HEADLINE: E.P.A. May Expand Plan To Clean Apartments 

BYLINE:  By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
Federal officials said yesterday that the government's new commitment to clean any apartment south of Canal Street in Manhattan, to remove dust and debris from the World Trade Center disaster, might be expanded to include reimbursement for residents who have already had their homes professionally cleaned. 
 They also said the cleanup program, which was officially announced yesterday at a news conference at the Manhattan regional headquarters of the Environmental Protection Agency, could be extended to include apartments outside the boundaries if testing suggests the need for it. Depending on what is found in the residential work, the interiors of businesses may eventually be included as well, they said. 
 "No one should have to live with anxiety about the safety of the air in their own homes," said Jane Kenny, the E.P.A.'s regional administrator.
The cleanup program, which is expected to begin next month, reverses the position that was taken after Sept. 11 by federal, local and state government officials, who insisted that Lower Manhattan residents and business owners were responsible for cleaning their own spaces. 
Under the new policy, the federal government has committed money to the cleanup, apparently without limit. "The most important message is that FEMA, our federal partner, has not said this is all there is," said Christopher O. Ward, the city's commissioner of environmental protection, referring to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which will pay for the work. 
E.P.A. officials said that according to their initial estimates, 15,000 apartments will be covered by the plan, and that cleanup by a contractor for a typical two-bedroom apartment might cost $3,000 to $5,000. If every resident participates and each apartment is within that range, that would bring the cost to $45 million to $75 million, not including the possible expansion and reimbursement plans mentioned yesterday. 
At the news conference, Ms. Kenny and other city and federal officials strongly rejected any suggestion that waiting eight months after the disaster to begin a cleaning program for New York's interior spaces has put residents at risk. The collapse of the trade center towers blasted dust and ash, some of which contained asbestos or other potentially harmful materials, across a wide area of the city, including parts of Brooklyn. 
In fact, Mr. Ward said, the new cleanup program could validate what health and environmental officials have said all along: that most apartment interiors were not contaminated. 
The degree of participation will probably depend on whether inviting government apartment cleaners into one's home sounds reassuring or intrusive. The cleanups could take two to three days, officials said. The E.P.A. will set up a telephone number for the program by the end of the month, officials said.
Representative Jerrold Nadler, a Manhattan Democrat who also spoke at the news conference, said he would work to see that apartments were cleaned en masse, with every resident participating so that no dust or debris is left over to be tracked back into cleaned spaces.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
A Little Good News Goes a Long Way on Wall St.

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The stock market, encouraged by some good news on earnings, delivered its biggest one-day gain since September yesterday.
 Having shrugged off signs of an economic rebound for weeks, investors finally found succor in a profit report from a leading technology company, Cisco Systems, the report came out after the market closed on Tuesday. 
 Cisco and other technology stocks, which have slumped the last two months, led all the indexes in yesterday's rally, with the Nasdaq composite index jumping 7.8 percent, its biggest gain in more than a year and its eighth biggest ever. The Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks had their best days since September, rising 3.1 percent and 3.8 percent, respectively. 
Shares of Cisco, which is the leading maker of networking equipment, surged more than 24 percent after the company said it saw some encouraging signs of recovery in its business and its quarterly profits were higher than expected. Microsoft, Intel, I.B.M. and Dell Computer also rose sharply.
Though technology stocks were the favorites, General Electric contributed to the market rally by announcing that it would probably meet profit forecasts for this year. Its stock jumped 7.2 percent.
"Investors have sniffed a little bullishness here," said William E. Rhodes, chief investment strategist at Rhodes Analytics in Boston. "It is not prudent to look at today's rally and say it is a flash in the pan. But it is not prudent, either, to say the market is ready to take off."
Outside the technology group, Citigroup, Caterpillar, J. P. Morgan Chase and Merrill Lynch were among the big gainers. Stocks of brokerage firms, Merrill in particular, rose on reports that the firm might be close to reaching a deal with the New York attorney general, who has said there are conflicts of interest and deceptive practices among the firm's stock analysts.
Mr. Rhodes said that the rally might have been fueled in part by short sellers, who had been betting that the market, and especially technology stocks, would continue to decline. Short sellers borrow stocks and sell them, hoping their prices will fall so they can buy them back for less and pocket the difference as profit. Many short sellers bought stocks yesterday, he said, to lock in their recent gains.
While institutional investors were the heaviest buyers yesterday, individuals were also snapping up stocks at a lively pace, according to Birinyi Associates of Greenwich, Conn., which tracks market movements.
Good news on earnings is precisely what investors have been waiting to see, and their exuberant response to Cisco showed just how important earnings reports would continue to be to stock market performance.
Stock prices have sagged since March, despite data indicating that the recession ended much earlier than expected. The economy grew at a 5.8 percent annual rate in the first quarter, and worker productivity rose 8.6 percent, the biggest gain since 1983. The surge in productivity should lead to higher profits, economists say. Meanwhile, inflation, outside of gas and other energy prices, remains in check.
"The sharp market response to the earnings release clearly illustrates the extent to which investors are focusing on the economy from the bottom up rather than from the top down," said Tony Crescenzi, chief bond market strategist at Miller Tabak & Company.
Profits at companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 have declined the last five quarters. Their earnings are expected to grow 1 percent in the second quarter, compared with a year ago, followed by sharp gains of 21 percent in the third quarter and 34 percent in the fourth, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.
A modest rebound in earnings would lead to big percentage gains because earnings plunged the last six months of 2001, in the fallout from the terrorist attacks and the recession, making the comparisons easier.
But there has been precious little information to make investors believe that the second half will be as strong as projected. Until Cisco on Tuesday, few companies had said anything reassuring about a rebound in earnings.
"After so much bad news on earnings, a piece of apparent good news was enough to spark a rebound," said Chuck Hill, director of research at Thomson Financial. 
Still, he said the Cisco report may not have been as strong as it appeared at first blush, a warning echoed by Mr. Rhodes. "It was not an indication of robust growth," Mr. Rhodes said. "It was an indication of the end of decay."
The Dow rose 305.28 points, to 10,141.83, while the S.& P. 500 climbed 39.36 points, to 1,088.85. The Dow is now up 1.2 percent for the year but almost 500 points below its 2002 high. The S.& P. 500 is still down 5.2 percent for the year and is almost 85 points below its 2002 high.
The Nasdaq jumped 122.47 points, to 1,696.29. It is still down 13 percent for the year and more than 3,300 points from its high. While the percentage gain in the Nasdaq was reassuring, 14 of its top 15 days have come since March 2000, when the Nasdaq peaked. Since then, the index has fallen 66.4 percent in spite of those 14 record days.
As investors jumped back into stocks yesterday, the bond market slumped. The price of the reopened 10-year note auctioned by the Treasury yesterday fell 16/32, to 97 13/32, while the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, climbed to 5.22 percent, from 5.06 percent on Tuesday. The yield at the auction was 5.17 percent but rose as the new note was sold during the afternoon.
Here are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of 10-year notes:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)

Price: 97.746
High Yield: 5.170%
Low Yield: 5.100%

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
TeaLeaves Set As Networks Haggle With Madison Ave.

BYLINE:  By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
The most telling evidence as to whether a recovery in advertising spending is in sight will come in the next few weeks, as the broadcast television networks and Madison Avenue begin their haggling over the purchase of commercial time worth $7 billion or more to be sold ahead of the 2002-2003 season.
 The annual mix of gamesmanship, posturing and spinning that surrounds the talks -- known as the upfront market -- could be more frenetic and fascinating than ever because of the recent roller coaster ride on ad rates. 
 The best guesses so far from analysts and executives on both sides of the upfront bargaining are that agencies will agree to spend on behalf of their advertiser clients about 3 percent to 6 percent more in the coming prime-time TV season than was sold ahead of time for the 2001-2002 season. 
The expected increase would represent a modest piece of good news for the networks. Last spring, the ad buyers found themselves in the driver's seat because of the sluggish economy and were able to bring down prices from the record they had reached for the 2000-2001 season, when an estimated $8 billion in ads were sold. As a result, the upfront ad revenue brought in by the six networks during last year's market declined by an estimated 15 percent, or $1 billion, to about $7 billion. 
Now the networks are hoping to make up lost ground after the introduction next week of their fall schedules at lavish presentations around Manhattan. History offers some guidance. "We've never had two back-to-back down upfronts, so you would expect some growth," said Joe Mandese, the editor of Media Buyer's Daily, a newsletter published by Primedia. Mr. Mandese predicts a rebound in the modest single digits, as advertising in categories like movies, automobiles and drugs should offset continued weakness in areas like financial services, travel and telecommunications.
There are, of course, no guarantees that the estimated increase of 3 percent to 6 percent, to $7.2 billion to $7.4 billion, will occur. Continuing uncertainties over the strength of consumer demand, centered on the pace of economic recovery and the potential for further threats to national security, cloud the outlook. And the caliber of the new programs and schedules the networks present beginning on Monday will help determine the upfront's outcome.
"To say the market's up, the market's down, is missing the bigger issue in the marketplace: Can we bring Americans back to the TV screen?" said Jon Mandel, co-chief executive for United States operations at MediaCom in New York, the giant media buying agency owned by the Grey Global Group.
"During the upfront presentations, I just want to see one series from each network that shows someone is trying to put on something different," he added.
The upfront always begins with the sellers predicting that robust demand will enable them to raise prices and with the buyers playing down their ardor for the merchandise, which in this instance are 30-second commercials on the prime-time series to be broadcast by ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, UPN and WB from September through next May.
Each network usually sells about 75 percent of the spots it plans to run, holding back the rest to peddle during the season in what is known as the scatter market. If prices are higher in the scatter market, the networks get more revenue than if the spots were sold in the upfront. If prices are lower, they at least hedged their bets by selling most of the commercial time at higher rates.
The apportioning of sales between the upfront and the scatter markets is part of the strategy-setting that network executives are now pondering, just as their counterparts across the table are determining whether to buy sooner rather than later.
"The economy is still wobbly enough that the networks might want to sell more now," said Gordon Hodge, an analyst who follows media companies for Thomas Weisel Partners in San Francisco. "Last year, they played the game of chicken a little too hard" and were forced to cut prices when agencies balked at paying the higher rates the networks initially sought.
"Taking the money and running would not be a bad idea if the networks can get the pricing they want in this environment," he added. "Asking double-digit increases doesn't make a lot of sense, but it seems to us now that dollar volume could go up 6 to 8 percent."
One issue looming large for this upfront market is that many media conglomerates that own broadcast networks, including AOL Time Warner, the parent of WB, and the Walt Disney Company, the parent of ABC, are under increasing pressure from Wall Street to demonstrate quickly that business is improving.
"That influence on the sellers is making the upfront more complicated than ever before," said Jack Myers, chief economist at Jack Myers L.L.C. in New York, which publishes media and research newsletters.
"Investors are looking to the upfront as a sign of market strength," he added. That means, he said, that "sales executives are under pressure to deliver positive news," like selling more commercial time in this upfront market than last year's even if they might be able to charge higher prices later in the scatter market.
As the early assessments of the upfront market are being made, a consensus is emerging that among the network players, the weaker hands are held by ABC and Fox, which is part of the News Corporation. Both networks suffered steep ratings declines in the 2001-2002 season that forced them to offer compensatory spots to advertisers known as make-goods.
Conversely, the stronger hands are held by CBS, which gained viewers for series like "C.S.I." and will finish the season in second place in the ratings; NBC, which will finish first; and WB, which continues to attract the coveted younger viewers who are typically harder to reach. How NBC sales executives play their cards may provide the key to the market. Last May, when NBC, which is owned by General Electric, reversed course and cut prices after refusing for a month to do so, advertisers suddenly raced to buy commercial time, forcing most other networks to reduce their rates, too.
This time around, "there are factors that could lead to a strong upfront," said Joseph Abruzzese, president for network sales at CBS, which is part of Viacom. Among them he listed the recent "fairly strong scatter market," with some prices 15 percent to 20 percent higher than was obtained in the upfront market, and signs of demand from advertisers like auto and drug makers as well as entertainment and telecommunications companies.
Mr. Abruzzese will be wearing two hats during the upfront negotiations, also selling spots for UPN, a CBS sibling in the Viacom empire. 
The upfront chess match may be somewhat less crucial than in previous years, said Jed Petrick, the president and chief operating officer at WB in Burbank, Calif., because "buying and selling is now a 52-week game." Mr. Petrick added that "more and more advertisers are holding on to their money till the 11th hour and placing buys closer to the air date."
The upfront market usually begins one to four weeks after the fall-season presentations and can last one to three months. Last year, the talks began in early June and ended by the July Fourth weekend; in 2000, they began right after the presentations and concluded by Memorial Day.
After the broadcast networks finish their upfront market, similar negotiations start for cable TV networks and syndicated shows.

GRAPHIC: Photos: A big question in selling TV commercial time for next season will be whether new series are as popular with viewers and critics as some of the shows from the 2001-02 season that the networks plan to bring back in the fall, like "C.S.I.," left, on CBS; "Friends," on NBC; and "Smallville" on WB.

HEADLINE: $200 Million May Be Needed For Budget Gap 

BYLINE:  By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI 

DATELINE: TRENTON, May 8 

 BODY:
With the end of New Jersey's fiscal year just eight weeks away, an unexpected drop in state tax revenues has forced the McGreevey administration to identify at least $200 million in additional revenues or spending cuts to balance the budget by July 1. 
 Although the treasurer's office would not release exact figures, state officials said that the April 15 tax receipts, which include quarterly payments from businesses, were more than a half-billion dollars less than expected. Since taking office in January, Gov. James E. McGreevey has sought to balance this year's budget by draining surpluses from several special funds, slashing spending and laying off hundreds of state workers. 
 But the shortfall in April tax receipts will eliminate the $500 million Mr. McGreevey had dedicated to the reserve fund, and prompted the governor to ask department heads to prepare for another round of budget cuts. Administration officials said the struggling economy was to blame for the drop in tax revenues. The state also expected to reap an additional $220 million by closing a corporate loophole, but that has brought in only $52 million. 
State Treasurer John E. McCormac said the numbers were still being tallied, and he declined to comment on the matter until the accounting has been completed.
But Assemblyman Louis D. Greenwald, chairman of the Appropriations Committee, said overall tax collections were likely to be $700 million lower than the $20.9 billion the state had been anticipating. The State Constitution requires that New Jersey end the fiscal year with a balanced budget, and Mr. Greenwald said the McGreevey administration apparently intended to find $200 million in new savings or revenues and deplete the $500 million surplus.
"Our requirement is to finish the year with a balanced budget; we need one penny in the bank," Mr. Greenwald said. "The reality is, that is where we are today."

HEADLINE: Impasse on Budget Extends Legislature in Connecticut 

BYLINE:  By PAUL ZIELBAUER 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, May 8 

 BODY:
For the second consecutive year, Connecticut lawmakers have been forced to extend their annual legislative session, because of an impasse between Democrats, who control the Legislature, and John G. Rowland, the Republican governor, over how to spend a $500 million increase in the state budget. 
 The Legislature ended its regular session at midnight tonight, having passed several significant bills on the environment and greater oversight of the state trash authority after its record loss of public money in a failed deal with the Enron Corporation, and stricter prohibitions on coaches and teachers who have sex with school-age minors under their supervision. 
 This evening, the House of Representatives also approved a bill creating tougher punishments for pedophiles, which the Senate amended and passed after a contentious predawn debate. The amended bill would greatly lengthen the statute of limitations on sex crimes against children and forbid out-of-court settlements that prevent defendants from speaking to the police. It would also expand the list of occupations required by state law to report information on sex crimes against minors to the police, adding parole and probation officers and coaches. 
The most contentious portion of the original bill, stricken by the Senate, included a provision that some Catholic lawmakers opposed because they said they believed it would require clergy members to report sexual abuse allegations made to them during confession. Their concern was that the provision would force priests to choose between obeying state law and the Catholic prohibition against disclosure of statements made during confession. 
Mr. Rowland said he would sign the amended bill into law. 
As both legislative chambers plowed through rafts of last-minute bills today, what remained unresolved -- dead in the water, actually -- was a problem that many other state legislators only wish they had: How to spend a roughly $500 million, or 4 percent, increase in Connecticut's budget for the 2003 fiscal year and close a $350 million deficit, which pales in comparison to other states' budget shortfalls. 
Despite indications of a compromise budget last week, Mr. Rowland and Democrats who lead the House and Senate each expressed exasperation with the other over how to bridge next year's budget gap. Democrats favored increasing some taxes and creating a tax on millionaires. Mr. Rowland and Republicans in the legislative minority want to close the gap by reducing spending on key programs, including education aid to cities and towns. 
Kevin B. Sullivan, the Senate president pro-tem, said today that his party tried to meet Mr. Rowland halfway last week, offering $175 million in spending cuts, only to have the governor come back this week and reject the offer.
Mr. Rowland, for his part, criticized legislative Democrats as old-time tax-and-spenders who understood neither what was good for the state's economy nor his unwillingness to begin to negotiate a nominal tax increase. He said he would probably be open to a small tax increase, but not until they offered a more viable package of spending cuts. 
Because Connecticut passes two-year budgets at a time and this is a mid-budget year, lawmakers are not under any constitutional pressure to pass a revised budget. But Democrats acknowledged that another late budget made them look inefficient, and Mr. Rowland warned that "there could be layoffs" of state workers if negotiations dragged on for months, as he said he thought they might. 
Aside from the budget, the Legislature and Mr. Rowland succeeded in creating laws to help protect the environment. The biggest accomplishment, both sides agreed, is a law, similar to a bill Mr. Rowland vetoed last year, that forces Connecticut's six remaining coal- and oil-fired power plants to reduce sulphur-dioxide emissions and phase out the practice of buying emission-reduction credits from other power plants to meet federal clean-air standards. 
Lawmakers also passed new protections for shellfish in Long Island Sound after Democrats failed to temporarily halt the construction of a cross-sound electric cable from New Haven to Brookhaven, N.Y.

Adelphia Communications said yesterday that it was putting several of its cable systems on the market in an effort to raise cash.
 The company is offering its Southern California system, with more than 1.2 million subscribers, as well as systems in Florida (750,000 subscribers), Virginia (575,000) and the Carolinas and Georgia (a total of 225,000 subscribers). 
 According to a person close to the company, Adelphia is putting up for sale systems with more than 2.7 million subscribers out of its total base of 6 million, but wants to sell only about 2 million worth.
Adelphia, the nation's sixth-largest cable television company, has been struggling since it acknowledged late in March that it had guaranteed more than $2.3 billion in loans to entities controlled by the family of its chairman, John J. Rigas. The family used some of the proceeds to buy Adelphia stock and bonds. 
Adelphia stock has taken a beating. Last week, the company said it would restate its financial results for the last three years to include on its books more than $1 billion of the loans -- a figure that puzzled some investors. Shareholder suits are pending. A federal inquiry into the loans is under way.
The news that Adelphia was preparing to raise cash, announced after the market closed yesterday, did little to change the view of one institutional investor, who said that the company was not likely to find eager buyers in the current marketplace, where the stocks of many media companies are severely depressed. 
He said that the Los Angeles cable system was the most likely sale, but added that since some 780,000 subscribers in that market were part of a joint venture with AT&T, Adelphia would not keep all the proceeds from a deal.
Besides, he said, the likely buyers there were Charter Communications and AT&T, but AT&T is in the midst of a merger with Comcast and Charter might not have adequate resources. That meant the entrepreneur Paul G. Allen, who is chairman of Charter and who has been building a war chest to expand in cable, might buy the systems directly. There was not likely to be a lively bidding war.
Matthew Harrigan, an analyst at Janco Partners in Denver, said the proposed sale would not really solve Adelphia's problems. He said that by selling, Adelphia was losing value because cable operators are more efficient as they gain economies of scale. In addition, he said, Adelphia is offering its more attractive systems, which generate higher revenue.
Mr. Harrigan said that the family had been "quite recalcitrant" about acknowledging Adelphia's problems, and that "the stock price will always be in the penalty box as long as the Rigases are there."
The Rigas family declined to comment.
In a press release yesterday, Mr. Rigas said, "I am confident that the steps we are taking will enable us to achieve our objectives of reducing debt, deleveraging our balance sheet, and creating a stronger Adelphia."
But both the institutional shareholder and Mr. Harrigan said that any asset sales would not immediately solve Adelphia's problems because it would take at least a year for the sales to close.
The company has yet to file its financial data for 2001. Because it has been both slow to acknowledge the loans and is unclear about the amounts, investors are skeptical about what the financial filings might disclose.
Adelphia has not yet given a specific date for publishing the overdue reports. "They want to hang on by buying time by selling systems at high prices," the institutional investor said.
An analyst who insisted on anonymity said Adelphia had little choice but to sell assets because it could not borrow in the public market, having lost credibility. "They can borrow from the banks, but they first have to pay down existing loans," the analyst said. "And currently, they are coming very close to the limit of their bank borrowing."

HEADLINE: As McGreevey Unveils a Plan For New Arena, Critics Scoff 

BYLINE:  By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: NEWARK, May 8 

 BODY:
Taking on a project that eluded two of his predecessors building an arena for the New Jersey Nets and Devils in Newark -- Gov. James E. McGreevey announced the outlines of a new financing plan today that he said would not put taxpayers at risk if revenue from the project slowed or dried up.
 But the governor acknowledged that the plan still hinged on several uncertainties: working out a number of details with the YankeeNets, which owns the teams; drafting a redevelopment plan for the state-owned Meadowlands site; and selling it all to a legislature that has seemed cool to any state involvement in building a new arena. 
 And the timing of Mr. McGreevey's announcement, just a week before Mayor Sharpe James faces Councilman Cory Booker in the most hotly contested race in Mr. James's 32-year political career, gave opponents of the plan fresh ammunition. 
Aides to the governor weakly fended off suggestions that the news was timed to help Mr. James, a staunch ally of the governor. But a group of Bergen County officials gathered later in the day to call the project a "pawn in a local political campaign."
The proposed $355 million, 18,500-seat arena, which would replace the teams' current home, the Continental Airlines Arena in the Meadowlands, could open as soon as the 2005 season. 
Mr. McGreevey announced the preliminary agreement with the YankeeNets to much applause from an audience at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center here. He was joined by Mayor James, half a dozen members of the Newark City Council, two former governors and a number of state legislators in trumpeting the proposal, which aides said would result in more than $1 billion in economic activity and thousands of construction and permanent jobs. A beaming Mr. James said the project would make Newark "the comeback city of America."
But Mr. Booker later dismissed the plan as "a performance designed to trick Newark citizens into voting for Sharpe James by promising them the same arena that he's been promising them for years."
Under the plan, the state's Sports and Exposition Authority would issue $165 million in construction bonds, to be repaid from tax revenue generated at the arena, an adjacent hotel and a parking complex. To protect the state if the revenue fails to cover the estimated $12 million in annual debt, the YankeeNets would have to buy insurance to make up for any shortfall. In addition, the governor said, the team owners would be responsible for any cost overruns.
The preliminary agreement calls for the YankeeNets to make an initial investment of $120 million in the arena, which the organization would operate and manage for two decades. All along it has been projected that Essex County would contribute $15 million to the proposed arena and Newark would contribute $35 million.
New provisions revealed today allow for about $20 million in loans to make up the difference. George Zoffinger, executive director of the Sports and Exposition Authority, said the money was for planning, design and preconstruction costs.
About $10 million of that amount would come from a loan that the YankeeNets would make to the project; that loan could be repaid only with tax revenue left over after the debt on the bonds was paid. The remaining $10 million, Mr. Zoffinger said, would be made available as a loan from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. That money would be repaid to the state before the YankeeNets repaid itself for its own loan, and the state would in turn repay the Port Authority.
Len Coleman, the chief negotiator for the YankeeNets, called the financing plan "a tough prenuptial agreement." But it is worth it, he said, because the teams want to be in Newark. 
For the last three years, three governors have labored to get a Newark arena started, parsing the economics in a hundred ways and confronting legislators who were wary of any tax-supported sports project or demanded costly projects for their areas in exchange for their support.
These issues bedeviled Gov. Christie Whitman even as she was leaving for a post in the Bush administration in 2000. And efforts by her successor, Acting Gov. Donald T. DiFrancesco, to satisfy legislative demands ended up sinking a similar arena financing plan that was paired with an ambitious redevelopment proposal for the Meadowlands.
After three months of negotiations with the YankeeNets, Mr. McGreevey is now seeking to decouple the construction of the arena and the redevelopment of the Meadowlands. But most lawmakers said no legislation to authorize an arena plan was likely to pass unless planning for the Meadowlands was well advanced and credible to officials of Bergen County, where the Meadowlands is located. In their news conference today, Bergen officials seemed unimpressed, as County Executive William P. Schuber chided the governor for informing them of the arena plan at the last moment.

HEADLINE: U.N. Session Begins to Tally The Perils of Being Young 

BYLINE:  By SOMINI SENGUPTA

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 8 

 BODY:
"We are street children. We are the children of war. We are the victims and orphans of H.I.V./AIDS."
 So declared the small but unshakeable voice of Gabriela Azurdy Arrieta, a 13-year-old from Bolivia this morning at the opening session of the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on Children. 
 It was the first time children were allowed to speak in such august chambers. So Gabriela, along with Audrey Cheynut, 17, from Monaco, both reciting a message drafted by a 300-member children's delegation to the meeting, did not squander the opportunity.
"We want a world fit for children," Gabriela said, her head barely peeking up from behind the lectern, "because a world fit for us is a world fit for everyone."
The three-day meeting, the first General Assembly session to be devoted to the world's youngest citizens, is intended to assess the plight of the world's children over the last 12 years, when the United Nations first set concrete goals to improve children's lives. 
The record spoke for itself: Some gains had been made in health and education, but 10 million children still die every year from preventable diseases and 120 million are not in school. Such a record prompted the secretary general, Kofi Annan, to reproach his peers.
"To the adults in this room, I would say: Let us not make children pay for our failures any more," he said in the opening remarks this morning to heads of state and children from more than 180 countries. "We the grown-ups must reverse this list of failures."
The conference is to produce a new list of goals for 2015 on everything from protecting children from war to caring for those orphaned by AIDS to offering children simple life-saving tools like measles shots. It drew 60 heads of state, 3,000 members of non-governmental organizations and hundreds of children.
But if the halls of the United Nations were awash with pledges about uplifting children, they were also riven with significant debates over their rights and desires.
Members of the United States delegation, noting their disappointment with the draft conference document, said today they would ask for abstinence to be included as part of the sexual education portion of the document.
"As President Bush has said, abstinence is the only sure way of avoiding sexually transmitted disease, premature pregnancy and the social and personal difficulties attendant to nonmarital sexual activity," Tommy G. Thompson, the Bush Administration's Secretary of Health and Human Services and the head of the United States delegation, told the General Assembly. 
"Our efforts include strengthening close parent-child relationships, encouraging the delay of sexual activity, and supporting abstinence education programs."
At a briefing with reporters later in the day, members of the United States delegation said they were also concerned that, among other things, the conference document did not include sufficiently strong language on protecting children under 18 from prostitution and pornography. 
Disappointment aside, members of the American delegation said, this conference is nothing like the Conference on Racism in Durban, where the United States walked out. They said they were optimistic about reaching a consensus. 
Conference documents, particularly on children's issues, are usually reached by consensus, rather than by a vote. The United States, like any other member nation, has the option of spelling out its reservations on specific provisions but accepting the conference document as a whole.
The American delegation has also urged that references to the phrase "reproductive health services" clearly exclude abortion. An American official contended that delegates from other countries had agreed privately that the phrase did not refer to abortion, but that they had not yet agreed to spell it out.
The question of how to handle abortion is a constant thorn on the side of United Nations conferences. Because "reproductive health services" can mean different things in different countries -- in some countries, abortion is part of the menu of options; in other countries it is illegal -- previous United Nations conferences sidestepped the dispute by leaving it to individual nations. 
Many other countries, including most of Europe, want to leave it that way. "It should be up to countries if and to what extent abortion should feature as an element within the constellation of reproductive health services," said a member of a delegation from a European country; he did not want to be named for fear of jeopardizing the negotiations.
The other sticking point for the American delegation is the degree to which the conference document can refer to a landmark 1989 treaty on children's rights. Along with Somalia, the United States is the only country that has not ratified the so-called Convention on the Rights of the Child. The treaty prohibits countries from using the death penalty against criminals under age 18, a practice permitted in many American states.
The treaty spells out a host of political, economic and cultural rights of children, and many children's advocates here said they hoped it would be the standard on which this conference document would be based.

HEADLINE: North Koreans Seek Asylum At Consulates In China 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

DATELINE: BEIJING, May 8 

 BODY:
Seven people tried to barge into consulates in the northeastern Chinese city of Shenyang today, the latest in a string of attempts by desperate North Koreans to gain political asylum by taking refuge in Western diplomatic compounds in China.
 Two people successfully scaled the wall of the American Consulate in Shenyang and were still inside as of nightfall. Another five, including a family with a 2-year-old, were caught by the Chinese guards as they rushed the open gate at the Japanese Consulate, according to South Korean aid groups concerned with the plight of North Korean refugees. 
 Japanese diplomats in Beijing lodged a protest with the Chinese Foreign Ministry this afternoon, asserting that the Chinese police had actually entered the Japanese compound to arrest two of the people, in violation of consular agreements. 
In a trend that has both angered and frustrated Beijing, 28 North Koreans have gained safe passage to South Korea by forcing their way into foreign diplomatic compounds in Beijing in the last two months. 
Human rights activists in the network that has assisted the North Koreans in these escapes say that such actions will continue, although they acknowledge that they have had to become more creative as the Chinese have tightened security around the diplomatic compounds.
"Others will follow," promised an e-mail message tonight from Norbert Vollertsen, a German doctor who used to work in North Korea and who has championed the asylum seekers. "Think about a flood of North Korean 'boat people' on ships from China to South Korea." 
In all cases so far, foreign diplomats have granted the refugees protection and refused to allow China to repatriate them. The Chinese authorities have reluctantly permitted them to leave China -- ultimately bound for Seoul.
China's official policy is that the North Koreans are economic migrants who come to China in search of food and should be repatriated if they are caught, in accordance with diplomatic agreements with North Korea. In practice, the Chinese police have been unenthusiastic about tracking them down, allowing an estimated 300,000 North Koreans to live illegally in China. 
But that tolerance has dissipated recently as China has struggled to deal with the spate of embassy invasions, which force it to confront a difficult problem.
Ever since North Koreans successfully entered both the German Embassy and American Embassy compounds 10 days ago, the Chinese have been busily stringing barbed wire and police tape around all embassy compounds here. 
Patrols have increased markedly in Beijing, but they had not changed in Shenyang, an industrial city where many countries maintain consulates. Shenyang sits just over 100 miles from the North Korean border. 
In the border region, aid workers say that the Chinese police have been much more aggressive in ferreting out illegal North Koreans. 
Most of the North Koreans first enter China in search of food or other basic goods. But the North Korean police tend to regard them as political criminals if they are arrested and returned. Those who have made repeated trips, or have had contact with South Korean groups, receive the severest punishment. 
The five people who were detained by the Chinese police while trying to enter the Japanese Consulate are all members of a family that has angered North Korean authorities with previous efforts to escape to Seoul, a human rights group said. Last June, other family members walked into the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Beijing demanding asylum and were subsequently resettled in Seoul. 
It is not clear how China will deal with North Koreans arrested while trying to enter foreign compounds. Last month, three North Koreans were detained by the Chinese police while trying to enter the compound of the South Korean Embassy in Beijing. The South Korean Embassy has requested that they not be sent back to North Korea, and they remain in Chinese custody.

HEADLINE: Vitriol of Newark Campaign Seeps Into Debate 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW JACOBS 

DATELINE: NEWARK, May 8 

 BODY:
In their first and only joint appearance before next Tuesday's election, Mayor Sharpe James and his opponent, Councilman Cory Booker, engaged in a spirited -- and at times mean-spirited -- debate this evening, questioning each other's honesty, integrity and ability to govern while painting starkly different portraits of New Jersey's largest city.
 Mr. James, a 16-year-incumbent who is seeking a historic fifth term, attempted to belittle his opponent as inexperienced, naive and dishonest. Mr. Booker, a single-term councilman who was born the year Mr. James first entered City Hall as a councilman, blamed many of the city's woes, including rampant street crime, enduring poverty and failing schools, on Mr. James. He also used the debate to hammer away at one of his campaign's central themes: that the mayor's single-minded focus on reviving downtown has deprived most Newark residents of a better life. 
 "We do not need a mayor that brags about symbols or a renaissance but one that rolls up his sleeves and takes responsibility to make sure there's a substance of a renaissance," Mr. Booker said.
Mr. James returned fire by calling his rival a liar and a stealth Republican, a man who courts conservative dollars and would try to use vouchers to dismantle the city's public schools -- an accusation Mr. Booker denied. "Mr. Booker sounds good, looks good, but does not tell the truth," Mr. James said. "Mr. Booker believes we're the worst city and we're the worst people, and he's the only sane person in the city of Newark. I disagree. Newark's a good place to live, a good place to raise a family."
A third candidate in the nonpartisan election, Dwayne Smith, was also part of the debate, but he has failed to generate much excitement here, and both men largely ignored him. Mr. Smith, a former police officer who campaigns across the city carrying a plastic orange bat, said he would offer tax-paying residents free landscaping services, increase the number of traveling health vans and require young children to wear uniforms in school.
The hourlong confrontation, which was broadcast on Cablevision in New Jersey, was the first time voters here have seen the two main contenders confront one another in a public forum. Both men started out seemingly calm, but as the vitriol increased, Mr. James became flustered and agitated. At one point, he seemed to misunderstand a question, and his answer was unrelated.
Mr. Booker, appearing poised and confident, again and again returned to the same theme, that in four terms Mr. James had failed to bring widespread progress to one of the nation's most troubled cities. "Sixteen years is long enough," he said. "It's time for a change."
The mayor began the debate by extolling the day's announcement by Gov. James E. McGreevey that an arena deal for Newark had been reached. Calling it "a great day for the city," he went on to list the economic benefits of the arena and potential events that might take place there. "Just think about it," he said proudly. "Family entertainment. The Nets, the Devils, Ice Capades, Disney World on Ice. I'll even try to get Tina Turner."
But in his rebuttal, Mr. Booker tried to play down the announcement, saying it was simply a well-timed ploy to win support for the mayor, and he offered his own list: of proposed projects that never materialized.
"We can no longer have election-time performances," he said. "What we need is a mayor that all the time can be focused on improving our neighborhoods."
Until this evening, Mr. James had skipped or canceled a dozen candidate forums and debates, saying he was too busy with the business of running the city to take part. Mr. Booker's supporters said the mayor was ducking his opponent.
A titan of Newark politics for the last three decades, Mr. James, 66, is a skilled fund-raiser and a confident campaigner who until recently was considered unbeatable. But Mr. Booker, 33, who entered the Newark political scene in 1998 by trouncing a Central Ward fixture, has been slowly chipping away at Mr. James's grip on power. Although the mayor enjoys the support of New Jersey's top Democrats and eight of Newark's nine City Council members (all but Mr. Booker), recent polls suggest a tight race. The results of a WABC-TV poll released last Friday showed the candidates in a statistical dead heat, and most political experts say that what once seemed a long-shot bid to unseat Mr. James has entered the realm of possibility.

HEADLINE: Lessons From the Mideast Agony 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Hijacking Mideast Peace" (editorial, May 8):
 Diplomacy leading to an equitable political settlement is the only way to achieve security for Israel's citizens, not the sale of more arms. 
 Israel received more than $18 billion in weapons and military equipment from the United States between 1991 and 2000. This quantity of arms has not brought greater security for Israeli citizens. Instead, Israeli use of American-supplied military equipment has increased the Palestinian desire for revenge and decreased Israel's own internal security by strengthening extremist groups.
The United States should impose an immediate embargo on all military aid to Israel. By doing so, the Bush administration would strengthen its leverage on Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.

HEADLINE: National Briefing Northwest: Washington: Widening Income Gap 

BYLINE:  By Timothy Egan (NYT)

 BODY:
 The income gap between the Seattle metropolitan area and rural Washington is the widest it has been in 30 years, new Census Bureau figures show. King County, which includes Seattle, accounted for 38 percent of the state's wealth. Officials say that while Seattle's technology and dot-com economy rose and then fell in the 1990's, the state's rural economy remained stagnant or declined.

Witness for Microsoft Sees Wide Harm From Penalties

BYLINE:  AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 8 

 BODY:
Tough antitrust penalties sought by nine states against the Microsoft Corporation would hurt consumers and encourage other companies to use federal antitrust law as a substitute for their own research and development, an economist said today.
 Testifying as an expert witness for Microsoft, Professor Kenneth G. Elzinga of the University of Virginia said the remedies proposed by the states would raise consumer prices and stifle innovation by Microsoft and other high-technology companies. 
 Professor Elzinga said that if Microsoft is required to disclose technical information about its Windows operating system, as the states propose, the result would be "a dampening of incentive" for companies to do their own research and development. 
"Forcing any firm to share its intellectual property with rivals reduces incentives to innovate in the future," he said. 
The nine states have refused to go along with a settlement the Justice Department reached with Microsoft last year. In addition to the disclosure of product technical information, the states want the company to release a modular version of its Windows operating system that will permit computer manufacturers to replace Microsoft features with competing products. 
Professor Elzinga has testified as an expert witness for Microsoft in two previous cases, and Steven Kuney, a lawyer for the states, questioned him extensively about his connection to Microsoft. 
Mr. Elzinga acknowledged that Microsoft had financed some of his early research into the software industry and that he has never concluded that the company "has monopoly power of antitrust concern." 
Asked by Mr. Kuney if he thought consumers were hurt by the anticompetitive behavior that an appeals court found Microsoft had engaged, Professor Elzinga said he was not asked to make such an assessment. Instead, he said, he was asked to compare the states' proposed remedy with the negotiated settlement "through the lens of consumer welfare." 
He said consumers might benefit if computer makers were allowed to remove Microsoft programs that come packaged with Windows and substitute the software of competitors, as the states have proposed. But the professor said such a practice might also curtail innovation by Microsoft. 
"It's like putting everything on a Christmas tree. Sometimes when you put everything on a Christmas tree it's not as attractive anymore," he said. "Sometimes you have to consider the costs." 
In his direct testimony, Professor Elzinga said he had evaluated claims that the negotiated settlement contained numerous loopholes that render it ineffective and found them "not to withstand scrutiny." But under questioning by Mr. Kuney, he said that in several instances he did not have the technical expertise to evaluate the supposed loopholes cited by the states.
Professor Elzinga, who is one of Microsoft's final witnesses, said many of the penalties proposed by the states are unrelated to the findings of antitrust violations and appear intended more to protect Microsoft's competitors than consumers.

HEADLINE: Vote on an Offshore Tax Plan Is Roilinga Company Town 

BYLINE:  By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

DATELINE: NEW BRITAIN, Conn., May 8 

 BODY:
Over the last 159 years Stanley Works has come to dominate this central Connecticut town, producing tools with the yellow logo that has made it a brand well known in every other American town. But if its shareholders approve a proposal in a vote on Thursday, Stanley will become a Bermuda company in address only, with its legal residence in Barbados.
 The company says its plan will slash its income tax bills by at least 28 percent -- $30 million a year -- and predicts that the resulting higher cash flow could by itself raise its stock price by 11.5 percent. Tax experts say the saving could be much higher. 
 That does not sit well with a lot of people here and elsewhere -- with workers, residents and even some large investment funds. Such critics hope to turn this vote into a referendum on whether the growing number of American companies with proposals similar to Stanley's should be allowed to promote the interests of shareholders without also considering the interests of the nation and the companies' home communities. 
"This is really about the future of the corporation in America," said Stephen Sleigh, director of strategic resources for the machinists' union. "Are companies going to stay loyal to our country and grow jobs here, where they made their money? The notion that stock price is the only measure of a company's value is shortsighted."
It is unclear whether Stanley will win this vote -- the proposal requires the approval of two-thirds of all shareholders to be passed. But Stanley's proposal has a lot of support. 
The company says it has no choice, and its situation says a lot about the struggle of American businesses to remain globally competitive and satisfy their shareholders. In the past, many chief executives said they had obligations to a number of constituencies -- not just to shareholders, but also to customers, employees and their communities. But Stanley's chief executive, John M. Trani, is one of a number of executives who, under pressure from Wall Street, have narrowed that definition.
Mr. Trani says his obligation is to his shareholders. "At the end of the day," he told The Hartford Courant in 1997, "it's the final score that counts. In this stuff, I'm paid to make money for the shareholders." (He declined to be interviewed for this article.) 
The 57-year-old son of a Brooklyn longshoreman who grew up in Italy, Mr. Trani played recreational tackle football without pads or a helmet when he was a student at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn in the 1960's. He worked briefly as an analyst on Wall Street and later joined General Electric, where he was among 10 or so rising stars thought to have a shot at the chief executive job, then held by John F. Welch Jr.
Mr. Trani has learned to talk tough and play tough. He says Stanley's plan is not just legal, but ethical. And he says it is necessary because his competitors -- from Taiwan metal-forging companies to Ingersoll-Rand, which itself became a Bermuda company last year -- benefit by paying lower taxes.
But even some big investors that own Stanley stock and would, in theory, benefit from the plan say they will vote against it. Among them are the state pension plan here in Stanley's home state as well as those in New York and California, and various union pension funds.
Sarah Teslik, executive director of the Council of Institutional Investors in Washington, which represents 110 pension funds and other institutional investors, said the group was studying how to advise members during an unexpected wave of such plans.
"We have a lot of members who are disturbed by these moves," Mrs. Teslik said, "because they do benefit shareholders through higher stock prices, but they also affect jobs and everyone's taxes."
Here in New Britain, a city of 71,000 where Stanley has its headquarters, it is hard to find anyone who favors the plan -- not the mayor nor the president of the Chamber of Commerce nor Stanley workers. While the company will still pay some property taxes here, some who understand the details of the Bermuda plan worry that it will lead the company to ship more jobs abroad.
Under Stanley's proposal, the company would not actually move its headquarters to Bermuda; it would merely incorporate there. That requires only a mailing address. Stanley would also register as a corporate resident of Barbados, where it would need to hold only one meeting a year to qualify as "centrally managed and controlled" from there. 
Under this plan, Stanley would no longer owe United States income taxes on profits earned abroad. (Bermuda has no income tax.) More significantly, profits earned in the United States could be shipped abroad and, under a treaty with Barbados, turned into tax deductions. All Stanley would owe on those profits would be a 1 percent tax in Barbados.
Five Houston companies, including Nabors Industries and Weatherford Industries, are asking their shareholders to approve the same move later this year.
Executives of companies that have gone to Bermuda or plan to go say that such proposals will become more common unless Congress fundamentally changes the way corporations are taxed because some profits may be double-taxed and rivals in tax havens pay little or no tax.
Mr. Trani has some important backers. Institutional Shareholder Services, which advises pension funds and other large investors, supports approval of Stanley's plan because lower taxes should mean a higher share price. The organization warned that "there is already fierce and credible opposition" in Congress, though it discounted the threat that Congress might undo the move.
Opponents of such plans make several points. Some say it is just not patriotic to stop paying income taxes and leave the burden to others. Mayor Lucian J. Pawlak of New Britain said, "We will be a much poorer city and America a much poorer country as companies move out jobs and machinery, pay less in taxes and take away the jobs that hard-working people without much education used to get their kids into college." 
Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, has said in Congressional hearings that Stanley "has its heart in Bermuda" and its behind in America. Together with Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, he has introduced legislation to remove the tax savings in such deals, calling them unpatriotic in a time of war.
Others, like Connecticut's treasurer, Denise L. Nappier, and New York's comptroller, H. Carl McCall, say the plan is unfair because it reduces shareholders' rights, like the ability to enforce American court orders. (They do not plan to sell their states' Stanley shares if they lose the vote, however.) The company says the changes are minor.
Still others say the plan will encourage Stanley and other such companies to ship more jobs and money abroad. Once profits are shipped to Barbados, they can be invested tax free in factories abroad, but if the money is returned to the United States, it becomes taxable again.
Many people in New Britain are worried because in the past decade Stanley has eliminated 90 percent of what had been 5,000 blue-collar jobs here, replacing union machinists with less expensive workers in China, Mexico and other countries.
Donald D'Amato, president of a machinists union local representing the last 500 production workers here, said: "Trani said he will always go to the lowest-cost producer, and that means he is out of the U.S. because we can't compete with China." Union wages in New Britain are $10 to $20 an hour, he said.
At a small grocery across from City Hall, the owner, Iftekhar Siddiqui, said his business had declined as Stanley eliminated jobs. 
Mr. Siddiqui, who has a master's in business administration, said people here were angry because they thought Stanley's manipulation of tax and labor laws could spell economic ruin for themselves but riches for the 10 percent of Americans who own 86 percent of all stocks.
"The C.E.O.'s job is not just profit," Mr. Siddiqui said. "He has to think about the welfare of society. You have to have a country that is healthy to have profits. If Stanley does this, a lot of other companies will follow, and they will invest the money they made here in China, and a lot of our labor force in this country will become unemployed. Fewer and fewer people will have disposable income. You have to have balance." 
Over on Broad Street, Gregory Adamski, who came from Poland 18 years ago and runs the Cracovia Restaurant, said, "When Stanley Works moves out, they ship the machinery to China, and that means our taxes will increase so they can pay less." 
Herb Holter, who owns a hair-cutting salon, said that when he arrived in 1957, at 16: "New Britain was a buzzing place, and everybody was working to get ahead. Now Stanley just wants to make a lot of money for shareholders and the C.E.O. Soon there'll be no jobs, and then who is going to buy Stanley tools?"
Mayor Pawlak said he would be surprised if anyone in New Britain spoke favorably about the company, which he said had seemed focused only on its stock price since Mr. Trani took charge five years ago.
"All those guys walking around with missing fingers and hunchbacks made Stanley," the mayor said, "but Trani doesn't want to hear that."

HEADLINE: Canaries' Signal On Environment 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 "Bush to Allow Mining Industry to Fill Streams" (news article, May 4) brought to mind the old tradition of using canaries to warn miners of toxic gas. We are witnessing the modern-day equivalent of those canaries, and it is time for President Bush to recognize the message our environment is sending. 
 A new Environmental Protection Agency report indicates that nearly half of America's coastal waters are polluted. The East Coast is facing a record-breaking drought. Virus and disease threaten oysters and rockfish in the Chesapeake Bay. 
The administration's response has been to push for oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and to roll back the Clean Water Act. President Bush is operating as if economic growth and the environment are competing interests. In fact, neither can survive without the other. 
Mr. President, the environment has sent a signal. It is time to pay attention to these 21st-century canaries.

HEADLINE: Bush Names 2 for Federal Reserve Posts 

BYLINE:  AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 8 

 BODY:
President Bush has selected a Princeton economist and an adviser to Alan Greenspan as his nominees for vacant positions on the Federal Reserve, the White House said today.
 Mr. 
Bush chose Ben S. Bernanke of Princeton and Donald L. Kohn, a longtime Fed staff member in Washington. 
 Mr. Bernanke, 48, was nominated for the nearly two years remaining on the term of Edward Kelley Jr., who resigned in December. The term will run until Jan. 31, 2004.
Mr. Kohn, 59, was nominated for a 14-year term through Jan. 21, 2016. His seat became available with the departure of Laurence H. Meyer, who left in January after deciding not to seek another term.
With the two nominations, Mr. Bush will have picked five of the seven Fed board members.
Both nominees require Senate confirmation.
Mr. Kohn has been Mr. Greenspan's closest adviser on interest rate policy, serving for 14 years as director of the Fed's division of monetary affairs, the group that prepares briefing books for interest-rate-setting meetings.
In addition to his teaching duties at Princeton, Mr. Bernanke serves on the National Bureau of Economic Research's business-cycle dating committee, the panel that determines the dates when recessions begin and end. He has focused much of his research on monetary policy.

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES; 
For City's Schoolchildren, the Healing Starts Here

BYLINE:  By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS 

 BODY:
THE reaction of Larry Aber's children to the 9/11 terrorist attacks sounds comic-book familiar. His 14-year-old son, Nick, took a page right out of the playbook of President George W. (Enemy of Evil) Bush. He was "determined to catch bin Laden and dip him in hot oil and crack the skin off him in a public square," Dr. Aber recalls.
 His 10-year-old daughter, Emma, focused on the victims, rather than the perpetrators. "Her empathy was so aroused she was not clear what to do with it," Dr. Aber says. "Baking cookies did not seem to her like a big positive thing." 
 With apologies to Nick and Emma, it can be hard to be the child of a psychologist. All too often, you are the convenient target of his well-honed scientific curiosity, an interesting diversion away from the office. But these days, J. Lawrence Aber has a bigger fishbowl to ponder than his own family. He is, in effect, the therapist for all 1.1 million New York City schoolchildren, and he has declared a large portion of them in need of healing.
Dr. Aber was the investigator, with his colleague, Dr. Christina Hoven, of a research project commissioned by the New York City Board of Education, to learn the impact of the attacks on the mental health of city schoolchildren. The study, released last week, found that as many as 200,000 children may suffer from mental health problems related to the attacks, exhibited in symptoms like depression, separation anxiety, agoraphobia, panic attacks, loss of interest in the future and bad dreams. He is an expert in what he calls "the epidemiology of development." Rather than studying mental illness in individuals, he studies it in entire populations.
Dr. Aber is the first to admit that there are built-in hazards to drawing sweeping conclusions about the data. To be accurate, he acknowledges, the results after Sept. 11 would have to be compared with results of a similar study conducted before Sept. 11, and there is no such baseline analysis for New York City schoolchildren.
"The things we found in this study about the level of children's mental health problems are not all caused by 9/11," Dr. Aber said the other day in his Columbia University office in Washington Heights. "I'm confident they have gone up, but we can't know for sure what level they were at before. It takes science a long time to learn how to reliably and sensibly measure things people want to know about in large populations."
This may come as some relief -- and perhaps little surprise -- to parents whose children suffered from nightmares before 9/11, and (like 17 percent of those in Dr. Aber's study) still wake up screaming now.
The point of comparison with New York was the so-called MECA study of 1996, which sampled children in metropolitan San Juan and Atlanta, inner-city New Haven and Westchester County.
Common sense, Dr. Aber says, suggests that New York City schoolchildren might be likely to suffer a higher than average rate of agoraphobia (15 percent in the Board of Education study, compared with 5 percent in the MECA study), because of preterrorist fears of stray gunfire and curb-jumping taxicabs. For New Yorkers, agoraphobia may not be an illness at all, but a perfectly rational defense strategy against the hazards of daily life.
"What's the old joke?" Dr. Aber says. "You're not paranoid if they really are after you."
The main lesson from the study, Dr. Aber says, is that there are a lot of festering psychological problems among city students, and it would be a good idea to deal with them every day, rather than reacting to an extraordinary situation.
Dr. Aber's main interest is not terrorism but how to mitigate the effects of poverty and violence on children's psychological development. His desk is stacked with books like, "Growing Up Fast," "Schools with Spirit" and "Understanding Poverty." He is director of the National Center for Children in Poverty and Professor of Public Health at the Joseph L. Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia.
Dr. Aber's own childhood was not without hardship. "My family's economic status changed frequently," he says. At various times, they were comfortable, lived on welfare, were working poor or lived on Social Security.
NOW 51, Dr. Aber was the eldest of six children. Born in Memphis, he went to eight grade schools in eight cities, moving to Pittsburgh when he was 12. He graduated from Harvard in 1973, and received his master's and Ph.D. in psychology at Yale.
When he was 19, his father died; when he was 24, his mother died. He had married Christine Pendry, a lawyer, six months earlier. The two of them raised the three youngest of Dr. Aber's five siblings, who were 16, 14 and 9. "They came to live with us," he says. "I was 24, my wife was 23." All six siblings are still close, Dr. Aber says. They have conference calls every Sunday.
It is a story that Dr. Aber, mild-mannered and somewhat timid, tells reluctantly. "I told you only because I wanted you to know," he says, "that I feel like I come by this interest honestly."

HEADLINE: At Least 14 Die in Attack on French Group in Pakistan 

BYLINE:  By RAYMOND BONNER

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, May 8 

 BODY:
At least 14 people, most of them French, were killed and more than 20 seriously wounded today when a suicide car-bomber pulled a red Toyota alongside a shuttle bus in front of the Sheraton Hotel in downtown Karachi and exploded it. 
 The bus, operated by the Pakistani Navy, had stopped at the hotel to pick up the French civilians working on a submarine project for the Pakistani government. 
 Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, called the bombing an "act of international terrorism," and President Jacques Chirac of France said it was a "murderous, cowardly, odious terrorist attack." 
There was no claim of responsibility, but Western and Pakistani officials said the bombing had all the markings of an operation of the sort carried out by Al Qaeda, and they warned of more attacks. 
The attack, coming two months after a suicide bomber killed five people, including two Americans, in an attack on a church here in the capital, represented an ominous shift in the method, magnitude and targets of terrorist attacks in this country. 
Sectarian violence has been nearly endemic here -- a lawyer, a high-school principal and a doctor have been killed in the latest wave of killing -- but suicide bombings have been extremely rare. 
Moreover, in the past, the targets have been Pakistanis, Iranians or Americans. Today's attack, along with the attack on the church, which is in the diplomatic compound, were aimed "at the Western community," said a Western diplomat.
"Any place where foreigners gather is now vulnerable," he added. 
The two attacks appear to be linked, Pakistani officials said. The Western diplomat referred to them as "a one-two" and called today's attack "very well planned." 
The American Embassy in Islamabad warned American citizens in the country "to maintain a low profile and avoid predictable patterns and behaviors." 
There was no apparent link between the bombing and the trial of four men who are accused of the kidnapping and murder of the Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, which resumed today in Hyderabad, about 100 miles northeast of Karachi. The trial had been moved from Karachi for security reasons. 
Once again, the trial, which prosecutors had originally said would be finished by mid-April, was put off, as defense lawyers sought to have the case moved back to Karachi.
There were fears that more attacks were likely here, aimed at foreigners and at the government of General Musharraf, who has sided with the United States in the war on terrorism.
"This may not be the end," Pakistan's minister of information, Nisar A. Memon, said at a news conference here this evening. "It appears their nefarious designs will continue."
He said he was not basing the warning on any specific intelligence but on the "historic facts in the last few months."
Today's attack raises fundamental questions about security here, and serious challenges for General Musharraf, diplomats and Pakistani political analysts said.
"If the government of Pakistan can't protect workers in the defense industry, what does it say for its security?" said one diplomat. 
The diplomat said General Musharraf must act decisively, within in the next two or three days. "If I were him, I would crack down with a vengeance," the diplomat said.
In an impoverished country already on the ropes economically, today's attack has caused "enormous damage," he said.
"Who is going to invest here now?" he said.
A senior Pakistani official agreed. "He has to act and act quickly," the official said, referring to General Musharraf. "We have to do more than issue a press release." 
But the measures announced by the government after General Musharraf met with his security advisers seemed modest and suggested how difficult it will be to prevent suicide attacks in this country, which has a long, porous border with Afghanistan and whose police officers are poorly trained and underpaid.
The government said that it was beefing up its intelligence gathering and security at places where foreigners gather, which is what the government said after the church attack two months ago. 
Today, the government also established a toll-free hot line for people to report suspicious terrorist activity, and a Web site: www.geocities.com/wantedforterrorism.
Today's attack would also seem to underscore questions that have been asked recently about just how effective General Musharraf has been in his declared war on violent Muslim groups here. 
The president has banned several groups, and authorities have rounded up about 2,000 men suspected of links to terrorist organizations.
But nearly three-quarters of those arrested have been released and not a single person has been charged. "This raises fundamental questions about his follow-up," one diplomat said.
After the church bombing, the government promised a swift investigation and a report that was to have been finished by early April. But the report has not been released, and the authorities appear no closer to solving the crime. The identity of the man who blew himself up remains a mystery. 
Parts of his body have been sent to the United States, and Pakistan has asked for help in recreating his face and body. 
"The investigation is resting there," the senior civil officer in the Ministry of Interior, Tasnim Noorani, said at today's news conference.

HEADLINE: 100-Year Flood, for the Second Straight Year 

BYLINE:  By FRANCIS X. CLINES

DATELINE: KIMBALL, W.Va., May 8 

 BODY:
The business of undertaking was never more vital along storm-racked Main Street in this old Appalachian mining town as Jim Widener mucked out the casket display room of his funeral home today.
 "We're managing to handle the wake of Shirley Faye Mitchem," Mr. Widener said as this remote coal hollow reeled under the devastation of its second deadly flood in 10 months. 
 "Mrs. Mitchem was killed when the storm took down a tree on Route 52 that smashed into her car," said Mr. Widener, who had just finished restoring his funeral home from the effects of the flash flood last July when the second one swept through Main Street last Thursday and deluged his business once more. 
"Her husband, Edgar, is still on the critical list," added the undertaker, doing his best to clean up the premises so victims could properly grieve over a storm that has swept lives and homes to oblivion in the funnel-like confines of the area's steep creek-side hollows.
Rainstorms continue to besiege mountainside dwellers left isolated by flood damage here in McDowell County, in the southernmost reaches of West Virginia. The storm of last week killed six people in the county while destroying close to 200 homes and flooding more than 2,000 others. Five other flood-related deaths have been reported in a multicounty swath of hamlets along the winding Virginia and Kentucky borderlands of Appalachia. 
"Last July's storm was called the 100-year flood," noted Kimball's mayor, Jack Premo. "I guess this is a 101-year flood. We lost everything last time, including City Hall, and we've lost it all again with this one."
The town shuddered anew as Elkhorn Creek once again thickened with a flash storm and roared above its banks down Main Street, bursting the doors of restored businesses.
Residents here and in a half-dozen other coal hollows complain that the 100-year flood timetable of folkloric tradition has been dangerously accelerated by modern timber cutters and strip miners on the surrounding steep mountainsides. Industry maintains that its work here is accompanied by restoration efforts ensuring that no environmental damage is permanent. But stunned residents say natural runoffs, and trees that would otherwise help absorb the downpours, have been obliterated, so that flash rains roar down on towns like unimpeded avalanches. 
"The logging has been going on indiscriminately, and no one will help us control it," said Jean Battlo, a writer whose Main Street home and elaborate flower garden were deluged once more by the latest torrent. 
"Even Senator Rockefeller was asking about the timbering," Ms. Battlo said of Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, who toured the damage on Monday and asked repeated questions about the effects of timber clear-cutting on the land's ability to absorb and channel runoffs. 
"I rebuilt after July's flood; how stupid was that?" Ms. Battlo said as the town spent another anxious day under flash-flood warnings. "I've been writing a play about the Hatfield shootouts in the mining days, but I can see the fresh tragedy to be written here is all about the flooding," she said, vowing to stay and capture the story.
As they shoveled, hosed and mopped, the few Main Street merchants left in this town of 500 residents were vowing to clean up and reopen, if only because they had no alternative way of surviving.
"Everybody down this part of the country is tough," said Jimmy Gianato, the hardware dealer descended from Italian immigrant coal miners who settled Kimball when King Coal boomed along the Elkhorn.
"Our parents were tough, our grandparents tougher, and toughest were the old-timers from the old country," said Mr. Gianato, a member of this town's stalwart mercantile clan.
The Gianato hardware and grocery stores were ruined in the flood last July. At the time, Mayor Premo openly raised the question of closing down the town. The Gianatos and other leaders stayed and reopened last summer, only to be at the mops and shovels this morning.
The McDowell County region, one of the poorest in Appalachia, has been in a downward spiral for 50 years, with young people emigrating and welfare replacing coal as an economic force. The county now has only about one-fourth the population of 100,000 it had in busier days, when, long before machine-intensive strip mining, manual labor was at a premium. But retired miners like Mayor Premo, who worked 40 years underground, remain addicted to the beauty of the mountain hollows.
So when the flooding returned last week, "the older people just sat in their houses and cried," said Fran Lambert, a resident who pitched in to rescue aged neighbors.
"We couldn't get them to stand up and go to the cars," Ms. Lambert said. "It was hard for all of us to believe that this was happening all over again a year later."
It may take a week or more to even reach the more remote hollow communities like Avondale and Barton No. 3, disaster officials said.
"It breaks your heart to see a third of the houses in Coalwood gone, destroyed," said Jay Wilson, director of McDowell Mission, a Methodist charity. He is hoping for the return of hundreds of volunteers from across Appalachia who helped rebuild impoverished McDowell County hamlets last summer.
"Recovery truly depends on people pulling together," said State Senator John R. Unger II, who is coordinating the state disaster-relief effort. "And I have to marvel how people are doing just that, rising above their homes' being destroyed."
Residents complain strongly about the effects of lumbering and strip mining, noting in particular the Bush administration's new decision to ease coal waste restrictions on mountaintop mining. This process involves the decapitation of mountaintops by giant machinery that now will have more leeway in pouring wastes into nearby streams that environmentalists say are vital for storm management. A state study on the effects of mining and lumbering on the Appalachian hollows is expected this summer.
The Bush administration contends that the new policy on coal waste will be tightly controlled by the Army Corps of Engineers. But Mr. Widener, the undertaker, firmly insisted: "Timbering and mining have raped and ruined us. A hundred families left after the July flood, and now here's the fresh storm, the ground bursting open with nowhere for the water to go. We're left all scared and hesitant." --------------------

Judge Bars Mountaintop Permits
CHARLESTON, W.Va., May 8 (AP) -- A federal district judge ordered the Army Corps of Engineers today to stop issuing new permits for mountaintop coal mining.
The judge, Charles Haden II, said the Environmental Protection Agency and the corps had overstepped their authority by making recent changes to the definition of the types of materials that could be dumped in nearby waterways by the mining operations. He said only Congress could change the definition.
A spokesman for the corps, Steve Wright, said its officials had yet to read the ruling, which stemmed from a suit brought in February by an advocacy group, Kentuckians for the Commonwealth.

HEADLINE: Senate Passes Major Expansion of Farm Subsidies 

BYLINE:  By ADAM CLYMER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 8 

 BODY:
The Senate today passed and sent to the White House an election year farm bill that greatly increases spending on agriculture and reverses a six-year-old decision to wean farmers from subsidies.
 Although the administration had resisted many of the subsidies in the legislation and a majority of Senate Republicans voted no, President Bush has said he will sign the measure. 
 Along with expanding big payments for grain and cotton farmers, the measure would also expand the food stamp program and restore the right of legal immigrants to receive them. The legislation also increases money for conservation and other environmental measures. 
The House-Senate conference report, which the House passed last week, was adopted today, 64 to 35. Voting for the bill were 43 Democrats, 20 Republicans and 1 independent. Seven Democrats and 28 Republicans were opposed.
Senator Tom Harkin, the Iowa Democrat who is chairman of the Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee, said the bill restored a safety net for farmers that the 1996 Freedom to Farm bill had weakened. 
"This farm bill," Mr. Harkin said, "marks a new beginning by investing in the security and success of our farm families and in the economic future of our rural communities." 
Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the majority leader, said, "For the first time in many years, we will be able to send a message of hope to the farmers and ranchers of this country."
But the senior Republican on the committee, Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, sharply disagreed. He said it would cause farmers to overproduce and would drive down prices and provide large subsidies to a few large farmers. He called the bill "an attempt in a closely divided Congress to try to help individual Senators and House members, with the thought that party control of either body may be a much more important objective than careful economic analysis or maybe even careful stewardship of the funds for which we are responsible."
The estimated 10-year cost of the bill is $180 billion, $70 billion more than the cost of current programs, and it would include $40 billion in subsidies for large cotton and grain farms.

HEADLINE: More Worry Over Loans By Big Banks In China 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, May 9 

 BODY:
Financial experts are expressing grave worries about the solvency of China's banking system, which may have a bad-loan problem several times as bad as Japan's.
 The head of China's central bank said recently that 25 to 30 percent of all bank loans were not being repaid. Today, the credit-rating agency Standard & Poor's estimated that the situation may be twice that bad, with half of all loans classifiable as nonperforming. And the agency found signs that the banks were busily making matters worse. 
 Without a robust banking system, it will be increasingly difficult for China to sustain rapid growth, attract foreign investment and develop the modern economy it needs to provide jobs and maintain social stability at a time of widespread disillusionment with the Communist ideology that united the country for 50 years. 
Standard & Poor's warned today that Chinese banks appeared to be trying to prop themselves up by issuing new loans at a furious pace, in many cases financing vaguely described projects with little discernible effect on China's overall economic output. This approach could yield even more bad loans, and may be creating a financial bubble of wasteful and mismanaged overspending of the kind that led to crises in many other East Asian nations in the late 1990's, according to Terry E. H. Chan, the ratings agency's director for Chinese and Southeast Asian financial institutions.
"Is the bubble building?" Mr. Chan asked at a news conference here today. "We are concerned. Where is the money going?"
Though a few privately owned and foreign banks have gained small footholds, China's banking system is dominated by four giant commercial banks, all state-owned. Questions have arisen periodically for a decade about the banks' viability, mainly because of the evident pressures on them to make uneconomic loans for various political reasons.
Beginning in 1999, the Chinese government sought to resolve these concerns by relieving the four big banks of $170 billion worth of bad loans -- 12 percent of loans outstanding -- and then writing off the loans or reselling them, following the same general approach that worked for the United States after the savings and loan crisis. 
But those efforts do not appear to have succeeded, Chinese and Western officials now say. Dai Xianglung, the central bank governor, said in a recent speech that even under the most generous accounting rules, one-quarter of the loans left on the books of the country's banks were nonperforming. New, more stringent rules being introduced will push the figure above 30 percent, other Chinese regulators have said.
The banks are gradually earning profits to offset the bad loans, Mr. Dai said in his speech. He called on the banks to get the bad-loan number down to 15 percent within five years.
By comparison, the highest estimates of the bad-loan situation in Japan, where banks have been in desperate straits for a decade and are very slow to write loans off, put the size of the problem at 15 percent or less of outstanding loans.
In the United States, banks are much more aggressive about writing off loans on which they are not receiving interest payments. At banks with assets of more than $1 billion, just 1.5 percent of loans were more than 90 days overdue on Dec. 31, according to data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
Standard & Poor's is far from alone in its assessment of China's problems. Wei Yen, vice president for Chinese banking at Moody's Investors Service, also say that the bailout has failed. But he was less pessimistic than Standard & Poor's about the potential for Chinese banks to grow their way out of their problems by finding creditworthy new borrowers.
Mr. Yen said the four main commercial banks had made considerable progress in centralizing control over lending and in imposing strict risk controls. The goal of these measures is to insulate local branch managers against pressure from local politicians and factory bosses to make ill-considered loans.
"We don't dispute that the Chinese banking system has terrible problems, but if you take a long-term perspective and look at what they have done in the last five or six years, it's tremendous," Mr. Yen said, adding that Moody's would soon release its own report.
In the Mao Zedong era, Chinese banks were not businesses in the Western sense. They were conduits for distribution of state subsidies to local enterprises, and for collection of taxes and other contributions to national revenue from those enterprises. How much borrowers received had little to do with how much they repaid.
Beijing tried to put the banks on a commercial footing in 1994 by setting up three new institutions to take over the job of financing big state-owned enterprises, the ones that employed so many people that for the sake of social and political stability they could not be allowed to fail. The commercial banks were supposed to stick to making loans strictly on the financial merits from then on. But they do not appear to have done so.
China plans to open up its banking sector to international competition over the next five years as part of its entry to the World Trade Organization, which will put more pressure on domestic banks. Foreign banks now have less than 2 percent of all deposits and loans in China.
The four big domestic commercial banks -- the Bank of China, the China Construction Bank, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and the Agricultural Bank of China -- are in various stages of preparing to sell minority stakes to public shareholders, in the hope of raising money to offset their bad loans.
The Bank of China is furthest along, and it had been expected to issue stock this year in China, Hong Kong and possibly New York. But its plans have been set back by several scandals in the last five months involving allegations of fraudulent loans to friends of bank managers.
Mr. Chan of Standard & Poor's predicted that the level of bad loans at Chinese banks would discourage international investors from buying any of their shares.
Moody's and Standard & Poor's usually agree on most credit ratings, but they have sharply divergent assessments of the four big banks. Moody's puts all four at Baa-1, three grades above the minimum to qualify as investment grade. But Standard & Poor's does not rate the Agricultural Bank at all, and rates the other three at BB+, a speculative rating four notches below Moody's.

HEADLINE: Regulate Casinos Fairly 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "Court Decision Raises Question of Legality of New York Casinos" (news article, May 3): Indian casinos, operated by sovereign nations and separately governed by the federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988, are essentially not subject to the laws, regulations and taxes covering everyone else in the country. 
 We in the non-Native American gaming industry face a regulatory system that is more stringent, which results in an unfair, anticompetitive marketplace. 
Even with equal regulation, Indian casinos would have an advantage since they can operate in states where legalized commercial casinos cannot. 
But stronger state and federal oversight of them would ensure that all casinos compete on a level playing field, remain free of illegal influence and are effective economic engines for all Americans.

HEADLINE: Japan Protests China's Arrest Of Koreans At Consulate 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 9 

 BODY:
With television relaying images of Chinese police officers dragging five North Korean refugees from inside a Japanese Consulate compound in China, Japan protested strongly today, seeking to head off a nationalist reaction against its powerful neighbor.
 After meeting with Wu Dawei, China's ambassador here, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi said he believed that China had violated the Vienna convention governing diplomatic relations. "That's why we are lodging a protest," the prime minister added. "We are seeking a sincere response from the Chinese side." 
 Separately, a Japanese Embassy official in Beijing visited the Foreign Ministry there today to demand the release of the five detainees.
The news video shows two North Korean women screaming for help as they clung to the inside of a gate at the Japanese Consulate compound in Shenyang on Wednesday. Chinese police officers wrested the women away, detaining them along with a 2-year-old girl and two North Korean men who were inside the consulate.
In a separate incident on Wednesday, two North Korean men successfully took refuge in Shenyang's American Consulate. Today a third North Korean scaled the consulate wall and joined them.
The five detained North Koreans are members of the extended family of Jang Gil Su, a defector whose amateur sketches have brought home to many Americans the privations and police abuses in North Korea. With rights workers preparing an exhibit of the sketches in Washington this summer, a group of United States Congressional leaders urged China in a letter not to send the North Korean detainees home. 
"We strongly urge your government not to forcibly return any of them to North Korea, where they would face certain danger," read the letter from Representative Henry J. Hyde, Republican of Illinois and the chairman of the House International Relations Committee. Addressed to Yang Jiechi, China's ambassador to the United States, the letter was signed by three other members of the committee.
The State Department spokesman, Richard A. Boucher, said today in Washington that negotiations on the Koreans' fate were under way with China, adding, "We don't believe that North Koreans should be returned to face persecution in North Korea."
With as many as 300,000 North Koreans living illegally in northern China, Beijing fears that granting them refugee status would start an exodus from North Korea.
The asylum bids started in March, prompting the Chinese authorities to ring the main neighborhood for embassies in Beijing with barbed wire and to mount police patrols.
Yet another case, which occurred last week, highlights China's reluctance to draw bad publicity over the issue: a North Korean family detained while trying to enter the South Korean Embassy have reportedly escaped from a Beijing hotel where they were being interrogated by the Chinese police. The family included a pregnant woman. The Chinese may have been reluctant to deport her in light of rights workers' repeated descriptions of forced abortions in North Korean prisons.
Japan is celebrating 30 years of diplomatic relations with China, and officials fear that the detentions could provoke a nationalist outcry.
Sankei Shimbun, a conservative newspaper, attacked the detentions today as "a serious situation of violation of extraterritorial rights by the Chinese police" and faulted "the more than lenient attitude of consulate staff."
The video, which has been broadcast in China and is expected to be broadcast here on Friday, showed Japanese consular officials talking with North Korean women as they resisted arrest by the Chinese police officers. But, according to the Kyodo news agency, the video does not show Japanese officials moving to stop the arrests. The Japanese can be seen picking up the Chinese officers' hats, which had been knocked off.
"Foreign Ministry officials at the consulate could have taken different action if they had properly felt Japan's sovereignty was being infringed on," Kosei Ueno, deputy chief cabinet secretary, said today. "I think the staff should have taken the incident more seriously."
A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Kong Quan, defended the police action as part of the war on terrorism.
"In the greater context of the global war on terrorism, the Chinese armed police on duty took away the people who rushed into the Japanese Consulate General illegally and whose identities are unclear," he said. Today, South Korea joined Japan and the United States in urging China to let the detainees leave China. So far this year, South Korea has taken in 312 North Koreans, twice the number for the same period of last year.

HEADLINE: Russia Delays U.N. Vote on Iraq Penalties 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 9 

 BODY:
Russia has asked for a delay until next week of a United Nations Security Council vote on an overhaul of sanctions against Iraq aimed at easing the flow of goods to Baghdad, according to diplomats.
 The five permanent Security Council members with veto power, including Russia and the United States, introduced a resolution on Monday and had hoped for a vote on Wednesday. 
 First Syria, a Council member, wanted a delay, and then Russian envoys told colleagues that President Vladimir V. Putin wanted to take a final look and sign off on the new plan. 
Russia, which helped negotiate the new plan, asked for the vote to be postponed until Monday but raised no new objections, the diplomats said late Wednesday night.
Central to the new program is a 160-page "goods review list" of items that may have dual military and civilian use and have to be evaluated separately before they can be exported. Goods not on the list can go to Iraq after review by United Nations officials. Military items continue to be banned outright.
Currently, any Council member can block a contract to Iraq, and the United States has put $5 billion worth of goods on hold. Russia, among others, has made sure many of its contracts are not on the list. The new plan promises to be the biggest change in sanctions procedures since the United Nations oil-for-food deal began in December 1996 to ease the effects of embargoes imposed when Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990.
This program allows Iraq to export oil and buy food, medicine and a host of other goods, with the proceeds placed in an escrow account from which suppliers are paid. The program, renewed every six months, expires on May 29.
Syria also raised misgivings about the new plan, with its diplomats saying they needed further instructions from officials in Damascus, who were studying the resolution that includes hundreds of pages of attachments.
But privately, diplomats said Syria cited the crisis between Israel and the Palestinians, questioning why it should vote quickly on Iraqi sanctions when the Council refused to condemn Israel for its offensive in the West Bank.
Although the vote can go ahead without Syria, which does not have veto power, the United States and others wanted to preserve Council unity. Paradoxically, Syria itself has been cited by diplomats and oil analysts for violating sanctions by illegally importing Iraqi crude oil.

HEADLINE: The Big City; 
Puzzling Out The Logic In Living Wage

BYLINE:  By JOHN TIERNEY 

 BODY:
PEOPLE who call themselves advocates for the poor are all for reducing the poverty rate in New York City, but it's not clear how they want to do it. Do they want the poor to climb the ladder to higher-paying jobs? Or would they rather reduce the poverty rate by keeping poor people out of town?
 No one, of course, likes to explicitly endorse the keep-them-out-of-town solution. You will not hear proponents of the City Council's so-called living-wage bill promising to reduce the number of jobs for the poorest and least skilled workers, even if that's what would happen. 
 The proposed law, which would mandate wages of at least $8.10 per hour at companies with city contracts, would help some workers while hurting those at the bottom of the ladder, like immigrants who can't speak English and have little education or work experience. These immigrants might find work as janitors if the pay is only $7 per hour, because employers have a hard time keeping those low-paying jobs filled. But if the pay increases, so does the competition. 
"When wages go up, employers look for better workers," said Richard Sander, a professor of law at U.C.L.A. who has studied the effects of living-wage laws in Los Angeles and other California cities. "Not only do some jobs disappear, but some of the lower-skilled workers are replaced." In Northern California, he noted, low-paying airport jobs were readily available before the living-wage law, but afterward the jobs became harder to get because there was less turnover and more competition from better-qualified workers.
If you want a specific example of the workers who would be affected in New York, look at the street cleaners wearing the blue uniforms of the Ready, Willing and Able program. These men and women, most of whom have been homeless and have criminal records, start out working for $5.50 per hour.
"The living-wage bill would raise the first rung of the economic ladder higher than our people should be reaching at this moment in their life," said George McDonald, president of the Doe Fund, which runs the program.
"Most of our people have been incarcerated many times. They get out of jail and have a hard time finding any job until we hire them. Then they graduate to a job in the private sector that pays more than the living wage as defined by this bill. We've gotten 1,200 people into jobs with living wages in the private sector at the same time we're making New York cleaner. It gets my Irish up to think that something could impede all that."
Mr. McDonald might manage to get an exemption for his training program, thereby sparing his workers and keeping some sidewalks clean. But other workers and services would be affected. There would be fewer jobs for the unskilled, and companies doing business with the city would either charge more or provide less. 
You could argue that, even with reduced services, the city as whole would be better off with a living-wage law because it would mitigate New York's extreme income inequality. With fewer low-paying jobs here, some of the least skilled workers would go elsewhere. Those particular workers would presumably be unhappy, but perhaps most New Yorkers would prefer living in a city with fewer people at the bottom of the economic ladder.
BUT that's not an argument that the "advocates for the poor" make when another issue comes up: gentrification. They can be quite forthright in desiring more poor neighbors, as I discovered from the reaction to a recent column describing some surprising research into gentrification.
The research showed that poor and working-class people in a neighborhood tended to benefit when it gentrified. Instead of being displaced, as popularly assumed, they become more likely to stay than they would be otherwise. They want to stay because the neighborhood's getting better, and many of them can afford the higher rents because of the new jobs that come with gentrification.
But those benefits weren't enough to satisfy some "advocates for the poor." Even if the poor people living in the neighborhood might not be displaced, the critics warned of "secondary displacement" caused by the rising rents. The people already in the neighborhood might be climbing the economic ladder, but other poor people wouldn't be able to move into the better neighborhood. 
By that logic, it's more important to keep poor newcomers arriving than it is to help the poor already living in the neighborhood. If you're confused by now, you're not alone.

HEADLINE: Factory Jobs, Then Workers, Leaving Poorest Southern Areas 

BYLINE:  By DAVID HALBFINGER 

DATELINE: KINGSTREE, S.C. 

 BODY:
This old farming and factory town in the rural South Carolina lowlands still has its charms, but they are lost on Sonya Alston, 22. She is planning to move to Charlotte, N.C., any day now.
 Ms. Alston had lucked out after graduating from high school in 1998 and landed a job at a latex-glove plant, where she turned wet gloves inside-out for $7.94 an hour -- enviable wages in Kingstree. 
 But in the fall of 2000, the company closed the factory, saying finished gloves could be made in China for less than what the company was paying for raw latex. After months on unemployment, Ms. Alston found a temporary job at a Tupperware plant 25 miles away. Her pay there is nearly as good as on her old job, but her hours have gotten pitiful.
"The last two weeks, we worked one day out of the week," she said. "They say there's just not enough orders."
That is the lament in Kingstree, the seat of Williamsburg County and the epicenter of the storm that has swept the manufacturing sector throughout the coastal Southeast. County officials say the exodus of people like Ms. Alston has shrunk the work force by more than 5,000 in recent years, but the unemployment rate -- 14.1 percent in March -- remains the highest in the state. The able-bodied workers who have not left their homes and families behind in Williamsburg -- or in Marion, Clarendon, Orangeburg and half a dozen other ravaged Black Belt counties -- often say that they would, if they could only figure out where the jobs are.
The recession's effects on manufacturing have been well documented in the sprawling, suburbanized industrial corridors of Georgia and the Carolinas -- places like Albany and Atlanta, Greenville and Spartanburg, Raleigh-Durham and Asheville. But they have been felt most sharply in the predominantly black, persistently poor coastal lowlands, where small and medium-sized factories began cropping up in old cotton, tobacco and peanut fields back in the 1950's to escape the unions and higher wages of the North.
Now, one weed at a time, nature is reclaiming many of those now-deserted industrial plants. Rural factories still employ fewer than half of all manufacturing workers in Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina, federal labor statistics show. But in the 15 months that ended in March, factories in rural areas accounted for nearly 7 out of 10 manufacturing jobs lost in the three states.
The disparity was bluntest in South Carolina, where rural counties are home to only 47 percent of the manufacturing work force but absorbed 72 percent of the 29,400 jobs lost from December 2000 to March, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In the production of durable goods -- things like electrical equipment, auto parts, appliances and countless widgets sold to factories further up the industrial food chain -- rural areas represented just 45 percent of the labor force, but accounted for 87 percent of the 12,200 jobs lost.
Jason Gray, policy director at the Southern Rural Development Initiative, a coalition of community groups based in Raleigh, said the latest recession had just accelerated the decline of an already weakened, if not dying, manufacturing base. "These counties have anemic economies," he said. "And when you're anemic, somebody else catches a cold and you get pneumonia.
"These were unhealthy places to begin with because they're undiversified economies that are relying on manufacturing sectors, which are not competitive in a global economy," he added. "All those textile jobs that have been lost in North and South Carolina? They all went somewhere else. They didn't just close, they closed and went to Guadalajara or Indonesia or China."
Many of the factories that have closed in Williamsburg County in recent years did produce textiles -- from the four Kingstree Knit plants that put 860 people out of work in 1995 and 1996, to the Tip Top Tees plant that stopped turning out T-shirts in December, idling 80 workers. But others included furniture, packaging and chemical plants.
Mr. Gray said many factories were simply reaching the end of their useful lives. Still other manufacturers that have come to the rural areas, perhaps hoping to take advantage of the local air of desperation by reaping local government incentives, often rest on shaky financial footings and thus are more vulnerable in a recession, he said.
Hilton McGill, Williamsburg County's economic development director, acknowledged the dilemma. "We realize these may not be the highest priority jobs or the most financially stable," he said. "But what we're trying to do now is put a tourniquet on a difficult situation."
So Mr. McGill dutifully prints glossy brochures promoting an ever-growing list of newly available -- i.e., abandoned -- industrial buildings. Pictures of his few big successes -- the Taiwanese plastics factory, the landfill-liner maker, the telemarketing operation -- hang on the wall of his office, which doubles as the terminal of the county airport. But the newer companies typically employ a small fraction as many workers as the ones they replace, he said.
"It's kind of like the gentleman who bought the Cadillac, but had to turn it off to fill it up with gas," Mr. McGill said. "We're bringing them in, but we're losing them out the back door."
Each loss only deepens the look of hopelessness in the eyes of people like Willie Tisdale, who worked for the old Colonial Rubber Works before its new owner shut it down last fall. "It used to irritate your skin, but was good work," he said. Mr. Tisdale hoed tobacco last summer season for $30 a day or less. Now that it is out of season he is living off his brother, a town maintenance man. "What we need is someone to open up a big plant," he said.
That is about as likely as manna falling from heaven, officials say. "Industrial developers are looking elsewhere," said Representative James E. Clyburn, the lone black congressman in South Carolina's six-person delegation, whose district includes many of the poorest and most heavily African-American counties. "So what trained, educated black people do is go where the jobs are." Wherever that is.
For those who stay, there are few choices. About 800 workers board county buses before dawn each morning for a two-hour ride to Myrtle Beach, where they flip burgers or clean hotel rooms for $6 or $7 an hour, returning home 12 or 14 hours later having earned perhaps $50 before taxes and the $5 fare.
At least there is still the Tupperware plant. Keith McFadden, 47, took a job there five years ago. He works full time. But he is still a temporary worker with no benefits. Waiting for a shuttle bus to take him to his night shift -- his old Mercury is not up to any kind of commute -- Mr. McFadden said he harbored little hope of getting a permanent job, but had no idea where else to look.
"I'm sticking with it because jobs are so hard to find," he said. "I'm between a rock and a hard place. For my age, and for the years I've been there, I don't want to give it up."

PERSON: Joel B. Leff 

HEADLINE: Joel B. Leff, 67, Co-Founder Of Investment Management Firm 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE WAYNE 

 BODY:
Joel B. Leff, a founder and co-chairman of the investment management firm Forstmann-Leff Associates, died at his Manhattan home on Tuesday. He was 67 years old and had suffered from cancer.
 Mr. Leff combined an eclectic approach to investing with an equally eclectic approach to collecting and selling antiques from the Oblique Gallery, which he owned on East 60th Street in Manhattan. 
 Since its founding in 1968, his investment firm, Forstmann-Leff, has grown to have more than $4 billion in assets under management and a client base that includes corporate and public pension funds as well as wealthy individuals.
At the same time, he filled his shop with an array of Art Deco and Far Eastern antiques and paintings that he and his fourth wife, Jeanne, acquired on their travels and later re-sold. He kept a computer at the gallery so he could continue with his financial transactions as he supervised the placement and sale of his antique finds.
He was also a William Cullen Bryant Fellow at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, part of a group of major donors to the museum's American Wing.
The son of a successful businessman, Mr. Leff was born in New York City on April 4, 1935, and attended the Barnard School for Boys and graduated from the Wharton School's undergraduate program at the University of Pennsylvania in 1957. He graduated from Harvard Business School in 1961, where he wrote the Odd Man Out column for the business school newspaper. After graduating, he stayed on as a teacher in advanced economic theory at Harvard and was a member of its faculty.
Before starting his partnership with Anthony Forstmann, Mr. Leff managed investments for several families and became a partner and research director for Hawkes & Company, a Wall Street firm.
At the beginning of Forstmann-Leff, Mr. Leff attracted money from union pension funds and private individuals to his firm. Throughout his years, Mr. Leff focused on his institutional clients and continued to expand his firm's financial product line. At all times, he followed a growth strategy, whether it was in the firm's hedge funds, its various stock funds or as part of the firm's overall portfolio mix.
In 1986, a British firm, the Guiness Peat Group, bought Forstmann-Leff, but later went bankrupt. Mr. Leff negotiated to buy the firm back. In 1997, Forstmann-Leff was sold again, to the Refco Group, a commodities firm, with Mr. Leff and his management team remaining to operate it under a management contract.
As co-chairman, Mr. Leff's was a member of his firm's investment committee, developing the firm's strategy and writing a monthly newsletter to clients.
With a house in Southampton, N.Y., many years as a bachelor and a love of the opera, tennis and the arts, Mr. Leff was a popular person at Upper East Side dinner parties and social events in the Hamptons. In his single years, he said that he received as many as 15 dinner party invitations a week and developed the technique of extricating himself from late-night events with the excuse that he had to leave to walk his two King Charles spaniels, Edison and Smudgin. He attributed his popularity to being a bachelor and being wealthy.
After his 1999 wedding -- at the chapel in the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas -- he agreed to let his wedding video be auctioned for charity.
Mr. Leff is survived by his wife; his mother, Zena L. Leff of Palm Beach, Fla.; his son, Adam B. Leff of Los Angeles; and his brother, Richard Leff, who lives in New Hampshire.

HEADLINE: New Data on Unemployment Question Health of Labor Market 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 9 

 BODY:
Worker claims for jobless benefits fell less than expected last week, and the number of Americans collecting aid rose to a 19-year high, government figures showed today, suggesting that the labor market is not improving rapidly as the economy recovers. 
 States received 411,000 new applications for unemployment benefits in the week ended Saturday, the Labor Department said. Though that figure was down 11,000 from the previous week, it was more than the 407,000 that economists had expected. About 3.8 million workers collected unemployment benefits in the week ended April 27, the most since April 1983 during a recovery from back-to-back recessions. 
 "The economy isn't growing fast enough at this time to absorb workers," said Chris Rupkey, senior financial economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi in New York. "There are real questions about the health of the labor market right now. The way continuing claims continue to go up suggests economic weakness."
The unemployment rate, which rose to 6 percent in April, a seven-and-a-half-year high, may climb as high as 6.5 percent in coming months as companies are slow to hire, Mr. Rupkey said.
A labor market that shows few signs of improving helps explain why Federal Reserve policy makers this week left the overnight bank lending rate at a 40-year low of 1.75 percent, where it has been since December.
Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, said job growth was vital because consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the economy. "Perhaps most central to the outlook for consumer spending will be developments in the labor market," he told Congress last month.
Retailers reported today that their April sales gain was the smallest since September. Sales at stores open at least a year rose 0.8 percent last month, according to the Goldman, Sachs retail composite index.
At the same time, inflation remains tame. A separate government report showed import prices were 3.9 percent lower in April than a year ago. Not including petroleum, the costs of imported goods were down 3.3 percent from April 2001.

BYLINE:  By DANIEL J. WAKIN 

 BODY:
He came to town with a reputation for a golden touch at raising money and for being a tough, cost-cutting administrator.
 Cardinal Edward M. Egan has done his part for this year's Cardinal's Appeal, bringing in a professional fund-raiser to run the campaign, imposing a tougher burden on his pastors to bring in donations and personally tapping wealthy Roman Catholics for more than $2 million. 
 But with only two weeks left in the appeal and nearly half the goal unmet, the Archdiocese of New York is now looking to make up the rest from the men and women in the pews, a place where anger at the Catholic hierarchy is running high over evidence that for decades bishops looked away while child-abusing priests were kept in parishes.
Whether they will come through is a big question for Cardinal Egan, who was seen as the best hope to rescue the archdiocese's sinking finances when he was appointed archbishop in 2000 but who has rarely been credited with having the pastoral touch of his predecessor, Cardinal John O'Connor. 
The archdiocese said that it had raised $8.2 million as of Wednesday in its annual fund-raising campaign, which has a goal of $15 million and ends May 26. The archdiocese says it is confident that a mail solicitation of modest givers starting in mid-April and appeals by pastors at Masses this month, the final phase of the campaign, will make up the difference. And officials point out that donations continue after the campaign formally ends. 
There are plenty of anecdotal indications that the scandal has dampened the enthusiasm of New York-area donors, but no clear evidence that Catholics in the archdiocese, which includes Manhattan, Staten Island, the Bronx and five counties to the north, are broadly punishing the church. 
"Are there some people who are angry?" asked Msgr. Charles M. Kavanagh, the archdiocese's vicar for development. "Yes. Are there people who are voting with their pocketbook? I'm sure there are." But, he said, he was satisfied with the results and expected that the goal would be met. The small-donor solicitation amounted to $8 million or $9 million in past years, he said.
But Cardinal Egan is facing pressure that his predecessor did not. Documents cited in news reports have suggested that the cardinal, while bishop of Bridgeport, knew that some priests had been accused of sexually abusing minors but allowed them to keep working in parishes and did not pass on information about them to law enforcement authorities.
New York City's other diocese, which covers Brooklyn and Queens, has not been immune to the trouble but officials say donations from a similar appeal have not dropped. Bishop Thomas V. Daily of Brooklyn has been criticized for failing to act while he was a top official of the Archdiocese of Boston in the early 1980's, and for allowing a priest accused of serious sex abuse to keep serving.
Despite reports about the bishop's role in Boston and reports of abuse in the Brooklyn diocese, pledges to its Annual Stewardship Appeal since Feb. 3 have reached about $5.9 million, well above the goal of slightly more than $4 million, said Frank DeRosa, a spokesman for the diocese. "We're on track to do as well as we did last year," he said.
In the New York Archdiocese, Michael Elmore, a 48-year-old librarian who attends St. Joseph's Church in Greenwich Village and has always contributed to the Cardinal's Appeal in the past, said he would give to Catholic Relief Services this year instead.
Referring to Cardinal Egan, he said, "His behavior has been reprehensible and I do not trust him, because of the way that he behaved when he was bishop of Bridgeport in covering up scandals."
The Rev. Walter F. Modrys of St. Ignatius Loyola Church on the Upper East Side, who has had a disagreement with the cardinal over renovation at his church, said he did not expect to reach his church's goal of $225,000. 
"There is a lot of feeling out there, negative feeling among Catholics, that's making it increasingly hard to raise money for the Cardinal's Appeal," he said. He also blamed a more troubled economy.
And at Holy Name of Mary Church in Croton-on-Hudson, where two pastors have been removed over allegations of sexual impropriety, the new pastor, the Rev. Michael Keane, said he expected his parish would barely raise half of its $66,000 goal. "It's hit home, twice in a row," he said. 
To respond to worries that donations may go toward settlements or legal fees to defend sex abuse allegations, officials in the New York Archdiocese have shaped their message. "There was a much greater emphasis on our clear-cut needs and where the money was going to go," Monsignor Kavanagh said.
The New York Archdiocese says all of the $15 million will go to Catholic schools and religious education programs, help for poor parishes, social services and pastoral outreach, St. Joseph's Seminary in Yonkers, and support for retired priests.
The appeal is critical to the operations of the archdiocese. Last year, Cardinal Egan reorganized the financing system. Before, parishes were assessed a lump sum, which included both general assessments on parish income and a goal for the Cardinal's Appeal. Parishes that reached the goal received a 25 percent rebate, and half of any excess. Now, parishes are assessed 7.5 percent of collections and given a goal for the appeal. There is no rebate, and the parish gets 60 percent of any excess. The effect, pastors say, is to increase the amount of money parishes are asked to raise.
Cardinal Egan brought in an outside fund-raiser, Community Counseling Service, last year to run a new kind of campaign for the Cardinal's Appeal. It focused on the biggest donors in the early months of the campaign, in February and March. Pastors, bishops and Cardinal Egan himself attended cocktail parties, large dinners and intimate meals.
By last Friday, the archdiocese had raised $5.8 million from donors who gave more than $1,000 each. Cardinal Egan was personally involved in appeals to a dozen who pledged more than $100,000 each, including one over $1 million, the monsignor said. None had given more than $50,000 before, he said.
Cardinal Egan, in closing schools and offices, has declared fiscal order to be one of his main goals. Monsignor Kavanagh said the deficit had dropped from about $20 million to about $9 million.
Cardinal Egan's predecessor came from a working-class background and was reluctant to ask for donations. One diocese official recalled a meeting at which Cardinal O'Connor told a donor he did not want his money, just his advice. "Can't you take both?" answered the incredulous donor.
Cardinal Egan, by contrast, moves easily in wealthy circles and feels no embarrassment in asking for money. While he was in Bridgeport, the diocese said, it reached or surpassed its appeal goal every year.

HEADLINE: Newark's Competing Visions of Itself; 
Reborn or Struggling? Each View Is Reflected by a Mayoral Candidate

BYLINE:  By ANDREW JACOBS 

DATELINE: NEWARK, May 9 

 BODY:
If this hard-luck city had a slogan it would be a single word: renaissance.
 The word has been adopted by scores of businesses here -- a hairdresser's, a candle shop, an apartment building -- and it invariably peppers the speeches of Mayor Sharpe James, the man who has spent 16 years selling the notion of Newark as a phoenix finally rising from the ashes of the 1967 riots that left this city a symbol of urban despair. 
 But Britney Ramsey, 19, has her doubts. Standing on Broad Street across from the shell of the unfinished Renaissance Mall, Ms. Ramsey said that after a lifetime of hearing about Newark's renaissance, she was still waiting for it. "What renaissance?" she said, nodding to the skeletal remains of the mall, left by a developer who ran out of money in the mid-1980's. "I live on one of the worst drug blocks in the city. Sometimes I hear gunfire at night. Yeah, I see improvements, but not enough to make me want to stay in Newark." 
Around the corner at the Renaissance Cafe, however, the manager, Anthony Cupo, sees an entirely different city. His view may be dominated by parking lots and the back end of the abandoned mall, but Mr. Cupo likens them to fallow but fertile fields awaiting a burst of new growth. "You can feel the excitement," said Mr. Cupo, referring to the recent spurt of downtown development and the even greater promise of a downtown arena, whose most recent version was proposed by Gov. James E. McGreevey on Wednesday.
"I see nothing but potential and opportunity," he said. 
When Newark residents go to the polls on Tuesday, they will be choosing between those contrasting views of Newark when they choose between the 66-year-old incumbent who has led this city for a generation and Cory Booker, a suburban-bred, Ivy League-educated newcomer half his age. The two strikingly different candidates are billing the election as a referendum on how real the renaissance has been. 
Mr. James is campaigning on his record of downtown development and bringing Newark back from an urban disaster to "America's comeback city." Mr. Booker's campaign slogan, "It's time for a renaissance for the rest of us," reflects his argument that Newark's comeback has been shallow, spotty and a benefit to only a few.
Both men can cite some convincing evidence. 
The downtown skyline, once ominously dark at night, is a brightly lighted collection of renovated office towers. Starbucks has even given the city its stamp of approval by opening its first store here, and several nights a week suburban concertgoers crowd a glittering performing-arts center and white-tablecloth restaurants that didn't exist five years ago. Even the tundralike stretches of the devastated Central Ward have flowered with middle-class housing and a multiplex theater.
Gone are crumbling high-rise projects that led to Newark's ranking as America's worst city for housing. Violent crime is down, the population numbers have stabilized, and optimism is on the rise. 
But much remains unchanged. The high school dropout rate has not moved below 40 percent since Mr. James won office in 1986. Unemployment is little changed and at 9.2 percent is nearly double the state average. A third of the city's 274,000 residents still live in poverty, and despite a gain of 4,300 housing units between 1992 and 2000, the home ownership rate actually fell by 3 percent during the same period. Newark still ranks among the worst cities in the nation for AIDS, lead paint poisoning and tuberculosis.
Given the mixed picture, few urban experts buy the notion that Newark has completed its rise from decades of poverty and neglect.
"There are discrete pieces of progress, but a new performing arts center does not make for a renaissance," said Stephen Goldsmith, a former mayor of Indianapolis who teaches public management at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard.
Others say that it would be a mistake to minimize Newark's progress and how far it has come. The last census showed that Newark's population, after declining precipitously for decades, was stable between 1990 and 2000. The city has also become more ethnically diverse in recent years. Newark's population is now about half black, almost a third Hispanic and just over a quarter white. 
"Considering its massive problems, what's most impressive is the fact that people are no longer walking away from Newark," said Thomas Bender, who teaches urban history at New York University. "They're reaffirming that the city is worth saving, that it is no longer viewed as a trap, but a place of opportunity, a place where people's lives are improved."
Even residents of the same block have conflicting perspectives. 
Take Barbara Williams and Leon Johnson, two longtime residents who look at their West Ward block and see two entirely different worlds. Mr. Johnson, a 43-year-old drug counselor, sees hope in the vinyl-sided homes that began arriving on South 18th Street last year. "We used to call this block Vietnam," said Mr. Johnson, who recalls looting supermarkets as a 9-year-old. "I used to wake up to gunfire, and you didn't walk around here unless you knew how to fight." Mr. Johnson has no doubts about the changes. "The renaissance is real," he said.
To Ms. Williams, 57, the new homes are shoddy replacements for the wood-frame beauties that once lined her block, and they cannot hide the depressing ruins of adjacent homes that await demolition. She cannot forget the vanished neighbors, a racially mixed assortment of middle-class strivers, or the century-old shade trees that, one by one, succumbed to neglect.
"The city used to take care of the trees, and the street cleaners used to come by twice a week," she said, standing in front of her weathered but well-kept home. "I can't remember the last time I saw one come down here." 
At night, the drug dealers stake out positions along the block, and when Ms. Williams returns from her job working with disabled adults, she has her brother escort her inside. "It was such a beautiful street," said Ms. Williams, a South Carolina native who arrived here as a teenager. "Now I'm afraid to go out at night." As for the renaissance, she said she was still waiting for its arrival on South Orange Avenue, the West Ward commercial spine that remains a landscape of liquor stores, storefront churches and vacant lots. "We're stuck in the dark ages," she said.
Even the celebrated resurgence downtown has its detractors. Many residents resent the heavy police presence they say is desperately needed in the wards. New jobs, they complain, often go to better-skilled suburbanites, and many say they cannot afford tickets to performances at the arts center or baseball games at Riverfront Stadium, home of the Newark Bears. Mr. James cites the stadium as one of his greatest achievements; Mr. Booker likes to point out the $34 million it cost to build, money he says could be better spent on youth recreation programs. 
Msgr. William Linder, founder of the New Community Corporation and the city's most accomplished nonprofit developer, has become one of the most prominent critics of the city's focus on downtown. Monsignor Linder, who arrived here when the Central Ward was still smoldering from the fires of 1967 and 1,000 businesses lay in ruins, has created an empire that houses 8,500 people and employs 2,300. The public money spent on the arts center, he said, would have gone a long way toward repairing the city's tattered neighborhoods. "So far I haven't seen much spinoff value," he said. "We could have built a lot of homes with $180 million."
Of course, for every naysayer, there is a bubbly optimist. The city's real estate leaders are reveling in a boom unimaginable a few years ago. Financial giants like Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and Lehman Brothers have begun sinking money into downtown portfolios, and small-time home builders are snapping up lots in even the city's most foreboding streets.
"We can't put houses up fast enough," said Manuel Rosa, a broker and builder who can sell homes for $195,000 in marginal neighborhoods and $525,000 in the thriving East Ward, the heavily Portuguese and Brazilian enclave better known as the Ironbound. "It's an amazing story. I'm even amazed by it myself."
Miles Berger, a veteran developer, can recall a time when city real estate auctions drew one or two people. "If the minimum bid was $20,000, you got it for $20,000," he said. The auctions now are held in the 700-seat ballroom of the hotel he owns, and the crowds often spill out the door.
Community leaders say buyers are paying high prices for houses in neighborhoods coping with drugs, gang violence and ailing schools.
"You get a big new house, but you're not getting the amenities of a healthy community," said Monsignor Linder. 
Still, new homeowners like Daniel and Ogo Nwosu are believers. Nigerian immigrants who currently rent in Irvington, a nearby town, the Nwosus stood in front of their nearly completed home in the South Ward last week, talking breathlessly about plans for their generous backyard, their suburban-sized family room and the future of their adopted city. Never mind that nearby Clinton Avenue, the neighborhood's once vital shopping hub, is a menacing shadow of its former self. "People say the neighborhood is bad, that Newark is bad," said Mr. Nwosu, an electronics salesman at P. C. Richards who came to this country three years ago. "But if you read a lot, you know it's going to change." 
His builder, Many Goncalves, nodded enthusiastically. Mr. Goncalves, who has 36 homes under construction, said he was having trouble finding additional lots in the neighborhood. "This is the future over here," he said, showing off the oak flooring and brick-faced balconies with a view of Manhattan. To drive home his point, he gestured to a mirror-image house on a neighboring lot that is selling for $310,000. Mr. Nwosu, who paid $295,000 for his, couldn't help beaming. "You see," he said. "You have to have foresight. This here is really the American dream."

An Anti-American Boycott Is Growing in the Arab World

BYLINE:  By NEIL MacFARQUHAR 

DATELINE: CAIRO, May 9 

 BODY:
Doughnuts may not be quite as American as, say, apple pie, but they come close enough to make Samir Nasier, a Saudi fast-food king, nervous. 
 So nervous, in fact, that Mr. Nasier and his brothers are offering roughly $300,000 to anyone who can prove that their House of Donuts chain has any connection to the United States. 
 For good measure, their slogan "the American pastry" is being jettisoned, with Mr. Nasier musing aloud that doughnuts might qualify as traditional Saudi fare, given that he started making them 21 years ago. 
"We share the same outraged feelings of the Saudi public toward the attitude of the American administration," Mr. Nasier said, speaking by telephone from the Jidda headquarters of his 180-outlet chain. "We are deleting anything that relates to America." 
American support for Israel, especially during its recent military offensive in the occupied territories, is driving a grass-roots effort to boycott American products throughout the Arab world. With word spread via the Internet, mosque sermons, fliers and even mobile phone messages, the boycott seems to be slowly gathering force, especially against consumer products.
Purchases of American goods generated by 300 million Arabs form such a small part of American exports that even a widespread boycott would not cause much of a blip. Most trade consists of big ticket items like airplanes, with total American exports to the Middle East amounting to $20 billion in 2000, just 2.5 percent of America's total exports.
But a long boycott could retard the spread of franchises and other products, experts say. Sales at most American fast-food outlets in the Arab world are already off somewhere between 20 and 30 percent on average, American diplomats and industry analysts say, and consumer products face a similar decline. 
The boycotts have largely been the effort of individuals and small groups without government involvement, like student organizations and such civic organizations as are allowed to exist. They reflect a growing sentiment that Arabs should distance themselves from the United States, and they want their governments to do likewise. 
"They are beginning to feel that shouting slogans in reaction to what the U.S. is doing is not enough," said Kamal Hamdan, a Lebanese economist. A Marlboro smoker, he said that whenever he pulls out a packet, somebody invariably now reproaches him with, "What, still smoking American cigarettes?" 
He went on: "They want to design detailed programs against specific goods and services that might involve the banking system, insurance, financial markets. They want to find some pressure points that can have an economic impact." 
The attitude is everywhere. Scores of lists circulate suggesting non-American substitutes for things like Lays potato chips and Head & Shoulders shampoo. The research does not always seem that rigorous; Domino's Pizza was listed as non-American on one list apparently on the strength of sounding Italian. 
Al Montazah, a supermarket chain in Bahrain, enforced the boycott on all its roughly 10,000 daily customers by replacing some 1,000 American products with alternatives. A few parents lacking Pampers diapers grumbled, but Abdulmonem al-Meer, the general manager, said the move had boosted sales at some stores. 
"I know it will not do much in terms of putting pressure on the American government, but whatever I can do I should do," Mr. Meer said. 
The boycott calls have thus far prompted little violence toward American companies, although an empty Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet in the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli was bombed overnight Thursday. 
Even places like Syria, where American products have long been barred, are trying to get into the act. Billboards around Damascus show horrific scenes of Israeli troops razing Jenin refugee camp, with the slogan, "Boycott American products -- Don't be an accomplice," in Arabic and English. 
"No Americans Allowed," reads a yardlong wooden sign in the window of Mondo restaurant, incongruously an American-style diner decorated with icons like the Statue of Liberty. "The American people should feel that they have a problem," said Ahmed Diab, the 38-year-old owner. 
The Arabs established a boycott office in Damascus in 1951 against companies that did business with Israel, and that kept products like Coca-Cola and Ford vehicles out of the Middle East for decades. But it gradually faded as major markets like Egypt signed a peace treaty with Israel. 
Boycott support in the region's government-run newspapers has been almost universal, although outright endorsements by senior officials have been rare, given that it could hurt foreign investment. The Syrian government is among the few encouraging the boycott. 
More typical is a speech by Sheika Fatima al-Nahyan, the wife of the ruler of Ajman in the United Arab Emirates, telling a women's group, "Start by boycotting all makeup and clothes made by the enemies and prevent children from buying their products, too."
The idea has gained the whole-hearted support of many religious figures, with myriad Friday prayer sermons devoted to the issue. Worshipers at one Jidda mosque were so fired up when they emerged that they converged on a hapless grocer next door to demand that he tear down a Coke sign. He demurred. 
Sheik Yusuf al-Qaradawi, the influential Muslim cleric on Al Jazeera satellite network, displays a blinking banner on his Web site that reads, "Boycott America from Pepsi cans to Boeing." 
Indeed, the flood of e-mail and Web sites sets this effort apart from all previous ones. Calls for boycotting three American corporations -- McDonald's, Starbucks and Microsoft -- gained rapid momentum through the Internet. 
In the case of McDonald's, the rumor erupted that it donated a part of every meal's cost to Israel. Local franchises from Morocco to the Persian Gulf issued statements denying it, stressing that they were locally owned and operated. The Lebanese McDonald's even paid for an instant message to be flashed on 60,000 cellphones, but in some cases the damage had been done. 
After a McDonald's opened a year ago at the end of her street in Taif, Saudi Arabia, Lama Muhammad's 5-year-old daughter insisted on one Happy Meal a day. But recently she started watching the news with her mother. "I told her we are not supposed to buy from there because they support Israel," her mother said. The child has not asked for a Happy Meal since. Saudi parents report that their children vie in the schoolyard to list all the American things they avoid. 
In the case of Microsoft and Starbucks, word bombarded across the Internet after the Israeli Microsoft branch sponsored a billboard supporting the Israeli Army, as did remarks reportedly made by Howard Schultz, chairman of Starbucks, at his Seattle synagogue. 
A local news article forwarded endlessly quoted him as saying that Jews needed to confront rising anti-Semitism worldwide and that the Palestinians needed to do more to fight terrorism. The remarks about the Palestinians prompted the boycott call, even though the company issued two statements saying Mr. Schultz did not believe terrorism was representative of the Palestinian people and that he thought Israeli and Palestinian states should live together peacefully. 
"Everybody is addicted to Starbucks -- it's the hip place," said Kholood Khatami, a 25-year-old Saudi journalist. "It's not empty, but it is not as crowded as it used to be. I'm boycotting. Of course, there are some things you cannot avoid -- technology and software is all American." 
Many companies, especially fast-food restaurants, are fighting back with huge advertising campaigns saying the boycott will only hurt locals. Burger King, in a typical advertisement this week in Saudi Arabia, pointed out that it bought everything from bread to lettuce to mayonnaise from Saudi producers.
Others with American products like Kellogg's breakfast cereal or Hershey's chocolate are hoping that the United States will change its Middle East policy fast enough for old consumer habits to return. 
"Our sales are suffering, but I am not concerned about the loss of sales," said Sheik Wahib S. Binzagr, the patriarch of a Jidda merchant family that has imported a wide variety of American goods for decades. He was nonplused to find the clan's own name on the boycott list. 
"I laugh from desperation because I cannot do anything about it," he said. "There is damage, and I think efforts should be mobilized to rectify the bad relationship, and then the other things will correct themselves."

HEADLINE: Fed Releases March 19 Minutes 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 9 

 BODY:
Federal Reserve officials saw "strong evidence" that the economy was recovering from recession at their March 19 policy meeting and sent a signal to investors that interest rates would have to rise at some point, minutes of the meeting showed today.
 The rebound in growth allowed members of the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee to shift their assessment of risks to the economy to neutral, from concern about weakness, even as they left the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks at a 40-year low of 1.75 percent. 
 "Members commented that the decidedly positive information received over the inter-meeting period provided strong evidence that an economic recovery was under way," the minutes show. "Economic activity was expanding briskly in the early months of the year after having turned up and increased modestly in the fourth quarter."
In a statement released after the March 19 meeting, members of the committee said monetary policy was "currently accommodative." According to the minutes, that phrase was a deliberate signal to financial markets. "A reference to the committee's currently accommodative policy stance in the press announcement to be issued shortly after this meeting would alert the public to the need to firm policy at some point in the future," the minutes show.
According to the minutes, as the members "gained confidence that the recovery was becoming better entrenched," interest rates would have to rise "to provide less stimulus" to the economy.
F.O.M.C. members said the "neutral" stance they were taking "did not preclude" a move to higher interest rates should it seem warranted by evolving conditions.

HEADLINE: Reimagining A Downtown 

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
For urban planners and elected officials, the destruction of the World Trade Center has provided an almost unfathomable opportunity to reconsider and reshape the future of one of the most distinctive neighborhoods in the world: 16 acres of land in the heart of downtown Manhattan.
 And with the site virtually cleared, some officials are speaking of bold strokes and grand opportunities in describing a vision for a new downtown, a sweep of land that, from this ambitious perspective, starts at Chambers Street and extends south to the tip of Manhattan Island and from river to river. 
 "We're going to make Lower Manhattan a far stronger and better community in every sense than it was on the morning of Sept. 11," Gov. George E. Pataki said in an interview. Carl Weisbrod, president of the Alliance for Downtown New York, said the events of Sept. 11 "took the lid off downtown's potential." 
Still, for all this language of transformation and opportunity, the contours of a reconfigured downtown that are emerging, as described in conversations with political and civic leaders over the past two weeks, are notable more for their caution and adherence to tradition than for any attempt at innovation or experiment.
For better or for worse, there is no talk, for example, of using the hand of government to push the frontier of conventional urban planning, or to distinguish downtown with a pioneering if unconventional work of architecture. Instead, the emerging consensus would permit Lower Manhattan to continue along the tracks of transition that it was following well before the attack.
Many decisions remain to be worked out, including the precise mix and density of residential development and offices. But the overall vision, as described by everyone from community leaders to planners to Mr. Pataki and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, is of Lower Manhattan as a neighborhood of office buildings, to reclaim corporations that fled the area; apartments and converted lofts, to accommodate a growing residential population; and stores and restaurants, to ensure a lively neighborhood presence after dark. 
The most distinctive element in the mix would be the memorial erected to the victims of the attack, and consequently the way the neighborhood adjusts in its transformation to, inevitably, one of the most visited historical sites in the nation.
It is a matter of debate whether this conservatism is a good thing or not, whether a city that has been so traumatized would want to embark on any kind of experiment in urban planning at this of all places, and at this of all times.
There are, on one hand, some people who suggest that if this really is an opportunity -- the cleared plot of land surrounded by downtown skyscrapers is twice the size of Bryant Park -- it may someday be remembered as a missed one. 
But the extent to which there is already agreement about the broad picture is striking. And while there are surely some political considerations at play -- Mr. Pataki is not particularly eager for a fight over this site in the midst of his re-election campaign -- it seems clear that the most powerful force here is the common judgment of elected officials, community leaders and planners that this is the ideal and natural way to develop the tip of Manhattan.
"You shouldn't be surprised that there is a broad consensus," Mr. Bloomberg said in an interview yesterday. "All the city planners have been saying the same thing. And it makes sense."
Louis R. Tomson, president of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, said that when he attended a meeting of the local community board in January, "there was a great uniformity of outlook, even then."
"There is a common feeling of all the people down here," he said, "that after all the years that this was talked about as a vibrant 24-hour community, and a lot of people came down here seeking that, that it really was not."
In fact, many city planners suggested that the tragedy of last fall had in many ways eased the transformation that urban planners had foreseen for decades. Given its sheer bulk and windswept isolation, the trade center had long been viewed as an obstacle to the kind of downtown that planners had been envisioning for more than 10 years.
"It may be blasphemous to say, but the World Trade Center was an anachronism both in scale and the architecture it represented," said Meyer S. Frucher, former president of the Battery Park City Authority.
It is notable that one of the first decisions about how to prepare the area for development was one to rectify what many people saw as an unfortunate byproduct of constructing the towers: the elimination of the street grid. And two other critical moves that are now being examined -- burying West Street, and bringing commuter rail lines from either Long Island or Westchester into the financial district -- have gone from being far-fetched planning exercises of the 1990's to realistic possibilities.
"The issues that we focused on in '92 are very much the issues that we are focusing on today," said Richard L. Schaffer, who was chairman of the City Planning Commission when it issued a plan for developing Lower Manhattan in 1992. "When we looked at it in 1992, we saw that the transportation issues, the broader infrastructure issues, were critical."
"Obviously, you weren't going to get the grid driven through the World Trade Center while it existed," Mr. Schaffer continued. "Some of these things were just prohibited by cost. But now, you have a cleared site."
Immediately after the attack, some spoke about simply rebuilding what had been destroyed, and of protecting the continued existence of New York's financial district. But in truth, it has been a long time since the financial district could rightfully claim to be the financial district of New York. Businesses had been settling in Midtown since the opening of Grand Central Terminal and Pennsylvania Station, to accommodate commuters from the suburbs.
"A cynic would say, 'What are you talking about, rebuilding?' " said Mr. Bloomberg, whose own corporate headquarters is at Park Avenue and 59th Street. "It wasn't really there before."
And if Lower Manhattan was losing its distinction as the city's financial district before the attack, the number of people who were making Lower Manhattan a place to live had been rising. In 1970, it was home to a mere 833 people; as of September, its population was 25,000. The residential population in Lower Manhattan jumped 60 percent over the past six years alone.
If there are disagreements in the future -- and surely, there will be some -- they will be on the margins: the precise balance between office and residential development.
Even here, though, there is general agreement between what might seem to be potential adversaries.
"I don't think we should look at just replacement of commercial space," said Madelyn G. Wils, the chairwoman of Community Board 1. "I think we should absolutely look at more residential."
Charles A. Gargano, vice chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and New York's top economic development official, said that while he expected that the vast majority of the buildings on the site itself would be office space, there would be nowhere near the number of square feet there was before.
Similarly, government leaders are talking about the mix of businesses in a reconfigured downtown New York. Gifford Miller, the speaker of the City Council, said, "Part of the city's fiscal problems is that we're run so cyclically on the basis of the financial sector, and we ought to be making a commitment to new types of industries, so we have a broader base and a more stable overall economic structure."
For many planners, these are relatively minor concerns, which will be resolved less by the city than by the marketplace. For them, the real question is what, if anything, New York might or should do to shape its future. "This is the kind of thing that happened in Chicago in the 1870's when the fire burned it down: It gives you a chance to think afresh," said John H. Mollenkopf, director of the City University of New York's Center for Urban Research.
The question, though, is whether anyone in this still very shaken city is ready to seize the opportunity.

Andersen Prosecutors Accused of Intimidation
A lawyer for Arthur Andersen accused federal prosecutors of trying to intimidate at least three witnesses by threatening them with indictment and said he would submit an immediate request to the Justice Department for an investigation.
 The accusation came after a day of hearings during which prosecutors disclosed that an Andersen partner had told an Enron lawyer in December that he had deleted e-mail messages, an indication that Andersen knew about the destruction of records weeks earlier than previously believed. Page C2. 

The warning that Sherron Watkins wrote about Enron's accounting practices has made her a celebrity. For now, Ms. Watkins remains an Enron vice president. But she is tip-toeing toward public life, a la Erin Brockovich. A1.

HEADLINE: U.N. Forum Stalls on Sex Education and Abortion Rights 

BYLINE:  By SOMINI SENGUPTA 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 9 

 BODY:
Differences over abortion and sex education continued to distance the Bush administration from many of the other delegates to a General Assembly Special Session on Children today, complicating efforts to draft a final declaration due on Friday.
 Delegates prepared to negotiate through the night to meet the deadline for a document that outlines goals and standards on issues ranging from child labor to immunizations. The three-day session is the General Assembly's first devoted exclusively to children. 
 Sex has proved the most contentious topic. The United States delegation, upholding the White House stance against abortion, seeks to amend language arrived at in previous United Nations conferences so that it excludes abortion from the menu of reproductive health services offered to teenagers. 
Since in some countries abortion is one of a range of basic health services while in others it is against the law, language from previous conferences contained no proscriptions against it, holding only that in countries where the service is legal, it ought to be safe.
During the negotiations over wording, American officials have pressed for specificity -- demanding, for instance, that the term "reproductive health services" be annotated to exclude abortion. In this they are joined by the Vatican, as well as several Islamic nations, from Iran to Pakistan. On the opposing side are delegates representing the European Union, as well as countries in Latin America, Africa and Asia.
The American delegation has also pressed for language promoting abstinence for unmarried youths. The delegation's head, the Bush administration's secretary for health and human services, says abstinence is "the only sure way of avoiding sexually transmitted disease, premature pregnancy and the social and personal difficulties attendant to nonmarital sexual activity." 
Critics accused the United States of trying to withhold life-saving tips about sexually transmitted diseases, including H.I.V., which is swiftly spreading among the young, particularly in the developing world. 
"We are really stuck," said Eveline Herfkens, the Dutch development minister, "because one or two governments -- one of them this country -- wants to renegotiate commitments we made in previous conferences. Others, like us, feel it's unacceptable. I feel it's irresponsible."
The European Union delegation, as well as those from many Asian, African and Latin American countries, favors maintaining earlier language. "I think we should keep all the agreements we have done so far," the Finnish president, Tarja Halonen, said at a briefing with reporters this afternoon. "This special session is supposed to take steps forward." 
Responding to the criticism this afternoon, an American official said, "We are trying to lead the world."
The official added that the American delegation had pressed for stronger language on child pornography and prostitution -- efforts that he contended had been drowned out by attention to the abortion fight.
Negotiations were expected to continue until consensus is reached. "It's a countdown now," said Dirk Rotenberg, spokesman for the German mission to the United Nations. "No one is allowed to go home. If we reach a text no one is happy with, that would be a good compromise." Germany is leading the negotiations.
Though sex dominated the closed-door debates over the conference document, the dozens of panels, briefings and luncheons here took up a range of equally important and sometimes bitterly contested issues. Arab nations pushed for a resolution declaring that children in Israeli-occupied territories remained "deprived of many basic rights"; a senior Israeli official shot back by accusing Palestinians of recruiting teenagers as suicide bombers.
The United Nations high commissioner for refugees, Ruud Lubbers, used the occasion to highlight his office's efforts to combat reported sexual exploitation of refugee children by relief workers. The reports have emerged recently from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, where interviews indicate that some aid workers exchanged food rations for sex with children. An investigation into these reports is continuing. Mr. Lubbers said this morning that one way the agency was combating the problem was by having only women distribute food rations. 
Perhaps one of the most poignant and politely contentious sessions was one in which African children sat face to face with representatives of their governments. "We must put an end to this demagoguery," a 15-year-old from Mali, Adam Maiga, told a room packed with heads of state. "You have parliaments, but they are used as democratic decorations."
Joseph Tamale, 12, from Uganda, lit into the group on debt servicing. Who will pay those big loans when they come due in 20 or 30 years? asked Joseph, a boy with braces, swimming inside his denim jacket. "It will be us," he answered. "And we have nothing to pay them with, because when you get the money, you embezzle it, you eat it." 
Gael Mbemba, 17, from Chad, begged them, his hands bouncing off the table in front, to carry out their promises back home. If you want to set up schools, he told them bluntly, make sure you have a teacher, a library. The promises of the past, he added, had left him disenchanted. "The result is not what you said, which is we are worried," Gael told them. "Listen to the children not with your ears, but with your hearts."

HEADLINE: ON PRO BASKETBALL; 
Picking Sides Can Be Too Easy

BYLINE:  By Mike Wise 

DATELINE: DALLAS 

 BODY:
The news conferences came within 48 hours of each other, from divergent places in the N.B.A.
 In Philadelphia, Allen Iverson, the league's reigning most valuable player until yesterday afternoon, vented on Tuesday, going on a profane, Tysonesque rant about company loyalty and how tough it is to be a millionaire basketball player walking in customized Reeboks. 
 Tim Duncan, this year's M.V.P., held the trophy aloft yesterday in San Antonio, smiled, humbly thanked his teammates and went about his business of trying to contain Goliath, Shaquille O'Neal and the Los Angeles Lakers.
Two faces of the N.B.A., held up for public inspection. Bad guy/good guy, the ground floor of sports-star perception. Just like a Western movie, you can root for and against someone. It's almost too easy. 
More complex and harder to grasp is the difference between this year's and last year's M.V.P. Winning is such an effective deodorant, covering up the odor of a missed practice or 20 in Philadelphia just as easily as it makes people embrace a plain vanilla All-Star in the small Southwestern market of San Antonio.
Once expectations go unfulfilled, you get something like the bizarre 30-minute news conference Iverson used to defend himself from criticism leveled by his coach, Larry Brown, who among other things wanted Iverson to attend more practices.
"I'm supposed to be the franchise player and we're in here talking about practice," Iverson said, his edginess growing each time he said the word "practice." "Not a game, we're talking about practice. How silly is that?"
In response, Brown replied, "He mentioned the word practice more than he attended it this year."
Would Iverson or Brown be sniping at each other if Philadelphia was still playing?
Winning made Iverson's misogynistic rap lyrics less of an enticing story. He was not so different when the 76ers began their improbable run to the finals a year ago. There were just more reasons to like him, to allow him into the mainstream because he played so hard and his team won. In the parking lot of the First Union Center a year ago, you could pay someone to put cornrows in your hair -- just like Allen.
Winning made us see what we want to see about Duncan, too. The quiet, demure center of the Spurs who plays the game that time forgot. Little jump hooks. The bank shot from 18 feet. Using both hands to rebound! So much simplicity in his game -- an economy of movement for every young big man to behold.
Duncan, as the perception held, was not a creature of the A.A.U. world, shuttled off to sneaker-sponsored summer tournaments (read: cattle calls) by street agents posing as coaches. He did not act like it was his birthright to play in the N.B.A. He felt privileged. He was the purist who stayed at Wake Forest for four years.
To this day, he neither taunts nor preens after dunking over someone. He merely trots mechanically back downcourt, unemotionally. Spock in hightops. With his actions and demeanor, he basically tells his shipmates, "The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. Even the one."
A.I.? The cat with the doo-rag and the seating posture of one of Gabe Kaplan's sweathogs, every punk kid you knew in 10th grade. Platinum-and-diamond rope. Baggy denim jeans. The counterculture black youth, another N.B.A. rebel without a clue. Until he started winning, Iverson was seen as the cutting protest to Duncan, the fundamentally sound, whitewashed and more palatable star.
The reality is, if Duncan were putting up the same numbers on a bad team, he would be a nice player with a quirky, introverted personality, whom few people outside his family and maybe his teammates would care to know much about.
Little-known facts: Duncan has tattoos and a pierced tongue and he is one of most uncooperative players when it comes to interviews. It's not a big deal. He does not fit the profile, so that part of him is left unexamined.
Iverson unplugged was not a pretty sight on Tuesday. You almost wanted the cameraman to stop filming, and the morbid curiosity to end.
"It seemed to me that was a young kid reaching out for help," Brown said of Iverson's meltdown.
Yes, and an old coach knows he can easily win a public-relations war against an emotional 26-year-old. Iverson's outburst almost gives Brown an alibi in case he wants to step down. You wonder if Brown had kept his criticism in-house if any of this would have happened. 
In San Antonio, Duncan, Mr. Embodiment of the Good and Right N.B.A. player, did attend practice today.
It is almost too easy, painting last year's winner and this year's winner into a black-and-white corner, unfettered with gray.

HEADLINE: Technology Briefing Software: XBox Developers Plan Games Venture 

BYLINE:  By Chris Gaither (NYT) (Compiled by Alan Krauss) 

 BODY:
 Two software programmers who left Microsoft after spearheading the introduction of its Xbox video game console have reunited in a start-up games company. Seamus Blackley and Kevin Bachus plan to introduce today their new venture, the Capital Entertainment Group, which will function much like a Hollywood film producer for early-stage game projects. 
The company, based in Seattle, is raising more than $40 million from investors like the Durlacher Corporation to finance creative games "that wouldn't otherwise get made," said Mr. Blackley, the company's vice president for development. Capital Entertainment will advise game developers, then seek marketing and distribution contracts with publishers. It will focus on games for the Xbox, he said, but will take on projects for any console or the personal computer. The company plans to announce its first development partnership today, with the publisher Sega of America. Chris Gaither (NYT)

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Europe: Britain: Rates Held Steady 

BYLINE:  By Suzanne Kapner (NYT) 

 BODY:
 The monetary policy committee of the Bank of England voted yesterday to keep interest rates at 4 percent, joining the United States Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank in their decisions to keep rates even until the economic recovery gains strength. Britain's economy grew at the slowest pace in a decade in the first quarter. Consumer spending, accounting for about two-thirds of the gross domestic product, has compensated for one of the worst slides in factory production in decades. If the economic recovery continues to gather steam, a rate increase is still possible later in the year, analysts said. The Bank of England last reduced rates on Nov. 8, by half a percentage point, after six reductions earlier in 2001.

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Europe: Italy: Pirelli Posts A Loss 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
 Pirelli, a leading maker of fiber optic cable, posted a second consecutive quarterly loss as a recession in the United States hurt its sales. 
Pirelli lost 37 million euros ($33.5 million) in the first quarter, down from a profit of 149 million euros a year earlier. Sales of energy cable fell, and sales of tires rose slightly. The chairman of Pirelli, Marco Tronchetti Provera, said he expected earnings before interest, taxes and one-time items to rise an average of 25 percent a year through 2004. Mr. Provera also said that a recovery in the telecommunications sector was unlikely this year and that the company had cut costs by 200 million euros this year.

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing Connecticut: Hartford: Governor Criticized For Ads 

BYLINE:  By Paul Zielbauer (NYT) (Compiled by Yilu Zhao) 

 BODY:
 A government watchdog group criticized Gov. John G. Rowland yesterday for allowing state tourism officials to spend millions of taxpayer dollars since 1999 to produce television ads featuring Mr. Rowland. 
Common Cause Connecticut said the Department of Economic and Community Development spent $2.5 million in public funds from 1999 to 2001 for ads promoting the state and featuring Mr. Rowland, who is up for re-election in November. Chris Cooper, Mr. Rowland's press secretary, said tourism officials asked the governor to appear in the ads, which Mr. Cooper said had helped increase tourism. Paul Zielbauer (NYT)

Beauty in the Eye Of the Key Holder

BYLINE:  By PHIL PATTON 

 BODY:
IN April, casual strollers along Park Avenue near 38th Street in Manhattan found themselves stopping to press their faces to the glass wall of Scandinavia House, a showcase for art and designs from Sweden, Norway and Denmark. What they saw, for the first time, was Saab's futuristic 9X concept vehicle, on display inside. 
 Even long-time Saab owners might be taken aback by the 9X. On the new model, a powerful V-6 engine drives all four wheels, and the bucket seats are backed by generous storage space. The total length is shorter than Saab's earlier 9-5 model. From the front, the 9X plays a trick on the eye -- it looks larger than it really is but seems to have less rear cargo space than it actually does. 
 The 9X is part sports coupe and part S.U.V., with a little bit of pickup truck thrown in. "The Saab 9X shows that the traditional way of classifying products is dead," said Michael Mauer, Saab's executive director of design. "It is no longer enough to have a vehicle that is good at satisfying just one role." 
Saab has been taking the 9X and its sibling, the 93X, around to car shows and other venues to gauge consumers' reactions. Saab hopes that the cars will help it reverse the pattern of recent sales slumps and recover its reputation for quirky, innovative design. The 9X was first shown at the Frankfurt Auto Show in September 2001 and won the Best Concept of the Year award at the Geneva show this spring. The 93X stunned American designers when it showed up in Detroit in January. 
The concept cars have also raised the hopes of Saab owners, who tend to be fervent fans of the company. Many proud Saab owners have displayed bumper stickers saying, "Made by Trolls in Trollhattan," a slogan that refers not only to the company's Swedish hometown but also to the offbeat quality of those who designed and built the cars.
Saab's quirks have usually been smart ideas that looked strange, like the five-door arrangement that provided the 900 with generous interior space. Saab turbocharged small-displacement engines to mix economy and oomph for socially conscious yuppies, and many other makers now emulate that approach. Saab also bucked a trend by continuing the production of convertibles in the late 1970's after the industry declared them dead. But then, what else could one expect from a company that once hired Kurt Vonnegut as a salesman? (He worked in a Cape Cod franchise in the early 1960's.) 
Saab quirkiness is often said to stem from the company's origins as an aircraft builder: the name stems from Svenska Aeroplan AktieBolaget, or Swedish Airplane Company. Even Saab's airplanes were quirky. They had canards, horizonal stabilizers, in front instead of on the tail, and unconventional propellers that faced the rear. Although it is no longer affiliated with the makers of Swedish fighter planes, Saab continues to design cars with cockpit-style wraparound windshields, noticeable on both the 9X and 93X. The 9X's squared-off rear window was inspired by the 1943 J-21 airplane, although it is more likely to bring the Studebaker to mind for most Americans. 
In the cockpitlike interiors of both the Saab concept cars, the seats seem to float, and the dash appears to hover on bands of blue light inspired, the company says, by the northern lights. The tailgate folds down and slides out, like a drawer, to provide extended cargo space. Two roof panels can be adjusted to make space for tall cargo, like bicycles. A tie-down system, borrowed from the anchoring rails for airline seats, allows for a variety of cargo attachments.
"Saab has lots of icons of the past," said Ola Granlund, the exterior designer of the 9X, "but it needed one for its future. This is a car that doesn't just say, 'I'm a Saab,' but, 'I'm a Saab -- get out of my way.' " 
The 9X's visit to Park Avenue was not the last stop on a tour. As part of its publicity effort, Saab has been showing off the car to target groups. One included Hollywood celebrities at a post-Oscar party. Another included National Public Radio listeners. "The overlap in their demographic with ours is almost total," said Steve Smith, a Saab publicist. That should come as no surprise for a group of car owners who, according to a 1972 survey, gave 98 percent of their votes to George McGovern. 
But as powerful as the affection for Saabs can be, the company has learned to expect the opposite reaction as well. 
"A new Saab should be polarizing," Mr. Granlund said. "It should not be love at first sight. Your eye has to work on it for a while. If you fall in love with a car at first sight, you'll get bored with it before long."

HEADLINE: Credit Rating Of WorldCom Is Cut to Junk 

BYLINE:  By SIMON ROMERO and JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
WorldCom's credit rating was cut below investment grade yesterday by Moody's Investors Service, but the company narrowly averted a cash squeeze by securing a waiver from its lenders that allows it to have access to an important borrowing program.
 Still, the downgrade by Moody's, which was followed by a similar cut by Fitch Ratings, fueled concern among investors yesterday. Difficulties at WorldCom, the nation's second-largest long-distance carrier, after AT&T, are expected to lead to greater uncertainty in the troubled telecommunications industry. 
 Companies like WorldCom and Global Crossing, which filed for bankruptcy protection in January, borrowed huge amounts of money in recent years to finance expansion plans that ultimately resulted in a glut of unused capacity on communications networks. Ensuing price declines for communications services have hurt these companies' prospects. 
Moreover, WorldCom's troubles are reverberating through the corporate bond market. In addition to raising investor concerns about risk, the downgrade will force many mutual funds to sell WorldCom bonds out of their investment-grade corporate bond funds.
The waiver, negotiated in recent days by WorldCom's banks and a new management team led by John W. Sidgmore, who replaced Bernard J. Ebbers last week as chief executive, prevents lenders from limiting access to $2 billion of financing backed by revenue from phone bills. 
"This is a positive outcome, but some questions remain," said Anthony Klarman, a debt analyst at Deutsche Bank. 
WorldCom's banks are apparently limiting their exposure to the company in return for the waiver. WorldCom said it planned to replace the financing with a $1.5 billion program, or $500 million less than the existing financing line. The new borrowing program may also be more expensive for WorldCom, debt analysts said.
WorldCom expects to secure the new financing by May 23, when the current waiver expires. Even after the waiver and the downgrade, Moody's remains more optimistic about WorldCom's future than several debt analysts, including Egan-Jones, a debt rating company based in Philadelphia. 
"We estimate that WorldCom's operating earnings will fall below its interest obligations within six months," said Sean Egan, managing partner of the company, which rates WorldCom bonds lower than Moody's. Moody's reduced WorldCom's debt yesterday by three levels, to Ba2, the second-highest junk bond rating, from Baa2, the second-lowest investment grade rating. 
In trading yesterday, WorldCom bonds fell sharply after the Moody's announcement but then rebounded a little after the company announced its waiver. The price of the 7.5 percent bond, which was sold last May and matures in 2011, fell as low as 43 cents on the dollar, from about 48 cents in late trading Wednesday. But after the news from WorldCom, the price moved up to about 45 cents, traders said.
Yesterday's downgrade -- and one two weeks ago -- has had a significant effect on the corporate bond market. "This has set such a negative tone for the corporate investment-grade market," said William Cunningham, director of credit strategy at J. P. Morgan. "Money managers have no tolerance for risk," he said, because WorldCom and other telecommunications issues "have destroyed people's years."
Many factors will determine whether there is continued downward pressure on the price of WorldCom's bonds, which total about $32 billion in face value.
First, the move to junk bond status will force many mutual funds to sell WorldCom bonds out of their investment-grade corporate bond funds. In addition, WorldCom will be removed from the leading indexes for investment-grade corporate bonds.
Lehman Brothers will remove $21.8 billion of WorldCom bonds, from 18 different issues, from its United States Aggregate Index at the end of the month. Some money managers and funds who follow the index will have to do the same.
It is hard, however, to tell how much selling this will produce. The Vanguard bond index funds, which follow the Lehman index, had $165 million of WorldCom bonds at the end of last year. But John Demming, a spokesman, said that the fund manager "does not have to buy or sell what is in the index." Instead, the manager samples the risk of the bonds in the index and decides which ones to buy or sell. Mr. Demming would not say whether a decision on WorldCom bonds had been made.
At the same time, there might be some pressure to buy WorldCom as it is added to high-yield or junk bond indexes. When Lehman puts the WorldCom bonds into its high-yield index, they will make up 3.7 percent of the index, a vastly larger share than the 0.17 percent share they had in the investment-grade index.
William Cunningham, director of credit strategy at J. P. Morgan, said he did not expect too much more downward pressure because he thought that most of those who would have to sell had already done so because it was clear that Worldcom would fall to junk bond status. He also said that some of the insurance companies owning WorldCom had held onto the bonds and could choose to move them into high-yield funds instead of selling them.
But, he said, he also does not think that many high-yield managers will feel forced to buy the bonds now that they are junk.
Another analyst, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified, said, "A lot of people are pretty scared of the name." The downgrade was not a surprise, this analyst said. But he said the timing and the magnitude "caught the market off guard." 
Scott D. Sullivan, WorldCom's chief financial officer, said in a conference call yesterday that he and other executives spoke with representatives from Moody's for more than three hours on Tuesday in an ultimately unsuccessful effort to discourage the rating agency from proceeding with the downgrade.

HEADLINE: How Arafat Fits Into the Arab World 

BYLINE:  By Lisa Anderson; Lisa Anderson is dean of the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University.

 BODY:
As the prospect of an international conference on the Arab-Israeli dispute becomes increasingly likely, both the Bush administration and the government of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon face coming to terms with a Palestinian leader they can neither abide nor avoid. What is it about Yasir Arafat that makes him so troubling to the United States and Israel? In fact, the problem is not the man himself, as Mr. Sharon and President Bush seem to think, but the political position of the Palestinians in the Arab world today.
 Despite their recent calls for democratic institutions for the Palestinians, American officials' disquiet about Mr. Arafat does not seem to be caused by concern about the corrupt and authoritarian regime he installed in the Palestinian Authority. After all, Mr. Arafat merely mimics the governments of many of America's closest allies in the Middle East. 
 Is Mr. Arafat disingenuous, as many argue, saying different things in different languages, with reasonable and peace-loving English rhetoric giving way to an intolerant and hate-filled vocabulary in Arabic? This seems unlikely. He knows perfectly well that both his supporters and his opponents can translate. Moreover, his recent, widely quoted outburst in English -- calling the perpetrators of the siege of the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem terrorists, Nazis and racists -- suggests that he feels no compunction about expressing himself candidly.
Mr. Arafat's problem -- and that of all who contend with him -- is that he is expected to be a statesman without a state -- an inevitably two-sided position. Sometimes he takes on the demeanor of his counterparts among the Arab rulers, deferential to the international norms and interests that contribute to keeping him in power, and sometimes he adopts the role of an opposition, railing against the same international norms and interests that also deprive him of the status the rulers enjoy. He has negotiated for his people, but he is also associated with militant protest that grasps for power without negotiation.
This two-sidedness reflects the nature of politics in the Arab world, where there there are two powerful forces: the ruling circles on the inside and the economic and political arrangements at the margin.
Over five decades of state building, the rulers of the Arab world hijacked nationalist aspirations and suppressed independent economic activities and politics. Helped by exceptional external revenues -- foreign aid, oil income, loans -- they built extensive and elaborate states while neglecting domestic concerns like education and social welfare. Now these states seem muscle-bound, paralyzed by their own overreaching and by their centralized organization.
Outside their influence, the ill-educated and underemployed young people produced by decades of their negligent social policy constitute the backbone of informal economies that sustain the millions of officially unemployed. From the smugglers at the borders and the street vendors in the cities to the migrants looking for a future in London, Marseille, Hamburg and Kabul, millions of young people in the Arab world have embraced globalization with an enthusiasm -- or desperation -- that far outstripped the commitment of their governments. And this group also provides the recruiting ground for political groups operating outside governmental control and across borders -- every militia, guerrilla group and armed salvation front from Lebanon to Algeria, Palestine to Sudan.
In the meantime, the rulers draw on increasingly narrow pools of talent -- family, military insiders, cronies -- to manage governments with little public orientation. They rule increasingly restive populations mostly born after the rulers came to power.
Since the moment of his election as the chairman of the Palestinian Authority, Mr. Arafat has given every indication of wanting to join the ranks of the Arab rulers. He shows no aspirations to be an institutional innovator. For better or worse, he seems to have taken the negligent despotism of his colleagues among the Arab regimes as his model.
But the other Arab rulers have states to rule. In this crucial respect, Mr. Arafat (like all potential Palestinian leaders) has less in common with the Arab rulers whom he wants to emulate than with the disenfranchised who make their living outside the established states, sustained by the networks of informal economies that respect no national boundaries.
In his frustration with an international system that has failed to deliver what it promised, Mr. Arafat represents the forsaken in the Arab world. Without a stake in the system, neither he nor the region's other outsiders have enough to lose to prefer negotiation over resistance. If the Bush administration and the Sharon government succeed in bypassing Mr. Arafat, they will find nothing but more Arafats behind him, for the problem is not the person but the position.

HEADLINE: The War On Terror Flounders 

BYLINE:  By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF; E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
To understand why America's war on terrorism is beginning to sputter, infiltrate the Bush administration's Bat Cave at the intersection of Intelligence Way and Cryptological Court (no, I'm not making this up) at a Navy base here. This is the brand-new homeland defense center from which America will respond to anthrax, smallpox, nuclear attack, multiple hijackings or other shoes still to drop.
 Tom Ridge, his chest puffed out with pride, showed off the command center on Wednesday to a group of reporters. You had to feel sorry for him, for it was a color-coded moment. 
 Standing in front of four 50-inch plasma television screens, Mr. Ridge hailed the super-classified capabilities of the SCIF (sensitive compartmented information facility). Unfortunately, while the television system allows simultaneous video conferencing with the White House Situation Room and the C.I.A., the huge plasma screens were devoted to television broadcasts. One of them was showing "Divorce Court." 
The command center is symptomatic of something broader: After an excellent start, the war on terrorism is floundering. 
It is not just that Osama bin Laden and the anthrax killer remain at large. Rather, it's that despite the buzz of activity -- such as doffing our shoes at airports -- we as a nation can't seem to get ahead of the curve in avoiding the next catastrophe, by taking steps such as controlling loose nukes, learning how to decontaminate after anthrax attacks, examining checked baggage, checking shipping containers and reducing the risk from states like Iraq or North Korea.
Perhaps the loss of momentum is inevitable with the passage of time, and it is true that we are registering progress in all these areas -- just not fast enough. The upshot is that we lose our fingernail clippers when we board planes, but somebody could still detonate a dirty bomb in New York City and devastate the nation's economy, or send out 100 anthrax letters around the country and close down the nation's postal system. 
Americans seem lulled by the calm since 9/11, by the new security measures in place. But remember that Al Qaeda typically spaces its attacks a year or more apart.
And as for the effectiveness of new security measures, I was sobered on my last major trip. My hotel in Sudan gave me a farewell gift of a pocket knife, and since I had only carry-on bags I assumed someone would find it and confiscate it. I stowed the knife with some care, and although I went through three international airports and my carry-on bag was X-rayed each time, no one found the knife. 
The Afghan campaign was truly a triumph, and Mr. Bush has surpassed other recent presidents in gathering smart and experienced advisers in security matters. But he refuses to send a small number of troops for a security force to sustain peace in Afghanistan, and thus the entire investment of lives and effort could be lost. Is there any explanation other than inertia to account for the United States' maintaining 47,000 troops in Japan, despite the lack of any threat there except perhaps from extraterrestrials, yet refusing to provide a few thousand troops to keep the swamp drained in Afghanistan? 
Then there's Iraq. The president's failure to engage the Arab-Israeli conflict earlier has made it much less likely that he can oust Saddam Hussein anytime soon. 
On the domestic front, let's start by giving Mr. Ridge a real job! Let's pull out his gag and allow him to speak to Congress. The White House is only belatedly realizing that the homeland defense structure needs to be revised to give him the clout of the average Washington maitre d'.
Mr. Ridge was so thrilled showing off his new command center (which, a bureaucratic flow chart helpfully explained, can facilitate meetings among the N.S.C. L.N.O., the D.O.J. U.S.B.P. and the D.O.T. F.R.A.) that it felt churlish to question him. He insisted he was getting cooperation from other agencies to staff the desks marked with names like C.I.A. and D.I.A.; it would have been more plausible if the staplers and scissors on those empty desks had been taken out of their packing. 
He kept repeating how he would be able to monitor this and monitor that. Great, but I wish that instead of monitoring the next crisis we were doing more to prevent it from happening. 
We asked Mr. Ridge if he was frustrated with his position. "I'm not authorized to be frustrated," he said gamely.
No, but we are.

HEADLINE: Tax Receipts Fall Far Short Of Predictions 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 9 

 BODY:
The Congressional Budget Office said today that tax receipts this fiscal year through April were $75 billion below its projections, ensuring that the federal budget deficit would be far larger than anticipated.
 Confirming preliminary figures that the government made public several weeks ago, the budget office said receipts were $60 billion lower than projected just in April, the month when revenues typically surge as income tax returns are filed. 
 The figures reflect the downturn in the economy, especially after Sept. 11. 
Economists said the problem appeared to stem in particular from the lackluster stock market, which generated little in the way of capital gains while also depressing compensation for people who are paid partly with stock options.
Before the shortfall became apparent, the budget office had been projecting a deficit of $46 billion for the fiscal year that ends on Sept. 30. A $75 billion shortfall would bring the deficit to $121 billion. The total federal budget this year is $2.1 trillion.
The deficit is highly likely to grow even larger by the end of the fiscal year, perhaps up to $150 billion, experts said.
Congress is working on a supplemental bill that will result in billions of dollars in additional spending this year. The Senate just sent President Bush a farm bill that will cost $1.6 billion more than initially budgeted for this year, and economists said tax revenues might continue to come in below expectations through this summer.
Should the revenue shortfall continue next year, it could depress the long-term fiscal outlook. 
Despite the recession, the costs of the campaign against terrorism and Mr. Bush's big tax cut last year, the Congressional Budget Office and the White House have been forecasting a return to a surplus in two or three years, assuming that Congress and the administration keep a tight rein on the growth of nonmilitary spending. 
A reduction in revenue forecasts could over the long run mean the disappearance of projected surpluses for much of the rest of the decade, restricting the ability of Republicans to call for further tax cuts and of Democrats to support increased spending.
"The fact that the exercise of stock options for income and the realization of capital gains violently reversed in 2001, and the fact that that was going to affect tax receipts, cannot have surprised anyone with a calculator and a newspaper," said Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at Hoenig & Company, an investment firm. "It will elicit a substantial revision in the outlook for the surplus, and we were already getting awfully close to not much left."

HEADLINE: Teams to Focus on Repeat Domestic Abuse 

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced a pilot program yesterday under which teams of workers from a number of city agencies would be assigned to help curb domestic violence in two police precincts, one in the Bronx and another in Brooklyn.
 Mr. 
Bloomberg said that the teams would work with members of households "at the greatest risk of domestic violence, those already well known to the police and to social service agencies." 
 He said that the teams would come from six city agencies: the Police Department, the Administration for Children's Services, the Human Resources Administration, the Department of Homeless Services, the Health and Hospitals Corporation and the New York City Housing Authority.
The pilot program is set to begin next month and will involve the 67th Precinct in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn and the 43rd Precinct in the Soundview section of the Bronx, where the police received more than 7,000 reports of domestic violence in each precinct last year. The focus in the first year of the pilot program will be about 150 households, based on the history of domestic violence reports in those homes.
Mr. Bloomberg said that a number of agencies would be involved because domestic violence had many causes, from frustration over unemployment to medical problems. He said the pilot program was aimed at better coordinating prevention efforts among city agencies.

HEADLINE: City's Budget Gap Could Top $6 Billion, Comptroller Says 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
New York City's budget shortfall could top $6 billion, which would make it more than a billion dollars worse than Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg projected, according to a report issued yesterday by Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr.
 Mr. Thompson also stated that much of the state and federal assistance that Mr. Bloomberg was seeking to help close the deficit in the year beginning July 1 was "not likely to occur," warning that the city could fall $456 million short of its target in that area. 
 If that were to happen, Mr. Bloomberg would have to try to carry out most of his contingency plan, which calls for $500 million in further budget cuts that he has described in the past as onerous and painful.
The contingency plan would cut school aid further, shrink the size of the Police Department more, eliminate fire companies from eight firehouses that currently hold two each, reduce garbage pickups and lay off workers.
"Washington and Albany must now stand up and realize that New York City is not crying wolf and that we need additional help," Mr. Thompson said in a statement.
Mayor Bloomberg puts the budget deficit at nearly $5 billion and has repeatedly expressed optimism that he will get the state and federal help he seeks. The mayor's aides said yesterday that they believed their projections would hold.
"While we stand by the accuracy of our analysis, the comptroller's report reminds of the severity of the city's fiscal problems," said Jordan Barowitz, a spokesman for the mayor.
Mr. Bloomberg, a Republican, wants to close the deficit by borrowing, cutting services and getting help from Washington, Albany and the unions. The City Council, which is overwhelmingly Democratic and must pass the budget in June, wants to raise the income tax and to restore a commuter tax on people who work in the city but live elsewhere.
Mr. Thompson, one of two citywide elected Democrats, calls for restoring the commuter tax but not for raising the income tax. In a speech last month, he said that other tax increases "are not the preferred course" and were unlikely to be approved in Albany.
The comptroller's report says that the budget gap will grow for two basic reasons: the city will take in less in taxes than the mayor expects because the economy will be slow to recover and the city will need to spend more than it expects on overtime, pension costs, labor contracts, public assistance and legal judgments.
The report cast doubt on the mayor's contingency plan. "It is unlikely that the city can achieve all of these savings given that some elements are unlikely to be approved by the City Council, or are programmatically undesirable," it said.

HEADLINE: Looking to Elections, Bush Plays Up Domestic Issues 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 9 

 BODY:
It was only in January that Karl Rove, President Bush's chief political strategist, was telling Republican operatives to trumpet the administration's handling of the war on terrorism as a major selling point in the November midterm elections.
 But now, in a striking readjustment driven by several recent polls, Republican strategists are warning that the war will not guarantee their party victory this fall, and President Bush has responded with a significant refocusing on what political analysts call the "Mommy issues" of his domestic agenda. 
 On Wednesday Mr. Bush talked up his education bill in Wisconsin. On Monday he did the same thing in Michigan. On Friday in Ohio and again next Monday in Illinois he is to talk of his welfare plan. Last week, Mr. Bush revisited the "compassionate conservative" theme of his presidential campaign in a speech in California. 
Mr. Bush is squeezing in the trips -- three of them in one week and two of them without his usual political fund-raisers -- among efforts in Washington at brokering peace in the Middle East. But even when he talks of international issues, the president's language often reflects compassion toward families. 
On Tuesday at the White House, as he spoke of the need to forge peace in the Middle East, Mr. Bush interjected, "I deeply hurt when there is a lack of hope for moms and dads of anybody -- Palestinian moms and dads." He added, "It bothers me to think there are some whose children are so hopeless they're willing to commit suicide."
A recent public opinion survey by the leading Republican polling company has in part alerted the White House.
"Right now, voters perceive the parties as headed toward a matchup of Republicans on taxes and terrorism versus Democrats on economy, education and the elderly," a confidential briefing by Public Opinion Strategies for Capitol Hill Republicans concluded in April. "We need more than just taxes/terrorism to win."
The poll accompanying the briefing found that 79 percent of voters rated domestic issues like taxes, health care and education as more important than international issues in deciding how they would vote for Congress this year. Conversely, the poll said that only 16 percent rated international issues, including the Bush administration's efforts to solve the Middle East crisis, as more important than domestic issues in deciding how to vote.
"That is a pretty stark and compelling number," said Geoffrey Garin, a leading Democratic pollster, who said his surveys have similar results. "The Bush administration and Congressional Republicans hoped that the politics of 2002 would be defined by the popularity of a wartime president. The reality is that voters have a very different idea."
Republicans have come to the same conclusion with a new sense of urgency about their prospects in November. Republicans, the briefing papers by Public Opinion Strategies said, "should work proactively to take away Democrat strength issues by developing offset issues" like education and health care.
"American memories last a nanosecond," said Bill McInturff, the pollster who conducted the Public Opinion Strategies survey. "We are moving beyond a world shaped by Sept. 11 into the world of a much more characteristic off-year election. Which means you have to address issues of concern here at home."
James Jordan, the executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said, "politically, the White House has no alternative."
"The data are clear -- voters will be casting their votes on domestic issues, that historically favor Democrats and will continue to do so," Mr. Jordan said.
Other Democrats cited Republican losses in governor races in Virginia and New Jersey last fall, similar to losses sustained in 1989, when President Bush's father occupied the White House, as another sign of possible electoral gains this fall. In interviews, some also said that Mr. Bush's father had appeared too focused on foreign affairs and detached from voters' domestic concerns when he lost in 1992.
At the same time, Republican and White House officials said the economy is fading as an issue of concern to voters, but that education is predominant, particularly to important swing voters like suburban women. Republicans also say that voters connect education to worries about the economic well-being of their children and the next generation.
"If you look at a lot of the polling data, and you look at public opinion about the economy, people link the issue of education to our future prosperity," a senior White House official said.
Other polls show that Mr. Bush's approval rating has slipped, but only from an extraordinary 89 percent last fall to a still remarkable 73 percent last month. Mr. McInturff's poll predicted that Mr. Bush's job approval rating would drop further, into "the very solid mid-60's" by Election Day.
Republicans said it was no accident that Mr. Bush gathered all the major domestic themes of his presidency -- from tax cuts, health care, education and welfare -- into his "compassionate conservative" speech in California, or that he spent two days this week reminding voters of his education bill, signed into law in January, that he considers one of the major achievements of his administration. The bill greatly enlarges the federal role in public education, mandates annual testing of children in grades three to eight and provides tutoring for children in failing schools. 
But the White House readily says that Mr. Bush's achievement was ignored by voters in the crush of news from overseas. "There was such bipartisan cooperation and such a small amount of bickering over the bill that it didn't garner the national headlines," said Dan Bartlett, the White House communications direction.
Mr. McInturff agreed. "No one knows about it," he said. "And so the president, who is committed to the issue, is doing what he should do. The only way you get people to notice is to talk about it. And he's got the largest megaphone in the world."
Even so, Democrats aggressively attacked Mr. Bush for a bill that they said looked good in theory but was woefully shortchanged in the president's budget. Don Kettl, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, said that Mr. Bush's education trip to Wisconsin was smart politics, particularly in a state that the president lost by a tiny margin in 2000 to Al Gore. 
"It's not a state right now that's preoccupied with foreign policy issues," Mr. Kettl said. "Sept. 11 was a long time ago. It's still in the backs of a lot of people's mind, but neither that nor the Middle East conflict are hot buttons issues for Wisconsin voters. Education is a big issue here."

HEADLINE: Companies Trim Health Benefits For Many Retirees as Costs Surge 

BYLINE:  By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
Hundreds of thousands of retired workers who used to have generous health benefits from large companies are digging deeper into their own pockets this year. Surging inflation in medical costs is draining hundreds of millions of dollars from corporate profits, and many large employers are responding by cutting back on health care benefits for retirees or requiring them to pay more for coverage. 
 The reductions in health benefits stem mainly from sudden sharp increases in employer spending on prescription drugs last year. Drugs account for 40 to 60 percent of employers' overall spending on Medicare-age retirees' health care. At the same time, far-reaching cutbacks by Medicare health maintenance organizations -- which used to provide generous benefits, including drug coverage -- are forcing employers to pay for retirees' drug coverage, since traditional Medicare does not cover the cost of most drugs. 
 As a result, current health care costs for retirees are soaring 18 percent a year, on average, according to the United States Chamber of Commerce. And large companies' liabilities for future health care costs for retirees are rising as much as 34 percent. 
Margaret Cleary, 80, who retired from the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company unit of J. P. Morgan & Company in 1986, is well aware of the effect of rising drug costs on retiree benefits. The monthly deduction for her Medicare H.M.O. from her $550 pension check jumped to $128.74 from $50 this year, she said, more than she could afford.
She dropped the H.M.O. and chose a less expensive plan even though it had no coverage for the prescription drugs she said she needed to control diabetes and problems with her blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Medicare recipients like Mrs. Cleary can select traditional Medicare coverage or join a Medicare H.M.O, where they are available.
A spokesman for J. P. Morgan Chase said a retiree in her position could have selected a new company-subsidized policy that would cover only drugs, instead of the more comprehensive coverage she had. But Ms. Cleary said that when she renewed her health plan last December, she did not understand that her H.M.O. would raise its rates. "I was paying $50 a month," she said. "I didn't think they were going to make it $129."
The soaring costs for employers are reflected in enormous charges recorded recently by large companies in the annual spring crop of reports to shareholders. The Ford Motor Company, for example, said in its latest annual report that it subtracted $1.92 billion from last year's pretax income to reflect expected payments for 150,000 retirees in the United States, mostly for medical costs. That was an increase of 24 percent, or $370 million, from $1.55 billion the year before.
General Electric, General Motors, Verizon, Boeing and other companies that long have provided extremely generous health plans for tens of thousands of retirees are also especially vulnerable, as their recent annual reports make clear. 
Many large companies are increasing their forecasts of future health care liabilities because their current costs are rising more rapidly than they expected, according to Richard Ostuw, a health care expert at the benefits consulting firm Towers Perrin. And since accounting rules require companies to reflect their future health care liabilities as a reduction in current earnings, just as Ford has, companies are trying to limit the damage to profits by demanding larger co-payments, raising deductibles and limiting coverage for retirees.
The prospects for retiree health benefits are even dimmer for younger workers at medium-size companies, with several hundred to a few thousand employees. Many of these companies have stopped promising retiree health care coverage to new hires. Small companies rarely pay for any health care at all for retirees. 
Several health care experts say costs for retirees will keep rising, unless the government provides tax relief for the employers or a taxpayer-financed drug benefit. 
Lorraine Sablan, 70, a retired aerospace worker at Allegheny Teledyne in San Diego, said the premiums subtracted from her $669 a month pension rose 80 percent on Jan. 1, to $90.16. The company shut the plant where she worked in 1994.
"If it keeps going up, we won't have a pension," she said. 
Dan Greenfield of Allegheny Technologies, the parent company, which has 20,000 retirees but only 10,700 active workers, said, even though his company was relatively small, "health costs are a big number, and even in a low inflationary environment, it continues to rise."
Trying to rein in health care costs for its retired workers, Ford recently informed the 50,000 retirees not covered by union contracts that beginning next month they will pay premiums of $5 to $150 a month, depending on the size of family covered and the retiree's eligibility for Medicare. If they do not want to pay a premium, they can still choose a plan with a high deductible. 
Ford also estimated that its commitments were $25.43 billion on Dec. 31 for the full extent of its future costs for retiree health care and other nonpension benefits, including life insurance. 
Altogether, companies reported total liability for future retiree health care costs of $400 billion, said Laura Champagne, a senior consultant on benefits for the United Automobile Workers union. For some companies, she said, their future liability for retiree health care was greater than their net worth, before they began cutting back on benefits.
Almost two-thirds of companies with 5,000 or more employees still provide some health benefits for retirees, according to the latest Kaiser Foundation-Commonwealth Fund study. But only 3 percent of small companies with fewer than 200 workers do so.
Retirees now pay all or part of the costs in 8 out of 10 company health plans, according to a national survey of costs in 2001 by Mercer Human Resource Consulting. In the mid-1980's, about half of all companies covered all their retirees' premiums. 
"Companies are concerned about how their balance sheets are going to look after two down quarters last year and the events of Sept. 11 and the big increases we've been seeing in health care costs," said Kate Sullivan, a health policy expert at the United States Chamber of Commerce. "Employers are looking at any way they can to shave off some of those costs," she said.
James Foreman, a health care expert at Towers Perrin, said companies "tend to be somewhat optimistic" when they put together their estimates of the future cost of benefits. "Then they are under pressure to manage the plans to produce the savings," often by limiting benefits, he said.
Mr. Foreman said 4 in 10 companies that pay for retirees' health needs have said they will not go above a ceiling, or cap, in payments. These limits have not affected coverage at many companies in the past, but this year, many are reaching their limits for the first time.
Alan Sefcik, a vice president for human resources at AT&T, said that management retirees who were hired after March 1, 1990, hit the company's spending limits this year. The caps were $3,950 for those over 65 with families and $1,725 for individuals in that age bracket. Retirees under age 65 had a limit of $7,550 for families and $3,700 for individuals. As a result, management retirees now pay monthly premiums of $21 for health insurance for families and $14 for individuals. 
The company's union retirees have a different deal. In recent negotiations, AT&T, which is struggling with financial losses, and the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers tentatively agreed to open new health care savings accounts for retired union members to help them if their costs reach their cap during the next 18 months. 
Some company officials do not hide their frustration with rising health care costs. "Our high cost per retiree is really driven by the fact that the health care industry does not have a focus on quality or cost," said Tom Croskey, an executive director of labor relations at General Motors. G.M. reported $3.72 billion as its net expense for retiree health and life insurance obligations for 2001, a $600 million increase from 2000.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 14, 2002

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Friday about companies that are cutting back health benefits for retirees or requiring them to pay more for coverage misstated the policy at AT&T. Employees outside union jurisdiction who began paying monthly premiums this year were those who retired after March 1, 1990, not those who were hired after that date.

HEADLINE: Nissan Turns Attention to Its Vehicles 

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON and MICHELINE MAYNARD 

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 9 

 BODY:
Having taken Nissan Motor from near bankruptcy to record profits in three years, the company's president, Carlos Ghosn, laid out a strategic plan for the company today that he said would elevate it "from a good company to a great company."
 Since he arrived from Renault, Nissan's largest shareholder, in 1999, Mr. Ghosn has made himself Japan's most famous corporate turnaround artist by attacking Nissan's costs with a most un-Japanese ferocity, shutting factories, slashing supply chains and laying off thousands of workers. 
 Now he is turning the company's attention to revitalizing its product line, capturing market share from bigger competitors in the United States and Japan and sustaining profits after the company has finished gleaning what it can from cost-cutting and favorable currency movements. 
The cornerstone of the plan is to sell an additional one million cars annually, nearly 40 percent more than the 2.6 million autos Nissan sold last year. Mr. Ghosn also wants to reduce the automotive division's debt to zero and widen its profit margins to 8 percent of sales.
"We have a clear idea of the future," he said in his presentation, strutting across a wide stage flanked by two new Nissan subcompact cars. "Now we have to earn it."
If Nissan meets these targets by 2004 -- a goal many analysts say is not unrealistic -- it stands a good chance of regaining its standing next to Toyota Motor and Honda Motor, the two leading Japanese carmakers, which have thrived in recent years while Nissan, Mitsubishi Motors and other rivals have struggled.
It would also position Mr. Ghosn to jump to the top post at Renault in 2005, a widely discussed possibility that Mr. Ghosn said today was likely to come about if his plan succeeded. 
But a triumphant return to Paris is not yet a certainty. Nissan has far to travel, and some analysts think Mr. Ghosn may be overreaching.
When Renault bought its first stake in Nissan in 1999, the Japanese company was gasping. Consumers saw its cars as stale, its production and distribution systems were cumbersome and it had 2.1 trillion yen ($16.3 billion) in debt. 
Its finances are much healthier now. In the fiscal year that ended March 31, Nissan said it expected to report 372 billion yen ($2.9 billion) in profit, even though sales were just 1.8 percent higher than the year before. Cost-cutting and a helpful fall in the yen's value made the difference, widening Nissan's profit margin to 7.9 percent, one of the best in the world auto industry, from less than 5 percent the year before.
For the current year, Nissan expects another 2.2 percent rise in profit, and 4.8 percent growth in sales, the company said today.
Standard & Poor's rewarded the company's performance today by raising its credit rating to investment grade at BBB-, from BB+.
The company has 22 new or upgraded vehicle models in the works, many of them set to roll out in countries that are still in recession. Nissan's new minicar, the March, is selling well in Japan, but profit margins on it are slim, and the market is crowded.
In the United States, Nissan's biggest market (it sells more cars there than in Japan), Mr. Ghosn wants to push up Nissan's market share by two points, to more than 6 percent. To get there, the company is building a plant in Canton, Miss., which will begin making a full-size pickup truck, the company's first, when it opens next year.
But there, too, Nissan's ambitions are pitched against tough competition from the market leaders, General Motors and Ford Motor, as well as Toyota's Tundra pickup.
Some analysts called Mr. Ghosn's strategy "aggressive," while acknowledging that Japanese carmakers have a long history of biting into market territory long dominated by Detroit. "It's the Nissan phase of what Toyota and Honda have already done," said Gregory Melich, managing director at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in London.
Mr. Melich also praised Mr. Ghosn's assault on Nissan's debt, which has been reduced by 80 percent so far in his tenure even without the help of strong sales growth.
In his three years in Japan, Mr. Ghosn has become a celebrity here, in the vein of Lee A. Iacocca, who turned Chrysler around in the 1980's, and he has been one of the most visible figures on the international automotive scene.
Like Mr. Iacocca, Mr. Ghosn has written a best-selling autobiography; his life story has been told in a series of Japanese comic books. Today's presentation and news conference in Tokyo even attracted a film crew from Lebanon, where Mr. Ghosn's parents were born.
Now, Mr. Ghosn must show that he can do more than just live up to his old nickname at Renault, Le Cost Killer. 
Analysts said there were many ways his strategy could backfire, not least if Renault and Nissan failed to integrate their operations more fully.
Bubbling with self-confidence as usual, Mr. Ghosn said he was not bothered that skeptics continued to have low expectations for Nissan.
"It's better to be neglected than to be taken seriously," he said.

 BODY:
 Canada's unemployment rate fell to a five-month low of 7.6 percent in April because of a surge in full-time jobs that heightened expectations that interest rates would continue to rise faster than those in the United States. The economy created a net 36,600 jobs, all of them higher-paying full-time positions, as retailers, transportation companies and builders hired people to keep up with demand, Statistics Canada said.

HEADLINE: Math Teachers Who Almost Took Math 

BYLINE:  By Alfred S. Posamentier; Alfred S. Posamentier is dean of the School of Education and professor of mathematics education at the City College of the City University of New York.

 BODY:
In January a young woman came to my office in search of an appropriate math course to qualify her for certification as a mathematics teacher. She was armed with a New York State Education Department form that indicated she was just one course short of meeting the math teacher requirements. Yet she had only one mathematics course -- pre-calculus -- on her college transcript. How could this be? The answer is that New York State credits courses for math certification that are really not math courses. I have seen accounting, finance, economics and engineering courses credited toward the math requirement. 
 All courses with numbers are not equal, and training in accounting or economics does not guarantee knowledge of math. 
 Mathematics is one of the most important subjects in the curriculum, a necessary foundation for many other areas of study, and we are allowing people who may know precious little about it to teach it. Some of them may become fine teachers, but they may not know much more about specific mathematics topics than what is in the textbook they are using.
Because college graduates who majored in mathematics can easily get jobs that pay more than teaching does, there is a national shortage of qualified math teachers. In many states, schools are putting teachers in math classes who have little background in math, but few other states have a math teacher shortage as severe as New York's. For students, this can mean having a teacher who cannot properly present or explain crucial concepts and cannot enrich the course in a way that motivates them to develop a liking (or a love) for math.
In 1998 I initiated an Austrian visiting teacher program to address the shortage of qualified math teachers in New York City. The Austrians were mathematically prepared but only stayed one or two years. It wasn't a long-term solution. 
The New York State Board of Regents is now considering offering a math-immersion program for secondary school math certification as an alternative to the usual requirements. I would suggest that this program offer college graduates with good academic records in quantitative fields of study (like engineering or statistics, for example) a special sequence of courses in the foundations of arithmetic, geometry, algebra, trigonometry, combinatorics, probability and statistics. Once in the classroom, these teachers should have mentoring by experienced math teachers.
Until state officials see the need to increase teacher salaries to levels that attract more college graduates to secondary school teaching, we will continue to have a shortage of teachers who are well trained in mathematics. Therefore, we can only hope that carefully designed emergency solutions like New York's planned alternative certification courses will go at least some of the way to giving our children the mathematics instruction they will need.

Thai PremierOffers Compromise of Sorts on Pipeline Dispute

BYLINE:  By WAYNE ARNOLD 

DATELINE: KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia, May 10 

 BODY:
Caught between impatient energy companies and neighboring nations on the one hand, and angry environmentalists and local villagers on the other, Thailand's prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, today announced his long-awaited solution to a dispute over a planned $700 million natural gas pipeline across southern Thailand.
 He wants to move it a bit to the right. 
 Mr. Thaksin ordered Thai oil executives to shift the spot where the pipeline will come ashore away from a cluster of traditional Muslim villages and onto land belonging to the Thai navy six miles to the north. 
Nudging the route did little to mollify the pipeline's opponents, who say the project tramples on local community rights guaranteed under Thailand's new Constitution. "The people demand this project be stopped," said Penchom Sae Tang, coordinator at the Campaign for Alternative Industry Network in Bangkok. "It violates the constitutional principle of public participation."
The proposed Trans Thai-Malaysia Pipeline, a joint venture of the two nations' state-controlled oil companies, PTT and Petroliam Nasional, would carry gas from jointly owned offshore fields across the Isthmus of Kra to customers in Malaysia. It is a crucial link in a regional grid of planned pipelines meant to help Southeast Asia, with rich gas resources in inconvenient places, to wean its power-hungry cities off dependence on Middle Eastern oil. 
The pipeline has become a sticky issue for Mr. Thaksin, one that pits his populist image with voters against his desire to appear pro-business to investors. The new Constitution, introduced after the 1997 financial crisis, has made it easier for opponents to resist the kind of pell-mell development seen in the boom years before the crisis.
Mr. Thaksin's strategy seems to be to seek compromise, or at least stall for time, on many projects. He also announced today that his government would postpone, but not cancel, construction of two deeply unpopular coal-fired power plants south of Bangkok. The government said Thailand had enough electricity for now, and that it needed more time to assess the impact of the power plants, one of which is partly owned by an American company, Edison Mission Energy, a unit of Edison International.
PTT and Petroliam Nasional, known as Petronas, had planned to start construction of the pipeline last year, but when opposition mounted, the Thai government put the project on hold, hoping tempers would cool.
Now Malaysia wants no further delays, because it is contractually obligated to start paying for the gas in a few months, pipeline or no pipeline. Petroliam Nasional has said it will invoke the "force majeure" clause in the contract and refuse to pay for gas that cannot be delivered, but it is still negotiating for time with the gas field's operators, which include BP and a Thai subsidiary of Amerada Hess. (BP recently announced that it wanted to sell its 25 percent stake in the field.)
This week, Malaysia's prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, told reporters that if the pipeline was not begun soon, Petronas would build one farther south that bypassed Thai territory -- which would thwart the Thai government's hopes for using the pipeline to encourage industrial development in the isthmus.

HEADLINE: Leading a Russia in Transition 

BYLINE:  By Strobe Talbott; Strobe Talbott, deputy secretary of state in the Clinton administration, is author of the forthcoming "The Russia Hand: A Memoir of Presidential Diplomacy."

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN 

 BODY:
One factor in Russia's transition from dictatorship to democracy has been the capacity of its recent leaders to break with their own pasts. Once Mikhail Gorbachev made it to the top of the Soviet system, he moved to repudiate its reliance on lies and brute force, setting the stage for the end of the empire and of the cold war. Boris Yeltsin, who rose to the Politburo by carrying out its orders, spent his presidency doing battle against the remnants of the Communist Party. Vladimir Putin, a former K.G.B. officer who almost everyone believed would be hopelessly out of his depth as Mr. Yeltsin's successor, has remained popular at home while accelerating Russia's alignment with the West.
 And then there are the also-rans. One of those, Aleksandr Lebed, died at the age of 52 in a helicopter accident on April 28 in Siberia. He was a paratroop general right out of a recruiting poster. Barrel-chested and steely-eyed, with a basso profundo voice, he had achieved prominence commanding a Russian division that stayed behind in the former Soviet republic of Moldova after the collapse of the Soviet Union. That background made him appealing to nationalists who hoped for a return to authoritarianism at home and for Moscow's domination of neighboring states. 
 But Mr. Lebed surprised admirers and critics alike. By the time he ran in the presidential elections of 1996, he had won over many liberals and posed a credible alternative to Mr. Yeltsin, the incumbent; the Communist candidate, Gennadi Zyuganov; and Vladimir Zhirinovsky, an ultranationalist. An early critic of the war in Chechnya, Mr. Lebed presented himself to voters as a tough, honest soldier with no tolerance for military bungling and the waste of lives. He finished a strong third, behind Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Zyuganov, in the first round of voting. Mr. Yeltsin co-opted Mr. Lebed's support to assure victory in the second round, making him head of the Kremlin security council with a mandate to end the war in Chechnya. Mr. Lebed negotiated a cease-fire with the Chechens that lasted for three years. With no further use for the general-turned-peacemaker and fearing that his popularity would grow, Mr. Yeltsin dumped him.
When I met with Aleksandr Lebed during his first trip to the United States, in November 1996, he delivered a long and astute critique of his country's economy: Russia was well endowed by nature but hindered in its chances of ever becoming a modern state because it had a crazy, capricious tax policy and rampant corruption. Democracy itself, he said, was in ill repute among average Russians because it was identified with crime, chaos and poverty. Russian democracy would have to be Russian-made -- not, as he put it, an import like Coke. Yet he professed to believe that America was "Russia's most reliable long-term partner."
If he were in charge, he said, he would make Russia a genuine federation. Decentralization, he said, was the best antidote to the breakup of Russia. The iron hand of Moscow only encouraged secessionists; that, he believed, was the lesson of Chechnya.
In those days, the single most contentious issue in American-Russian relations was enlargement of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, due to begin the following year. Yet Mr. Lebed didn't raise the subject, so toward the end of our meeting I asked what he thought. Russians had "real problems," he said. "They don't need phantom ones." It was a precursor of the sensible view that Vladimir Putin has adopted and that will probably guide him at his meeting with President Bush later this month, when Mr. Bush is expected to confirm that NATO, at its meeting this fall, will bring in additional Central European states, including former Baltic republics of the Soviet Union.
In the late 90's, Mr. Lebed voluntarily packed himself off to Siberia -- yet another indication of how dramatically Russia had changed. In trying to make a go of the governorship of the vast Krasnoyarsk region, he was holding open the option of a return to political power in Moscow. Mr. Putin, in his meteoric rise, eclipsed all other contenders for the presidency in 2000 in part by adopting some of Mr. Lebed's imagery and campaign techniques. It's a sign of Russia's continuing transformation that Mr. Lebed's once prominent national role already seems part of an earlier era.

HEADLINE: So God's Really in the Details? 

BYLINE:  By EMILY EAKIN 

 BODY:
Economists use probability theory to make forecasts about consumer spending. Actuaries use it to calculate insurance premiums. Last month, Richard Swinburne, a professor of philosophy at Oxford University, put it to work toward less mundane ends: he invoked it to defend the belief that Jesus was resurrected from the dead. 
 "For someone dead for 36 hours to come to life again is, according to the laws of nature, extremely improbable," Mr. Swinburne told an audience of more than 100 philosophers who had convened at Yale University in April for a conference on ethics and belief. "But if there is a God of the traditional kind, natural laws only operate because he makes them operate." 
 Mr. Swinburne, a commanding figure with snow-white hair and piercing blue eyes, proceeded to weigh evidence for and against the Resurrection, assigning values to factors like the probability that there is a God, the nature of Jesus' behavior during his lifetime and the quality of witness testimony after his death. Then, while his audience followed along on printed lecture notes, he plugged his numbers into a dense thicket of letters and symbols -- using a probability formula known as Bayes's theorem -- and did the math. "Given e and k, h is true if and only if c is true," he said. "The probability of h given e and k is .97" 
In plain English, this means that, by Mr. Swinburne's calculations, the probability of the Resurrection comes out to be a whopping 97 percent. 
While his highly technical lectures may not net Christianity many fresh converts, Mr. Swinburne's efforts to bring inductive logic to bear on questions of faith have earned him a considerable reputation in the small but vibrant world of Christian academic philosophy. Thanks to the efforts of Mr. Swinburne and a handful of other nimble scholarly minds -- including Alvin Plantinga at the University of Notre Dame and Nicholas Wolterstorff at Yale -- religious belief no longer languishes in a state of philosophical disrepute. Deploying a range of sophisticated logical arguments developed over the last 25 years, Christian philosophers have revived faith as a subject of rigorous academic debate, steadily chipping away at the assumption -- all but axiomatic in philosophy since the Enlightenment -- that belief in God is logically indefensible. 
"They are the first group within 20th-century Anglo-American philosophy to tackle questions of religious faith using the tools of philosophy," said Brian Leiter, a professor of law and philosophy at the University of Texas at Austin and editor of the Philosophical Gourmet Report, which ranks academic philosophy departments. "It would be accurate to say that it's a growth movement." 
Mr. Wolterstorff, who retired from Yale in December and in whose honor the conference was organized, agreed. "And it's not just graybeards," he added, referring to the dozens of younger scholars and graduate students in attendance. "Within the general discipline, this development of the philosophy of religion has been extraordinary." 
To be sure, not all of the movement's philosophers agree with one another, use the same tactics or even hold the same religious beliefs. Some, including Mr. Swinburne, for example, are what's known as evidentialists: they accept the Enlightenment doctrine that a belief is justified only when evidence can be found for it outside the believer's own mind. According to the classic evidentialist argument, for faith to be considered rational it has to be supported by independent proof, and there simply isn't any. (Asked what he would say if God appeared to him after his death and demanded to know why he had failed to believe, the British philosopher and staunch evidentialist Bertrand Russell replied that he would say, "Not enough evidence, God! Not enough evidence.")
In "The Existence of God" (Oxford University Press, 1979), Mr. Swinburne, a Greek Orthodox Christian, tried to meet the evidentialist challenge using Bayes's theorem. Supplying pages of intricate, technical argumentation to back up his claims, he wrote that many natural phenomena -- including the universe itself -- are, well, if not incontrovertible proof of God's handiwork, at least "more probable if there is a God than if there is not." (Mr. Swinburne, it turns out, is not the first to enlist Bayes's theorem in defense of religion. In a 1763 paper presented to the British Royal Society, the minister Richard Price used it to show there was good evidence in favor of the miracles described in the New Testament.)
More influential at the moment, however, are the "reformed epistemologists" led by Mr. Plantinga and Mr. Wolterstorff, who are Calvinists. These scholars reject the evidentialist insistence on independent proofs. After all, they point out, the ability to distinguish good evidence from bad requires reason, but why trust our ability to reason? Where's the proof that our reason is any good? For the evidentialists, reason is considered a "basic belief," one that doesn't require additional evidence to be true. But if reason can be considered a basic belief, then so, too, say the reformed epistemologists, can faith in God. 
Accepting faith as a basic belief, they say, does not make faith irrational. On the contrary, they insist, a belief can lack independent evidence and still be rational. Some beliefs are simply self-evident. Most people know that 1 + 1 = 2, Mr. Wolterstorff points out, just as they accept beliefs about their bodily state -- like "I feel dizzy" -- without having to consult other sources. "We believe lots of things that don't have publicly formulated arguments," Mr. Wolterstorff said. "Reformed epistemology challenges the need for arguments."
To buttress their case, the reformed epistemologists lean on Thomas Reid, an 18th-century Scottish "common sense" philosopher, who, arguing that many legitimate beliefs are simply instinctual, complained: "Are we to admit nothing but can be proved by reason?" 
But despite their intricate arguments, some critics -- including Christians -- worry that reformed epistemologists make it far too easy to justify any belief, no matter how absurd. Mr. Plantinga calls this the Great Pumpkin Objection. As he stated the problem in a seminal 1983 essay, "Reason and Belief in God": "If belief in God is properly basic, why cannot just any belief be properly basic? What about voodoo or astrology? What about the belief that the Great Pumpkin returns every Halloween? Could I properly take that as basic?" 
The answer, as you'd expect, is "certainly not." But explaining why turns out to be a formidable challenge. Mr. Plantinga has devoted three thick volumes and the last 20 years to the effort, stressing, among other things, that for a belief to be justified, it must be held by a person whose mental faculties are functioning properly. 
More aggressively, he has suggested that our capacity for true beliefs is proof that a divine creator -- rather than Darwinian natural selection -- is behind evolution: if human beings evolved by random process from mentally primitive creatures, how could we be sure that any of our beliefs -- including our belief in evolution -- are true? 
At the Yale conference, however, neither Darwin nor the Great Pumpkin Objection seemed any more pressing than conundrums that have dogged Christianity far longer -- occasionally giving the event the aura of a medieval synod. If God is omnipotent and wholly good, why does he permit evil to occur? the philosophers wondered. And if God ultimately decides what happens in the world, in what sense can human beings be said to have free will? 
Mr. Swinburne also came in for his share of questions. "Bayes's theorem provides a model of learning from experience," one philosopher observed. "As time goes by, it seems you would accumulate more evidence against the Resurrection because the expected Second Coming doesn't occur."
Mr. Swinburne acknowledged the point was worth considering. But he wasn't about to concede it entirely. When Jesus spoke about the Second Coming, "he might have said soon but he certainly didn't say when," Mr. Swinburne insisted, adding, "I don't think you have a very strong case there."

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Tumbled Unexpectedly in April 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 10 

 BODY:
Producer prices fell unexpectedly in April as food costs showed the biggest decline in almost three decades and sluggish demand made it harder for companies to charge more, the government reported today.
 The Producer Price Index, which measures prices paid to factories, farmers and other suppliers of goods and materials, dropped 0.2 percent after gaining 1 percent in March, the Labor Department said. Excluding food and energy, the index rose 0.1 percent, the 11th consecutive reading of that size or smaller. 
 Amid little sign of inflationary pressures, Federal Reserve policy makers have room to leave the benchmark interest rate at a 40-year low and focus on ensuring that the economic recovery continues. 
"Fed officials are watching demand now, not inflation," said Christopher Low, chief economist at First Tennessee Bank in New York. "This report offers no reason to change that focus."
Economists had expected the index of prices at the wholesale level to rise 0.4 percent. They had also projected a 0.1 percent gain in prices excluding food and energy.
Producer prices in April were 2 percent lower than in April last year. In February, prices were down 2.6 percent from a year earlier, the biggest decrease since February 1950.
Prices of consumer products, including cars, clothing, gasoline and food, fell 0.2 percent in April and were 2.4 percent lower than last year. Food fell 3.2 percent, the largest drop since June 1974, led by a record 47 percent fall for vegetables. 
Passenger car prices were unchanged, after falling 0.4 percent in March. General Motors extended cash rebates and zero-interest financing on most models until April 30. The loans are accounted for as a price decline. 
Clothing prices fell 0.7 percent, the most since December 1982, led by a 1.4 percent drop in costs for men's and boy's apparel. A 4.4 percent rise in tobacco costs, the biggest in almost a year, and a 4.2 percent increase for gasoline kept the producer index from falling further.
Capital goods prices, a measure of demand for business equipment, fell 0.1 percent in April after rising 0.1 percent in March. Computer prices fell 1.3 percent and were down 27 percent from a year agor. Prices of light trucks fell 1.4 percent and were down 2.4 percent from April 2001.
Prices for electronic components, fell 0.4 percent in April and were down 1.7 percent from a year earlier.

HEADLINE: Strikers at Insurer Aim to Keep Free Benefits 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Group Health Inc., the Manhattan-based health insurer, has long had a reputation as a paternalistic employer because of its tradition of giving its workers health coverage requiring no out-of-pocket expenses.
 But ever since G.H.I.'s 1,200 unionized workers went on strike three weeks ago, that reputation has taken a beating, with no end to the walkout in sight. 
 The sticking point seems ironic -- the nonprofit company and its workers are at loggerheads over employee health insurance.
Upset that medical outlays for its workers soared by 13 percent last year, G.H.I. has insisted that its employees begin paying something toward their coverage. 
Saying it is only fair that employees pick up some of the increased costs, G.H.I., which specializes in insuring unionized workplaces and administers or provides health coverage to 2.5 million people, wants its employees to begin making $10 co-payments for doctor visits.
But the employees, after decades of paying nothing for visits to doctors and dentists, or for prescription drugs, see the idea as a betrayal.
"We have no real benefits at all except for free health insurance," said Anthony Walters, a customer relations representative for G.H.I. "Other employees have benefits. Airline workers get free rides on airplanes. Restaurant workers get free meals. So it makes sense for workers at a health insurance company to get free health insurance."
Mr. Walters and hundreds of other employees have spent most of the last month inside a rectangle formed by police barriers in front of G.H.I.'s headquarters at 34th Street and Ninth Avenue. Encouraged by some shop stewards, most G.H.I. workers remain firmly behind the strike, though each worker has lost at least $1,800 in pay since the walkout begin April 16. They belong to Local 153 of the Office and Professional Employees International Union.
Ilene Margolin, G.H.I.'s senior vice president for corporate affairs, said many managers were mystified that workers would suffer through such losses just to avoid making a few co-payments each year.
"This whole strike comes down to their objections to a $10 co-pay for doctors visits," she said. "The workers have lost a lot more money in this strike than they would have from our initial or current proposals."
But G.H.I. has asked for more concessions than just the co-payment for doctor visits. The company originally asked that employees with dependents begin paying premiums toward health coverage. Depending on the worker's salary and family size, annual premiums would have ranged from $91 to $444.
When the workers began the strike, their main objection was to that proposal. They complained that for many workers the premium would represent more than 1 percent of their salaries. Management has since withdrawn the proposal.
In addition to a co-payment for doctor visits, G.H.I. wants workers to pay $15 per prescription for brand-name drugs. G.H.I. originally asked for a $20 co-payment. As another option, it continues to offer free prescriptions if workers agree to generic rather than brand-name drugs.
But the two sides disagree on much more. The union says the workers' average salary is $24,000 a year, while management says it is $36,000. For weeks each side blamed the other for refusing to bargain. Talks resumed yesterday in the first negotiating session since April 24.
Management has proposed a three-year contract with a pay increase of 3.25 percent a year, up from its proposal of 3 percent when the strike began. The union is insisting on a 4 percent raise in the first year of a new contract and 5 percent in the second and third years. Management says its proposal exceeds the inflation rate, while union officials say workers need more because it costs so much to live in New York.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Ponders the Legalities of Borrowing to Cover a $1 Billion Shortfall 

BYLINE:  By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI 

DATELINE: TRENTON, May 10 

 BODY:
New Jersey's budget crisis has grown so acute that the state may have to borrow as much as $1 billion to cover a cash-flow shortage between now and June 30, the end of the fiscal year, administration officials said today. 
 While it is not uncommon for municipalities to use short-term loans to cover cash-flow problems, the borrowing under consideration would be significant because New Jersey has never before borrowed money for one year's operating expenses to be paid back from the next year's revenue. New Jersey's Constitution requires that the state end each fiscal year with a balanced budget, so some legislators and constitutional experts warn that such an arrangement may be unlawful. 
 But the state's tax revenues have fallen $750 million below projections this year, and will deplete the $500 million reserve fund. In coming weeks, the state also must come up with billions of dollars to cover its loan payments, payroll costs and other expenses, and with the drop in tax revenues, the treasury may not have the cash to meet its obligations. 
Gov. James E. McGreevey declined to discuss the issue today, but his spokesman said that short-term borrowing had not been ruled out. 
"We're looking at all available options," said Paul Aronsohn, Mr. McGreevey's communications director. 
Some state legislators question whether a borrowing plan would be constitutional. 
"This is a form of deficit spending, and the Constitution requires a balanced budget," said Senator Leonard Lance, a Republican from Hunterdon. "I don't believe we've ever before issued temporary bonds without a revenue source to pay them back. The Legislature is the only branch of government that can approve spending, including the money to repay any bonds, so the administration is going to have to demonstrate that its plan is permissible." 
Some members of Mr. McGreevey's staff, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that the Whitman administration had briefly considered a similar borrowing arrangement in 1995. Although Gov. Christie Whitman never resorted to the plan, her staff produced a legal opinion that such an arrangement was permissible, according to McGreevey administration officials.
Nether the governor's office nor the state treasurer would release a copy of the document.
Even if the borrowing is legally permissible, Wall Street analysts say it would add to their worries about New Jersey's troubled finances.
Since taking office in January, Mr. McGreevey has put forward a plan to close the $3 billion shortfall this fiscal year, plus another proposal to close a projected $5 billion budget gap in the fiscal year that begins July 1. 
But some of his calculations were based on overly optimistic assumptions, and Mr. McGreevey has not yet addressed the structural imbalance between the state's revenues and long-term expenses. As the national and regional economies continue to struggle, two bond-rating agencies have already downgraded New Jersey's credit rating in recent months. 
Standard & Poor's has said it will wait for the budget process to play out before making any changes in New Jersey's rating, but an analyst for the agency said today that the state's cash-flow problem was a troubling sign. 
"The state has a structural imbalance between receipts and disbursements, so when you cross fiscal lines, it raises alarms," said Richard Marino, an analyst for Standard & Poor's. "We'd like to speak to the state before we take any action, but it does heighten our concerns, and its rating could be in jeopardy."

HEADLINE: David Riesman, Sociologist Whose 'Lonely Crowd' Became a Best Seller, Dies at 92 

 BODY:
David Riesman, the sociologist whose 1950 scholarly book, "The Lonely Crowd," unexpectedly tapped a deep vein of self-criticism among Americans and became a perennial best seller, contributing ideas and descriptive phrases to popular culture, died yesterday in Binghamton, N.Y. He was 92 and had lived for many years in Cambridge, Mass. 
 "The Lonely Crowd: A Study of the Changing American Character," written with Reuel Denney and Nathan Glazer, prompted millions of Americans to begin characterizing their friends, neighbors and associates as "other-directed," "inner-directed" or, occasionally, "tradition-directed." 
 In "The Lonely Crowd" Professor Riesman identified those character types and declared that the prevalence of each within a society was determined by trends in population growth. The book contended that during periods or in cultures with a relatively stable population, a balanced social order and little technological change -- the Middle Ages, for example, or contemporary countries relatively untouched by industrialization -- the dominant character type was tradition-directed.
Such people, he said, based their lives on rules "dictated to a very large degree by power relations among the various age and sex groups, the clans, castes, professions -- relations which have endured for centuries and are modified but slightly, if at all, by successive generations." 
Professor Riesman said that in periods of technological progress and population growth, like the Renaissance and the Reformation, people developed a capacity to go it alone and set lifelong goals for themselves based on values like wealth, fame, the search for scientific truth, the quest for religious salvation and the creation of beauty. 
But in periods in which consumption overtook production and the population was leveling off or even declining, he said a society became less dynamic, and its members more other-directed. In these circumstances, people seek to become accepted into the mainstream by conforming to the expectations and preferences of peer groups. Professor Riesman thought the United States was in this third phase, becoming a culture of more and more other-directed citizens.
The intention of "The Lonely Crowd" was primarily to analyze American life rather than to point with anxiety to its deficiencies, but as the sociologist Dennis H. Wrong observed, "it was widely read as deploring the rise of the psychological disposition it called 'other-direction' at the expense of 'inner-direction.' " Professor Wrong said the combination of urgent warning, however misinterpreted, and manifest learning "came across as a trumpet call to some sort of remedial action" and helped to account for the book's phenomenal success.
"The Lonely Crowd" was among the first of the postwar classics written by academics who gained unanticipated fame and fortune because an anxious public believed that their works had uncovered some deteriorating and alarming condition in American society. Other such books include "The Greening of America," by Charles Reich; "The Other America," by Michael Harrington; "One-Dimensional Man," by Herbert Marcuse; "Life Against Death," by Norman O. Brown; and "The Closing of the American Mind: How Higher Education Has Failed Democracy and Impoverished the Souls of Today's Students," by Allan Bloom.
In 1950, Yale University Press printed 3,000 copies of "The Lonely Crowd," only to have to order 13 additional printings before the book appeared in an abridged version as one of the first "quality paperbacks" in the Anchor Books series, where it became an even greater success.
In the 2001 abridged paperback edition, also published by Yale, the foreword by Todd Gitlin notes a 1997 study by Herbert Gans that called "The Lonely Crowd" "the best-selling book by a sociologist in American history, with 1.4 million copies sold."
The book generated academic debate, opposition and occasional derision. Its champions considered it a brave and unusual effort to define the shifting relationship between the general culture and individual behavior. The philosopher Jacques Barzun said the book "not only describes but also explains" and concluded that its command of the literature relevant to its varied topics was encyclopedic, and its imagination "like Zeus's thunderbolts."
The writer Irving Howe thought that Professor Riesman was "often strikingly brilliant" when he described the effects of other-directed values on American culture. 
But Russell Kirk criticized "The Lonely Crowd" in his 1954 book, "Program for Conservatives." Its "facile analysis of change is interesting; but it is undemonstrable," he wrote. 
Allan Bloom said later that "The Lonely Crowd" was "a good example of a source of vague and unhelpful ideas about virtue." 
In 1952, Professors Riesman and Glazer produced a companion volume to "The Lonely Crowd" called "Faces in the Crowd: Individual Studies in Character and Politics." The book provided numerous portraits of Americans and tended to support the theories of the first book.
Professor Riesman was the author with other specialists of more than a dozen other books, as well as essays and articles. His works included "Thorstein Veblen" (1953), "Individualism Reconsidered and Other Essays" (1954), "Constraint and Variety in American Education" (1956), "Abundance for What? And Other Essays" (1964), "Conversations in Japan" (1967), "The Academic Revolution" (1968), "The Perpetual Dream" (1978) and "On Higher Education" (1980).
David Riesman was born in Philadelphia on Sept. 22, 1909, the eldest of three children of Dr. David Riesman, an internist and professor of clinical medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, and the former Eleanor Fleisher, a graduate of Bryn Mawr.
He attended the William Penn Charter School, a Quaker preparatory school in Philadelphia, then enrolled at Harvard, where he concentrated on the biochemical sciences. He received a B.A. degree in 1931, was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and was an editor of The Harvard Crimson. He went on to Harvard Law School, "more out of aimlessness than out of any passion for the law," he recalled, and became an editor of The Harvard Law Review. He found time to study government, economics and history as well, before receiving his law degree in 1934 and a fellowship the following year that enabled him to study with Felix Frankfurter.
He was admitted to the bar in Massachusetts, the District of Columbia and New York; served as a law clerk to Justice Louis Brandeis on the Supreme Court; practiced law in Boston; taught at the University of Buffalo; and was a deputy assistant district attorney in Manhattan.
During World War II, Professor Riesman was an official with the Sperry Gyroscope Company, where, he said, "I had the chance to get out of my system the kind of executive energies many lawyers have." He resolved on an academic and writing career, which he fulfilled as a lecturer at many leading universities and as a professor of social sciences at the University of Chicago from 1949 to 1958 and, after that, at Harvard. 
For a time he edited The Correspondent, an antinuclear journal, and was identified with liberal causes. But when student protests erupted at the University of California at Berkeley in 1964, triggering demonstrations on campuses across the nation, he opposed the student radicals, maintaining that the establishment they opposed was actually a delicate if flawed social web that was necessary to the continuation of a free society. 
In the late 1960's, he particularly criticized his own field, sociology, contending that it was "becoming so politicized, it's hard to bring sober people into it."
"Sociology is the soft underbelly of the soft underbelly of society," he continued. "It is interesting that all over the world, student revolutionists have been led by sociologists; from Tokyo to the Free University of Berlin, sociologists have been the vanguard."
Professor Riesman married Evelyn Hastings Thompson, a writer and art critic, in 1936. She died in 1998. He is survived by two daughters, Lucy Lowenstein and Jennie Riesman; a son, Michael; and two grandchildren.
In "Individualism Reconsidered and Other Essays," he wrote: "What is feared as failure in American society is, above all, aloneness. And aloneness is terrifying because it means there is no one, no group, no approved cause, to submit to."
Professor Riesman urged Americans to find "the nerve to be oneself when that self is not approved of by the dominant ethic of a society."

HEADLINE: Enron's Lessons for the Energy Market 

BYLINE:  By Gray Davis; Gray Davis is governor of California.

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO 

 BODY:
This week the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission released internal memos it had obtained from Enron detailing an edifice of corrupt practices Enron used to profit from artificial shortages it created in the California energy market.
 More than a year ago, we in California stood virtually alone when we charged that Enron and possibly others were ripping off California consumers. The energy industry scoffed, saying the charge was paranoid. "Get used to it," they said. "That's the way the deregulated market is supposed to work." 
 Now, after billions of dollars of damage to California's economy, the truth is out. These memos amount to a confession by Enron of its efforts to exploit the system. Residential rate payers and small businesses were among the victims. More important, the memos are the first inkling that Enron's actions in California were possibly criminal as well. Through its greed and possibly illegal manipulation, Enron did incalculable damage to California's economy and to the national economy. 
Enron's current board has done the right thing in turning these memos over to FERC. And I am joining Senators Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer in asking Attorney General John Ashcroft to start a criminal investigation into Enron's actions.
I am also calling on FERC to release all other materials in its possession relating to Enron's role in manipulating the energy market in California and the West. It is important to know how deep Enron's involvement goes. Did Enron attempt to have a role in shaping California's dysfunctional 1996 deregulation law, as it attempted to influence the Bush administration on energy policy and even helped to shape the membership of FERC? 
Did Enron taint trades made by other energy marketers? That possibility is raised in a tantalizing line in one of the Enron memos saying, " A lthough Enron may have been the first to use this strategy, others have picked up on it too." In response to this concern, FERC has appropriately demanded that other energy trading companies in the California market turn over internal documents relating to their trading strategies.
To prevent further damage, FERC also needs to continue price caps on energy throughout the West. The caps are due to expire on Sept. 30. Power producers and marketers, especially companies like Enron, make money by exploiting market imperfections. The price caps should remain until California has enough new generation capacity to prevent shortages, and until all the investor-owned utilities, including PG&E, are creditworthy again and able to purchase power on their own.
Another huge problem is the long-term power contracts that California entered into last year when it was forced to purchase power on behalf of private utilities that were driven into insolvency by high energy prices. Those contracts were infected by the high spot market prices, and now the Enron memos show that the spot market itself was tainted. These revelations add strength to California's argument that the dysfunctional market resulted in long-term contracts that the FERC must now act to reshape. 
Enron's own lawyers have written memos that suggest the company's actions may have contributed to severe power shortages throughout California. In one memo from December 2000, the lawyers describe one trading strategy as appearing "not to present any problems, other than a public relations risk arising from the fact that such exports may have contributed to California's declaration of a Stage 2 emergency yesterday."
To the Enron traders who came up with schemes they named Fat Boy, Ricochet, Get Shorty and Death Star, it must have seemed merely a matter of how much they could get away with in a deregulated, chaotic market.
After Enron's manipulation and the siphoning of billions out of California during the energy crisis, it will be impossible to make the argument that the energy market can function without diligent government oversight.

HEADLINE: Fed Chairman Doesn't See Bubble in HousingMarket 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, May 10 

 BODY:
The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, said today that he saw no bubble in the United States housing market and added that longer-term prospects for crucial capital spending were sound even with a mixed near-term outlook.
 And while there was probably some statistical "noise" in recently released first-quarter productivity data showing an annualized growth rate of 8.6 percent, the Fed chief said, productivity growth remains strong, thus lifting the pace at which the economy can grow without causing inflation. 
 In a wide-ranging question session after a speech to a banking conference here, Mr. Greenspan also said that recent increases in oil prices bore watching. But he added that they would have to be much larger to damage the economy, which is in the fragile early stages of recovering from last year's shallow recession.
"With a fairly large amount of exploitable capital investment out there, the short-term outlook for capital investment is rather mixed, but the longer term outlook is increasingly, persuasively good," he said.
Economists have said that a resurgence in business spending is critical to the sustainability of the expansion.
Fed policy makers this week left short-term interest rates unchanged at four-decade lows.
Mr. Greenspan played down concerns that residential house prices over the last few years constituted an asset bubble. "I don't think we have a bubble in house prices," he said, citing market dynamics that made it more difficult for buyers to jump on a bandwagon as in the stock market. He added that recent data shows some softening of home prices as well.
"If there is a big boomlet going, it's not showing itself in the most recent data," he said. "The most recent data show some edging off in the overall markets."

HEADLINE: Graduation Speakers With 9/11 Ties Are in Vogue 

BYLINE:  By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
As this year's college seniors prepare to find their way in a world indelibly changed by the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, a new category of commencement speaker is emerging: those who symbolized the bravery and heroics of that day.
 Former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani will headline graduation ceremonies at Syracuse University tomorrow, Georgetown University's law school next weekend and the high school in Shanksville, Pa., where United Airlines Flight 93 went down, on May 31. Mr. Giuliani's spokeswoman, Sunny Mindel, said he had received more than 25 requests to speak at college commencements and many others from high schools. 
 Bernard B. Kerik, the city's former police commissioner, has even more commencement engagements lined up. Mr. Kerik, who never finished college, will address graduating seniors at Manhattanville College in Purchase, N.Y.; Kingsborough Community College in Brooklyn; and Francis Lewis High School in Queens. He will also receive an honorary degree and give remarks at Caldwell College's commencement in Caldwell, N.J. 
Thomas Von Essen, the former fire commissioner, will give the commencement addresses at Deerfield Academy, where one of his best friends teaches, and at St. Bonaventure University in Olean, N.Y. St. Bonaventure is the alma mater of the Rev. Mychal F. Judge, the charismatic fire chaplain who died on Sept. 11 and whose dress hat and gloves will occupy an empty seat at the ceremony.
Mr. Von Essen's speech will focus on Father Judge, who will receive an honorary degree posthumously. Mr. Von Essen will also get an honorary degree.
"What we're interested in is his reflections on this man who exemplified an awful lot of the good that human beings are capable of," said David Ferguson, a spokesman for St. Bonaventure, which is in the southwest corner of the state. "Father Judge died doing what he believed in, and if that message gets across, it will be a wildly successful day."
Alaina LeBlanc, the senior class president at Manhattanville College, said she and her classmates decided almost immediately after Sept. 11 to look for a commencement speaker who could talk about the lessons of that morning because "our whole school went into shock and our whole frame of mind changed" after the attacks. They considered asking Mr. Giuliani but decided against it. 
"Giuliani has been sort of controversial, and the seniors weren't too excited with the politicians in general," Ms. LeBlanc said. "But when I ran the idea of Kerik by them, they were so excited. It has totally changed everyone's view of commencement."
Richard Sheirer, the former director of the city's Office of Emergency Management, will get an honorary degree at the ceremony, she added.
At Syracuse, the choice of Mr. Giuliani was not without controversy: fliers listing the names of people killed by New York City police officers during his tenure were posted around campus after the selection. But Sharon Ehm, a senior class marshal who was on the selection committee, said most of her classmates were elated about the choice of Mr. Giuliani over other contenders, like Senator Tom Daschle, Bob Costas and Conan O'Brien.
Ms. Ehm said she did not know what Mr. Giuliani would tell her class, and Ms. Mindel would not give any hints.
"He was a true leader in that tragedy and he probably has good advice on how to be prepared for anything," Ms. Ehm said. "Especially with the economy the way it is, all of us coming out of college right now need to be prepared for anything."
To be sure, the business magnates, comedians, television personalities and journalists who are perennial favorites on the commencement circuit will be addressing many senior classes in the metropolitan region this year. Anne Mulcahy, the chief executive of Xerox, will speak at Fordham University; Calvin Trillin, at Long Island University; and Bill Cosby, at Cooper Union. 
George Campbell Jr., the president of Cooper Union and a childhood friend of Mr. Cosby's, said that even commencement speakers who were not involved with the rescue effort on Sept. 11 would almost certainly touch on the attacks. "It's almost mandatory for everyone who gives a speech these days to mention Sept. 11," Dr. Campbell said.
Hillary Rodham Clinton, who will address graduates of Manhattan Community College, and Gov. George E. Pataki, who will speak at Yale, are among the many commencement speakers expected to focus on the impact of Sept. 11.
Other colleges will present awards to people involved in the rescue effort or have police officers and firefighters participate in their ceremonies. At New York University's commencement on Thursday -- where Raymond W. Kelly, the police commissioner, will speak -- the academic procession will be led for the first time by a Fire Department color guard. Officer Daniel Rodriguez of the Police Department will sing the national anthem.
Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion in Manhattan will award its annual Roger E. Joseph prize posthumously to Father Judge at its ordination ceremony tomorrow, citing his "courage in carrying out his Manhattan ministry in a manner unprecedented in its breadth and diversity." 

CORRECTION-DATE: May 14, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about colleges that have selected commencement speakers tied to Sept. 11 heroism misidentified a college that broke the trend by choosing a business leader, Anne M. Mulcahy, chief executive of Xerox. It was Marymount College in Tarrytown, N.Y., although Fordham also chose a business leader, Gerald M. Levin, retiring chief executive of AOL Time Warner.

HEADLINE: In Time for Carter's Visit, Cubans Petition Government 

BYLINE:  By DAVID GONZALEZ 

DATELINE: HAVANA, May 10 

 BODY:
Two days before a historic visit to Cuba by the former President Jimmy Carter, human rights activists today delivered an extraordinary challenge to the Communist government of President Fidel Castro in the form of petitions signed by more than 11,000 people seeking greater freedom.
 The petition drive, known as the Varela Project, calls for a referendum under the terms of the Cuban Constitution on whether there should be more freedom of expression, an amnesty for political prisoners and a chance for ordinary citizens to own small businesses. 
 The signed petitions were delivered this morning to the National Assembly, after supporters painstakingly verified each signature, in the most significant peaceful effort to bring reform to Cuba in four decades.
"All of these Cubans, who with great courage and sacrifice have signed Project Varela, are the social vanguard for peaceful change in Cuba," said Oswaldo Paya, who led the drive. He said changes in the rights of Cubans could only be achieved peacefully. 
The delivery of the petitions seemed timed to coincide with the visit by Mr. Carter, who made human rights a leading issue of his presidency. Not everyone in the dissident community supported the move. Some had rejected the petitions because the proposed referendum would be carried out by a political system they consider illegitimate.
President Castro made no mention of the drive during a speech tonight addressing another issue that arose in advance of Mr. Carter's visit.
Mr. Castro denounced as "sinister lies" the State Department's accusation this week that his government was developing germ warfare capabilities and sharing them with rogue nations.
While his country has expended considerable efforts to develop vaccines and medicines, at no time was it exploring biological weapons, Mr. Castro said. He added that his country's biotechnology centers had nothing to hide.
"No one has produced a single piece of evidence that any program for developing nuclear, chemical or biological weapons has been set up in our country," Mr. Castro said. "Those who have no sense of ethics, or who fail to understand that the government of Cuba abides by truth and transparency, might at least understand that it would have been utterly stupid to behave in any other way."
On Monday, a State Department official accused Cuba of developing limited biological warfare weapons. The official, John R. Bolton, under secretary of state for arms control, said that Cuba, renowned for its biotechnology research, had also provided "dual use" technology to rogue nations.
His comments, made during a speech at the Heritage Foundation, were the first public comment by United States officials on previously classified intelligence reports.
Mr. Bolton also described Libya and Syria as working to develop biological weapons. His remarks were welcomed by conservatives who advocate a harder line against Cuba. Lawmakers in favor of reviewing Cuba policy regarding trade and travel restrictions were skeptical of his allegations.
Among the places Mr. Carter will visit is a biotechnology research center that is frequently showcased to foreign guests. The center has been a leader in developing vaccines and other medicines and has also done research on genetic engineering.
Mr. Carter was briefed last week by State Department officials, but neither they nor Mr. Carter's staff would comment on whether the biological weapons issue was raised during the briefing.
Mr. Castro said that his country had been working to develop a range of vaccines and medicines used to treat everything from meningitis and cancer, and that his country's research facilities had been visited by officials and executives interested in acquiring new products.
"The doors of our research centers are open to any international institution," he said. He added that Cuban biomedical technology and products had been acquired by other countries, including Iran and Britain.

A Rally, Then Another Technology Slide

BYLINE:  By SHERRI DAY

 BODY:
Despite a robust rally on Wednesday, the stock market lost ground last week as investors bet that an economic recovery would not come as quickly as some had previously thought.
 Better-than-expected earnings from Cisco Systems prompted the biggest one-day gains in the major indexes since September. 
General Electric and Coca-Cola Enterprises reported that they would meet analysts' expectations this year, adding to the rally. 
 But the market's move higher was short-lived. Investors engaged in widespread selling on Thursday, dumping telecommunications stocks after the debt of WorldCom was downgraded to junk status. 
 The economic data released last week was mostly positive, but it failed to elicit a strong reaction from investors. First-quarter productivity surged by 8.6 percent, the Labor Department reported on Tuesday. The Federal Reserve decided to leave overnight interest rates unchanged at 1.75 percent.
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 66.71 points, or 0.7 percent, to 9,939.32. The Nasdaq composite index 12.18 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,600.85. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index shed 18.44 points, or 1.7 percent, to 1,054.99.

MACGREGOR, FRANCES COOKE

 BODY:
 MACGREGOR-Frances Cooke. With apologies for the delay to her friends and colleagues, it is with regret that we advise that Frances Cooke Macgregor, an expert on the psychological effects of facial deformities, died on Christmas Eve (2001) at her retirement home in Carmel, California. She was 95 and died of congestive heart failure. She was a renowned social scientist whose research and writing on the social and psychological significance of facial differences was the first acknowledgement of disfigurement as a disability. Her publications document 40 years of research. Mrs. Macgregor was born in Portland, Oregon, but grew up in San Rafael, California and earned a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of California at Berkeley in 1927. She moved to Massachusetts several years later and in 1933 married the late Gordon Macgregor, an anthropologist for the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs. They later divorced. While they were married, the Macgregors visited Indian reservations around the country. A professional photographer at the time, Mrs. Macgregor took pictures that captured daily life on the reservations. Those photographs, published in 1941 in a book entitled, "Twentieth Century Indians", helped prompt Congress to devote more money to Indian reservations. Other pictures Mrs. Macgregor took over the course of a year in the small Massachusetts town of Hingham, were also published in 1941 in a book called, "This Is America", with text written by her friend, former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt. In the 1940's, Mrs. 
Macgregor moved to New York City and did graduate work in anthropology at Columbia University under Dr. Margaret Mead. Mrs. Macgregor obtained her master's degree in sociology at the University of Missouri in 1947. Her work on facial disfigurement began during World War II while photographing patients at the Ellis Fischel Cancer State Hospital in Columbia, Missouri. Shortly after the war, she met plastic surgeon Dr. John Marquis Converse, who helped repair the shattered and burned faces of French and English pilots. His specialty coincided with her interest in social and psychological ramifications of facial disfigurement. Dr. Converse accepted her suggestion to conduct an exploratory study of his patients. At that time, the existing literature on physical disabilities was limited almost entirely to functional impairments: the loss of a leg, blindness, deafness and so on, and the problems of physical rehabilitation. As for those whose faces happen to deviate from the norm, there was and is, a special irony with which they must contend. Their problems have their roots in the inextricable relationship of the face to the person and its role in human relations. Moreover, it is a situation made even worse in a society whose frenetic efforts to look young and beautiful makes looking different a social stigma-a stigma that has the potential for social and psychological death. Her work led to the World Health Organization adding facial disfigurement to its list of disabilities. In 1951 The Society for the Rehabilitation of the Facially Disfigured was established. Now known as The National Foundation for Facial Reconstruction, the Foundation helps fund the work of the Institute of Reconstructive Plastic Surgery at New York University Medical Center. Mrs. Macgregor remained in close touch with Dr. Joseph G. McCarthy, who became Director of the Institute following the death of Dr. Converse in 1981. The innovative streak in Macgregor drew the attention of the Russell Sage Foundation where she did a threeyear study at the New York Hospital, Cornell University School of Nursing in order to introduce social science into the education of nurses. She published a textbook, "Social Science in Nursing; Applications for the Improvement of Patient Care" (Russell Sage Foundation, New York, 1960). She became a full professor teaching at Cornell University Medical and Nursing School from 1954 to 1968 then rejoined the Institute of Reconstructive Plastic Surgery at NYU Medical Center. In 1991, Macgregor moved from New York City to Carmel, California. She continued her consultancies adding legal clients as well as medical colleagues and patients. Magregor's last research efforts focused on iatrogenic illness. Years before it was frontpage news in the New York Times (Sunday, December 19, 1999), she wanted her philanthropic funds to go to studying medical errors caused by physicians and other health professionals. On the same page as the continuation of The New York Times article of December 19, 1999, "Breaking Down Medicine's Culture of Silence", the Institute of Medicine estimated that between 44,000 and 98,000 Americans die each year as a result of medical errors. Macgregor had already contributed to studies by the Institute of Medicine and also the Harvard Medical School in her name through the aegis of The Commonwealth Fund. She has left her estate to The Commonwealth Fund who will administer the Frances Cooke Macgregor Awards for further study of iatrogenic illness. At a private ceremony on January 4, 2002, Frances Cooke Macgregor was buried at the family burial plot beside her father, mother, brother and nephew at the Mt. Tamalpais Cemetery in San Rafael, California.

HEADLINE: California Stunned to Find $20 Billion Hole in Budget 

BYLINE:  By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 11 

 BODY:
The fury of last year's dot-com bust may be fading from memory, but its effects are proving far more severe than anyone had predicted even a few months ago, state officials and economists say. 
 Gov. Gray Davis and state finance officials are to release updated figures for the state budget on Tuesday, and economists are predicting that they will show a potentially catastrophic deficit of $20 billion to $25 billion for the current fiscal year, which ends June 30, and the next. 
 The shortfall could well force the state and local governments to slash an array of services, including police protection and mental health, state and local officials say. The California Legislature is expected to spend most of the summer in a brutal political battle over who will have to sacrifice the most. 
Nearly every state has budget problems, but California's potential deficit is larger than the entire budgets of most states. California's general budget is about $80 billion.
State finance officials began expecting a problem months ago, given the downturns in the technology industry and the stock market. In January they predicted a shortfall of $12.5 billion. Now, with most tax returns tallied, the figures have mushroomed. The principal cause, the officials say, is not the overall economic malaise, or even the terrorist attacks, but plunging tax revenues from stock options and other capital gains, which evaporated when the dot-com bubble burst last year. 
The total income reported by California taxpayers from stock options and capital gains rocketed to roughly $200 billion in 2000 from $25 billion in 1994, state officials say. Then last year it fell to less than $70 billion, a decline that will reduce state tax revenues this fiscal year by $11 billion to $15 billion. 
"Everyone was taken by surprise," said Kathleen Connell, the state controller, who has been forced to prepare an extraordinary $7.5 billion short-term bond offering next month to close the state's financial gap. "The diminished revenue was startling. And we don't see this as a single-year problem."
In recent weeks, local governments and their lobbyists in Sacramento have been scrambling to find ways to protect basic services and prevent the state from forcing the localities to absorb the brunt of coming budget reductions.
Making matters worse, the problem has surfaced in an election year, when the governor and the Legislature will be particularly reluctant to make painful budget cuts or to raise taxes. Those constraints have put many officials in the awkward position of both playing down the severity of the problem and stressing that it will require extraordinary measures to fix.
"It's not a crisis," said Tim Gage, director of the Department of Finance. "It's a significant challenge. No one really saw what the magnitude of that drop was going to be. The problem is to close the gap with the least damage, to cushion the otherwise devastating impact if we just made the cuts directly to programs."
Local governments are particularly vulnerable because they have two basic sources of income, local taxes and tax revenues passed down from the state, and many localities expect to be hit on both fronts.
For example, Santa Clara County, which includes Silicon Valley, faces an $85 million budget gap because of plummeting revenues from things like property transfer taxes, sales taxes and vehicle license fees. 
Unemployment has gone to 7.7 percent from less than 1 percent two years ago, and now the government is preparing for potentially steep reductions in the money it receives from the state, which accounts for 43 percent of its annual revenues. 
"I've been doing this for 26 years, and I've never seen anything like this in terms of how quickly things have turned," said Richard Wittenberg, the county executive. "It's been a free fall, and we haven't had much time to prepare." 
He said services like health care, a program providing health insurance for children and welfare programs were likely to face cuts. 
Richard Averett, finance director for the tiny city of San Carlos, south of San Francisco, said he was preparing for cuts in recreation, senior programs, the library system and police protection. 
Even rural counties are expecting the worst. Fresno County, for instance, in the San Joaquin Valley, is concerned about potential cuts in state fire protection in its forests. Los Angeles County, which has nearly 10 million people, is particularly concerned about potential cuts in the money it receives for its extensive health programs, which focus on the burgeoning immigrant community. 
Butte County, in Northern California, is one of the poorest in the state and has been on the verge of bankruptcy for years. Officials there worry about even modest cuts. 
"We're in no position to bail anyone out," said Paul McIntosh, the chief administrator for Butte County. "We're just hoping we'll have some flexibility in how we can deal with this because we don't have anywhere else to dig."
The only time the state came close to this situation was in the early 1990's, when there were rampant layoffs in the aerospace industry. The revenue shortfall reached $14 billion in fiscal 1991, a gap that was closed, in large measure, by taking money away from local governments.
The problems are a reminder of just how unusual the 1990's were in California. While poor and working class immigrants flooded into the state, the wealthiest residents simply grew wealthier, laying the groundwork for the current problem.
The top 5 percent of taxpayers accounted for 22 percent of total personal income in California in 1980. By 2000, the top 5 percent of taxpayers -- with gross incomes of $150,000 or more -- accounted for 42 percent of total personal income. 
When the stock options and portfolios of that tiny slice of the population collapsed, so did the state budget. 
State officials are not in the business of making stock market forecasts, but they are working hard on their economic predictions and they expect little relief soon. 
"If there is no real economic growth until the end of the fourth quarter, there will be no revenue growth to help out on next year's budget," said Ms. Connell, the state controller. "We could be dealing with this for three or four years."

HEADLINE: OPEC Ministers Signal That Group Has No Plan to Lift Oil Output 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: CAIRO, May 11 

 BODY:
Two OPEC ministers said today that oil supplies were adequate, indicating they had no plan to raise production to stem the 33 percent surge in prices so far this year.
 The oil ministers for the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, speaking here, said inventories were ample. Higher prices can, in part, be attributed to traders' concern of a disruption to Middle East supply as a response to violence in Israel. 
 "Supply and demand are in balance," said Qatar's minister, Abdullah bin Hamad al-Attiyah. "Prices today are a mixture of politics and other issues, and we have to wait to see things clear up before making a decision. There is no doubt that if there is a shortage, we will supply more oil."
He was attending a meeting here of Arab oil producers who are determined to keep crude prices around $25 a barrel, which means the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will probably maintain production at current levels, the lowest since 1993, analysts have said. The American Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, said on Friday that oil prices would have to rise much higher to damage the economic recovery in the United States.
OPEC holds almost 80 percent of known oil reserves yet pumps only about a third of world supply, limiting production to bolster prices. Allowing prices to rise too high risks hurting demand, encouraging development of competing energy sources and losing market share to rivals like Russia.
While no decision on production will come until OPEC meets June 26, the Arab ministers were discussing the future of their biggest industry at a time when economic growth is lower than normal.
Prices are "at a good level," said Obeid bin Saif al-Nasiri, the oil minister for the United Arab Emirates. "The stock level is very high, so there is no need for additional supply to the market now."

HEADLINE: What Soccer Hath Joined: The Rockiest Match 

BYLINE:  By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 10 

 BODY:
For the nearly one million first-time visitors to Japan and South Korea who will soon begin arriving for the 2002 soccer World Cup, the two Asian hosts might seem as snug and similar a pair as, say, Spain and Portugal.
 From their geographical proximity to their related languages, common traditions of Buddhism and Confucianism and their rice-and-chopsticks cuisines, Korea and Japan indeed share as much culture as the closest of European neighbors. 
 But for the two longtime Asian rivals -- locked in a tense and awkward partnership as the first co-hosts of the world's largest sporting event, global soccer's quadrennial championship extravaganza, which kicks off on May 31 -- a more fitting European analogy might be France and Germany before the European Union forged a friendship out of their long feud.
After more than two millennia of tightly intertwined history, including the bitter years of 1910-45 when Japan ruled Korea as a colony, the two countries still stand out as Asia's pre-eminent odd couple. Security alliances with the United States and mutual economic interests oblige them to live together. But for visitors who travel back and forth, almost everything else -- from tastes in food and national temperament to even rudimentary geography -- seems to set them apart. 
Like a seriously estranged couple, the two countries have never been able to agree on very much, not even something so basic as the name of the narrow sea that separates them. (It is the Sea of Japan for the one and the East Sea for the other.) Their shared hosting roles have only provided new opportunities for backbiting and one-upmanship.
The two countries have spent wildly, creating a total of $8 billion worth of new stadiums and other World Cup-related projects, each nation with its eye on outdoing the other.
South Korea objected to the choice of names for the cartoon-like mascots as overly Japanese. Meanwhile, loath to play second fiddle to a country it has always regarded as its smaller, poorer junior, Japan fought the name-order in the international soccer federation's officially decreed name -- the "KoreaJapan 2002 World Cup" -- so strenuously that the joint hosting arrangements were, for a while, cast in doubt.
Disputes like these pale, however, compared with the profound divisions over history. This was powerfully underscored by the visit in late April of the Japanese prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, to a Shinto shrine that commemorates Japan's war dead.
Mr. Koizumi struggled to reassure Japan's neighbors that no offense was intended. But for Koreans, there is simply no getting past the 35 years of atrocities and humiliation suffered under Japanese colonial rule, which the Koreans see symbolized by the shrine.
"What outsiders can't fully appreciate is that between Korea and Japan there is no humor about certain things -- especially history," said Edward J. Shultz, director of Korean studies at the University of Hawaii.
By reputation, Japan is the homeland of harmony, where the interests of the group should always prevail, where public altercations are almost unheard of and where even automobile accidents seem rare. Japanese prize delicacy in flavors and textures, and cherish restraint so deeply that years of friendship may be required before learning what another truly thinks.
Korea, by contrast, is a brash and backslapping land that could even teach New Yorkers something about outspokenness. It is a place where tae kwon do is sometimes used to settle things after a fender bender, and where not speaking one's mind earns the distrust, even contempt, of others. In short, Korea does not do muted. Its women like their makeup bright, and seasonings, from garlic to chilies, are equally bold.
The jointly hosted World Cup, the first on Asian soil, was conceived back in 1996, in what appeared to many at the time to be an inspired blend of sports and diplomacy that would draw the uneasy neighbors together. But Joao Havelange, the headstrong former international soccer czar, who is usually credited with the idea, may not have fully appreciated the psychic gulf that has kept Japan and Korea apart.
The Korea-Japan relationship is so intense and so complicated because it involves far more than simple animosity. For half a century, Koreans have hated Japan even as they have made catching up with their neighbor through emulation a national obsession.
For years, Koreans have barred Japanese automobile imports while building careful knockoffs of Japan's leading models. Koreans have long banned Japanese television programs, comics and pop music, but push the mute button on a television variety show in Seoul, and someone from Japan might think he is back home.
The monumental grudge that drives Koreans in this competition easily ranks among the world's most ancient. Korean immigrants helped populate the Japanese archipelago starting thousands of years ago. Korean royalty helped establish the Japanese imperial line in the seventh century. And Koreans brought Chinese writing and religion to the Japanese islands as well.
In the 16th century, kidnapped Korean artisans created Japan's most prestigious schools of pottery making. And in the 20th century, tens of thousands of Koreans, working as forced laborers and sex slaves, helped sustain Japan's expansionist drive in Asia in World War II.
Although Korea has suffered an inferiority complex toward Japan for centuries, the last decade has seen a dramatic reversal of roles. Japan's economy has been stagnating and its politics have become increasingly dysfunctional, so that a once-feared Japan has been looking ever more marginal.
South Korea, on the other hand, has been booming economically, and its 15-year-old democracy appears increasingly vigorous. The uncertainties remain huge, but the divergent fortunes have allowed many South Koreans to dream that if a smooth integration with poor Communist North Korea can be pulled off, the resulting country of 70 million or so would finally be able to stand shoulder to shoulder with Japan.
Japan's population of 126 million, by contrast, is expected to fall by half in this century.
Many Koreans, looking optimistically at this picture, find it impossible not to gloat and are tempted to offer lessons to a neighbor that once lorded it over them.
These days, Korean newspapers are full of the once unimaginable: advice for Japan.
"Japanese people wait for their government to resolve their problems, and when their government is averse to change, they suffer," said Chung Chin Sung, a professor at Seoul National University who is an expert on Japan. "In Korea, we've never believed our government will take care of everything for us. That is why we are so much more dynamic."
At the popular level, though, Japanese show little resentment. Korean movies have been the rage in Tokyo recently, and among younger Japanese, things Koreans are enjoying an unprecedented chic.
"There are probably more Japanese people studying Korean right now than there were from 1900 to 1990 combined," said Ronald P. Toby, a historian at Tokyo University. "There are tons of things one can be gloomy about, but there is a new kind of awareness of Korean culture that goes way beyond anything taught in the public education system, and beyond the leadership.
"Over the next 10 to 20 years," he said, "this is going to absolutely transform the way the two peoples relate to each other -- and people may look back at the World Cup and say it helped."

ENRON'S NAME GAMES

 Fat Boy. Death Star. Get Shorty. These were the cocky nicknames Enron traders gave their strategies to manipulate California's electricity prices in 2000 and 2001, when the company was riding high, exploiting weaknesses in the state's deregulated electricity market. 
Enron has collapsed, but California officials hope internal e-mail messages about its trading games will help them persuade regulators and juries that Enron and other energy traders should return some of the profits they made at California's expense during its yearlong energy crisis. Joseph Kahn

 THE NEXT CHRISTENDOM
The Coming of Global Christianity.
By Philip Jenkins.
270 pp. New York:
Oxford University Press. $28.
 MARK your calendar. By the year 2050 six nations -- Brazil, Mexico, the Philippines, Nigeria, Congo and the United States -- will each have 100 million Christians or more. Sub-Saharan Africa will have long displaced Europe as the leading center of Christianity, while Brazil will count 150 million Catholics and 40 million Protestants. And more than one billion Pentecostals, the poorest of the poor, will be spreading their distinctive brand of Christian supernaturalism.
Across the Southern Hemisphere a new wave of nondemocratic states with theocratic pretensions, some of them openly repressive, will compete for regional dominance. When they are not fighting among themselves, these Christian regimes will unite against their common foe, Islam. In 2050, almost 20 of the 25 largest nations will be predominantly or entirely Christian or Muslim; at least 10 will be the sites of intense conflict.
Although Christians will continue to outnumber Muslims, Islam may have the upper hand in the third-world wars. The deciding factor may well be the support provided to oil-producing Muslim regimes by the nations of the industrialized North, whose sentimental attachment to Christianity will be outweighed by economic considerations. Extremists in both religions, meanwhile, will continue to guarantee the absence in the South of women's rights, freedom of worship and other misbegotten ideas of the secular North, even as Asia and Africa develop significant military capacity, perhaps based on chemical or biological weapons. The coming havoc, in short, will make the bloody religious wars of the 16th century look like calisthenics.
These startling and gloomy predictions are served up in "The Next Christendom," by Philip Jenkins, a budding futurist who, having written on pedophiles and priests and on mystics and messiahs, knows disasters in the making when he sees them. A professor of history and religious studies at Penn State, he sketches the contours of a new Christendom emerging from the convergence of third-world demographic explosion, Muslim and Christian missionary zeal and the hunger of millions of newly urban poor for supernatural deliverance.
Jenkins's forecasts are no less arresting for their occasional flirtation with the absurd -- he would be the first to caution that they may not all be borne out. He must now also be aware that seemingly innocuous events, which could hardly be described as trends, can nonetheless trigger seismic change. (Indeed, Jenkins's earlier research on sexual scandal in the Roman Catholic Church seemed wise in playing down the impact of priestly pedophilia by placing it in comparative context. But his findings did not predict -- could not have predicted -- that a few isolated cases would lead, as they have, to a wider scandal of priestly misconduct and episcopal malfeasance that has significantly weakened the moral authority of the church in the United States.)
Jenkins's more sensational futurist predictions aside, the general scenario is rooted in well-documented demographic, religious and political trends. Already in Nigeria and Sudan, in Indonesia and the Philippines, in Brazil and Guatemala, we can witness the deleterious effects of rapidly growing factions competing for converts, struggling for political power, inciting persecution and striving to legislate and enforce laws drawn from their sacred precepts.
Al Qaeda, the Taliban, Hamas, Hezbollah and dozens of other violent jihadi networks notwithstanding, Islam will not corner the market on religious extremism. Jenkins, if not fully sympathetic to the emerging Christian order, is at least respectful of the right of Christians to remake themselves -- or, as others would say, to manipulate and distort their heritage in much the same way that some Muslims, Hindus, Jews and even Buddhists have ransacked their traditions to legitimize intolerance against outsiders. He argues persuasively that the issues now confronting the Muslim world -- the allure of theocracy as a way of securing political dominance; the rights of minorities; and the penalties for conversion out of the dominant tradition -- will divide and transform the Christian world as well.
The new world of the South will not conform to the vision of liberation theology or other movements for radical restructuring in developing nations that many European and American liberals still cherish. As Jenkins remarks, quoting one writer on Brazilian religion, " 'the Catholic Church has chosen the poor, but the poor choose the Pentecostals,' and the choice rankles." Indeed, Pentecostalism does seem to be the wave of the Christian future. Born early in the 20th century, this Spirit-filled movement, emphasizing the power of personal faith, biblical literalism, visions and prophecy, numbers hundreds of millions of souls in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Its ministers are homegrown products, not seminary-trained missionaries. Apocalyptic visions of extrahistorical justice are more than plausible in societies colored by violence and life-threatening diseases like AIDS. Reliance on faith healers and shamans is also healthier than mounting revolution.
None of this bodes particularly well for Northern Christians. Black missionaries from the Anglican communities of Africa may be inspired to mount huge missionary crusades to re-evangelize the white, affluent "pagans" of England. And the Catholic Church, faced with huge losses to the people-friendly Pentecostals and new indigenous churches, might soon regret its policy of robbing Africa and Latin America of their already inadequate supplies of priests to serve the relatively priest-rich United States.
What to make of all this? Statistics are the stock in trade of futurists, and Jenkins adopts the somewhat dubious methods of these secular prophets: he ventures to predict the future by extrapolating current social chaos and catastrophes on roughly the same scale as population is projected to increase. In the case of third-world Christianity and Islam, more is worse.
Perhaps. But Jenkins is to be commended for reminding us, throughout the often gripping pages of this lively work of synthesis, that the history of Christianity is the history of innovative -- and unpredictable -- adaptations. Those who hope for a future more pacific than the one sketched here might take some comfort in the integrity and autonomy of faith, which is always shaped but never fully determined by social and cultural pressures.

 WEALTH AND DEMOCRACY
A Political History
of the American Rich.
By Kevin Phillips.
473 pp. New York:
Broadway Books. $29.95.
 WHEN future historians want to understand the politics of the last half of the 20th century, they will treasure Kevin Phillips's books, particularly "The Emerging Republican Majority" and "Post-Conservative America." Phillips's latest book, "Wealth and Democracy," has its moments, principally as a jeremiad against the financial excesses of the late 1990's, but it lacks the force and clarity of his earlier works. It is annoyingly repetitious and contains what seems like needless detail about things like how many millionaires lived in Philadelphia in 1845. And to the extent that it has a central premise, the premise is not one that commands assent.
As he has done before, Phillips argues that America is the latest victim of the cyclical rise and fall of great imperial powers -- from Greece and Rome through Britain and the United States. He portrays the United States "against the warning backdrop and decline symptoms of its three predecessors -- Britain, Holland, and Hapsburg Spain." This view of history, which was popular among the nation's founders, was revived in the late 1980's by Phillips and the historian Paul Kennedy. (I also did my bit in "Grand Illusion: Critics and Champions of the American Century.") The idea fell into disfavor during the boom of the 1990's, but Phillips insists that what many Americans took for symptoms of a new economy were further signs that the United States is about to suffer the same dismal fate as its imperial predecessors.
Phillips focuses on the similarities between the United States now and the 17th-century Netherlands and early-20th-century Britain. Among other things, he cites "financialization," a preoccupation with success in "finance, technology and services" and the neglect of "basic manufacturing," speculation and the recurrence of bubbles and manias (from Dutch tulips to America's dot-coms), the export of capital and jobs, the reliance on foreigners to fill domestic jobs, growing inequality of wealth and income and the "exposure . . . to war." The trouble is that similar symptoms don't necessarily reflect similarity in causes and conditions: the fact that the British had to enlist "foreigners to aid or run chemical and electrical industries" may have been a sign of their imminent decline, but the influx of skilled Asian workers, many of whom have become American citizens, into Silicon Valley during the 1990's has contributed to the United States' economic vitality.
If you look at the actual causes of decline in the Netherlands and Britain, they do not seem present in the United States today. The Netherlands was felled by European tariffs against its textiles, British discrimination against its ships and its vulnerability to military attack from its neighbors. Britain declined in the early 20th century because it lagged behind the United States and Germany in making the transition from owner-operated manufacturing companies to large-scale corporate capitalism. In the late 1980's, it did seem that the United States would suffer a similar fate at the hands of Japan and West Germany, but just as they began to catch up in basic manufacturing, the locus of growth and innovation changed from industrial to postindustrial capitalism -- from hardware to software (much of which is misleadingly labeled services). The United States was better suited for this new phase of capitalism, and has once again pulled ahead of its rivals.
Phillips could have benefited from a quick glance at the statistics. He writes that "the United States of 2000 was roughly as distant from its post-1945 peak share of world production as the Britain of 1910-14 had been from her own." The facts are these. In 1950, when Europe and Japan had still not recovered from World War II, the United States accounted for 27 percent of the world's output; 50 years later, with Europe and Japan fully recovered, the United States accounted for 23 percent of the world's output, with America's gross domestic product almost double that of Germany and Japan combined. By comparison, Britain in 1914 accounted for only 8.3 percent of the world's G.D.P., with its total already less than half that of the United States. The United States is obviously not without problems -- most notably, the growing economic inequality that Phillips cites -- but its flaws cannot plausibly be attributed to a dynamic of imperial decline.
In the book's last chapters, Phillips introduces a different cycle of history. With a nod to Will and Ariel Durant and Arthur Schlesinger, he suggests that the United States has alternated between periods of "wealth laudation" and "democracy." For the last two decades it has been in the throes of the former and could move still farther toward establishing "plutocracy by some other name." But it could also undergo a Schlesingerian reaction against plutocracy.
The reaction, Phillips says, could take one of two forms, "progressive" or "radical." The progressive reaction would consist of a mobilization like that of Theodore Roosevelt "against corruption, polarization and market Darwinism," reviving America and prolonging its ascendancy atop the pyramid of nations. The radical reaction would reflect American decline, recalling the politics of the Dutch Patriot Revolt of the late 18th century or the situation of the British Labor Party after World War II. Dreams of international pre-eminence would be abandoned; "economic nationalism" would be stressed. Among other things, America would impose "import duties to recapture the U.S. internal market for domestic producers and workers."
Like Phillips's schema of imperial decline, this theory of cycles doesn't entirely fit the facts, especially the facts of the politics of the last decade. Phillips, for instance, puts Theodore Roosevelt's administration squarely in the camp of democracy and progressivism and the Clinton administration in the camp of plutocracy and conservatism. But in fact the two administrations were similar both in what they attempted and what they accomplished.
Phillips sees the T.R. years as countering "Gilded Age wealth and income trends." He asserts that "farmers and workers seem to have gained ground between 1900 and 1914." Statistics from the turn of the last century are hard to come by, but one estimate -- cited in George W. Mowry's "Era of Theodore Roosevelt" and echoed by other historians -- is that the average real wages of urban workers was lower from 1900 to 1912 than from 1890 to 1900. Corporate consolidation and the destruction of the older craft industries also proceeded apace during the T.R. years. That doesn't mean T.R. wasn't a progressive reformer, only that he was frustrated by underlying economic trends as well as by political opposition.
Very similar conclusions can be drawn about the Clinton years. Phillips says that "the top percentiles became richer than ever while the lower portions of the society lost ground." The first part of this statement is correct, but the second isn't. During Clinton's second term, real wages finally began to rise, the result of low unemployment and of Clinton's earned income tax credit. Clinton was certainly not in T.R.'s class as a reformer, but he was by no means a friend of plutocracy. His administration was much more a reaction to than a continuation of Reagan's conservative policies.
Phillips's division of American politics among plutocrats, progressives and radicals is not altogether mistaken. It's just that the tripartition has been going on since at least 1992 and has been central to every subsequent presidential election. The two Bushes and Bob Dole represented, with appropriate reservations, the party of business and the market; Clinton and Gore were, for better or worse, representatives of a new T.R.-style progressivism; and Pat Buchanan and Ross Perot (and to some extent Ralph Nader) represented an angry economic nationalism. The terrorist attack of 9/11 has postponed the final resolution, but it will probably occur before the decade is over. Phillips deserves credit for laying out the alternatives, but his analysis is clouded by simplistic models of cyclical change.

A PIANO booms and tinkles, deep in the shadows of Hollywood's collective memory. Sometimes the keys are out of tune; sometimes a paper roll makes them thump mechanically. But the song is forever the same: "By the sea, by the sea, by the beautiful sea."
 On a screen that need be no grander than a bedsheet, young women flicker into view, dressed for the beach. They are Mack Sennett's Bathing Beauties. It is not clear why they have chosen to go swimming together, how the laws of physics have brought them into alignment or whether they will avoid, for long, the gentle attention of Mack Sennett's Keystone Kops. No matter. The Bathing Beauties inhabit early American cinema with a monarchical self-assurance. Vast tracts of the medium belong to them. 
 Were we to probe the nearer regions of Hollywood's memory, we would confirm the legitimacy of the Bathing Beauties' reign. When audiences take their seats in a near-black, windowless room, they love to watch actors frolic on the beach. Think of Burt and Deborah in "From Here to Eternity," Elvis and anybody in "Blue Hawaii," Annette and Frankie in anything. Hollywood means fun in the sand.
Or rather, it used to. In contemporary Hollywood, the beach has turned into a site of isolation, anxiety and horror. I do not think it coincidence that this change dates from 1975. With "Jaws," the movie industry entered the blockbuster era, and the Bathing Beauties ran screaming from the water, chased from their domain by a razor-mouthed killing machine.
If you scan the Variety list of all-time top-grossing movies, you will see that it is composed almost entirely of pictures released after "Jaws." We live in a period of fantastically lucrative films, which sail triumphantly into theaters, one after the other, on a flood of venture capital and marketing dollars. These films consistently evoke a dread of water.
Here, for example, is "Cast Away": No. 26 on the Variety list, with a domestic box-office of $233 million. The beach, in this picture, is a place where you get skinnier and crazier, with nobody to befriend you except for a single airhead. It's a situation strikingly reminiscent of the coked-out early blockbuster-era Hollywood that the late Julia Phillips described in her memoirs.
Turn to Variety's No. 32 movie, with its $216 million gross, and the terror intensifies. Colors turn to mud; fragments of flesh, bone and blood spray everywhere. We are in "Saving Private Ryan," where a day at the beach is an eternity of violent death. On what emotional reserves did Steven Spielberg draw when he mounted his indelible re-creation of D-Day? Maybe he was showing us how it felt to launch the campaign for a failed blockbuster -- for example, his own "1941."
The terminology of financial failure may suggest why moviemakers envision the swirling of water whenever they sink huge resources into a make-or-break project. Producers risk taking a bath, getting washed up, going down the drain (or its ruder equivalent). Think of an outsize, insanely expensive movie, which conceivably could have foundered like an outsize, insanely expensive vessel, and you will have the name of the No. 1 picture on the Variety list: "Titanic." As it happened, James Cameron's film floated; the reported domestic gross was $600 million. But no one could have guaranteed this success. The rich investment might have plunged, like Kate Winslet's jewel, into the depths -- or, to cite a costly misadventure of Cameron's, into "The Abyss."
The fortunes of Ms. Winslet's co-star may underscore the danger. When Leonardo DiCaprio returned to the screen after "Titanic," he ventured onto "The Beach," where he suffered terribly at the hands of armed thugs, and also reviewers.
No further examples should be needed (though I can't resist citing No. 39 on Variety's list, "Pearl Harbor," with its domestic take of $198 million). Still, there may be more than economics behind modern Hollywood's fear of the beach. I turn for guidance to someone who works in the industry and knows well the ways of horror: Stuart Gordon, director of "Re-Animator." Mr. Gordon confesses that he, too, finds water scary, though for practical reasons. He shot much of his recent horror movie, "Dagon," in and around the water, and he found that "it kills you."
"Steven Spielberg learned that with 'Jaws,' and Kevin Costner learned it with 'Waterworld,' " Mr. Gordon says. "It's complicated and expensive to make a movie with water. If one of your electrical cables falls in, everybody's fried."
What about the beach?
Mr. Gordon points to a segment from the recent HBO series "Project Greenlight," which tracked a first-time writer and director during the making of his film, "Stolen Summer." "The filmmakers are shooting on the beach in Chicago, and it looks like the most hellish experience ever. The actors can't swim, the water's freezing because it's April, the sand gets in everything and everybody. It's a nightmare. I mean, what about 'On the Beach'? That's the ultimate horror movie."
Is there no hope, then, of Hollywood's returning to the simple pleasures? Other national cinemas still know how to romp on the sand. Look at France, and "Pauline on the Beach." Look at Tunisia, for that matter, and "A Summer in La Goulette." Are Annette and Frankie gone forever?
"There's 'Baywatch,' " Mr. Gordon says. "That's all about the beach. MTV has a beach show where the kids hold wet T-shirt contests, and there's a bit of the beach in 'Dawson's Creek.' "
So even now audiences may sit indoors and enjoy fun in the sun. They just have to do it through the cheaper, quicker medium of television. That's where they can find present-day counterparts to the cheap, quick Bathing Beauties movies.
With thanks to Mr. Gordon, I return to economics as my explanation, and so look more deeply into Variety's list. I have to drop down to No. 159 before I find a film where people at least try to enjoy themselves in the water: "On Golden Pond." Suddenly, I feel old -- not as old as Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn, but creaky enough. Have beach movies disappeared because the investors are paunchy baby boomers? Is that what they really fear -- having to admit that they slacked off in their workouts and can't match Jane Fonda's way with a swimsuit?
Hypocrite reader! My look-alike! My brother! You want to escape this glare of self-knowledge and flee into the pleasures of the dark. But now the summer season is upon us, with its latest flotilla of blockbusters. Just when you thought it was safe to go back into the movies.

Final Grade for the Future

BYLINE:  By RICHARD WHITE; Richard White, Ph.D., is director of Career Services at Rutgers University in New Brunswick.

 BODY:
LAST May, when more than a million college seniors were donning their caps and gowns, I was asked by a reporter how I would grade the entry-level college job market. "B plus," I replied, "down from a solid A in 2000." The news -- not only economic, but also political and cultural -- has not been very good since then. 
 Members of the class of 2002, who entered college in September 1998 during a booming economy and with the world generally at peace, are graduating into a jittery reality. Their senior year was defined by 9/11, the anthrax scare (especially in New Jersey), declining job prospects and budget cuts at many schools around the country, all contributing to students' feelings of anxiety, procrastination, fatalism and even fear. The grade for this year's job prospects for graduating seniors? No better than a C. 
 The news is not all bad. Some Rutgers students have conducted successful job search campaigns and landed good, solid jobs. They were the early birds who used on-campus resources and personal networking to generate leads, interviews and offers. On the other hand, many other students, who two years ago would have produced a couple of offers, faced the stark reality of a 40 percent decline in online job postings and campus interviews -- 40 percent fewer opportunities to be noticed, interviewed and hired. Of course, this does not translate into a 40 percent unemployment rate or a 40 percent decline in actual jobs, but it does significantly increase the time and effort that students must commit to their job searches.
Meanwhile, the economic numbers coming out of Washington tell a different story. The Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, has essentially declared the recession over. The New Jersey Department of Labor also presents a fairly rosy scenario. For example, in the last quarter of 2001, while the nation lost 933,000 jobs, New Jersey actually had a net gain of 9,000. For the past 25 months, New Jersey's unemployment rate has been lower than the nation's. Currently, the state's rate is hovering around 5.5 percent.
So why do things feel so uncertain on college campuses in New Jersey and the rest of the country? For one thing, there is the lag between increased economic activity and hiring. But the deeper and more troubling issue is an underlying wariness to hire on the part of many employers.
Maybe life has returned to some semblance of normalcy -- the "new normal," as some commentators have put it -- but look around our towns, cities, campuses, schools, Little League baseball fields and especially in newspaper and television news reports, and there is a very uneasy feeling about the state of our nation and the world. Maybe some of those same uncomfortable feelings that have pervaded college campuses since Sept. 11 are more pronounced on Main Street and Wall Street than we actually realize.
We are an optimistic people by nature, forward-looking, flexible and willing to change. As a nation, we live by the business principle of "continuous improvement." Yes, the job outlook will get better, probably by the fall. While the current economic picture does not translate into lots of good job prospects for the class of 2002, graduates will survive and eventually thrive. As we tell our students at Rutgers, who will graduate May 23, it takes a lot of work to get work, especially in this job market.
Our good old-fashioned advice is more relevant than ever -- prepare a strong one-page resume; do lots of networking with friends, neighbors, local merchants and college alumni; start the process early; and use a multifaceted approach to finding a job, including career fairs, the Internet, on-campus interviewing and volunteer work.
And what about prospects for the class of 2003? My hope for these graduates is twofold: a B for the job market that they will enter a year from now and a senior year free from the tragic events and unsettled feelings that have seared this year into our memory forever.

HEADLINE: They're Thinking of a Number . . . 

BYLINE:  By VIRGINIA GROARK 

 BODY:
THE plan was hatched four years ago over breakfast at the Diamond Pizza Family Restaurant in East Hampton. Four men, then between the ages of 50 and 65, decided something had to be done about the town budget. After all, town officials were proposing an 8.9 percent tax increase.
 So the men, who knew each other from church, came up with a plan. How about a top-down budget approach? Instead of complaining about individual line items, like the cost of police officers' uniforms, why not just give the town an overall spending cap and then let town officials decide where to spend the money? 
 For example, the group, the Common Sense Citizen/Taxpayer Group of East Hampton, said it decided last year that the town needed $26,570,817 for the 2001-2002 fiscal year, a $978,000 increase from the previous year. The group came up with the number by using a formula that takes into account such things as cost of living increases, bond payments, and the growth of the grand list. 
The group eventually ended up supporting a compromise budget about $100,000 higher, which was then approved by voters. The group, which has gotten taxpayers' attention by holding its own budget information meetings and putting information on its Web site, said it was the fourth year in a row that voters approved a budget the group had supported. Common Sense will next be tested on Tuesday when the town's proposed 2002-2003 budget, of which the group disapproves, goes to referendum.
Peter Arcidiacono, one of the group's founders, acknowledged that it was difficult to determine whether the group caused the past budget referendums to turn out the way they did. But, he said, the point is that they have tried to take a reasonable approach to what can be emotional debates. "You certainly hear enough complaints about taxes," Mr. Arcidiacono said. "And I think we just gave voice to the people who felt that something is wrong and I should say that we try to empower them with information." 
The philosophy seems to be spreading. In nearby Hebron, where taxpayers are in yet another difficult budget season that is exacerbated by the recent property revaluation, a group has adopted the East Hampton organization's approach.
"We set down some ground rules, basically that we will look at the money and try to determine whether or not these proposals that keep coming up are affordable," said Ronald Winter, co-chairman and co-founder of Hebron Dollars and Sense. "But we are not going to be the old-fashioned taxpayers association where the only goals seem to be slash and burn and to get up in public meetings and call people names and get all angry and raise a lot of noise and stuff."
Just how far this movement will go is unclear. The East Hampton organization, which has eight members on its governing committee, has talked about starting a statewide taxpayers group, but has not moved forward with those plans.
And, it was clear at a recent Common Sense budget information meeting in East Hampton that not everyone agrees with the group's approach. "I think it's stupid," said Eric Henzy of East Hampton, who has three children in the local school system. "I don't think any government anywhere can or does budget that way."
William Simonsen, professor and director of the master of public administration program at the University of Connecticut, said that while taxpayer groups can be effective in accomplishing their goals, they may not necessarily reflect the attitudes of a town. "The question is, Do these groups represent the populace generally? And the answer to that is, Probably not," Mr. Simonsen said.
But the philosophy has added a new page to budget battles that are waged each spring in various communities around the state.
"The idea of taking a percentage of the grand list and making some assumptions and taking some of the fixed costs out of the equation and assuming some of the efficiencies, it's unique to me," said Robert Lee, the town manager of Hebron who has worked in municipal government since 1978. 
Municipal budget battles are a common rite of spring. For years, residents of cities and towns have turned out at budget meetings, either advocating for spending cuts or increases. Depending on that year's revenue stream, the budgets can be passed without a hitch or, in extreme cases, can be repeatedly defeated, leading to summers filled with emergency budget sessions, contentious meetings and referendums.
With the recent downturn in the economy, an increasing amount of taxpayers are becoming concerned about government spending, said Susan Kniep, vice president of the Federation of Connecticut Taxpayers Organizations and a former mayor of East Hartford.
"I think people are getting a little bit wiser," said Ms. Kniep, whose organization consists of about 25 groups around the state.
In communities like Hebron, an outer ring suburb of Hartford whose population has increased by 22 percent in the past 10 years, the budget seasons have come to reflect the growing pains of the town, where new subdivisions are sprinkled among farmland.
"The town has really been blowing up since the 70's," said Brian Lessard, chairman of the Hebron Board of Finance and a town resident for nine years. "It's largely a farming community that's getting developed, so as the farms turn into homes, the schools need to grow."
Just down Route 66, East Hampton saw its population jump 28 percent in the past 10 years, increasing from 10,428 to 13,352, according to United States Census figures.
Though East Hampton has a different character than Hebron -- it has a rich manufacturing history and was a prominent vacation spot -- they have at least one thing in common: Proposed budget increases have concerned some taxpayers.
In East Hampton, Common Sense decided to tackle its members' concerns by developing its formula. It asks that the town not spend more than 80 percent of its new grand list growth and it subtracts a half percentage point for efficiency.
"We feel that the professional managers that implement and oversee the budget should be able to, during the course of the fiscal year, find areas of savings," said James Mathias, chairman of Common Sense.
So what made these Common Sense members experts on budget issues? Though Mr. Mathias is a former tax examiner for the state, none of the original four is an accountant. But, Mr. Mathias said, they developed their knowledge by sifting through reams of state reports, like per pupil spending rates, and attending many municipal meetings.
"Since 1998, we have attended as many of the town council, board of finance and board of education meetings as we could," he said.
At a recent meeting of the group, Mr. Mathias expressed frustration that town leaders have not used a "top-down" approach in preparing the budget. But Alan Bergren, the town manager of East Hampton, said Common Sense has had some influence. The Town Council budget policy statement, for example, mentions a "top-down" approach. But, he said, while the town has tried to apply the formula in some places, sometimes it's difficult to do. "You have to take a look at the details also," Mr. Bergren said. "Formulas work only to a certain degree. And I think the council and the Board of Finance has tried to focus on a top-down approach and look at overall spending and see where you can control it, but there's some things that you can't control because you don't have direct control," such as the cost of insurance.
"There's got to be a balance," he added. "You can use these tools to kind of get an overall focus, but you've got to be careful and you've got to get a balance in there."
However, he said, the group has managed to increase the amount of dialogue on the budgets, so that more attention is paid to it. And, he said, "it's not acrimonious."
The civil dialogue is one reason why the Hebron group decided to take the East Hampton approach. The idea was welcomed, especially after last year's budget season, which some said was the most contentious in recent memory. For the first time in at least a decade, the town budget was rejected at a town meeting. In addition, the regional school budget went to three referendums before it was passed. 
The heated rhetoric spilled over to the town green, where signs dotted the grassy strip. Residents wrote letters to the local weekly newspaper and name calling was not unheard of. "People would have signs and others would drive up on their lawn and drive over them in daylight in front of children," said Victoria Avelis, chairman of the Hebron Board of Selectman. "When people encountered each other that were on the opposite side of the issue it was very tense."
Consequently, she said, people didn't want to repeat the same situation this year.
"After last year, everyone agreed that we couldn't do it with signs and neighbor versus neighbor yelling," she added. "You had to get more professional and I think that's what Hebron Dollars and Sense is doing, trying to be more professional, coolheaded. We all live together and we'd like to be able to disagree and agree to disagree and not end up not speaking to each other or anything worse than that." 
And this year could prove to be an especially difficult budget season. A recent property revaluation could lead to a significant increase in taxes. Combine that with the school budget increases, where fixed costs like salaries and insurance as well as the cost of opening the new high school, and the average tax increase could be as high as 9.48 percent, Mr. Lee said.
To help people adjust to the potentially large increase in taxes, Mr. Lee has put binders in the library and at the local supermarket, Ted's Foods, that show the new assessed value of every property in town, the current taxes and the proposed tax increases according to the latest budget proposal. The data also breaks down how much of the tax increase is due to the revaluation and to the proposed budget.
The same figures are also on Hebron Dollars and Sense's Web site, which it advertised with hand-painted signs that dot the town's rural roads. The Web site, which Mr. Winter said has received more than 3,000 hits, also explains the group's top-down approach and its formula, which is modeled on the one used in East Hampton. 
However, not everyone has welcomed the group's approach. For one, William Silver, superintendent of schools for Hebron and Regional School District No. 8, cautioned that it is not wise to present numbers without putting them context.
"It doesn't take into account any factors within the system," Mr. Silver said. "It can't account for a 21 percent increase in health insurance rates or the fact that kindergarten enrollment is going to be 25 percent higher than we anticipated or that a new building is opening and obviously there are going to be increased costs.
"There's a big difference between ability to pay and willingness to pay," he said, referring to the town's taxpayers.
The true test will be tomorrow, when the town budget goes to a vote. 
In the meantime, one thing is clear. At the end of April, the only sign on the town green was advertising a book sale.

HEADLINE: A Parched Job Market Greets New Graduates 

BYLINE:  By DAVID KOEPPEL 

 BODY:
RAJIAH WILLIAMS, a senior at Barnard College, thought she had done everything right to set herself up for a career in television. She got all A's and B's and was a producer for Columbia University's television station, a Head Start volunteer and a member of the French club. More important, she worked summers at Black Entertainment Television, CNN and Fairchild Publications, assuming that the experience and contacts would practically guarantee her a job after she graduated.
 It hasn't worked out that way. Over the last few weeks, ordinarily prime scouting time for employers on college campuses, Ms. Williams has landed only one interview for a job that actually existed, at NY1, the 24-hour news channel. Now, she is seriously considering riding out the hard times by moving to Paris to be an English tutor. 
 "I'm especially discouraged," said Ms. Williams, 21. "I've interned every summer since high school and always recognized the importance of the foot in the door and paying your dues. I never thought it would be a problem. I never thought I'd be in the position I'm in now."
With graduation only days away, Ms. Williams and thousands of other highly qualified job seekers in the New York City area are facing what recruiters, personnel executives and college career counselors agree is one of the most competitive job markets in more than a decade.
And they are advising graduating seniors who haven't found work to redouble their efforts and lower their expectations. In the current labor market, they say, students should scale back their salary demands, be willing to work for smaller companies and even consider relocating far from home.
"You have to use all your resources," said Trudy Steinfeld, the director of New York University's Office of Career Services. "Sitting around in your slippers, searching on the Internet is not going to cut it."
Specialists blame the usual suspects -- the sluggish economy; hard times on Wall Street and in the manufacturing and technology industries, and the reverberations of Sept. 11 -- for the bleak outlook in New York. But something of a more existential nature might be at work, too, in the view of one career manager. "The situation is made more complicated by the world picture," said Betty Feehan, senior manager of career services for the American Institute for Chemical Engineers, a trade organization. "People are edgy about making decisions."
Employers certainly are. Those who were surveyed last month by the National Association of Colleges and Employers said they expected a 36 percent decline this year in their hiring of college graduates; in the Northeast, they foresaw a 39 percent drop.
In such a buyers' market, students who just a couple of years ago watched companies tripping over themselves to entice graduating seniors with fat salaries and other perks are grateful to get even a single job offer. Others are opting out of the job market and heading off to graduate school.
"It's a stark turnaround: high supply and lower demand," said Dan Black, the area director of campus recruiting for Ernst & Young, one of the Big Five accounting firms. "In the recent past, it wasn't unusual for students to have three, four or five offers."
Mr. Black says Ernst & Young has already filled most of the 300 positions for its New York office, the same number as last year. But this year, it interviewed 10 to 15 percent more candidates and turned away many qualified applicants, he says.
He also noticed a shift in attitude in this year's crop of graduates. "In years past, students were saying, 'What can Ernst & Young offer me?' " he said. "Now applicants are more eager. They're saying, 'Hey, I can do whatever it takes.' "
Baruch College's director of career development, Patricia Imbimbo, believes there is another reason for the job drought besides the uneven economy: foolish overhiring in the boom years. "There was a war for talent," she said. "There were signing bonuses, offers being made to sophomores. It was a frenzy." As a result, many companies are now laying people off, not hiring them.
Stephanie Cohen, a senior at New York University who majored in secondary education, has broadened her job search to include marketing, public relations, human resources and publishing. She is currently working as an intern at Kenneth Cole, the leather-goods retailer, and was hoping that job would lead to full-time work in the marketing department.
In April, though, she was told there were no positions available. Now, she has set up a series of interviews, one with Kenneth Cole's international department and others for a marketing job at the Scholastic Corporation, a New York publisher, and for the position of community-service coordinator at a West Village community center.
Ms. Cohen, 22, has also been networking with friends and family members, and meets regularly with one well-connected acquaintance who has provided her with contacts at Conde Nast and American Express. "I worry about it every day," Ms. Cohen said of her job prospects. 
Career counselors think Ms. Cohen is on the right track. Ms. Steinfeld, the career-services director at New York University, advises students to master the nuts and bolts of job hunting, especially networking with everyone they know, attending professional association events and following up on resumes they send to potential employers.
John Challenger, chief executive of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, the outplacement firm, says college seniors should consider careers in government, insurance, health care and nonprofit organizations, where jobs may be more plentiful. Indeed, the survey by the National Association of Colleges and Employers shows that the federal government and the insurance industry are two of just a handful of sectors that are expected to step up hiring this year.
For all the obstacles, of course, many students are being hired. Abraham Salcedo, a New York University senior who completed an internship with PricewaterhouseCoopers last summer, has been offered a job as an accountant with the firm. And Meredith Silverberg, a senior at Barnard, has accepted a job as a legal assistant with Cravath, Swaine & Moore, the Manhattan law firm.
But other graduating seniors have concluded that looking for a job right now just is not worth the effort. After Teisha Covino, a New York University senior, saw her friends jumping through hoops, she scratched her plan to work for a couple of years before going to law school. Instead, she will attend the University of Pennsylvania Law School in the fall.
Likewise, says Ms. Feehan of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers, many top engineering students are heading straight to graduate school rather than spending a year or two in the field, a common practice in flush times. One student at Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, N.J., even abandoned his ambition to become a chemical engineer and joined his family's seafood business, she says.
Ms. Feehan says engineering students have a rough time looking for work because they tend to be introverts. Her advice: they should overcome their inhibitions and network like everybody else. "They need that New York chutzpah," she said.

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: Top 4 Floors in Chelsea to Be Above the Adjacent Structure; 
Condo Shaped Like Inverted L

BYLINE:  By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
At first glance it might seem as if it's going to be one building, but it's really two. The one on the left is a new nine-story condominium going up at 211 West 18th Street in Chelsea -- and its upper four floors hang over and are attached to the adjacent old five-story commercial building.
 When completed this summer the new building, shaped like an inverted L, will have eight loft apartments, including two duplexes. It replaces a four-story lumber store and warehouse that formerly stood on the site, between Seventh and Eighth Avenues. 
 By buying air rights over the adjacent building, at 209 West 18th Street, and merging the two 25-foot-wide lots, the developer, G & S Brown Investments of Manhattan, was able to build a structure taller than the 60 feet that current zoning allows on one narrow lot. It could also make the building wider in spots. "It was the only way to make the project viable from a zoning and economic perspective," said Steven Brown, a partner in the company with his brother Gary.
The brothers acquired 211 West 18th Street two and a half years ago from the estate of Alan Bernstein, whose father, Max, had begun the lumber business in 1935. They had bought lumber there for years. 
The brothers worked out an agreement with the owner of the adjacent structure to buy the air rights, combine the lots and refurbish that masonry building, which has a ground-floor plumbing supply store with a warehouse above. The brothers said that the total cost of the project, including construction and the purchase of the building and the air rights, would be just under $10 million.
John Cetra, a principal at Cetra/Ruddy Inc. of Manhattan, the project's architect, said that while the 211 building was strong enough to hold the new floors, hollow air shafts in its easterly wall had been filled and capped with reinforced concrete to provide even more support. Its roof was replaced with the additional floors, which were anchored to the new portion's structural steel frame, Mr. Cetra said, adding that the new building's westerly wall and the steel central columns in the 50-foot-wide floors are other anchors. 
Sales of the units, with one to four bedrooms and 1,140 to 2,995 square feet, are to start today. Insignia Douglas Elliman is handling sales. Prices for the units are $850,000 to $2.9 million. The new building is clad in glass and metal with a masonry trim on its westerly edge. Where the building spans over its neighbor it steps back and curves, to create "a harmony" between the two, Mr. Cetra said. This is the first new construction project in Manhattan for the company, which owns 20 buildings with a total of 200 rental apartments. An affiliate, Furnished Quarters, owns 425 more Manhattan apartments used as extended-stay residences. RACHELLE GARBARINE

HEADLINE: Streetscapes/903 Park Avenue, at 79th Street; 
1914 Apartment House Once Called World's Tallest

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER GRAY 

 BODY:
THE scaffolding is going up -- and up and up -- on 903 Park Avenue, built in 1914 as the tallest apartment house in the world. The owner says the work is just routine, but the 17-story building was anything but, a sumptuous multiple dwelling designed to attract millionaires.
 By the early 1910's, the lawyers Alexander M. and Leo S. Bing had just entered the real estate business. By the 1920's they were among the most active apartment developers in New York, often working with Emery Roth on buildings like the Alden, at 82nd and Central Park West, and the Southgate complex of apartment houses on the south side of 52nd Street between First Avenue and the East River. 
 For one of their earliest projects, begun in 1912, they chose the northeast corner of 79th Street and Park Avenue. At that time Park was evolving from a wide boulevard of middle-class five- and six-story apartment buildings to one of mansions and tall luxury buildings. 
For 903 Park Avenue they hired Robert T. Lyons, who had designed the picturesque St. Urban, at 89th and Central Park West, and Warren & Wetmore, who had just finished co-designing Grand Central Terminal and had designed swank clubs and mansions. Unlike most other structures, apartment buildings were governed by fairly detailed laws, and buildings more than 150 feet high required a higher standard of fire-resistant construction. Thus that height, translating to about 12 stories, became the default standard along West End, Park and other avenues where apartment developers were active. 
But the corner of 79th and Park presented an unusual opportunity. Multiple-dwelling heights were also governed by the width of the street, through rules similar but not identical to the provisions that would be adopted in the 1916 Zoning Resolution, which applied to all building types. If the Bings would spend more on fireproofing, their corner could go up one and a half times the 140-foot width of Park Avenue, or 210 feet -- 17 stories, as construction practices indicated at the time.
"World's Highest Apartment House," The New York Times said in 1912, although the newspaper did not mention which building held the previous height record. 
The Times remarked that the Paterno Brothers, another development firm, had contemplated a 16-story building on the west side of Broadway between 115th and 116th Streets but had decided that the economics did not justify it. But Bing & Bing did, and Leo Bing ventured a revealing opinion to The Times: "Mr. Bing believes that the upper floors of the new 17-story house will be in greater demand than the lower floors and the price of the five top floors will be slightly higher than the middle and lower sections." These were super-apartments, full floors, some with 18 rooms and 5 baths, renting for around $10,000 a year. A period floor plan shows a 13-foot-wide circular foyer and living rooms of 20 by 26 feet, with the largest bedroom measuring 20 by 23 feet. Each apartment had its own laundry, six servants' rooms and a servants' dining room.
An account in Real Estate Magazine in 1913 gives an idea of how the developers aimed at their market. The dining room walls were finished in blue and gold silk, the master bedroom in "French gray" silk. The bedroom hallway had a mosaic floor, with a six-inch-high marble baseboard. The bathrooms had showers, tubs and bidets, and all the apartment window frames were bronze -- apparently a fireproofing measure.
If the four bedrooms were not enough, new tenants could arrange to make up or down connections to more bedrooms from adjacent apartments. Although most servants' rooms were at a distance from the bedrooms, there was a "personal maid's room" leading on to the main hall. Each kitchen had its own silver safe and garbage incinerator, and there was also a steam-cleaning apparatus in the basement for garbage pails. But most revealing was a separate scullery, set apart from the kitchen, "it being intended that no rough work shall be done in the kitchen," the magazine said.
The exterior was described as being in "tapestry brick," which usually indicated a soft, mottled mixture of green, gray and buff; the building is now so soiled it appears to be a monochrome gray. But there wasn't a lot of art to this new breed of apartment building; The Times noted that the solid walls were "relieved by a few artistic balconies."
Apparently Bing & Bing planned this building for sale, and in February 1914 they sold it to Maria DeWitt Jesup, the widow of the banker Morris K. Jesup, who had been president of the American Museum of Natural History. She had inherited $9 million from her husband in 1908, and she gave the museum multiple gifts, including the 34-ton Ahnighito meteorite, still on display there. Perhaps it was a financial advisor who arranged the purchase of 903 Park -- Mrs. Jesup was 80 when she died in June 1914. 
The tenants attracted to 903 Park Avenue included William Seward Webb, a physician who had forsaken medicine and become rich enough in railway investments to build an expansive estate in Vermont now known as Shelburne Farms. He lived at 903 with his wife, Elizabeth, and 11 servants; most were of Scottish and English birth and had arrived in the United States in the previous 10 years. When he died in 1926 his obituary in The Times noted that he "became one of the first owners of an old Fifth Avenue mansion to move into a Park Avenue apartment."
A tenant in the 1930's was Walter Hoving, president of Lord & Taylor and later head of Tiffany & Company. In November 1938 he was involved in a minor dispute about a simulated blizzard in Lord & Taylor's Christmas windows. The Fifth Avenue Association, of which he was a director, protested that the imitation snowflakes violated the association's ban on moving displays. Mr. Hoving immediately complied, although he pointed out that the Christmas windows were not designed to sell merchandise. 
IN 1917 the Jesup estate sold 903 Park Avenue to the investor Vincent Astor of the real estate family. A few years later, Astor built a town house around the corner at 130 East 80th Street. 
By the 1920's, other, taller apartment buildings had gone up. Sometime after 1940 most of the apartments were cut up, although there are three floors left more or less intact: a doctors' suite, and two residential units. Perhaps 20 or 30 years ago, the ornamental balconies were shaved off.
Last month, workers began putting pipe scaffolding up around the facades. The building is still a rental, and Marianne Dziuba, senior vice president of Stahl Real Estate, the owner, said that the firm was planning normal maintenance and needed the pipe scaffolding because the overhanging copper cornice projects so far out that scaffolding hung from the roof will not work. 
She said that the copper cornice, which is sagging in some parts, would be repaired, and that other pointing work would go on, although the firm was not certain whether it would clean the building. Stahl Real Estate declined to respond to questions about current rents.
She said that in the last few years the firm had begun to restore the circular entry foyers that remain on most floors and that, unlike many rental building managers, she had not replaced the old windows but had stripped and shined the bronze. 
"They don't leak, they're still in good shape," she said. "They were really built to withstand the centuries."

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/Carroll Gardens; 
Area of Gardens and 19th-Century Charm

BYLINE:  By AARON DONOVAN 

 BODY:
A CENTURY ago, Carroll Gardens was a working-class neighborhood in Brooklyn, home to thousands of Irish immigrants. In the decades before World War II, the Irish moved out and first-generation Italians moved in.
 The neighborhood kept its Italian-American character for decades and to a large degree retains it still. But in recent years a new group has begun to settle in the area -- young urban professionals. 
 "They're from Iowa, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Kansas, all over the heartland of America," said Salvatore J. Scotto, known as Buddy, the president of the Carroll Gardens Association and the informal mayor of the area. "When they come here into the neighborhood, they feel great because everybody's looking after everybody else. They realize that people around here care about them. They don't get that feeling in Manhattan because Manhattan is just too busy." 
For the moment, the usual order of property transfer in this urban neighborhood of three- and four-story brownstones and federal brick town houses has undergone a reversal. People are moving in when they attain a certain degree of wealth, rather than the other way around.
An urban renaissance has led people of means to stay put. Mr. Scotto, for example, was ready to leave in 1964. "Like everybody, it was time to move to the suburbs," he said. But his parents encouraged him to stay, and he founded the association.
The neighborhood took its name from the new civic association that Mr. Scotto had founded. Carroll Gardens was formerly just a section of a larger area called South Brooklyn, which also included what is now Cobble Hill and Boerum Hill. The most recent indication of the neighborhood's changes has been the transformation of its main commercial street, Smith Street, from a dreary gray strip to a rejuvenated row of cafes, boutiques and clubs that draws people from outside the neighborhood.
"When I first moved here, you wouldn't walk on Smith Street at night," said Laurie Alicea, 38, who moved to Sackett Street 30 years ago with her family. "Now, it reminds me of the Village."
The neighborhood's two commercial streets run north and south through its center. In addition to Smith Street, which lies above the F and G subway lines, Court Street, one block to the west, has also experienced a recent commercial growth.
Real estate agents say that residents are attracted to the area for its 19th-century charm and quiet tree-lined streets, its shops within walking distance and its location not far from the offices in Downtown and Midtown Manhattan.
The areas to the west of Court Street are the most sought after in the neighborhood, especially the blocks where the row houses have deep, verdant front yards. It is these gardens from which the neighborhood got its name. They exist between Court and Henry Streets, from First Place to Fourth Place. On this side of the neighborhood, the poplars are so thick with leaves that one cannot see the upper floors of the buildings without crossing the street.
The name Carroll comes from Charles Carroll of Maryland, a signer of the Declaration of Independence. During the Revolutionary War, he led a regiment of 400 men that tried to regain from the British a strategically placed farmhouse on the Gowanus Creek, now the Gowanus Canal. About 300 of his men were killed in the attacks, which took place in August 1776. A street, a park and then the neighborhood were named after him.
Between Court and Smith the buildings are similar to those to the west, but the trees are fewer and smaller. Between Smith and the Gowanus Canal, the neighborhood's eastern border, the buildings too are smaller and some blocks are devoted to industrial use. This side of the neighborhood also has blocks with front-garden lots, from President Street to Second Street between Smith and Hoyt Streets.
In the past, the blocks near the canal frequently suffered from putrid smells emanating from the stagnant, polluted canal. But in 1999 a long-unused flushing propeller was reactivated to circulate the water, and in the years since, the smell has vanished and birds and fish have come to the canal, as have weekend kayakers, said Craig Hammerman, district manager for Community Board 6, which includes Carroll Gardens.
Mr. Scotto said he hoped that with the changes, some of the industrial blocks, which had formerly housed businesses that used the canal for shipping, could now be converted to mixed-income residential use.
Over the past 10 years, prices for homes have steadily climbed, real estate agents said, until about a year ago, when they leveled off as the recession began to take hold. A multifamily brownstone or brick town house typically sells for $650,000 to $1.3 million, depending first on size, then location and condition. In multiple-family buildings, the owners often live in a garden apartment and rent the upper floors, or live in an upper-floor duplex or triplex and rent out the lower floors.
Neighborhood rents are about $1,000 for a studio, $1,200 to $1,600 for a one-bedroom apartment and $1,800 to $2,500 for a two-bedroom apartment, said Michael Mayo, manager of Carroll Gardens Realty, which specializes in rentals. There are few co-ops or condominiums in the area, but those that are available, like the newly built Carroll Gardens Condominiums on the south side of Degraw Street, are usually about $400 a square foot, which for a two-bedroom unit translates to about $400,000 to $450,000, according to Christopher Thomas, the director of the Brooklyn office of the William B. May Company.
The neighborhood is in many ways similar to Cobble Hill and Boerum Hill, the two other former slices of South Brooklyn that lie to the north of Degraw Street. "It's the same thing, the exact same thing," Mr. Mayo said with a wave of the arm at his office at Degraw and Smith Streets encompassing all the neighborhoods nearby.
But there are subtle differences. While subway service in Carroll Gardens is limited to the F and G trains, the other neighborhoods each have at least 10 lines within walking distance. And while the long blocks of Boerum Hill seem to stretch on as far as the eye can see, in Carroll Gardens at many intersections with Smith and Henry Streets, the corners of the east-west streets often do not quite line up with one another. The ability to see the end of a street a few blocks away creates a feeling of, if not exactly coziness, manageability. And on the streets that are affected, there is less traffic, Mr. Hammerman said. 
PRICES in the neighborhood are similar to neighboring regions. "The bigger brownstones are going to sell in the same range as anything you're going to get in Boerum Hill or Cobble Hill," said Sal Capozucca, a lifelong Carroll Gardens resident who has a real estate office on Atlantic Avenue in Boerum Hill, where he uses the name Sal Cappi.
Mr. Thomas said Cobble Hill's slightly higher prices might be attributable to the fact that the area was desirable for doctors and others who wanted to be located near Long Island College Hospital in Cobble Hill.
There is one public elementary school in the neighborhood: P.S. 58, the Carroll School, on Smith Street, where 51 percent of all students read at or above grade levels last year, about 6 percentage points above above the citywide average, 45.3 percent. Students often advance to Intermediate School 293 in Boerum Hill. 
The neighborhood is also home to Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary and St. Stephen Roman Catholic Parish School on Summit Street, which has an enrollment of 220 students from prekindergarten through eighth grade.
On the church itself, just east of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, weather-worn letters under the steeple clock spell out the words "Drive Carefully."
There are two other Roman Catholic churches in the area, St. Mary Star of the Sea, on Court Street between Nelson and Luquer Streets, and St. Agnes Church on Sackett Street at Hoyt Street. There is also an Episcopal Church, St. Paul's, at the corner of Clinton and Carroll Streets. Another church, Old Westminster, at 450 Clinton Street at the corner of First Place, with wrought-iron gates, antique-style street lamps and stone Romanesque architecture, has been turned into co-op apartments.
A stroll down Sackett Street shows the dynamic at play in Carroll Gardens. Ms. Alicea, the 30-year resident, said she appreciated the new commercial vigor on Smith Street but said that she felt the neighborhood had lost some of the friendliness she remembered growing up and that most of her friends had moved to Staten Island.
She confessed to staying because her grandmother owned her building and charged below-market rent. Reflecting on the appeal of the greater space and privacy that attracted many of her former schoolmates to other neighborhoods, she said, "Maybe it's because I grew up here, but the brownstones don't do anything for me."
A few doors down, Doug Klosterman, 32, an architect from St. Louis, unloaded a truck as he moved into a fourth-floor walkup that rents for $1,400 a month. He had no such brownstone fatigue. "Everyone had great things to say about the area," he said.

Any temptation to trail a hand in the water was stanched by a mention of the hepatitis and cholera microbes that had been found there." But on May 3, 1999, the canal was transformed when the propeller that sits at its head was activated for the first time since it broke in the early 1960's. While the bottom of the canal is still tainted with a century of industrial waste and, legend has it, a few Mafiosi, the propeller circulates the once-stagnant water. The odor is gone, said Jeanne DiLascio, executive director of the Gowanus Canal Community Development Corporation. Because of that, she said, she expects real estate prices along the canal to increase. "I think Carroll Gardens and Park Slope will be connected in the near future," she said, "with a body of water that's not a separator, but a connector."

HEADLINE: The Odd Couple 

BYLINE:  By BARBARA FITZGERALD 

DATELINE: MADISON 

 BODY:
TEN minutes before the cameras begin to roll, the two former governors are huddled like unflappable executives debriefing each other before a board meeting.
 The conversation between the two, Tom Kean and Brendan Byrne, is relaxed as they stroll the corridors of Mead Hall at Drew University, awaiting a signal that it is time to start taping a television interview on Governor McGreevey's evolving budget in the face of a gaping $5.3 billion deficit and a testy Legislature. 
 The pair need little time to prepare. After all, they have both juggled billions of dollars -- each having had to manufacture his own budget in two consecutive terms. Mr. Kean knows what he is going to say, and though Mr. Byrne is carrying a briefing book, he tosses it aside as they take their seats and begin the interview. There is a chemistry, formed by years of moving in the same political circles, observing each other's tennis serve and sharing stories only the small circle of former governors would understand. 
After about five minutes, Kent Manahan, the anchorwoman for the New Jersey Network, asks the obvious: whether the budget at this point is not just a work in progress. Certainly some deals will be cut with the Legislature, won't they?
Mr. Kean and Mr. Byrne look at each other and say simultaneously in mock disbelief, "Deals? . . . Deals? . . . In Trenton?"
The two are on a roll. They're entertaining. They're informative. They are A-list invitees, on the speed dial of the current governor, James E. McGreevey. In addition, they have a regular column that appears in The Star-Ledger.
They are, in short, the antidote to two grumpy old men. And they could not have come from more diverse backgrounds. Mr. Kean, who is 67, is a moderate Republican from Far Hills, and the 78-year-old Mr. Byrne is a scrappy Irish-American Democrat from West Orange -- yet they act and move almost as brothers. 
True, both graduated from Princeton, the state's premier university. But while Mr. Byrne financed his education through the G.I. Bill after serving in the Army Air Corps in World War II, Mr. Kean of the broad vowels was the product of a family steeped in wealth and politics, and four years at Princeton was a natural progression. After all, his grandfather had served in the United States Senate, and his father was a member of the House of Representatives for 20 years.
As for Mr. Byrne, his family was involved in politics on the local level -- his father was the police and fire commissioner in West Orange and his grandfather was an alderman -- but none of the land his family had owned was a gift from the King of England, a boast that Mr. Kean could make.
After graduating from Princeton, Mr. Kean taught history at St. Mark's, an elite prep school in Southboro, Mass. But he left to earn a master's degree at Columbia. Mr. Byrne, on the other hand, went to Harvard Law and began practicing in 1950. There is more than just a shared political experience, however; there is that chemistry. Mr. Byrne, who is outgoing and witty, plays well against the reserved, articulate Mr. Kean.
In the post-Newt Gingrich era, putting a Democrat and a Republican together on television is almost as likely to draw blood as it is civil discourse. Yet the two elder statesmen serve as a reminder of how the game was played in a gentler time. While others talk over one another and -- as often as not -- scramble for the low ground, Mr. Kean and Mr. Byrne might disagree, but they don't stake their claim at 10 paces.

'A Very Deep Affection'
"There is a very deep affection," said Carl Golden, who was Governor Kean's press secretary. "They have become the elder statesmen of New Jersey politics -- not their party, but New Jersey politics as both of them would like to see it practiced. That is, with vigor, but with not such a partisan edge and coarseness to it."
The state's two other living governors -- Christie Whitman and Jim Florio, are not nearly as close, and they do not enjoy the same popularity.
To be sure, their approaches are vastly different, which widens their appeal. Mr. Kean has never given a political interview in his home; Mr. Byrne has never had an unlisted telephone number. When asked to be interviewed, Mr. Kean chose his office at Drew University; Mr. Byrne arranged lunch at a Chinese restaurant that featured live jazz. Mr. Kean was alone; Mr. Byrne arrived with his wife, Ruthi, and invited nearly as many people as he ran into along the way to join them, debriefing guests about the best selections on the menu.
In 1973, when Mr. Byrne decided to run for governor, he had never before held elective office. Rather, his career had been propelled by mentors who brought him along and appointed him to important positions. On the other hand, Governor Kean -- although born with a plethora of social and political connections -- worked his way to the State Legislature in 1969, eventually becoming Assembly speaker in 1972 before running for governor five years later.
Unlike Mr. Byrne, however, Mr. Kean was not elected his first time out. After a successful run in 1981, his popularity soared. Indeed, last year he was asked by several leading Republicans to take on the incumbent Senator Robert Torricelli -- tarnished after years of federal investigations into his campaign finances -- but he chose to stay out of today's rough-and-tumble world of partisan politics.
Mr. Byrne, who was responsible for enacting the state's first income tax law, did not enjoy as much popularity while in office but was candid enough to win a second term. He has remained active in political circles, all the while cultivating his humor and wit.
To lift a line from the mayor of Newark, Sharpe James, they seem like "the real deal," unblemished by pollsters telling them what positions to take. Even when in office, the two acknowledged that they often did not listen to the political wisdom of the day. For Mr. Byrne, that meant no apologies for a statewide income tax. For Mr. Kean, it meant ignoring Republicans who told him to stay out of the troubled cities. Mr. Kean, who made "the politics of inclusion" a major theme of his campaign, remains one of the last statewide Republican candidates to have won black and minority votes handily.
Yet although he enjoys great popularity, he jokes that he is sometimes mistaken for Mr. Byrne. "Just yesterday, the guy who was pumping my gas came up and said, well, he called me Governor Byrne," he said, " 'Governor Byrne, I love your column. I read it every week.' That happens to me, and I know it happens to him. We get confused a little bit by the public."
One time, Mr. Kean joked, he even signed an autograph as Brendan Byrne. "Somebody came running up to me and said, 'Governor Byrne, Governor Byrne, I'd love to meet you; I admire you and the column and everything else' and he said, 'Can I have your autograph?' " Mr. Kean recalled. "So I signed Brendan Byrne."
As for the spirited Mr. Byrne, he readily acknowledged that his popularity took a longer time to cultivate.
"He was always popular," Mr. Byrne said. "For me, it's distance. I put through that income tax and was roundly booed. My popularity when I was re-elected was in the high 30's; it never got to be 50 percent."
In fact, he said, a big reason he won re-election was that people realized that his income tax program made sense.
"It was really the last election decided on issues and not popularity," he said. "My campaign was classic. It was on the issue of do we need an income tax or don't we need an income tax. I would stand up and debating my opponent and say, 'If you want to elect a nicer guy, vote for him, but if you want this and that and want soundness of fiscal policy, you've got to look at me.' "
Luck and circumstance initially thrust Mr. Byrne into politics. He was working for a lawyer named Joseph Weintraub, who became counsel to Gov. Robert Meyner in 1954. As it happened, Mr. Byrne was brought along as an assistant. It was a time of celebration for Democrats, since Dwight D. Eisenhower, a Republican, was president, and a Democrat had not been elected governor since 1940.
"Meyner took a liking to me," Mr. Byrne recalled. "Then I became secretary to Governor Meyner, which is now like chief of staff, and I stayed with him for almost two years." Toward the end of his second term, the governor -- "he was sort of a father figure to me" -- asked Mr. Byrne what he wanted to do next.
"I've always been a lawyer," Mr. Byrne said he replied. "I'd love to be prosecutor of Essex County."

Reputation for Integrity
By "sheer luck," he said, there was an opening in 1959, so "they could do it without my paying political dues."
As prosecutor, Mr. Byrne earned a reputation for integrity, a trait that would position him well during his race for governor in 1973, an era dominated by fallout from the Watergate scandal.
"When I was prosecutor, the F.B.I. was doing some wiretaps," he recalled. "On one of them, they picked up a conversation about me in which they were saying, 'This guy is a Boy Scout . . . you can't get to him . . . he can't be bought.' Now Watergate comes along, and the prime quality is honesty. And so I was certified."
While Watergate was good for Mr. Byrne, it was a difficult time for Republicans like Tom Kean, who eventually retired from the State Legislature. "I was speaker of the Assembly during the beginning of Watergate," Mr. Kean said. "Right in the middle of Watergate we had an election and I came back as minority leader of 14 Republicans."
He recalled: "I remember walking down the street in Livingston and somebody shouted at me and said they wanted to say hello to me. And they said, 'You know, you're the best legislator we've ever had and I just want to thank you for that . . . but he said I'm going to tell you I'm going to vote against you because we've got to send a message to Nixon.' "
Nonetheless, Mr. Kean won re-election to the Assembly. And even though Republicans bounced back somewhat in the next election, they remained in the minority, prompting him to eventually retire from the Assembly in 1978 because he "couldn't take the minority any longer."
"I'd been so used to being in the majority -- not only the majority but I'd been majority leader and speaker and all that so you could really craft legislation and feel good at night when you got home because you got this and that done," he said. "But in the minority, it's fun for a while because you throw rocks into the process and slow things down, but it's not as much fun."
Mr. Kean had decided to run in the gubernatorial primary against Ray Bateman, who at the time was Senate president. He did not think he had any chance of winning -- which was an accurate assumption -- but he realized that the experience would be good and he wanted the bully pulpit.
"I wanted to say what I thought was important in the state, and what I thought was wrong," he said. "You can do that when you run for governor. You don't have to win. But if you're a serious candidate, what you say gets paid attention."
He said that "while everybody else was talking about the income tax, I was talking about education."
Though Mr. Kean did not win the primary, he established a core group of supporters who urged him to run again. The second time around, he only had three county chairman supporting him. 
"From the time I declared in the primary until the time I was elected governor, not a single poll said I would win either the primary or the general," Mr. Kean said.
But he did have one advantage over his opponents: He had done this before. "I knew what was important and what wasn't, politically," Kean said.
Mr. Kean emerged victorious from the primary and went on to win in November.
Even in their younger days, these two old warriors were on each other's radar screen. While Mr. Byrne was governor, he appointed Mr. Kean -- who was Assembly speaker -- to the Highway Authority. And when Mr. Kean was later elected governor, he appointed Mr. Byrne to the Sports and Exposition Authority. But it was not until Mr. Kean was elected governor, and Democrats controlled the State Legislature, that their relationship deepened.
"He and I used to get together very often in my early years as governor," Mr. Kean recalled. "We'd get away from the State House, usually prior to a tennis game, and I'd ask him very frankly things that you can only ask people who have had the same job before you. He was enormously free and helpful with his advice."
"We had the worst recession going on since the Great Depression, and I had a budget deficit that approached a billion dollars," Mr. Kean recalled. "I asked him all sorts of advice about ways to save money . . . I had a Democratic Legislature, so he was very helpful as I asked him questions about how you deal with certain members, how you could communicate with them, get across your point of view."
Listening was how Mr. Kean got his start in politics. One of the first people he listened to was a professor at Princeton, who had told him that one of the most exciting things he had done was work for a presidential campaign that did not have a chance of winning, because it enabled the staff to get closer to the candidate.
Mr. Kean said he took the advice and joined the presidential campaign of William Scranton. At the time of his presidential bid in 1964, Mr. Scranton, the governor of Pennsylvania, said he was drawn to the race because of the battle over the Civil Rights Act. His campaign was largely about making the Republican Party more inclusive, a theme Mr. Kean would continue to preach. Bill Bradley, who was still a Republican, also worked on the Scranton campaign. But while Mr. Kean became energized and worked within the party to try to make it more inclusive, Mr. Bradley, who would go on to become a United States senator from New Jersey, decided to switch parties.
"I got very excited by the process," said Mr. Kean, adding that he was told that if he was serious about pursuing politics he needed to get involved on the local level.
With that, Mr. Kean called Webster Todd, Christie Whitman's father, who was then chairman of the state Republican Party. Mr. Todd made Mr. Kean the party's youth coordinator for the state. After two years, Mr. Kean decided to run for the Assembly.
Despite their love of politics, both Mr. Byrne and Mr. Kean concede that if they had to run in today's political climate, with such a heavy emphasis on raising money, they might not have entered their races.
"I have never made a phone call in my life asking people for money," Mr. Byrne said. "You only had to raise a little bit, and we raised no money between elections. I got elected in 1973, served four years and never asked anybody for a dime. But we ran campaigns for almost nothing."
He added, "If when I had run in 1973, they said you have to have $25,000 of your own money, I could not have run."
In fact, when Mr. Byrne left office in 1982, he said, he had to borrow money from his children to pay for a house.
As for Mr. Kean, he also did not use any of his own money when he ran for governor.
"People consider me thrifty," Mr. Kean joked. "Brendan considers me cheap."
On a more serious level, however, Mr. Kean said that he did not believe that it was fair for candidates to pump much of their own money into a race. "I think you should be in the same competition as everybody else," he said.

A Nastier Political Process
Of course that notion of campaign finance -- as well as the whole political process -- has changed since Mr. Kean and Mr. Byrne were involved.
"It's nastier," Mr. Kean, which may explain why he chose not to run for the Senate this year against Mr. Torricelli, who is known to be a tough campaigner. "The kind of ads that people run against each other now are pretty outrageous in their inaccuracies as well as their innuendoes."
Yet life goes on, as does the next generation of Keans and Byrnes; both men have sons who have entered the political arena. Mr. Kean's son Tom is a member of the Assembly. And Mr. Byrne's son Tom is a former chairman of the state Democratic Party. But they both concede that with the vast amounts of money now required to run for office, and the system favoring incumbents, it is much harder for their children to seek public office than it ever was for them. 
That said, the two remain loyal to the reasons that first drew them into politics: shaping and giving voice to issues they believe are important today. And so through their column and their television appearances, they remain at the forefront of political discussions throughout the state.
"Through the years," Mr. McGreevey said, "Governor Byrne and Governor Kean have served as mentors and have been invaluable to me with regard to their insight and wisdom."
Jim Willse, editor of The Star-Ledger, said he knew immediately that he should ask the two men to do a column for the newspaper after he saw them on NJN News during an election night seven years ago.
"I was taken by the chemistry between them, how smart they were, how knowledgeable they were and how they enjoyed each other's company," Mr. Willse said.
Ms. Manahan of NJN feels the same way. "It's just been a terrific opportunity, really, for the people of New Jersey to hear from two former governors, who obviously have a relationship with one another but have different perspectives on different issues," she said. "The governors will get into it with one another, and sometimes they may differ sharply . . . yet there is a certain gentlemanly civility here."
And they are still doing in their own inimitable way.
A perfect example is an exchange between Mr. Kean and Mr. Byrne during the last gubernatorial election. Mr. Byrne was making the point that Mr. McGreevey had successfully defined his Republican opponent, Bret Schundler, on two issues: abortion and guns. For his part, Mr. Byrne thought the race was over when Mr. McGreevey kept hammering at "guns and girls."
"Tom Kean said you can't say guns and girls," Mr. Byrne recalled. "O.K., women and weapons."

HEADLINE: In Hell's Kitchen, a Changing Skyline 

BYLINE:  By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
WHEN the star-crossed lovers of "West Side Story," Tony and Maria, longingly sang, "There's a place for us," they could hardly have conceived what would become of their gritty neighborhood -- tower after tower of sleek luxury residential buildings casting shadows across their low-lying warren of 19th-century tenements.
 Certainly, today's rents of up to $5,600 a month for a penthouse in those richly appointed high-rise buildings -- even if adjusted downward for decades of inflation -- would have proved prohibitive for late-1950's denizens of a community that is still referred to by some as Hell's Kitchen and by others, more genteelly, as Clinton. 
 And besides, not one of the glistening facades has a zigzag fire escape bolted to it -- though there are terraces.
Over the last three years, like widespread fingers reaching skyward from West 34th to 59th Streets, close to a dozen residential buildings have opened their doors to new tenants, recently topped off construction or are still filling in their skeletal girders. Others remain, for now, gaping excavations waiting to be steel-fed by looming cranes. 
The burst of residential development -- most of it in a westward corridor along 41st, 42nd and 43rd Streets from Eighth Avenue to the Hudson River, with other sites scattered to the north and south -- is rising above a community of stooped and corniced walk-up buildings, their halls lined by railroad flats. The tenements, some dating to the 1850's, are scattered among body shops, car washes, parking lots, warehouses, factories and regiments of tractor-trailers behind razor-wired fences. Not to mention an ample supply of saloons.
And while real estate executives see great potential for further residential development of the area, and city planners envision a westward expansion of office-dominated Midtown into what they consider one of the few remaining underused expanses of Manhattan, there are local officials, longtime residents and community curmudgeons who like things much as they are. They fear for the extinction of another New York neighborhood with its vintage character and colorful, if somewhat seedy, past.
"Fifty-story skyscrapers are out of character, out of line," said John Fisher, president of the Clinton Special District Coalition, a local civic group. "They are not good, just not good." 
The forces for change disagree. "This was a rundown area ravaged with prostitution," said Lisa Silverstein, vice president for residential development for Silverstein Properties, which already has one luxury tower well occupied in the community, and another in the works. "This is one of the unsaturated pockets of New York, and things are happening and will continue to happen over there in terms of development."
In December, the New York City Planning Department released a document titled, "Far West Midtown: A Framework for Development," a plan that calls for the transformation of the southern portion of Clinton -- from 28th Street to 41st Street and Eighth Avenue to the river -- into office towers, some residential buildings and parks. At the same time, the Jets of the National Football League are pressing a $1 billion plan for construction of a sports and entertainment complex over the rail yards between 30th and 33rd Streets and 10th to 12th Avenues, a project that could also be a component of the city's bid for the 2012 Olympics.
All of which would be dependent on a $1.5 billion extension of the crosstown No. 7 subway line, farther west from its Seventh Avenue terminus and south to 34th Street.
"The plan," said Richard Barth, director of the City Planning Department's Manhattan office, "is a recognition that the city needs space to grow, particularly the central Midtown business district. It recognizes that this area offers one of the prime opportunities for the city to meet its economic needs over a 20-, 30-year horizon." 
The residential towers along that 42nd Street corridor and sprinkled, mostly, to the north all the way to the 75-story AOL Time Warner residential and office complex now rising at Columbus Circle, along with the city's far west office visions, the sports complex proposal and the possible extension of the No. 7 line, are all proving a bit unnerving for Simone Sindin, the chairwoman of Community Board 4.
"This is scary," said Ms. Sindin, whose board covers Clinton and Chelsea. "This is having your world changed and the rug pulled out from under your feet."
Mr. Fisher of the Clinton coalition insisted: "The city has to realize that maintaining neighborhoods is important. They're claiming that the area below 42nd street is not built out. But there are neighborhoods down there, and businesses that the city needs."
THE block between 41st and 42nd Streets and 11th and 12th Avenues could be seen at the symbolic, if not quite geographic, core of all the change. There stands, at the western end of the block, Riverplace I, a 40-story, 920-apartment luxury rental building with ribbon windows wrapped around its curved corners, offering views of the spikes and spires of Midtown and glorious sunsets.
While Ms. Silverstein's company bought development rights to the entire block 14 years ago, Riverplace I -- with its health club and tennis courts and rents ranging from $1,600 for a studio to $5,600 for a penthouse -- opened only a year ago. It is 76 percent occupied. 
"We have a mostly young, professional crowd who walk to work in Midtown," Ms. Silverstein said.
At the eastern end of the block, along 11th Avenue, is a parking lot. And attached to the chain-link fence surrounding the parking lot is a large-lettered sign proclaiming, "Future Site of Riverplace II."
If Silverstein Properties realizes its dreams, Riverplace II will be a 53-story tower, sleeker and more expensive than its elder sibling. Its 882 apartments will have "higher ceilings, higher finishes, a lot of marble and limestone and porcelain in terms of the bathrooms; highly amenitized," Ms. Silverstein said. The company plans to seek preliminary construction bids by the end of summer.
"By the time we are all done," Ms. Silverstein said, "we hope to have close to 5,000 people living on that block. And that is because most of the units at Riverplace I are young people sharing the expense of that apartment."
"I think we are the anchor for what's going to proliferate in the area," she said. 
Actually, what is already proliferating.
Not even counting dozens of less dominating projects -- midblock buildings required by zoning ordinances to maintain the heights of their longstanding neighbors, renovated tenement buildings with penthouses suddenly plopped on top -- these are just some of the major residential developments currently under way in the community:
*On the north side of 42nd Street between Eighth and Ninth Avenues, beside Holy Cross Church, the Ivy Tower has risen.
Two weeks ago, a topping off ceremony was held for the 43-story, 270-unit building developed by Friedman Management on a 22,000-square-foot site that used to be a parking lot. But a courtyard is coming behind the tower -- 4,000 square feet of rock garden, waterfall and abstract sculpture in a midblock belt connecting to the smaller piece of the same complex -- a seven-story, 50-apartment building on 43rd Street. Occupancy in the smaller building is expected to begin in July, and in the tower by November. Studios will start at $1,800, one-bedrooms at $2,700 and two-bedrooms at $4,000.
*On the northwest corner of 10th Avenue and 41st Street, long the site of four tenements and a parking lot, stands the Victory.
The 45-story building with 417 apartments has a masonry facade with bay windows up to its 26th floor. But from there, said Hal Fetner, president of Sidney Fetner Associates, the developers, "it grows into a glass tower, a progression of less brick and more glass, which forms a V-shape in the corner of the building at 41st and 10th."
The 24-hour doorman building, said Nancy Packes, president of Feathered Nest, the rental broker for the Victory, will have a health club, an indoor half basketball court, a sun deck, a landscaped garden, a golf driving range, a tenant's lounge and "a vending center, so, at night, people can get their munchies, juices and waters." The rental office, Ms. Packes said, is scheduled to open by the end of this month. Studios will start in the high $1,800's; one-bedrooms around $2,400, two-bedrooms at about $3,900.
*Beside the long-dark Biltmore Theater, on the northeast corner of Eighth Avenue and 47th Street, the Parker family is developing a 51-story, 464-unit residential building with three commercial floors that incorporates unused air rights from the theater and the firehouse at the corner of 48th Street. It replaced six tenement buildings.
The building will be 20 stories taller than zoning formulas would originally have allowed, a bonus granted by the city because the developers are rehabilitating the Biltmore Theater -- home to "Hair" and "Barefoot in the Park" -- which has been dark since it was damaged by fire in 1987.
*With a ramp wrapping around it and leading into the Lincoln Tunnel, the lot at the southwest corner of Ninth Avenue and 37th Street was a huge pit two months ago. Now, cranes are lowering girders into place.
What is coming is a 14-story, 259-apartment building, developed by the Dermot Meridian Corporation. The building, the first major construction on Ninth Avenue below 42nd Street in the Clinton area in 30 years, is replacing a Burger King and one of those quadruple-decker parking lots that lift cars, piggyback style, on open steel frames.
*It won't be open to the public, but on the south side of 43rd Street near 11th Avenue, a 23-story building with 106 apartments began welcoming residents on May 1 -- all of them employees of the Chinese government.
Called the Residence Tower of the Chinese Consulate General, the $28 million building bears an arched, ribbed roof with a curved facade of frameless glass held in place by cables threaded through pinholes. The 20th and 21st floors, reserved for the ambassador, have stainless steel and granite exteriors. Construction started a year and a half ago, with finishing touches expected by July.
An eight-story factory building had been on the site. "They bought it for $8 million," said Joseph Maggio, vice president of Princeton General Construction, the builders. "Twenty years ago, it could have sold for a couple hundred thousand."
"I'm very familiar with the area," Mr. Maggio said. "When I was with Colby Construction, we rented a full floor on West 44th Street for $3.50 a square foot in the early 80's. Now that would be like $35 a square foot. And this is Hell's Kitchen!"
That moniker, despite all it has come to imply, is of obscure historical origins.
Clinton -- the more official, though less dramatic alternative -- is clearly traceable to two of the community's, indeed New York's, most prominent forefathers: George Clinton, New York's first governor, in 1777, and his nephew, DeWitt, who served as mayor and later governor. The Clintons owned vast farms by the river.
"It wasn't until the 1880's that this was called Hell's Kitchen," said Mary Brendle, the official district historian. But where the name came from remains a mystery.
One tale tells of a midsummer's utterance by a constable on patrol, that the place was "as hot as hell's kitchen."
But it may have been, Ms. Brendle said, The New York Times -- in a Sept. 22, 1881, story headlined, "A Notorious Locality" -- that labeled, or libeled, the neighborhood. Ms. Brendle says the article, describing "a collection of buildings of the same unprepossessing appearance known to the police as 'Hell's Kitchen,' " is the first printed use of the term she has found. The story calls the area "the lowest and filthiest in the city."
To be sure, the neighborhood has had its bad guys. "Through the 1870's, the Gophers gang ruled the whole West Side," Ms. Brendle said. "They stole from the railroad cars, the docks." And there was an 1880's spinoff of the Gophers, the Hell's Kitchen Gang, which that same Times article cited as the city's "most desperate ruffians." (As late as the 1980's, the neighborhood was plagued by a murderous gang, the Westies, linked to the Gambino crime family.)
BUT by and large, with the farms gone and Manhattan's street grid inscribed (under the governance of DeWitt Clinton), the community embraced an expanding populace of blue-collar families dependent on the newly arriving industries -- the breweries, the dairies, the rail yards, the docks, the soap factories and the slaughterhouses -- all within walking distance of their homes.
"Thirty-ninth Street was slaughterhouses," Ms. Brendle said. "They had the cattle pens on the roof, the ramps. They'd bring them across the river on barges, or by train, and drive them through the streets."
By the turn of the last century, the community was also becoming the city's reservoir for servants, cleaning people, hotel and restaurant workers, Broadway ushers, stagehands and set builders. And, as a melting pot of nationalities, it remains so to this day. According to the 2000 census, 45,700 people live in Clinton.
It was in the mid-1800's, with the farmlands fading, that housing for all those workers would shift from three-story wood-frame dwellings to tenements -- considered a significant step up during those times.
And it is those stolid brick structures, rundown though many of them are, that community leaders fear will disappear.
"We are extremely concerned about the expansion of high-rise buildings bordering and struggling to enter the Hell's Kitchen-Clinton neighborhood," said Ms. Sindin, the community board chairwoman.
In 1974, the city created a Special Clinton District, from 41st to 59th Street between Eighth Avenue and the river, in which midblock buildings cannot rise higher than seven stories or 66 feet, whichever is less. On the corners, however, buildings may climb as high as the underlying zoning allows.
"They aren't as tall as the 42nd Street stuff," Ms. Sindin said, "but tall enough to tower over the neighborhood. We've always tried to keep Clinton a low-density village-type area, but so much is coming that it's too much for one afternoon's typing."
What Leni Schwendinger, president of the Hell's Kitchen Neighborhood Association, worries about is the city's long-term vision for the area south of 42nd Street. "We do not look forward to office development," Ms. Schwendinger said. "We do not think that our neighborhood should be an extension of the Midtown business district."
Mr. Fisher of the Clinton coalition said: "All this stuff puts pressure on neighborhood people. Landlords are clearing out tenants. A building on West 51st, 26 tenants got hit with court papers in one day."
"How is the city going to provide for the electricity, the traffic, water, solid waste and sewage?" Mr. Fisher wondered. "It's going to catch up with us."
And there are businesses at risk. "There's photographers, sign makers, small companies that provide services to the office towers in the real Midtown," Mr. Fisher said. "Where do the delivery trucks gas up? When the auto shops are gone, where are you going to put them? In New Jersey?"
Joe Restuccia has been working for years to strike a balance in the community. Mr. Restuccia is director of the Clinton Housing Development Company, a nonprofit group founded in 1973 by neighborhood volunteers to preserve affordable housing in the special preservation district. "The big struggle was to prove that tenements could be renovated instead of demolished," he said. "This was the 70's when the idea was to knock it all down and start all over again."
Housing in the neighborhood is almost entirely tenements -- railroad flats with tubs in the kitchen and toilets in the hall. "The challenge is to take a building like that and modernize it, installing kitchens, private bedrooms, a toilet with a door." Mr. Restuccia said. "This was like a major achievement -- a toilet with a door!"
So far, the company has renovated 72 buildings with 900 apartments using $78 million in public and private funds. About 60 percent of the buildings had been held by the city for tax arrears; the rest were renovated by private investment with low-income housing tax credits.
And that is how the Clinton company has worked with some of the developers of those rising towers -- all of whom are building what are called 80-20 projects.
For those projects, either the city or the state issues bonds to finance low-rate mortgages. In exchange, the developers must set aside 20 percent of their apartments for people earning between 40 and 60 percent of the metropolitan area's median income. The affordable apartments must be equally distributed throughout the building and match the distribution of apartment sizes.
In another type of exchange, as with the Victory on 10th Avenue, developers can receive extra square footage or building height if they either construct or renovate affordable apartments on site or off site, over and above the 20 percent already set aside. Just such an exchange is taking place on the east side of Ninth Avenue between 42nd and 43rd Streets. 
There, where for decades the Gardini family pharmacy stood, the Brodsky Organization is pouring foundations for an 80-20 building that wraps around a row of four-story midblock tenements.
W HAT we're putting up," said Daniel Brodsky, the company's president, "is a 10-story building on 43rd connected to a 23-story building at the corner of 42nd, for a grand total of 256 apartments." But to maintain the height of the midblock tenements, part of the 43rd Street section of the new building will be only four stories. With occupancy expected in the 10-story section early next year, rents for studios will start at about $1,700, one-bedrooms at $2,200 and two-bedrooms at $3,500.
The low-income apartments, however, will be off-site. And that is where Mr. Restuccia comes in. "They have worked with us to renovate a building at 501 West 52nd Street," Mr. Restuccia said. "It was four tenements with 27 units -- the kind with tubs in the kitchen -- that the city took over for urban renewal in 1969."
The four tenements are being combined into one elevator building with standard apartments. And the 12 long-term tenants relocated during construction will return, with the remaining apartments rented to low-income neighborhood residents.
"The secret of this stuff is that when it works, it really works," Mr. Restuccia said. "When the private developer is interested in engaging with the community in a creative way, the developer gets a benefit, the community gets a benefit and low-income neighborhood residents get a better place to live. This is not about marching with banners; this is sitting at the table and working it out."

BYLINE:  By STEVE STRUNSKY 

DATELINE: ELIZABETH 

 BODY:
JUDGING by the pancake index, this historic port city with a historically uneven reputation seems to be stacking up surprisingly well.
 Michele Kenny, the owner of the International House of Pancakes on North Broad Street, the closest thing to a diner near this city's gritty, bustling center, said the IHOP's sales volume has risen to a hefty $40,000 a week from about $6,000 when she bought the franchise 10 years ago. 
 On a recent weekday morning, the restaurant's sunny dining room radiated optimism as the plates, forks and knives of men in suits, mothers with children and other Elizabethans, as residents here are known, harmonized in a clanging chorus of prosperity.
"Actually, it was 20 years ago, and Elizabeth was not doing well, and it was a company-owned franchise and IHOP wanted to get rid of it," said Ms. Kenny, 49, who was working as a waitress in Union when she and the chef there pooled their assets. "Elizabeth has changed a lot since then. In the last 10 years, a lot of business has returned." 
By land, sea and air, in fact.
With more than 110,000 residents, Elizabeth, the seat of Union County, is the state's fourth-largest city after Newark, Jersey City and Paterson -- and one of its most dynamic. From the giant retail outlets that have sprouted from barren brownfields along the New Jersey Turnpike to the new hotels near the increasingly busy Newark International Airport to the rows of townhouses that have replaced decaying apartments for many of the city's lower-income residents, Elizabeth has undergone no small transformation over the past decade. 
"We're the best-kept secret in the state," said Dan Sullivan, executive director of the Elizabeth Development Corporation, a native of Elizabeth and a former school board member who is now a freeholder.
Indeed, it is having trouble getting attention for itself as cities like Newark -- enjoying a self-proclaimed renaissance with its New Jersey Performing Arts Center, baseball stadium and restoration of some of the city's stately skyscrapers -- garner most of the attention. Jersey City is repeatedly trumpeted as the state's financial capital and leader in job growth, and has become virtually synonymous with the term "waterfront boom." Even Paterson -- despite its stagnation -- manages to stay in the spotlight, or perhaps searchlight is more accurate, if only through its struggle with characteristically urban problems of poverty, unemployment, corruption and violence.
But while Elizabeth has been booming -- averaging $45 million a year in new construction over the past five years -- it has attracted little attention. What outsiders do tend to hear about Elizabeth from the occasional news release issued by the Union County prosecutor's office -- an investigation into municipal corruption; a doctor is shot dead in a hotel parking lot; a youth football coach is accused of molesting his players -- reinforces negative stereotypes.
"I have a friend who said to me, 'Aren't you afraid to live in Elizabeth?' " said Christine Lalevee, 48, who moved to Elizabeth with her husband in 1985, and lives along a park near the city's western border with Carteret. "It's not like that."
Ms. Lalevee, a part-time office worker for the American Heart Association, said: "When I came here, there used to be a lot of cars stolen in this area. Now I don't see that."
Neither do the police. In keeping with state and national trends, reported crime has significantly fallen in Elizabeth in recent years.

Improved Schools Hold the Key
But for all of the city's improvements and potential, even its biggest boosters say long-term prosperity depends on a struggling public school system that while showing signs of improvement, continues to perform well below the state as a whole.
"The biggest concern, and one that really could be a major inhibitor to economic growth of the town is the underperformance of the school district," said State Senator Raymond J. Lesniak, a Democrat who was born and raised in Elizabeth. "When people look to relocate in a town, whether it's a business or a family, they look for quality of life, they look for economic opportunity, they look at the school system.'
With about 15,000 students, it is the fourth largest system in the state, and with the districts in Newark, Jersey City and Paterson all under state control, Elizabeth has, in a sense, New Jersey's largest independent district. It is also among the state's 30 Abbott districts -- poor urban districts that take their name from the New Jersey State Supreme Court cases, Abbott v. Burke.
Being an Abbott district does qualify Elizabeth for additional state aid for operations, pre-kindergarten classes and facilities, but the extra aid has been slow in coming.
On the High School Proficiency Test administered to 11th graders, 58.2 percent of Elizabeth High School students passed the reading portion in 2000, the most recent year for which statistics were available. Math was no better, at 56.6 percen, while 78.1 percent passed the writing portion. (Typically, a much higher percentage of students statewide pass the writing portion, which is easier than the math and reading parts.) The scores were an improvement over 1999, but still lagged behind the rest of the county.
In the most immediate sense, the disparities worry residents like Christine Lalevee and her husband, Wayne, who moved to Elizabeth in 1985, and now have an 8-year-old son, Luc, in the district. 
"I don't know if I would buy a house in Elizabeth," said Mr. Lalevee, 41, a former Honda service manager who now receives federal disability benefits because of a chronic back injury.
It is Luc's current school, Westminster Academy, that keeps the Lalevees in Elizabeth. Westminster, where Mr. Lalevee is president of the Parent-Teacher Association, is a magnet school for kindergarten through sixth grade in a new building, with sunshine streaming in, space, and enthusiasm among students, staff and parents.
"What keeps us here?" Mr. Lalavee asked. "His school. If he had to go to Hamilton? I don't have the money to put him in a Catholic School, so we would be out of here."
Whatever divide there may be between the city's economic strides and the perceptions of its school district is mirrored by a schism -- a blood feud, if you will -- between City Hall and the Board of Education. The district's harshest critics include Mr. Sullivan, Mr. Lesniak, and Mayor J. Christian Bollwage. What those men also have in common is their opposition in the early 1990's to the city's legendary former mayor, Thomas G. Dunn Sr., a Democratic powerbroker who reigned for 28 years.
With the support of fellow members of a younger generation who eventually became frustrated with, among other things, Mr. Dunn's refusal to cede power, Mr. Bollwage finally unseated him in the primary in 1992 before going on to win the general election.
Although Mayor Dunn died in 1998, his name lives on, literally, at the Board of Education. Elizabeth's superintendent of schools is none other than the mayor's son, Thomas G. Dunn Jr., who was elected by the board in 1991 while his father was mayor. But even after Mayor Dunn's defeat, his son remained at the district's helm.
A common criticism directed by Mayor Bollwage, Senator Lesniak and others toward the superintendent and his supporters is that they have exploited the district as political patronage mill the same way Mayor Dunn doled out municipal jobs and contracts to help him in City Hall. The most prominent example they cite is the appointment of a former physical education teacher and athletic supervisor, Michael Scarpato, as principal of Elizabeth High School in 1999 after successfully managing the campaign of four school board candidates.
For his part, Mr. Dunn rejected the criticism and defended Mr. Scarpato as a qualified candidate whose appointment may have raised eyebrows, but was sound educationally. In terms of test scores, Mr. Scarpeto's appointment did not seem to hurt the high school, where in statewide testing reading and math improved in 2000, the year after he became principal.
Mr. Dunn's supporters outside the district include the New Jersey Association of School Administrators, which named him superintendent of the year for 2001-2002 after he implemented districtwide standards in an effort to achieve consistency in the quality and nature of instruction.
He is also defended by David Sciarra, executive director of the Education Law Center in Newark, which has represented students from the Abbott districts -- including the latest, most expensive and slowest to be implemented: a 1998 order by the State Supreme Court that the state pay for school repairs and new construction. Elizabeth has not built a single new school but, Mr. Sciarra noted, neither has any other Abbott district.
"It's not out of incompetence on Tom Dunn's part," said Mr. Sciarra. "He has his strengths and his weaknesses, like all these superintendents do. No new schools have been started anywhere, no major renovation projects have been started anywhere."
Glenn Tillou, the Union County superintendent of schools, said Mr. Dunn faced the same daunting task that every other Abbott superintended did in getting new buildings.
"Where you need to build the schools is where the students are, and where the students are are the most densely developed areas, so site selection becomes very difficult and controversial," said Mr. Tillou. "The Elizabeth school system does do reasonably well. Obviously, their test scores are not as high as we would like them to be, but they have made significant strides."

Superintendent Defends Himself
In his own defense, Mr. Dunn, who now lives in Montclair, said his appointment was not the result of nepotism, and he noted that he had been an assistant superintendent before ascending to the top spot in 1991. But he acknowledged that growing up with a father who had one of the nation's longest runs as mayor probably did help him navigate the city's political and bureaucratic crosscurrents.
"Certainly, it has given me insight into how things work and how things get done," Mr. Dunn said in a recent interview in his office, which is across North Broad Street from the IHOP, where he sometimes eats.
Beyond reports of IHOP's hot cakes selling like, well, hot cakes, construction is perhaps the most conspicuous aspect of Elizabeth's economic revival.
In 1998, during the peak of the city's building boom, new construction totaled about $165 million -- including the vast Jersey Gardens outlet mall -- making it second to only Jersey City. Growth has trailed off somewhat, though but still totaled $73 million last year.
Residential construction, though relatively modest for city the size of Elizabeth, has steadily increased in recent years, and in 2001 was valued at $13,092,200. The residential figure, too, falls short of totals in many other cities, but officials note that much of it involves the city's affordable housing program, which has lined several streets with 130 new townhouses in the Elizabethport neighborhood.
The program, known as Hope VI, which is financed in part by a special 3 percent tax charged by retailers that is part of the city's Urban Enterprise Zone, has put a fresh face on the city across the Arthur Kill from Staten Island, and provides a new sense of comfort and privacy for people like Willie Hill, who last year moved into hius own townhouse from an apartment in a nearby housing project.
"You got your own place," said Mr. Hill, a plain speaking 65-year-old retired factory worker. "It's okay."
The new houses are accompanied by a range of neighborhood programs involving child-care placement, adult education, substance abuse treatment, entrepreneurial, credit and homeownership counseling, and job training for residents to work for Hope VI contractors. Like an infant version of Newark's thriving Ironbound section, with its vibrant array of Portuguese and Brazilian shops and restaurants, a significant Portuguese community is taking root.
Supporters of Mr. Bollwage credit the mayor with bringing about Elizabeth's revival in part by scouring state and federal grant programs for every dollar of seed money and matching funds available. 
Yet the impetus for Elizabeth's boom might rightly be identified as the opening of the 350,000-square-foot Ikea store across the turnpike from the airport in 1990, which anchors the 100-acre Elizabeth Center that includes a Kids 'R Us store and the Rex-Plex, a giant family recreation mall that also houses a job training center. The effort seems to be working, in that the city's unemployment rate fell to 6.2 percent at the start of this year -- still slightly above e the national figure of 6 percent, but well below the 14.3 percent rate in 1993.
Of course one of the engines of Elizabeth's growth is Newark International Airport, which straddles the Newark-Elizabeth border. The airport, which today handles more volume than either LaGuardia or Kennedy, with 30.5 million passenger having arrived and departed in 2001, has fueled development of Elizabeth's hotel corridor along Route 1 and 9. By comparison, Kennedy hyandled 29.4 million passengers and LaGuardia 21.9 million. Moreover, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is planning an expansion that will add another 10 million passengers a year by 2010.
In addition, five new hotels are about to open or under construction: the Mariott Courtyard, the Mariott Residence Inn, American Extended Stay Hotel, Holiday Inn Crown Plaza, and the Carlton Country Inn and Suites.
"This market has been strong for an awfully long time," said David W. Rossman, general manager of the Wyndam Newark Airport, a hotel that opened this year on Route 1 and 9 in Elizabeth. "And with the $3 billion that the Port Authority has invested in this airport, it's going to be a strong markert for a while."
It was just after the Wyndham's ceremonial opening in January that Mayor Bollwage gave his annual state-of-the city address to the Greater Elizabeth Chamber of Commerce. "The state of the city is strong," he told an enthusiastic audience of about 400 business people, a record crowd for the annual event. 
At this point, Elizabeth's most potent symbol of renewal is the 1.3 million-square-foot Jersey Gardens outlet mall, which opened in October 1999 after being built atop an old municipal landfill and was heralded as one of the state's most successful projects in terms of making use of a contaminated property that was cleaned up. The 200-store mall, with its wide-open, exposed-beam construction that resembles the immense jet hangers across the turnpike, drew more than 15 million visitors in 2001, and increased sales 8 percent, according to city figures. The mall, off Exit 13A of the turnpike, provides 5,000 jobs and $6.5 million in annual city revenue.
After buying a Brooks Brothers blazer or pair of Tommy Hilfiger jeans -- or almost any conceivable item of clothing in between -- Elizabethans and others can now take in a movie at the 20-screen Loews Theater cineplex that opened next to Jersey Gardens last August.

Light Rail Is on the Way
Soon, those shoppers, employees, airline passengers and residents will be able to get around more easily with a two-part light rail system now under construction. The first segment will be an 8.8-mile stretch linking downtown Newark and Elizabeth with the airport. The second part will be a 5.8-mile stretch extending from downtown Elizabeth to an area along Newark Bay that is being developed as a huge, mixed use complex known as Bridgeview Center for its view of the Bayonne Bridge. The area will also have its own ferry service to Manhattan later this year. 
Bridgeview, which is being developed by a company known as OENJ-Cherokee of Bayonne, is proposed as a three-building, 700,000-square-foot office complex with an estimated cost of $140 million, with its ultimate completion dependent on the demand for office space. Bridgeview -- significant not only in its scale but also because it is the city's first major office project in decades -- will share the 182-acre site of the reclaimed landfill with Jersey Gardens. 
Ultimately, officials agree, economic development and improvement in school performance goes hand-in-hand. But there is a chicken-and-egg question over which comes first: good schools that draw residents, keep them there and produce a well-educated, quality workforce that retains old businesses and attracts new ones; or economic development that fuels the tax rolls, enabling the district to hire more teachers and build new schools, ultimately producing better students. 
"I think there is a mutual concern among the business community and school districts concerning the training and education of the workforce," said Frank Belluscio, a spokesman for the New Jersey School Boards Association.
"Businesses will want a well trained work-force, so that is a component of economic development," Mr. Belluscio said. "The thing about development, it builds up the tax base, which makes it easier for the district to raise money."

HEADLINE: The View From Weehawken and Other Mayoral Campaign Issues 

BYLINE:  By STEVE STRUNSKY 

DATELINE: WEEHAWKEN 

 BODY:
UNLIKE its fast-growing neighbors, little has changed in this riverfront town in the past decade, including the nameplate on the mayor's desk. Richard Turner has been running things here -- pretty much as he wants, some say -- for the last 12 years.
 For Laura Ledesma -- an 18-year-old naturalized citizen who will be voting for the first time on Tuesday -- it is time for a change. 
 "I'm voting for the new team, actually," said Ms. Ledesma, referring to a slate of challengers who call themselves Weehawken Initiative Now, or WIN. "I don't know, it's been the same people over and over. The mayor has done a great job, you can't deny that. But I want to try something new." 
It was 12 years ago that Mr. Turner led his first slate of five candidates for Weehawken Township Council to victory, and that slate in turn chose him to serve as mayor for a four-year term, a process repeated in 1994 and 1998.
And although the mayor and his current running mates -- all part of the Weehawken and You team -- boast about how crime has gone down, taxes have been stable and property values and the quality of life have gone up, the 52-year-old Mr. Turner is nonetheless facing his most aggressive electoral challenge.
The most obvious measure of opposition to the mayor's reign is the fact that this is the first time his team is being challenged by a full slate of five candidates who question the mayor's commitment to residents as opposed to wasterfront developers as well as to open goverment.
Benjamin A. Goldman, challenger for an at-large seat who has lived here for six years, said: "I've worked for communities my entire adult life, and I've fought for people who have been underrepresented, and for access to information about what government is doing and what communities need, all of which would be of benefit to a place like Weehawken, which on the one hand is a small town, and on the other faces some of the most complex issues of any community in the world."
The 41-year-old Mr. Goldman, who opposed the project, has written about the environment and other policy issues, and served on President Clinton's Council on Sustainable Development.
The slate of challengers has accused Mr. Turner of being an autocratic, secretive ruler. Moreover, they have questioned how the incumbents in a town of 12,000 have raised about a quarter of a million dollars, largely from out-of-town businesses, including engineering firms, law firms and other development-related companies.
"I think they're bought and paid for, and I think it's why their decisions have not represented the interests of our local citizens," Mr. Goldman said.
For their part, the incumbents rejected those assertions. They minimized dissent, they said, by ironing out differences at work sessions. And they questioned how the challengers could make an issue of how business was conducted, assereting that they had attended few council meetings.
Mr. Turner said that in terms of campaign funds, the challengers were lumping $143,000 in donations over the past three years to the Weehawken and You Civic Association, a charitable group, with $98,000 in recent contributions to the Weehawken and You Campaign Fund.
Weehawken, where Aaron Burr mortally wounded Alexander Hamilton in their duel on the banks of the Hudson, does not have the PATH service or night life of Hoboken, its trendier neighbor to the south. But it is home to the Lincoln Tunnel and New Jersey Transit's 181 bus, making it a logical choice for commuters with families, especially since its schools have improved over the past decade. And there is the unobstructed view of Midtown Manhattan across the Hudson.
To be sure, the mayor has his supporters, even among relative newcomers. Daniel S. Cieri, who moved here four years ago from Union City, said he had been impressed by Mr. Turner's success in turning around a public school system.
"I have a little boy in first grade, and I am proud to be living in a town that takes such pride in its schools," said Mr. Cieri, 60, who is co-owner of a fitness center in Palisades Park. 
As for the mayor, Mr. Cerci added: "He's so approachable, and he's easy to get to know.
And to upset the equation a bit more, even some longtime residents are ready for a change.
Virginia Hessmer, a retired executive secretary whose father and grandfather were Weehawken police captains, said she would not vote for Mr. Turner.
Ms Hessmer blamed the the mayor -- unfairly, he insists -- for approval of the controversial Port Imperial South project, a mini-city of 1,632 housing units and more than a million square feet of office space between the Hudson and the the Palisades.
"I changed my mind," Ms. Hessmer said, standing outside her yellow brick apartment building on Park Avenue. "My windows upstairs, I have a beautiful view of New York, and I don't want to lose it.

HEADLINE: WEDDINGS; 
Michele August, Michael Marotta

 BODY:
Michele August, a daughter of Nancy and Robert August of Whately, Mass., was married yesterday to Michael Lawrence Marotta, a son of Nancy and Michael Marotta of Todt Hill, Staten Island. Jerrold Winer, a Massachusetts justice of the peace and the bride's great-uncle, officiated at the Pines Theater in Florence, Mass. 
 Mrs. Marotta, 27, is the manager for corporate sponsorships and special events at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. She graduated from Syracuse University. Her mother is a physical therapist at Cooley Dickinson Hospital Rehabilitation Services in South Deerfield, Mass. Her father owns Nasami Farm, a nursery in Whately. 
 Mr. Marotta, 32, is a vice president in a risk-management group at Goldman, Sachs & Company, the New York investment bank. He graduated from the University of Notre Dame and received a master's degree in political economy from New York University. His mother is the assistant principal at P.S. 50 in Oakwood, Staten Island. His father, who until 1999 was the principal of Tottenville High School on Staten Island, is an adjunct professor of science at St. John's University in Queens. 
The couple met in June 2000, as they were preparing to jog. As they stood together waiting to cross the West Side Highway at 14th Street, Mr. Marotta grew impatient and began speaking to Ms. August. When the light changed and both began running south, Mr. Marotta asked Ms. August if they could jog together.

HEADLINE: MARKET INSIGHT; 
Seeing Reasons To Believe In Technology

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
IT has been more than two years since air started leaking, then rushing, out of the technology balloon. 
 The Nasdaq 100 index has fallen nearly 75 percent from its peak in March 2000. About 45 percent of the decline has occurred over the last 52 weeks. Since the start of 2002, the index is down more than 20 percent. Yet it is still about 30 percent higher than in early 1998, when it closed at 956.19. 
 Michael Murphy, editor of the California Technology Stock Letter and chief investment officer of Murphy New World Mutual Funds, spoke last week about technology stocks' prospects. Following are excerpts from the conversation.

Q. Good news from Cisco Systems last week set off a rally in tech stocks, which then fell back. Are they oversold?

A. They are strongly oversold. We have a record level of Nasdaq short-selling. Nobody wants to own these stocks. Big mutual funds own anything but technology. The Cisco news was not that much -- they said revenue in the July quarter would be up 5 percent, which translates into a 22 percent annual growth rate. But the reaction to that news shows how extremely oversold we were.

Q. Why are you bullish on technology?

A. We are bullish because of the fundamentals. There is more product improvement and generational innovation going on in virtually every area right now than in the 30 years I have been following this business.
Everything from semiconductor equipment to third-generation cellphones to software, which is moving to Internet-based computing, to data storage, which is moving from big disk-drive systems to storage area networks. 

Q. Did technology companies attract too much investment capital in the late 1990's?

A. The problem is that things become obsolete. When a JDS Uniphase writes off $3 billion in inventory, people think they are writing it down. That's wrong. They are taking it to the dump. There was a huge amount of semiconductor equipment installed, but it is now useless. The cost of making an Intel Pentium 4 chip has gone from $100 down to $40. The $100 chip sits idle, and will never get used.
There are 550 million personal computers in the world, and 300 million of them can't run Windows XP. A lot of those PC's were bought in 1999, and their three-year cycle is pretty much up. There are one billion cellphones out there, but the third-generation cellphone is a way better product. 

Q. Is there real demand for new equipment?

A. Well, in the first-quarter gross domestic product numbers, spending on computers was up 38 percent, off a very low base. Auto companies and the government are helping electronics.
There is no question there is huge demand for data storage. Over the next three years, we will store more information than in the last 3,000. But storage companies sell big systems that cost as much as $1 million each. Even if the chief information officer at a company wants to spend that kind of money, the chief executive doesn't. The chief executive wants to make sure the company is really out of recession. At some point this summer we think spending for those sorts of things will be emerging. 

Q. Which two tech stocks you would sell now?

A. We advocated selling Lucent and Nortel. We don't think Lucent has its act together to come back. It's not too late to sell. Nortel has been so badly hurt by all this they may have to exit the optics business completely and turn themselves into a wireless company.

Q. Which stocks are you buying?

A. We have been buying Xlinx, which is the clear leader in programmable chips. Nvidia, which is a pretty controversial stock, is a company we know well and is gobbling up lots of features to put into integrated graphics chip sets.
Another is Taiwan Semiconductor, which in a few years will be manufacturing 25 percent of all the semiconductors in the world. During the recession they kept spending money and modernized all their plants. Now they are as good at manufacturing chips as I.B.M. and Intel.

Q. What about the prospects for Intel, Microsoft and Cisco Systems?

A. We are finding it easier to find good big stocks than good small ones. That is a big change that is mostly due to the fact that venture capitalists are not making any new investments. Bigger companies have managed to gain market share, and a lot of their erstwhile competitors have gone away. We have been buying all three of these stocks, and think Intel is the cheapest of the bunch. But with around $10 billion in cash, Cisco is looking like a bank. Microsoft is in the same position.

HEADLINE: Palace Revolt 

BYLINE:  By KATHERINE MARSH 

 BODY:
FROM the moment the new tenant moved into the Apthorp, the majestic turn-of-the-century apartment building on Broadway between 78th and 79th Streets, she was the subject of rumor and gossip, much of it unkind.
 Some tenants dismissed her as nouveaux riche, saying that her over-the-top appearance was at odds with the shabby-chic ethos that has attracted not only solid middle-class tenants but also celebrated figures like Nora Ephron and Cyndi Lauper to the building. Others speculated as to how the newcomer managed to get prime real estate under the main arch at the Apthorp's entrance. Soon, a rumor spread that she had been imported by Nason Gordon, the Apthorp's nonagenarian landlord and one of the building's four managing members, as they are known. 
 The new tenant, a life-size marble nude, arrived in 1998. She is a fitting symbol of the painful transformation under which the 189-apartment Apthorp, one of the city's most celebrated rental buildings, is evolving from comfortable West Side icon to gilded palace for the very, very rich. 
For owners, the statue represents the latest in a long line of improvements designed to attract new, luxury tenants, like investment bankers and chief executives. For many longtime tenants, who feel they are gradually being forced out by sharply increasing rents, the statue epitomizes the pursuit of tasteless luxury at the expense of the building's character, not to mention their own pocketbooks.
A legendary New York residence in the same league as the Dakota and the Ansonia, two other neighborhood grandes dames, the Apthorp houses nearly every subspecies of Upper West Sider from rent-controlled senior to socially conscious psychiatrist to celluloid celebrity to ultrawealthy executive.
With its 3,000-square-foot apartments and airy interior courtyard, the Apthorp embodies the dream of New York living. These days, for some, it also represents the nightmare.
In the last few years, tenants have heard bizarre stories involving jewel thefts and a mysterious dead body. In recent months, with the increasing turnover of tenants, the building has been roiled even more. Afraid of repercussions or protective of their famous names, many tenants refuse to speak on the record. But off the record there is incessant buzzing -- Is it true that Al Pacino just moved into one of the big-ticket apartments, as some tenants have said? -- and the air is heavy with intrigue.
"I've never seen such fear in people," said Boaty Boatwright, the talent agent and social figure who has lived in the building for nearly a quarter of a century.
The most recent event to set tongues wagging was the departure last month of the movie director Nora Ephron and the writer Nick Pileggi, her husband since 1987. "We left because they doubled our rent and then doubled it again," said Ms. Ephron, who moved out of her eight-room apartment after 22 years in the building but is keeping an office there. Ms. Ephron, who has moved to the Upper East Side, filmed part of her 1986 movie "Heartburn" in the Apthorp.
In March, Ms. Ephron's younger sister and creative partner, Delia, a novelist and screenwriter, left the Apthorp -- and the Upper West Side -- after her rent was quadrupled from what it was when she arrived seven years ago.
Other famous figures are fighting to stay -- at often-enviable rents. Cyndi Lauper, the helium-voiced 80's pop star, is suing to get her rent rolled back from $3,250 to $507. Kate Nelligan, the actress, is in State Supreme Court to prevent her rent from soaring much higher. It was $2,570 a month in 2001.

Tenants With Room to Roam
On a recent Tuesday evening, Paul Nickolatos and Michael O'Neal, the chairmen of the Apthorp Tenants Association, gathered a few fellow tenants in Mr. Nickolatos's apartment to discuss plans to fight a proposed rent increase.
The living room of his four-room, rent-stabilized ($1,438-a-month) apartment features 10-foot ceilings, a fireplace and an original 1908 mirror framed by Edwardian molding. But the detail that reveals most about why tenants are fighting so aggressively to stay in the Apthorp is a baby grand piano that had been in the family.
Neither Mr. Nickolatos nor his wife, Katherine Ryden, play a note. They acquired the instrument because, unlike most New Yorkers, who can't stuff another stick of furniture into their tiny apartments, they had space to spare. The Apthorp has that most precious of New York commodities, room.
Last November, the Apthorp's owners, an entity known as 390 West End Associates, applied to the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal for what is known as a Major Capital Improvement (M.C.I.) increase. The aim was to offset $1.8 million the owners had spent replacing the building's 11 elevators.
The two tenant leaders contend that the new elevators -- some spray-painted gold, to many tenants' dismay -- are little better than their predecessors. The real purpose of the increase, they say, is to drive out longtime rent-stabilized residents like themselves to make way for others with deeper pockets. (Under the city's rent laws, if a stabilized rent exceeds $2,000 and the tenant's family income is over $175,000 for two consecutive years, the apartment may be rented at market-value -- luxury -- levels.)
The proposed increase is a modest one -- $25 per room per month. But if it is granted, the tenant leaders say, under the city laws some people will be forced out. To prevent this, the tenants' association has hired a lawyer and an elevator expert.
Mr. Nickolatos complained that while stone lions and urns multiply in the courtyard, longtime tenants continue to grapple with rusty water and outdated wiring.
"The big complaint among tenants is that the M.C.I.'s aren't helping the building, but the landlord," Mr. Nickolatos said. He is particularly critical of Barbara Ross, the building's managing agent. "Ms. Ross has been on a rampage of fixing things up," he said. His wife added, "We're afraid that this is just the beginning."

Upgrading to Woo the Wealthy
One Thursday afternoon around the same time, Ms. Ross and Mr. Gordon met in their cavernous wood-paneled office on the Apthorp's ground floor to demonstrate how they are making the building more enticing to upscale tenants. Except for an enormous mahogany desk that dwarfed both Mr. Gordon and Ms. Ross, the room was empty.
"The room we're in is part of what would be a very elegant dining room," Mr. Gordon said, pulling out a brochure published when the building opened. The brochure wooed turn-of-the-century titans with lavish descriptions of the Apthorp's amenities.
In the last several years, demand for luxury real estate on the Upper West Side grew. Many landlords sought to adapt to the changing neighborhood. For its part, 390 West End Associates spent more than $10 million upgrading the Apthorp to attract the 21st-century version of these original tenants. Improvements include a steam-cleaning of the richly ornamented limestone exterior, a new gatehouse, new navy uniforms with gold buttons and epaulets for the doormen -- "Like captains on a cruise ship," Ms. Ross said -- the new elevators, and renovations of vacant apartments to include amenities like central air-conditioning, new plumbing and wiring, washer-dryers and SubZero refrigerators.
"As we've been renovating, we've gotten more upper-level tenants," said Ms. Ross, who has managed the building for 18 years and whose dressy business attire and ebony beehive are a fixture in the building.
Ms. Ross and Mr. Gordon defend the wooing of affluent tenants, and although they will not say how much it costs to run the building, they defend the rent increases as necessary to do the job. "Owners and landlords are entitled to M.C.I. increases," Mr. Gordon said. "Everyone benefits from the improvement of the building."
Ms. Ross said the elevators had been replaced because they were breaking down. "I don't think we're trying to push anyone out," she added.
She also said the management was quick to address any plumbing or electrical problems, adding, "We have a contractor on the premises, and when a problem is reported, we send them in immediately." 
Many tenants deny this, saying they have reported complaints but found the response sluggish. They also say they do not report major problems because they doubt that any action would be taken.
As freshly outfitted doormen gave over-the-top hellos, Ms. Ross and Mr. Gordon headed upstairs in one of the new gold-painted elevators to conduct a tour of an apartment nearing the end of a nearly yearlong renovation.
Inside the four-bedroom, four-and-a-half-bathroom space, which is on the market for $25,000 a month, a McMansion aesthetic has replaced shabby chic. The space had been fitted with a granite kitchen floor, new plumbing and wiring, and the piece de resistance, a master bathroom with a beige marble Jacuzzi and other fixtures.
"This is the top right now," Ms. Ross said of the apartment.
Back in the courtyard, the pair lingered near the new gatehouse to offer a few more observations about the changes. "Barbara and I have devoted our lives to this building," Mr. Gordon said. "It's not just about making a dollar." What it is also about, he said, is restoring the Apthorp's former glory.
He and Ms. Ross seem particularly proud of the marble nude near the front entrance. "We bought that statue strictly to conform to the building," Mr. Gordon said. But as her fellow tenants suspected, the statue's true provenance reveals a great deal about the world she now inhabits. Contrary to a rumor that had swirled through the building, her last known residence was not a cemetery, as some had suspected, but Sotheby's.

Edwardian Splendor
For almost a century, tenants have been coming to the Apthorp not for statues but for space. To understand the spell of the Apthorp is to understand the passion of Manhattanites packed onto a tiny island for square footage. Built by the Astor family and named after the original owner of the land, the 12-story Renaissance Revival structure was designed as a luxury building at a time that apartment living was considered a lower-class convention.
The reason apartments were built large, up to 12 rooms apiece, was to lure the rich out of their brownstones. The building was completed in 1908. With units the size of houses, the Apthorp occupied an entire city block, and was an instant success.
By the Great Depression, however, even the rich were less inclined to cough up several hundred dollars a month for rent. In the next few decades, as profound social and economic changes swept through the city, many of the Apthorp's largest apartments were sliced in half. Residents left for the suburbs. Single-room-occupancy hotels proliferated on and off Broadway, as did crime.
The ambience of the Upper West Side of the 1960's and 1970's left much to be desired. But many tenants arrived in those years, attracted by spacious if rundown apartments available at rent-controlled and rent-stabilized prices.
Mr. O'Neal, a bearded Hemingway look-alike who, with his family, owns O'Neal's restaurant opposite Lincoln Center, moved to the Apthorp in 1972. Mr. Nickolatos and Ms. Ryden arrived in 1977. Many in this generation of tenants saw themselves as urban pioneers.
"There were hookers and drug dealers everywhere," said Mr. O'Neal's wife, Christine, who remembers the night she heard the screams of a prostitute whose thumb had been bitten off by another prostitute. "There were also a lot of transvestites. You'd wheel your child in a stroller and hope they couldn't see up their skirts."
Manhattan's West Side had traditionally been a world apart from the East Side, in both income level and character. But by the 80's the distinctions began to blur.
Luxury buildings sprouted along Broadway, notably in the West 60's. As the Internet boom helped spark another era of affluence in New York, Wall Street executives and those who in another era would have gravitated to the Upper East Side began to take a fresh look at upper Broadway.
The shift in population has resulted in startling developments, like the appearance of a Coach store on Broadway and 84th Street a few years ago. One effect of the change is that landlords have been able to raise rents to astronomical levels, pricing even the ordinary rich out of the Upper West Side, and out of the Apthorp.
Even before tour buses began stopping at Zabar's, just to the north, and before Victoria's Secret moved in on the hookers, the Apthorp's down-on-its-heels sensibility had attracted creative artists like Lena Horne, Joseph Heller and George Balanchine. In the 1990's, a more celebrity-studded roster that included Ms. Lauper, Ms. Nelligan and the television figures Rosie O'Donnell, Steve Kroft and Conan O'Brien discovered the Apthorp. Limousines near the entrance became an increasingly familiar sight.
Landlords were helped by a 1993 law that let them raise the rents of many rent-controlled and -stabilized apartments. Most tenants who arrived around this time, like Delia Ephron, were offered leases calling for what initially seemed like reasonable market-rate rents of $2,000 to $3,500 a month. But as rents began to climb, some tenants asserted that their apartments had been illegally destabilized.
One such resident was Ms. Lauper. In 1993, she sublet an apartment for $3,250 a month. In 1996, she and her husband, David Thornton, sued the previous tenant, saying that he had never lived in the apartment and therefore could not destabilize it and charge them a market-rate rent. In 2000, she expanded the suit to include the building's owners, on the ground that they were aware of the arrangement, and she demanded a lease specifying a monthly rent of $507, the rate before the rent was destabilized. In February, Justice Marylin G. Diamond of State Supreme Court ruled in her favor. 
Ms. Nelligan has also been squabbling with the building's owners since they took her to court to declare her original 1991 lease void. In an affidavit, Ms. Nelligan asserted that to secure this lease, which included set increases and lifelong renewal rights, she had paid $285,000 in "key money" to a former tenant, and that the Apthorp's owners had known of the deal. Her fear was that under a new lease, the owners could raise her rent as high as they liked.
The owners have declined to comment on both these matters on the ground that legal action is continuing.

The Body on the Roof
As the atmosphere in the building became increasingly bitter, a small group of tenants began compiling documents that, in their view, proved that the building was being mismanaged.
Even tenants who chose not to complain found the wave of rent increases especially galling, because they came in the wake of several sensational crimes. In 1997, a dead body appeared on the roof. The body was later identified as Gabriele Opferman, a German tourist who had died of exposure. A police investigation followed. But as no one in the building admitted to knowing Ms. Opferman, tenants were left worrying about a level of security that allowed a corpse to appear on their roof.
Four years later, the jewel thief struck. On a single day in January 2001, more than $400,000 worth of jewelry was stolen from the apartment of Andrew and Helen Sheinman, and jewelry valued at $60,000 disappeared from the apartment of Paul Nickolatos and his wife.
"I came back from a business trip, and there were 22 policemen in the apartment fingerprinting everything," Mr. Sheinman said. The thief was never arrested. 
Ms. Ross says the owners have done much to allay security concerns. Last year, they hired Kroll Associates, the security consultant, added cameras in elevators and lobbies (which operate but are not monitored round the clock), and require guests to wear a badge and sign in at the gatehouse. But some tenants still feel unprotected. "Is anyone watching?" Mr. Sheinman said of the cameras. "I doubt it."
As residents peer into the future, many predict that the invasion of the superrich will soon be a fait accompli.
"In two or three years' time," Ms. Boatwright said, "this building will be like the Four Seasons in Dallas, full of Enron people."
In some eyes, certain of the new arrivals are still unwelcome.
"The lions, that nude statue, no one wants them there," Delia Ephron said. "It's very nouveau riche-y. I think that management doesn't understand that the building has a heart and soul."

HEADLINE: Admitting To Mixed Feelings About Motherhood 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH HAYT 

 BODY:
SINCE its publication last fall, Naomi Wolf's "Misconceptions: Truth, Lies and the Unexpected on the Journey to Motherhood" has become a staple of baby shower gift baskets. Ms. Wolf, who has made a career of turning her rites of passage into social critiques, details the difficulties of her second pregnancy, the lack of support for new mothers and the toll that parenthood takes on couples. The book, which rejects the conventional, nurturing tone of popular baby advice books, is one of several published recently that challenge the prevailing image of this second Sunday in May -- of motherhood as Hallmark card. 
 After two decades in which boomers managed to make children the raison d'etre not only of their lives but of the culture at large, another version of motherhood is beginning to seep out, with some mothers speaking up -- in the impassioned tones of those breaking a taboo -- about the drudgery of child care, the isolation of the playground and their loss of identity. 
 "Motherhood is supposed to be this gauzy, pastel-painted, blissed-out state that has no depth or complexity," Ms. Wolf said. "That is the socially acceptable picture in the mass market. But women have discovered that the cultural mythology surrounding motherhood has nothing to do with their lives. Women are hungry for the truth. They want to know they're normal when they feel overwhelmed, lonely, isolated or ecstatic." 
In addition to Ms. Wolf's book, others in the genre include "A Life's Work: On Becoming a Mother," a memoir by the novelist Rachel Cusk, who confesses her disgust for breast-feeding and decries the "feudal relation" she slid into with her husband; "Augusta, Gone" by Martha Tod Dudman, an unvarnished memoir of the trials of raising an uncontrollable teenage daughter; and "Life After Birth: What Even Your Friends Won't Tell You" by Kate Figes with Jean Zimmerman, a parenting guide that covers problems like a new mother's inability to feel unconditional love.
"I wanted to write a book because I felt inadequate and alone," Ms. Figes said. "There are these myths that motherhood is natural and instinctive and that mothers bond with their babies immediately." 
The rosy glow surrounding parenthood in contemporary culture dates from the 1980's -- the era of movies like "Baby Boom" (1987) and television series like "Thirtysomething" (1987-91), which sanctified child-rearing as the next step for a generation of middle-class Americans who had spent an extended adolescence indulging themselves. Beginning with the Reagan presidency and gaining momentum after the 1992 election, when Bill Clinton made policies like the Family Leave Act a part of the Democratic platform, "family values" became an overwhelmingly bipartisan issue. Today, Baby Gap ads make child-rearing appear as fashionable and easy as a credit card swipe, and the White House is turning its attention in the coming midterm elections to "Mommy issues." 
At the same time, there are signs of an anti-romantic reappraisal of motherhood. They exist in pop culture, like the most recent season of "Sex and the City," in which Miranda, the lawyer and single-mother-to-be, learning that her baby is to be a boy, responds with a fake smile and a sarcastic, "Oh, great." After giving birth in the final episode, she said dryly, "It feels like a giraffe just entered the room."
Donna Wick and Wendy Ettinger, former college roommates who each have three children, are the co-producers of a documentary called "Bringing Up Baby," which follows six New York professional women through the late stages of pregnancy, birth and two years of child-rearing, laying bare their frustrations and self-doubt. One of the subjects wonders why "just being a mother isn't more fulfilling" and another feels guilty for craving time alone. 
"Why aren't we allowed to talk about hating the park?" said Ms. Wick, 44, who expects their film to be shown on the Oxygen network next year. "You feel alone and think you're crazy. We want women to be able to say it's O.K. to dislike parts of being a mother. It's boring, lonely, not valued and not paid. It's mindless and repetitive and no one ever says to you, 'It looks like you're having a tough day, go for a cup of coffee' like they do at the office." 
A number of mothers -- and potential mothers -- who have read some of the anti-romantic parenting tomes expressed relief. "The idea that there could be some ambivalence about motherhood, to hear that echoed is really important," said Michelle Goldberg, 26, a New York writer, who does not have children. "You always hear about people regretting not having children, but you never hear of any woman saying, 'I regret having children.' "
"There has to be some measure of regret, and you don't have to be Susan Smith," she said, referring to the South Carolina woman who drowned her two sons in 1994.
Although 1970's feminists like Adrienne Rich and Jane Lazarre wrote about their bipolar swings between loving and resenting their children, the family-values momentum of recent decades has swept aside most of the dialogue that is less than pro-natal.
"We've seen a dampening of the feminist discussion of the complexities of adult women's lives, including parenting, which has been simplified down to a 'good mommy/bad mommy' formula," said Suzanna Walters, a professor of sociology at Georgetown University and the mother of a 7-year-old daughter. "The late 60's and 70's were a brief, shining moment when all kinds of unspoken things were spoken, including maternal ambivalence." More recently, she added, "there's been a prohibition against voicing ambivalence about mothering." 
A number of the mothers who have written recently of their conflicted feelings provoked reactions that made them feel they had touched a high-voltage wire.
Ms. Cusk, a novelist who has won Britain's Whitbread award, attracted sharp criticism for "Life's Work" when it was first published in England last year. In her memoir, she longs for the freedom she had before her child was born. "You become an anonymous person as a mother, but to speak as an author from that experience is extremely difficult," Ms. Cusk said. "When my book came out, people had a fit about it. I wasn't prepared for the level of anger. I had to go on TV to defend myself."
The writer Peggy Orenstein witnessed the self-censorship of mothers when she conducted some 200 interviews for her book "Flux: Women on Sex, Work, Love, Kids and Life in a Half-Changed World," which appeared in paperback last August. Although some women seemed relieved to confess that they disliked motherhood and wished they might walk away, immediately after making that admission, they qualified it by saying how much they loved their children and would kill for them. "It was almost furtive for them to admit motherhood is not fulfilling," Ms. Orenstein said. "It actually makes me feel deviant and anti-mother to say that. But I'm not. It's like being anti-American. Motherhood silences women. The kryptonite words for women are fat, slut, bad mother and selfish. The words make us lose our powers just like Superman loses his in the face of kryptonite."
One of the paradoxes of the feminist movement is that after opening the workplace to women, offering them independence and professional fulfillment, it sometimes made child-rearing feel like a letdown. Today, a typical 32-year-old prospective mother has had a 10-year career and has made her own decisions since college. Although motherhood has always entailed sacrifice -- of time, of the ego, of one's sex life -- contemporary mothers are sacrificing more: careers, salaries, status. 
"What women are bringing to the table is confidence, education and work experience," said Ann Crittenden, the author of "The Price of Motherhood: Why the Most Important Job in the World Is Still the Least Valued," which argues that mother's work is economically and socially slighted. "When they become mothers, they discover it's an anachronism. Women are used to being treated equally, and then they have children and they find they're back in the Dark Ages."
Even for those who return to work, a compromise of professional goals often ensues, as suggested by Sylvia Ann Hewlett's recent cause celebre, "Creating a Life: Professional Women and the Quest for Children," which reports that in the "top echelons" of corporate careers, nearly half of the women are childless.
In the face of some women's maternal ambivalence, many others will testify to being blindsided by the power of maternal love, and quickly resetting priorities, sometimes never to return to careers. "I had no conflict about leaving to be a full-time parent," said Darcie Sanders, 49, who quit a job in publishing to have a baby and be a stay-at-home mother in Lyons, Colo., 10 years ago. She is the co-author, with Martha M. Bullen, of "Staying Home: From Full-Time Professional to Full-Time Parent," published in 1992. "I didn't feel like I was sacrificing anything," Ms. Bullen added. "There are aspects of drudgery to it, but for me the benefits so overwhelmingly outweigh those aspects, and anyway, there are aspects of drudgery to any job." 
Danielle Crittenden, 39, a Washington mother of three and the author of "What Our Mothers Didn't Tell Us: Why Happiness Eludes the Modern Woman" of 1999, faulted feminists of the 60's and 70's for devaluing motherhood. 
"I grew up in the 70's with that whole idea that you're supposed to work, and motherhood wouldn't be satisfying and maybe you condemned it," she said. "We've undervalued the satisfaction motherhood can bring. We haven't planned our lives to accommodate our children, and yet having children has proved to be one of the most profound and satisfying experiences of life. We're afraid to give ourselves over to motherhood -- to drop out of the workforce. Motherhood is great and important and something I want to do."
In the end, the subject of maternal ambivalence is not a skirmish in the long-running conflict between working and stay-at-home mothers. Most American women balance careers and families. Sixty-three percent of married women with children under 18 are in the workforce, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
Working or not, all mothers may be relieved to learn that motherhood may not come automatically to anyone after all. Sarah Bleffer Hrdy, an anthropologist at the University of California at Davis, studied primates, including humans, to understand better the biological relationship between mothers and their offspring. Describing her findings in her 1999 book, "Mother Nature: A History of Mothers, Infants and Natural Selection," she said that mothers are not innately selfless beings but learn to care for their babies over time. In addition, a mother's own well-being may conflict with nurturing her baby.
"It's instructive for women to understand that ambivalence isn't something to feel guilty and ashamed about," Ms. Hrdy said. "Striving for social status, which today comes from work or earning power, and relying on others for help are integral to motherhood in the human species."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: MORNINGSIDE HEIGHTS; 
Cathedral Needs Alms In the Wake of Calamity

BYLINE:  By KELLY CROW 

 BODY:
In the first half of the 1900's, the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine was busy seeking money to build its north transept, a stretch of arched offices and alcoves off the main sanctuary. One idea of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the longtime chairman of the fund-raising committee, was to place a 12-foot-long plaster model of the cathedral within the main concourse of Grand Central Terminal. 
 The ploy worked, and awed train commuters donated heavily to the project. 
 Last week, Jere T. Farrah, the cathedral's executive vice president of development, shook his head as he eyed the crumbling remains of the model, now sitting in a charred corner of the north transept, which was ravaged by fire five months ago. The transept, now open to the sky and dotted with warped steel bookcases and debris, had been the cathedral gift shop. The model was its centerpiece.
"You think this building is indestructible, and then you see what three hours of fire can do," Mr. Farrah said, as he gingerly picked up a singed postcard from the sooty floor. "Maybe more people should see it."
If they did, they might understand why the cathedral is in such financial trouble since the fire of Dec. 18, which was started by a short circuit. 
The church resumed normal activity within weeks of the fire, and insurance will probably cover most of the costs of reconstruction. The cathedral's social and arts programs have continued because they are supported by outside grants.
But the gift shop had been expected to make $1 million last year, mostly during Christmastime. The take fell well short of that figure. A smaller shop, expected to open in June in another part of the church, is unlikely to recoup those losses. Two Christmas concerts had to be reduced in size and relocated after the fire, which meant a $100,000 loss in ticket sales. Tourism, already slumping from the recession, stopped for several months. So did group tours of the cathedral, which once brought in at least $500 a week.
People have contributed $400,000 since the fire, but the church still has a $400,000 budget deficit. The fiscal year ends June 30.
Mr. Farrah and others are also looking to the Rev. James A. Kowalski, the new dean of the long-unfinished cathedral, to help stem the money troubles. There are few easy solutions.
"There's a lot of pressure right now, and I knew that coming in," Father Kowalski said last week. "But what I keep telling people is that major construction hasn't happened around here since Pearl Harbor. So, my hope is that with all the attention and fear of losing the cathedral to the fire, we can go further." KELLY CROW

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
TiptoeingToward Variable Pricing

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
THE executives who run the Colorado Rockies may not know how to put together a good Major League Baseball team, but they seem to be at the forefront of economic theory. They have taken the radical step of acknowledging that their fans would prefer to watch the Rockies play the New York Yankees, who have won four of the last six World Series championships, than the Pittsburgh Pirates, who haven't made the playoffs in 10 years.
 So the Rockies are charging more for the three games against the Yankees next month than for games against the Pirates and most other teams. A seat in the upper deck down the right field line, for example, costs $23 for the Yankees game and $15 for the Pirates. If you think that this is not particularly bold, you are clearly not a Hollywood studio executive, a newspaper publisher or an operator of most of the country's bridges. 
 Based on the price of movie tickets, Hollywood seems to think that moviegoers are no more excited to see "Spider-Man" than they are to see "Sorority Boys." Both movies cost the same in any given multiplex.
The people who set tolls in San Francisco, meanwhile, charge $3 to most drivers crossing the Golden Gate Bridge, whether they do so at 2 a.m. on Sunday or during rush hour on Monday morning. A newspaper costs no more the day after a big event than any other day.
All of this clashes with basic market economics, which holds that prices are supposed to rise as demand does. When they do, Adam Smith argued more than 200 years ago, societies allocate their goods and services efficiently and thrive. 
But for various reasons -- many of them having to do with the fear of angering consumers -- businesses are often reluctant to raise prices when demand climbs. Executives at Coca-Cola accidentally demonstrated the wisdom of that reluctance in 1999, when they announced plans to charge more for soda on hot days and were promptly derided around the world. Coke abandoned the plan. 
In fits and starts, however, the reluctance to adopt variable prices may be melting away. The Internet has played a role, with consumer Web sites like eBay and business-to-business sites creating marketplaces where prices fluctuate. After 25 years in which the government deregulated one industry after another, Americans may have also grown more comfortable with letting the market determine prices.
Baseball's Rockies, mired in last place in their division and suffering from declining attendance, are hoping that the strategy will help increase revenue. The San Francisco Giants, a successful team, have taken a similar step, raising prices for some weekend games. Some theater managers and concert promoters have stopped ceding the upper end of the market to scalpers. "The Producers" charged $480 for its best seats, and the Rolling Stones announced last week that they would sell some tickets at $350.
In the public sector, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey began charging $5 to cross the George Washington Bridge, among other bridges, at rush hour and $4 at other times.
THE shift can obviously help companies and government increase revenue. But is it good for society as a whole?
It can be. After New York's tolls changed last year, fewer cars used the bridges during morning rush hour, and more did so from 5 a.m. to 6 a.m, when the roads are less crowded, the Port Authority said. Because of the altered traffic flow, drivers now spend less time waiting on the bridges.
There can even be positive implications of price increases by companies. Judith A. Chevalier, an economist at the Yale School of Management who has studied pricing, gives this example: Imagine a town that has been hit by a hurricane and lost some of its electricity. If the local hardware store continues to charge its normal price for flashlights, all of the residents may line up to buy one. Some people who really need one may lose out to those who want one as a precaution.
But if the store raises the price of flashlights, people will think harder about whether they need one. The store will not be breaking the law, either. Companies run into trouble only when they create an imbalance between supply and demand and then try to profit from it, as some have accused Enron of doing with electricity in California.
Variable pricing, however, is not without its social costs. It tends to worsen society's divisions. Tickets to the Yankees and Rolling Stones, as well as space on the road at the most convenient times, increasingly go to the affluent. 
As skittishness over such pricing recedes, lawmakers will find themselves facing questions about when the market should not have the final word. Drinking a Coke on a hot day may not be an inalienable right, but having light after a hurricane should be.

HEADLINE: The Nation: Market Knows Best; 
Does Energy Deregulation Still Make Sence

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
AS soaring electricity prices roiled California last year, supporters of power deregulation -- including Enron and the Bush administration -- insisted the state's woes were not related to its newly deregulated electric market. High prices and rolling blackouts were the natural consequence of a supply shortage years in the making, they said.
 That explanation never carried much weight with the economists and engineers who watched the state's electricity market crumble. Instead, the experts said, as demand for power rose, flaws in the market's design gave suppliers incentives to worsen and even create shortages. 
 Proof of such manipulation was in short supply until last week, when federal regulators released memorandums written by lawyers at Enron that offered new evidence that power producers used the crisis to gouge consumers.
Despite its flaws, electricity deregulation, which has proceeded for more than a decade, should eventually benefit consumers, industry experts say. But the new evidence of the system's vulnerability may strengthen the position of consumer groups and others who said that tough rules and close oversight are essential if it is to to work.
"If we want generators to obey the market rules, we have to make it unprofitable for them to break the market rules," said Frank Wolak, an economics professor at Stanford University and chairman of the market surveillance committee at the California Independent System Operator, which runs the state's power grid.
The memorandums released by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission show in detail how traders drove up prices in California when electricity supplies were tight, said Robert McCullough, an energy industry consultant in Portland, Ore.
"Under the original incentives, it was in every player's interest to exacerbate an emergency," Mr. McCullough said.
Like other deregulated electricity markets, California set prices using a reverse auction. Traders and producers offered power supplies, and an independent agency bought enough to cover the day's expected demand. The agency picked as many plants as it needed to keep the lights on, choosing the lowest bid first, then the next lowest and so on. Once it met the demand for power, the highest bid it accepted was the price that every generator received. 
But businesses and people need electricity, no matter what it costs, so demand does not vary much with price. In California, that meant that, as demand neared the limits of supply, the producers could be virtually certain that almost any offer they made would be accepted, said Richard Schuler, an engineering and economics professor at Cornell University. "A measure of a market's competitiveness isn't necessarily the number of suppliers," Mr. Schuler said. "It's how many suppliers risk not selling anything if their bids are too high." In California, that risk was very low.
Making matters worse, suppliers who owned several power plants found that even on days when demand was low, they could create emergencies by keeping generators out of service, Mr. Wolak said: "What led to the meltdown in California were generators withholding supply from the market in California, either by bidding very, very high or just turning the plants off."
California tried to impose price caps on its market when the crisis began in 2000. The idea was to eliminate the incentive for producers to withhold supply and drive up prices. But traders simply sold power to neighboring states without caps, a strategy detailed in the Enron memos. Only when the Bush administration imposed regional price caps did the crisis ease.
"Once the price caps went into operation, the plants actually operated more instead of less," Mr. McCullough said.
Whether electricity markets in other states could implode as California's did remains an open question. Richard A. Rosen, a consultant who works mainly with consumer groups and state utility commissions, said the Enron memos offered more proof that electric suppliers have too much power in deregulated markets.
"These kinds of tricks and manipulations could be done, and are probably being done to a lesser extent anywhere," he said. "These markets demand very strong monitoring and regulation, so strong that it's essentially impossible."
But Mr. Schuler argued that California's market design had several technical weaknesses that made a crisis more likely. Over time, deregulated markets will become harder to manipulate, especially as power users learn how to lower demand quickly in response to price spikes, he said.
Regulation, Mr. Schuler said, stifled innovation and caused high prices. "I'd rather see people put their money where their mouth is, and that's the system we have in place right now," he said.
STILL, the Enron memos may heighten the pressure on Bush administration to reassure New York and other states with deregulated markets that they will not see a repeat of California's problems. To do this, FERC must toughen oversight of power producers and press state regulators to allow electricity to flow between states more easily, said Paul Joskow, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
"In the end, you have to have a national policy on electricity," Mr. Joskow said.

 Re "New Data on Unemployment Question Health of Labor Market" (Business Day, May 10): 
 The simultaneous increase in unemployment and economic growth in the American economy is not surprising in a world that has changed from an industrial national economy to a high-tech global economy. 
What are the effects of these changes? Human labor is being replaced by automation and corporate mergers. Global competition is reducing corporate profits at the same time that high technology is increasing productivity. The technology revolution creates many new companies that fail to survive.
The decreasing rate of savings and a rapidly growing consumer debt have kept unemployment from rising at an even faster rate. This cannot continue because bad loans have already become a serious problem.
Our war expenditures cannot solve the problem of rising unemployment and falling profits. It's no wonder Wall Street remains skeptical about an economic recovery.

At Some Online Brokers, Discounts Have a Price

BYLINE:  By DONNA ROSATO 

 BODY:
ONLINE trading is on sale.
 To attract new customers in a weak market, a handful of smaller brokerage firms have cut commissions to $4 or less -- or have waived them entirely -- for trading stocks on the Internet. But the deals generally come with strings. 
 Several online sites keep costs down by executing their trades infrequently -- in one case, only once a week -- and investors must accept the current market price. One firm applies its lowest commissions only to stock purchases, not to sales. The best bargains are often reserved for big traders. 
Last month, Foliofn.com cut its fee to $4 for even the smallest trades. By doing so, it joined Sharebuilder.com, BuyandHold.com, Brokerage America and others in offering very low per-trade commissions to take business from better-established competitors that offer a much broader range of services but have higher fees. For example, basic commissions range from $8 at Ameritrade (which also has a low-cost unit called Freetrade to compete with the cut-rate firms) to $9.99 at Datek Online, $14.99 at E*Trade and $29.95 at Charles Schwab.
With trading volume down, some of the large online firms are raising some fees. Charles Schwab is increasing commissions on trades executed via the telephone or at a Schwab branch, although it is holding the line on online commissions. Ameritrade and Datek, which are awaiting regulatory approval for a merger, have imposed charges for inactive accounts. E*Trade is adding a $3 order-handling fee effective on June 3; Schwab already imposes a $3 fee. "Prices are going up, not down, at the big players," said Jaime Punishill, a senior analyst at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. If investors can live with some potentially onerous restrictions, they can find cheap deals through the niche brokers, Mr. Punishill said.
Foliofn helps to keep costs low by executing trades only twice a day, and investors must accept the market price. Investors can trade in real time for a $14.95 commission, though they cannot specify a trading price.
Sharebuilder.com offers $4 commissions on stock purchases, which are executed once a week, when the market opens on Tuesdays. Investors can cancel orders until 5 p.m. Eastern time on Monday. After that, they are stuck with the market price on Tuesday. Sales are executed in real time, and investors may set a price, but the commission is $15.95. The firm is trying to attract investors who want to accumulate positions in a few stocks and do not trade often, said Jeff Seely, its chief executive.
BuyandHold.com charges a total of $6.99 for the first two trades of the month and an additional $2.99 for each subsequent trade that month. Trades are executed three times each day, and investors must accept the market price. The firm, acquired in March by Freedom Investments, recently cut its fee for real-time trades to $15 from $19.99.
In some cases, firms offer trades without any commissions. Brokerage America, at www.brokerageamerica.com, imposes no fees on stock trades of at least 1,000 shares and, in fact, gives a $1 rebate for each such order. To qualify for a commission waiver, investors must accept the market price. A $5 commission applies when the investor sets a price, and for trades of less than 1,000 shares. Investors are required to maintain a $1,000 minimum in their accounts. 
"We traditionally attracted the very active trader," said Andrew Sycoff, chief executive of Brokerage America, adding that customers with large accounts at full-service firms were now signing up. "People are looking for greater value."
CHARLES SCHWAB, a giant among the online brokers, offers a broad range of services, including rapid execution of trades at prices set by investors. Its customers can trade in many financial instruments and receive a variety of financial advice, not to mention mortgage and private banking services.
Schwab is focused on winning over more affluent investors. "We're interested in serving all clients, but our customer base is looking for more than just trading," said Morrison Shafroth, a spokesman.
The firms offering cut-rate deals are tiny by comparison. At the end of last year, they each managed just 100,000 to 500,000 accounts and together accounted for less than 5 percent of the 30.8 million accounts at brokers that offer online trading, according to an industry survey by Salomon Smith Barney. Fidelity Investments, with 8.7 million total customers, was ranked No. 1, and Schwab, with 8 million, was second.
Some analysts say cost-cutting will provide smaller brokers with a viable business. "This really fills a gap," said Shaw Lively, research manager for online financial services at the International Data Corporation in Framingham, Mass., "because mutual fund firms and big brokerages are moving away from the smaller investor."

The Long Boom's Ugly Side

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
SAY goodbye to the victimless economy.
 As the 1990's boom stretched on and on, many otherwise sober market watchers decided that the United States had repealed the laws of economics. Not only could the expansion go on forever, but this time, nobody's prosperity need come at the expense of others. 
 The symbols of the boom were not the ruthless robber barons of the Gilded Age, or the corporate raiders of the 1980's, but young new economy entrepreneurs, who started Internet companies and made millionaires not only of themselves but, legend had it, also of their stock-holding receptionists. 
Even when the stock market began falling two years ago and a recession ended the longest economic expansion on record a year ago, the primary culprit seemed to be the country's irrational but well-intended exuberance. 
Recently, however, the victimless economy seems as remote as a $200 share of Amazon.com stock. 
Last week, federal regulators released documents showing that Enron, and perhaps other energy companies, helped cause California's recent power crisis by artificially driving up prices. 
Other regulators, from the Democratic attorney general of New York to the Republican chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, are investigating conflicts of interest on Wall Street. And jury selection began in the government's prosecution of Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm the Justice Department has charged with obstructing justice during the Enron inquiry.
The details of the cases vary widely, but they collectively reveal that the 90's boom really did claim millions of economic victims. 
Virtually every resident of California and every business with an office there seems to have suffered from price gouging after the state's energy deregulation.
"About $30 billion was extorted from this state," Gray Davis, California's governor, said last week.
Many investors, thinking that the earnings statements approved by Andersen and other major accounting firms were truthful, lost money buying stocks. Others bought stocks on the bullish advice of Wall Street analysts, whose research reports may have been written more to win the investment-banking business of the corporations being analyzed than to make an objective assessment of the future prospects of its stock.
In February 2000, analysts made 85 "buy" recommendations for every "sell" recommendation, according to Zacks Investment Research in Chicago. Since then, the stock market has fallen about 25 percent, and many of the technology stocks analysts were hyping as a bargain at $100, including DoubleClick and JDS Uniphase, now trade for less than $10.
WHEN the collapse of Enron cost employees and investors billions of dollars, corporate executives like Jeffrey R. Immelt, the new head of General Electric, rushed to criticize Enron, suggesting it was an exception. Such an easy explanation is harder to accept today. 
"It has been said that the four most dangerous words in business are 'This time it's different,' " said Richard S. Tedlow, a historian at Harvard Business School. "And people really thought it was." 
No longer. Investors have punished the stock prices of G.E., Tyco International and other companies, fearing that they used accounting legerdemain to spiff up their earnings. The S.E.C. is investigating whether analysts deceived investors by publishing falsely optimistic research reports to please the corporate clients of their investment firms. Eliot L. Spitzer, New York's attorney general, is considering whether to bring criminal charges against employees of Merrill Lynch and Salomon Smith Barney for similar reasons. 
In one internal e-mail, a Merrill analyst called InfoSpace -- a technology company whose stock now trades at 79 cents, down from a high of $130 -- "a piece of junk" even as the firm's official position on it was favorable.
The seven stocks Mr. Spitzer is investigating at Merrill have lost $118 billion of their worth, from peak to trough, according to Brad Hintz of the investment firm Sanford C. Bernstein. Merrill's customers may have lost $4 billion of this total, Mr. Hintz said.
Mr. Spitzer has suggested that Merrill establish a restitution fund for investors, and is negotiating with executives over the eventual penalties. The firm has denied some of the allegations, but its chief executive, David H. Komansky, has publicly apologized. "We have failed to live up to the high standards that are our tradition," Mr. Komansky said.
Other regulators are investigating whether investment banks, including Goldman, Sachs and J.P. Morgan Chase, and a small group of chosen investors unfairly profited from initial public offerings of stock during the dot-com craze. Individual investors absorbed many of the losses, regulators said.
The New York Stock Exchange has been looking into Salomon Smith Barney for its role in persuading employees of Worldcom, the telecommunications company, not to sell some of their shares in the company a few years ago. By holding the stock, the employees helped lift Salomon's profits, but the decision ended up costing some people virtually their entire savings, as Worldcom's stock has fallen to $2 from a peak of $60 in 1999.
IT'S all a far cry from the 90's, when Time magazine named as its Man of the Year three businessmen -- Ted Turner of CNN, Andrew Grove of Intel and Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com -- having named only two in the previous 60 years. Wired, Fast Company and a handful of other magazines sprang up during the decade to chronicle and promote what they called companies' revolutionary role in society.
"Business in the 90's became not a fallback for people who weren't creative enough for other pursuits, but a force for innovation and creativity," said William Taylor, a founding editor of Fast Company. "Clearly, the attitude toward business has changed dramatically."
Indeed, the current investigations take aim at many of the "victimless" economy's most important pillars. The long bull market? Yes, it fattened the retirement accounts of millions of people, but it also seems to have allowed a small group of investors and bankers to profit off of the ignorance and trust of others. 
The great surge in corporate profits? Some of it now appears to be fiction, with Arthur Anderson and its peers playing the role of ghost writer. Those beloved technology entrepreneurs? Knowingly or not, they created companies that became the prime vehicles for the questionable stock-market profits. Many of those executives now appear in magazine not as heroes but as symbols of hubris, like Bernard Ebbers of Worldcom, or of greed, like Gary Winnick of Global Crossing. 
In addition to the thousands of people suffering the financial consequences of one bubble or another, the American economy is also a victim. Investors poured money and employees poured themselves into companies that were far less prosperous than they appeared. The unwinding of this excess is one reason that the economy seems to be recovering slowly from recession and that the unemployment rate actually rose sharply last month, to 6 percent.
"There was a massive redeployment of capital and people," said Adrian J. Slywotzky, a partner at Mercer Management Consulting, a consulting firm, "from fundamentally productive activities to fundamentally unproductive activities."
Beyond the investigations and prosecutions, policy makers have also called for change. Congress is considering whether to prevent accountants from selling other services, like business consulting, to their clients. On Wednesday, Mr. Pitt, the S.E.C. chairman, proposed new rules to limit conflicts of interest among stock analysts. Wall Street firms praised the plan, but some Democrats and investors called it too tame.
Some business leaders, as well as Mr. Pitt, are concerned that a wave of new laws could hamstring businesses and hurt the economy far more than any of the current scandals have. To others, the conflicts of interest that have now been exposed cry out for new rules.
Otherwise, Mr. Slywotzky said, "the next bubble won't be victimless, just as the last one wasn't."

Congratulations! Here Comes the Bill

BYLINE:  By KATHLEEN O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
Marriage can be an expensive proposition. Americans spend more than $70 billion annually on weddings, with each couple spending about $20,000, on average, for a traditional one, according to theknot.com, a wedding Internet site. 
 The bulk of the expenses are for food and beverages at the reception, but keeping a record of the occasion, through photographs and videos, can be costly, too. On the elaborate end of the spectrum, some couples even have their wedding photography arranged in a montage on DVD. 
 As videography has become more sophis-ticated, it's become more popular and people are spending more on it, said Lisa Dickens, vice president of Bridal Guide magazine. KATHLEEN O'BRIEN

New Signs of Growth In Credit Problems

BYLINE:  By Jan M. Rosen 

 BODY:
The economy may be showing signs of improvement, but a new report shows that many Americans are still falling behind on their credit card payments.
 The report, by Moody's Investors Service, is based on its tracking of securities backed by credit card receivables. 
Bad debt written off as uncollectible, as an annualized percentage of the total, amounted to 6.4 percent in the first quarter, the highest since the second quarter of 1998, according to the report. The delinquency rate, for payments 30 or more days late, rose to 5.4 percent in the first quarter from 5.2 percent in the period a year earlier. 
 With the unemployment rate rising and many wages shrinking, the figures show the danger of being overextended on credit. 
William Black, a senior analyst at Moody's, said many affluent consumers had converted their debt to mortgage or home-equity debt, which carries lower rates and is usually tax deductible. But people who don't own a home have no such option. Jan M. Rosen

HEADLINE: Will It Be California Redux? 

BYLINE:  This article was reported by Neela Banerjee, David Barboza, Richard A. Oppel Jr. and Joseph Kahn and was written by Mr. Kahn. 

 BODY:
ENRON has collapsed, and other energy trading companies have had their wings -- and their stock prices -- clipped. But the battle-tested technicians in Folsom, Calif., who control the nation's largest power grid are acutely aware that energy markets remain susceptible to manipulation at the hands of traders doing what traders do -- exploiting loopholes and inefficiencies to maximum gain.
 "They will keep testing us any way they can, in big ways and small," said Anjali Sheffrin, director of market analysis for the Independent System Operator, the agency that runs California's electricity grid from a control room in Folsom, a town 20 miles from Sacramento that is better known for its prison. "Unless we are more diligent, we could have the same kind of crisis all over again." 
 And not just in California, where memos released last week showed that Enron manipulated energy prices during the state's energy crisis. Texas, the state that most recently deregulated electricity, quickly found that its new market is vulnerable to being manipulated, too. 
At a hearing on Wednesday, Texas state legislators learned that Enron and five other energy companies drove prices higher during a market test last summer by consistently overstating their demand for electricity -- one of the tactics laid out in the California documents.
Regulators in California and Texas -- and in New York, New England, Pennsylvania, the Midwest and a handful of other places where energy companies sell electricity in open markets -- say they are much smarter now than they were when shortages and sky-high energy prices pitched California into crisis.
But many also complain that they still lack the tools to properly manage the competitive power markets that have gradually supplanted tight regulation and local utility monopolies over the last few years. Under existing rules, many experts add, Enron's aggressive trading tactics -- with names like Get Shorty, Fat Boy and Death Star -- were probably legal. And similar schemes, traders say, remain in wide use, because energy markets remain flawed.
"Energy trading is a football game; it ain't bridge," said R. Martin Chavez, chief executive of Kiodex, an energy risk management firm in New York. Mr. Chavez was formerly the head of risk management for energy trading at Goldman, Sachs. "If you want a nice game because electricity is an important public good, then set up a nice game." 
DEFENDERS of the deregulation experiment counsel patience. "I think gamesmanship is inherent in any new market, and the hard thing to convey to consumers is that creating these markets is a long-term endeavor," said Steven Sullivan, a spokesman for the agency overseeing New York's electricity grid. "Just as babies stumble when they learn to walk, we are in that same place."
Officials in New York, California and elsewhere say regulators are learning to stand up straight. This month, California submitted a 700-page blueprint to federal regulators that officials say reinvents deregulation. The new market, if approved by federal authorities, would outlaw some types of manipulation that raised prices in 2000 and 2001. It would force electricity providers to lock up the vast majority of their supply at least a month before delivering the power, radically reducing the amount of trading -- and scheming -- that occurs in real time.
Charles F. Robinson, general counsel of the Independent System Operator, said the changes would discourage Enron-like trading tactics as well as the more threatening practice of creating artificial scarcity in the market by keeping power plants offline. Mr. Robinson said that it was the withholding of power supplies by energy merchants that cost California billions during its energy squeeze. 
Indeed, the costs of the power crisis of late 2000 and 2001 are still being digested. California is seeking $8.9 billion in refunds from energy generators, and its biggest utility, the Pacific Gas and Electric unit of the PG&E Corporation, remains in bankruptcy protection. In neighboring Nevada, analysts say that state's biggest utility, the Nevada Power unit of Sierra Pacific Resources, could yet be forced into bankruptcy. State regulators refused to let Nevada Power recover all its costs from the crisis. And now Enron, of all companies, has cut off power deliveries for fear it will not be paid.
At the Independent System Operator's headquarters in Folsom, blue tape lines the carpet in one corner of the control room, marking the spot where television crews filmed the frenzied struggle to keep the lights on -- or, as happened on several occasions in 2000 and 2001, the announcements that the state would be subjected to rolling blackouts. Now, the floor-to-ceiling projection of the West's power grid is aglow, all circuits functioning smoothly.
The agency's struggle to find power each day has all but ended since Gov. Gray Davis, in the heat of the crisis last spring, committed $43 billion to long-term power contracts to take the pressure off prices in the bazaar. Republican politicians say the contracts were a grave miscalculation, because they locked in high prices just as new electricity supplies were leading to lower prices in daily trading. Governor Davis says the power emergency would not have ended if he had not signed those contracts, though he is now trying to renegotiate them.
Nationwide, energy trading volumes have plummeted, partly as a result of the recession and mild weather, and in part because of the Enron bankruptcy and the pall it has cast across the energy sector. 
THE Securities and Exchange Commission last week began a review of trading activity by Dynegy, the Houston-based energy company that looked ready to become the industry goliath after Enron's fall. Another Houston energy merchant, Reliant Resources, canceled a $500 million bond offering on Friday after disclosing that it had made similar trades. Other companies, too, are having trouble borrowing the billions of dollars they need to arrange big trades.
"Credit-rating agencies have raised the goal posts and moved the end zones," said John Olson, an energy analyst at Sanders Morris Harris in Houston.
Federal regulators, whom California officials accused of sitting on their hands through the state's energy crisis, have started to be more aggressive. 
It was at the order of Patrick Wood III, chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, that the Enron documents were made public last Monday. The agency has given power traders two weeks to turn over e-mail messages, memos and other internal documents.
"We have to try to get to the bottom of this and tell the truth," Mr. Wood, a Texan appointed to the energy commission by President Bush last year, said in an interview on Friday. "If the capital markets perceive that regulators and customers and elected officials and everybody else are getting comfortable with understanding what went on in California, then you can restore confidence." 
William Massey, a commission member who has pushed for tougher oversight of energy trading, said that in the last year, the commission has become more responsive to concerns about problems in the marketplace. 
"What we're learning is that electricity markets are fragile and that prices can soar in the blink of an eye, and that the structure of a market is critical," Mr. Massey said. "Solid market rules that prohibit abusive behavior are critical, and regulators cannot be naive about this. We have to be smarter than the market participants, and we have to stay one step ahead of them. When we see abuses and that the market is not performing as we expect it to, we have to intervene immediately. 
"That ought to be the new approach, and I have reason to believe the commission is moving in that direction," Mr. Massey said.
Experts say there is more work to be done. There is a danger that wholesale power markets could effectively dry up if retail markets, controlled by state officials, also failed to respond to supply and demand. Today, consumers almost everywhere still pay regulated rates. Demand tends to remain robust even when prices surge.
California officials have ordered all big users of electricity to install sophisticated meters to display the cost of the power they consume minute by minute. But the rates they pay are still fixed, making the meters a mere technical curiosity, rather than a signal to conserve when power supplies are tight and prices high.
IN Texas, where deregulation took effect last winter, advocates say they have adopted the safeguards against manipulation used in more successful markets, like the PJM Interconnection, which spans the mid-Atlantic states. Texas officials say they have also taken steps to plug loopholes that allowed participants to manipulate the system during its trial phase last summer.
Six companies have been identified by local officials as having exaggerated the demand for electricity during the test -- and thus having driven prices higher: Mirant, Constellation Energy, Reliant Energy, TXU, American Electric Power and Enron.
State Representative Steven Wolens, a Democrat from Dallas who is co-chairman of the state Legislature's deregulation oversight committee, said the panel had been assured by regulators that the kind of manipulation described in the California memos would not be possible in Texas. 
"But perhaps other vulnerabilities will be exposed," said Mr. Wolens, who was co-author of the state's deregulation law. "We're having meetings every six weeks, we're checking our pulse every six weeks, to understand the progress of deregulation."
STILL, there are signs that energy providers continue to engage in manipulative behavior, such as when they artificially create congestion in power lines and are then paid to relieve it, one of the tactics attributed to Enron in California. A $20 million fund that Texas created to compensate providers for clearing congestion was to have lasted 18 months but was depleted in two weeks.
"There's a tremendous hubris: California doesn't want to learn from PJM; Texas doesn't want to learn from California," said William Hogan, an energy market expert at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. "The lesson is that you can't learn from others' mistakes. You have to make them yourself."
Other trading companies were quick to declare publicly last week that they never engage in the kinds of activities described in the Enron memos. But interviews with current and former traders and executives at such companies suggest that Enron's strategies were common.
"In retrospect, some of this stuff looks terrible, but I did this kind of thing, and I can't imagine anyone in the same circumstance doing anything different," one former Enron trader said.
One popular strategy, traders say, is called trading around the flow. In the heavily policed securities industry, a trader must serve his customers first before trading from the company's own account. But energy markets do not have such rules. Traders sometimes buy or sell in advance of their customers, profiting from their knowledge of the way prices are likely to head once they execute their clients' orders.
"Trading ahead of customers is a violation in a regulated futures market," said Thomas J. Erickson, a member of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission who favors tighter regulation of energy trading. But online energy futures trading -- the heart of Enron's trading business and that of many of the companies that survived Enron's collapse -- is "not regulated and not subject to application of our fraud authority," Mr. Erickson noted.
Even in Enron's wake, though, moves to tighten regulation of energy trading have made little progress in Congress. 
Senator Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat, withdrew one such proposal last month when she could not muster enough votes to counter a Republican threat of a filibuster. 
A spokesman for Ms. Feinstein said the Senate Agriculture Committee would hold a hearing later this month on her plan to give the Commodity Futures Trading Commission purview over energy trading. 
Supporters of the bill, however, expect a tough fight. "What will it take to get the amendment passed?" Mr. Erickson said. "That is the question of the day."

HEADLINE: Carter's Trip to Cuba Raises Many Hopes From All Sides 

BYLINE:  By DAVID GONZALEZ 

DATELINE: HAVANA, May 11 

 BODY:
Former President Jimmy Carter arrives in Cuba on Sunday as the most prominent American political figure to venture across the chasm between two nations separated by 90 miles and 43 years of Communist rule.
 While no major policy breakthroughs are expected during his five-day visit, which is billed as a private one, many here hope that Mr. Carter's presence will advance their efforts for change. 
 The Cuban government would like to see Mr. Carter speak out against the United States trade embargo. Mr. Carter's administration was marked by an easing of American policy toward Cuba. 
Meanwhile, human rights advocates hope that Mr. Carter will lend support to their campaign for greater political and economic freedoms -- his speech at the University of Havana on Tuesday evening is to be broadcast live on state television.
In either case, there are expectations that the visit could signal the start of a dialogue that shifts the focus away from adversarial suspicion toward a more constructive vision of relations between the countries.
"Since the 1960's the only thing I've seen coming from Washington, Miami and Havana is rhetoric," said Bernardo Benes, a Miami banker who helped the Carter administration negotiate the release of 3,600 political prisoners and establish family visits to the island. "I do not see any reason for the status quo to continue. Nobody is gaining anything."
But the fact that Mr. Carter is traveling here at Mr. Castro's invitation has led others to worry that the former president's visit is merely a ploy by Mr. Castro to add some luster to his own image. Last month, a resolution sponsored by Latin American countries censured Cuba at a meeting of the United Nations Human Rights Commission. 
The trip has been met with skepticism by some Cuban-Americans, including several lawmakers who tried, unsuccessfully, to have the Bush administration prevent Mr. Carter from getting the federal license necessary for traveling to Cuba. 
The staunchly anti-Castro Cuban-American National Foundation, which sent a delegation to brief Mr. Carter in Atlanta last week, cautiously supported the trip.
Foundation leaders, excoriated by the Cuban government as part of the "Miami Mafia," suggested they were willing to see the embargo end if Havana allowed free elections.
Joe Garcia, the foundation's executive director, added that Mr. Carter's worldwide stature as a human rights advocate brought with it special responsibilities in Cuba.
"The creator of the international standard in human rights is going to meet with the greatest violator of human rights in the hemisphere," Mr. Garcia said. "He is a former president and his role has to be significant or it would not be worth risking his legacy."
However, one prominent human rights advocate in the United States expressed concern that Mr. Carter would not take full advantage of his chance to address the Cuban nation.
"My fear is that the most he would do is make a few references in the abstract about human rights," the advocate said. "That is the most you can expect, as well as a very clear condemnation of the embargo as a unilateral policy."
Chief among the concerns for human rights advocates and dissidents is the fate of the Varela Project, a petition drive for a referendum on greater individual freedoms, amnesty for political prisoners and permission for Cubans to own their own businesses.
On Friday, its sponsors delivered two boxes to the National Assembly filled with petitions signed by 11,000 people, 1,000 more than needed in order to have a referendum, as set out in the Cuban Constitution. It is the biggest peaceful challenge yet to the Cuban government.
These rights advocates have also been compiling lists of political prisoners to present to Mr. Carter. The list grew shorter by one name this month when the government released Vladimiro Roca, the last of four people who had been sentenced to five years in prison after calling for greater liberties.
Mr. Roca said Friday that he did not expect to see rapid changes coming from Mr. Carter's visit, although it would give a lift to him and his colleagues. But he was also aware that the trip could just as easily be used by the government to distract people from the country's problems. 
"They are like the Roman Caesars who had to give people bread and circuses," he said. "When you have no more bread, give them circuses. It is no different with Carter's visit."

HEADLINE: 2 PARTIES PREDICT A SHARP INCREASE IN SPENDING BY U.S. 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 11 

 BODY:
Congress and the Bush administration are heading toward further big increases in government spending, reflecting the costs of fighting terrorism, election-year support for domestic programs and the apparent lack of a political penalty for the reappearance of budget deficits.
 Despite a commitment by President Bush to hold down the size and scope of government -- and a brewing revolt among conservatives who say they are determined to resist further increases -- spending grew substantially this year and is all but certain to be up sharply for years to come, private analysts and members of both parties said. 
 While Republicans generally support limited government, they are now pushing for the largest military buildup in 20 years, huge increases in spending on domestic security and many domestic programs like the farm bill, in addition to election-year pork-barrel spending.
The parties, however, remain sharply divided on spending for many social programs, with Democrats, as always, backing higher spending for education, the environment and health care programs like Medicare coverage for prescription drugs.
With revenues already depleted by the combination of the recession and the tax cut Mr. Bush pushed through Congress last year, the continued growth in spending will probably push the government deeper into deficit for at least the next few years, they said. 
Although Republicans blame Democrats for pushing spending ever upward, members of both parties have supported many increases as vital or at least justifiable. The cumulative effect has been a multiyear spending surge that began when the budget surplus was large and has continued now that the government is back in the red.
"We're seeing very little, if any, discipline on the spending side," said L. Douglas Lee of Economics from Washington, a consulting firm. "Long-term projections still show surpluses in the future, but the assumptions underlying those projections are increasingly unrealistic. Large tax cuts combined with growing outlays threaten deficits as far as the eye can see."
The rise in spending is giving the economy a lift as it comes out of the recession, economists said. But they said that if left unchecked, the deficit growth could ultimately harm the economy.
Mr. Bush is seeking and is all but certain to get the biggest military spending increase in two decades, the centerpiece of a buildup that the two parties generally agree is justified by the threat of terrorism. 
Spending is rising sharply in many other areas as well. Congress completed work this week on a bipartisan farm-aid bill that is expected to cost billions of dollars more over the next few years than projected even a few weeks ago.
In the next month or so the House will vote on a Republican plan to spend $350 billion over the next decade, nearly twice what the White House had sought, on overhauling Medicare and providing retirees with a prescription drug benefit. Democrats in the House and the Senate are considering a plan that could cost as much as $800 billion.
Next week the House Appropriations Committee is expected to approve a $29.35 billion supplemental spending bill for this year, $2 billion more than Mr. Bush sought. The Senate Appropriations Committee plans to take up its version of the measure soon and is expected to add billions of dollars more.
As Congress prepares to work on the spending bills for next year, the White House is already warning lawmakers not to let expenditures grow beyond what Mr. Bush has requested. 
"From the first of the year, the president has been cautioning about the need not to practice a guns-and-butter policy," said Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., director of the White House Office of Management and Budget. "The president is resolute. The House leadership is resolute. Those are two good disc brakes. The problem is that the vehicle is already moving pretty fast."
Many of the formal and informal constraints on spending have been tossed aside by choice or circumstance, including budget rules that set spending limits and the bipartisan agreement not to dip into the Social Security surplus.
Democrats have not been able to get a budget plan through the Senate this year, meaning Congress may have to take up the annual spending bills without a blueprint for how much money should be allocated to domestic and military programs.
Efforts by the administration to push through spending cuts in some areas to offset increases in others have brought the White House nothing but political heartburn.
Last week the administration effectively abandoned a proposal to slim down the federal student loan program after an outcry from Democrats and Republicans. In considering the supplemental spending bill, the House Appropriations Committee provided much of the financing sought by the Energy Department for increased nuclear security even after Mr. Daniels slashed the request. 
After a year in which Mr. Daniels infuriated appropriators from both parties by suggesting that they had never met a spending proposal they would not embrace, the House appropriations panel did rally around one budget cut: a reduction of $750,000 in the $78 million annual budget for Mr. Daniels's own agency.
Depending on how big a supplemental spending bill Congress approves, discretionary spending -- the programs Congress has to vote on each year -- will probably total $720 billion to $740 billion this year, up from $657.4 billion last year. Mr. Bush's budget calls for an increase in discretionary outlays next year to $773 billion.
Those figures do not include the costs of mandatory programs, those that are not revisited each year, including farm subsidies, Medicare and Social Security.
Democrats do not want to be tagged as big spenders and risk their claim, a legacy of Bill Clinton's presidency, to being the party of surpluses and fiscal responsibility.
But they do not want to surrender over spending programs, contending that the tax cut is the root of the fiscal problems, not increased spending. They admit, though, that they lack the votes to delay or repeal the tax cut, which phases in over the rest of the decade.
Representative David R. Obey of Wisconsin, the senior Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, said voters in his district wanted the government to provide needed services.
"At least 80 percent of the people I talk to want more investment in education, not less," Mr. Obey said. "They want more done with health care. We just opened a dental clinic in Portage County, which I got the money for a year ago, and we have a waiting list of 300 people and 400 more who can't even get on the waiting list. People recognize that there's plenty of need."
Moreover, Democrats say, spending by some measures remains relatively low by historical standards. Total government outlays this year are expected to equal just under 20 percent of gross domestic product, up from 18.4 percent two years ago but down from 23 percent 20 years ago.
Much of the spending increase this year and next year is tied to the fight against terrorism. But some of it comes from programs that many conservatives consider bloated or ineffectual, especially the new farm bill. Conservatives are considering steps like offering scores of amendments to tie up appropriations bills they consider excessive.
"This is the major issue for conservatives in the House," said Representative John Shadegg of Arizona, the chairman of the Republican Study Committee, a group of 70 conservatives who have been pressing their party's leaders to clamp down on spending.
"Many of us are deeply concerned about spending spinning out of control," Mr. Shadegg said. "We're looking at every option we have to make sure it doesn't."

HEADLINE: North Korean Migrants Pull U.S. Into a Diplomatic Mess 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

DATELINE: BEIJING, May 11 

 BODY:
The eight North Koreans who tried to storm into two foreign consulates in the northeastern Chinese city of Shenyang this week were seeking asylum in the United States, not in South Korea, the requested destination of previous asylum seekers, a diplomat and rights advocates familiar with the group say.
 This new twist in the recent spate of North Korean defections via diplomatic compounds in China pulls the United States into a messy international debate. It also puts to the test President Bush's statement in February that he had "great sympathy and empathy for the North Korean people." 
 It may also help explain why three North Korean men are still in the United States Consulate after three days, even though a previous group in Beijing got clearance to leave in just over a day. 
Today the consulate would not confirm the request for asylum in the United States, saying only that negotiations with the Chinese were still going on. The request for asylum in the United States "made a complicated situation even more complicated," said one non-American diplomat in Beijing.
Two of the North Koreans successfully scaled the wall of the American Consulate in Shenyang on Wednesday and another on Thursday. Five other North Koreans, including a 2-year-old girl, tried to enter the nearby Japanese Consulate on Wednesday but were detained by the Chinese police.
Though North Koreans have previously sought refuge and asylum at the United States Embassy in Beijing -- as well as the Spanish and German Embassies here -- they have asked to go to Seoul, and Western diplomats have merely acted as conduits to secure their departure from China. South Korea has a policy of accepting the North Koreans.
But the request for asylum in the United States pushes the Americans to take an explicit stand on a politically loaded question: Should the hundreds of thousands of North Koreans illegally in China be given protected political refugee status under United Nations covenants? Such status would make it illegal to return them to their homeland.
For political reasons, they have never been accorded that designation even though the United Nations high commissioner for refugees has said that a large number of them probably qualify under treaties that China and the United States have both signed.
China, insisting that the North Koreans are economic migrants rather than political refugees, has refused to give United Nations inspectors permission to interview the North Koreans within its borders, essentially blocking an official designation. Furthermore, in the absence of such protection, China continues to send back thousands, if not tens of thousands, of North Koreans each year under bilateral diplomatic agreements with North Korea, its longstanding ally.
The Chinese have tightened security around all embassies and consulates since the spate of invasions began and have also been stepping up searches for illegal North Koreans in the northeast, who are repatriated if they are found. Previously, the Chinese police often turned a blind eye to the illegal migrants who live in the border region, which is population by ethnic Koreans.
If the United States directly granted the North Koreans political asylum, it would not only put new pressure on its already delicate relationship with China but it would also almost certainly scuttle the Bush administration's current exploration of ways to restart a dialogue with North Korea.
In a copy of a letter carried by the five people detained at the Japanese Consulate, provided by rights activists familiar with their case, the North Koreans said they had chosen the United States in part because they feared that they might be attacked by North Korean undercover agents in South Korea as retribution for their family's political background.
In 1997, the patron of the clan was arrested on the charge of making a statement against the government and disappeared. Since then, the rest of the extended family has suffered persecution, the letter said, leading many members to flee to China, although almost all have been captured repeatedly and sent home to stints in prison. 
Last June, five other relatives sought asylum in a United Nations office in Beijing and were eventually resettled in Seoul. Once there, they published a book containing drawings by a teenage family member of starvation and official cruelty under the North Korean government. 
Since the "incident, our family were hunted down more viciously by North Korean police and have had to hide in many different places in China," the letter said. "There are no places we can hide anymore."
The letter mentioned, too, that the family has discovered a distant relative in the United States. It added that the group hoped to draw more attention to the plight of North Koreans by directly seeking help from the American government.
North Koreans who are resettled in Seoul are discouraged from speaking out about their former homeland, in part because the government does not want their grisly tales to upend the current policy of working toward reconciliation with the North. 
The group of five apparently decided to go into the Japanese Consulate, whose gate was partly ajar, after they concluded that the walls of the United States Consulate were too high for some group members to scale -- one woman is elderly and her daughter is pregnant.
While most of the North Koreans initially come to China in search of food to escape the famine in their homeland, they are often considered traitors once they leave, particularly if they have done so repeatedly or have had contact with foreigners.
South Korean groups, many with church affiliations, have long assisted the illegal North Koreans in China with food and housing. Some have also started to help the migrants find an escape, in some cases apparently providing guidance and letters in English that explain their plight.

HEADLINE: Congress Awakens to AIDS With a Convert's Zeal 

BYLINE:  By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 11 

 BODY:
Two decades into the global AIDS epidemic, an unlikely alliance of lawmakers is pressing President Bush to increase spending by hundreds of millions of dollars this year to help foreign nations grapple with the disease.
 The Bush administration has budgeted $780 million for the global AIDS fight this year. On Thursday, however, Republicans on the House Appropriations Committee voted to add $200 million in global AIDS money to an emergency measure for domestic security and military spending. The White House had not asked for the money. 
 Next week, the Senate Appropriations Committee is to vote on its version of the emergency spending bill and will consider adding as much as $700 million for global AIDS. 
Republican and Democratic lawmakers predict the total will be $500 million when the House and Senate bills are reconciled, which would mean nearly $1.3 billion to fight the disease globally. The money is to be allocated by Sept. 30, with more likely next year.
"It took tens of millions of people being infected and dying before our political system woke up to those realities," said the economist Jeffrey D. Sachs, who recently served as chairman of a World Health Organization panel that examined the economic impact of AIDS. "But there is no doubt it is waking up now." 
Among those who have undergone an awakening is Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House minority leader, who talks with passion about a trip he took to Africa in 1999. Mr. Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, led a Congressional delegation to South Africa, Nigeria and Zimbabwe, intending to learn about economic and political conditions. Instead, he said, he came away with a single message: "AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS. I came away knowing and believing that this is the moral issue of our time."
Now, Mr. Gephardt is calling for the United States to spend $2 billion a year to fight the AIDS pandemic. A few years ago, he would have been laughed out of official Washington for such a suggestion. Today, however, Mr. Gephardt has a surprising partner in his fight: Senator Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican, who also wants more money, though not billions, for global AIDS.
Mr. Helms, 80, has frequently denounced foreign aid as "a rathole" and has infuriated gay people by asserting that homosexuals were to blame for the spread of AIDS in this country. Yet as he prepares to retire, the senator is calling for $500 million for medicines that would prevent expectant mothers infected with the human immunodeficiency virus from passing it on to their babies. 
The reasons for the change in Congressional sentiment are varied, and even proponents of more spending disagree on how much money is needed and precisely where it should go. Some lawmakers have come to embrace the disease as a children's issue, citing predictions that the number of AIDS orphans will increase to 40 million in 10 years. 
Sandra Thurman, the former top AIDS official in the Clinton administration who runs a nonprofit group, the International AIDS Trust, said she began pitching the concept to Congress as early as 1999.
"If you can't get Democrats and Republicans to agree on everything," Ms. Thurman said, "you can get them to agree on children." 
Others, like Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, see the disease as a national security threat, creating political and economic instability that will breed the next generation of terrorists. Former President Bill Clinton, who has made combating global AIDS a priority of his ex-presidency, has made this argument in a series of speeches.
Some lawmakers, notably Mr. Helms, have credited Bono, the Irish rock star who has become something of a cult figure in Washington with his pleas for more aid to fight global poverty and disease. Some credit Kofi Annan, the United Nations secretary general, who last year called for a new global fund to fight AIDS. The fund awarded its first grants last month.
Still others, like Mr. Gephardt, have witnessed the devastation up close and cannot quite get over what they saw.
"It is a life-changing experience," Mr. Gephardt said, "to go there and confront physically what it means to have 22 million people H.I.V. positive without any drugs, without any real infrastructure to deliver drugs. We went to a hospital in Johannesburg and we went through pediatrics wards and we learned that about half the babies born in the hospital are H.I.V. positive. I asked, 'How long will these children live?' Some were in preemie incubators. And they said, 'Less than a year.' " 
Infection with the AIDS virus is now the leading cause of death in sub-Saharan Africa, according to UNAIDS, an arm of the World Health Organization. On Friday, the agency reported that 6,000 young people age 15 to 24 and 2,000 children under 15 were infected with H.I.V. every day.
Yet the agency said medicines to prevent mother-to-child transmission of the virus reached fewer than 5 percent of women in sub-Saharan Africa.
The White House says the United States is providing nearly half of all international financing to fight the epidemic. A spokesman, Scott McClellan, describes the United States as "a world leader" in the fight against global AIDS.
But advocates for people with AIDS say that in light of the staggering tally of H.I.V. infections and AIDS deaths, the administration and Congress are not doing nearly enough. They note that Secretary Annan has called for $10 billion in annual global AIDS spending and say the United States' share should be one-quarter of that, or $2.5 billion, delivered immediately.
"Three million Africans are going to die this year," said Dr. Paul Zeitz, executive director of the Global AIDS Alliance, an advocacy group in Washington. "I want $10 billion this year. I don't buy this incremental response. I think it's a hoax." 
Yet even as he denounced the federal government's lack of "political will to stop global AIDS," Dr. Zeitz allowed that sentiment in Congress was beginning to shift.
"It's a clear link to the war on terrorism," he said, noting that the Central Intelligence Agency had reported that countries heavily affected by AIDS are susceptible to political instability. "That's why people might have perked up about it."
Among the most surprising converts to the global AIDS cause is Mr. Helms. Those who know him well say he was heavily influenced not only by Bono, but also by Samaritan's Purse, a Christian relief organization in his home state that is run by the Rev. Franklin Graham. The group recently held a conference in Washington and invited Mr. Helms to speak.
The senator, the ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is not running for re-election this year and is currently recovering from heart surgery. He told Mr. Graham's group he was ashamed he had not done more, said Lester Munson, a Republican spokesman for the Foreign Relations Committee.
"He put it in very personal terms," Mr. Munson said, "in a religious, Christian context." Senator Bill Frist, the Tennessee Republican and a heart surgeon, said Mr. Helms's remarks were raising awareness among his Senate colleagues.
"He has opened their eyes to a plague of biblical proportions," Senator Frist said.
Like Mr. Gephardt, Senator Frist said his eyes were opened by seeing the epidemic firsthand. He volunteers frequently for medical missions in Africa and has worked as a surgeon in Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania, often operating on people infected with H.I.V.
"When I'm in the hospital taking care of people," he said, "I'm with the nurses, the doctors, the villagers, the tribal people. I know what's going on." President Bush has said that before he devotes more money for global AIDS, he wants assurances that it will be well spent. 
Senator Frist says he will introduce legislation in the form of a strategic plan that will meet Mr. Bush's demands.
"My goal, by the time I get out of here," Senator Frist said, referring to the Senate, "is to look back and say, we have reversed the tide."

HEADLINE: Pataki Says a Battered State Needs Him for 4 More Years 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: PEEKSKILL, N.Y., May 11 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki told supporters today in this gritty river town where he began his political career that the state needed his leadership for the next four years to navigate treacherous economic times.
 "These are uncertain times, but we will meet these uncertain times in no uncertain terms," the governor said as he formally announced his campaign for the third term that, eight years ago, he promised he would never seek. 
 Speaking to a crowd of about 1,200 people, many of them bused in from New York City by union leaders, Mr. Pataki cited his achievements in cutting taxes, forcing welfare recipients to work and conserving open space. He also took credit for the drop in crime in his two terms. 
The governor, a Republican who said in 1994 that he would serve no more than two terms, said that since the terrorist attack, the state was confronted by the need to rebuild not only Lower Manhattan but also the state economy. He said he had learned from his father, Louis Pataki, who delivered mail and was a volunteer firefighter here, to confront obstacles head-on. "I have no intention of walking away from these difficult challenges," he said.
Mr. Pataki, who is 56, seemed to take pains not to mention the Republican Party in his 20-minute speech, focusing instead on the themes of "unity and pride." He also did not mention his two Democratic challengers, State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, and Andrew M. Cuomo, the former federal housing secretary who is the son of the man Mr. Pataki defeated eight years ago.
His formal announcement appeared to have been designed to present the governor not just as a champion for suburban whites, but also as a candidate who had reached across party lines and appealed to black and Latino voters as well. About a third of those in the crowd were black and Latino health workers bused in by Dennis Rivera, a Democrat and the leader of the state's largest hospital workers' union. 
There were many Hispanic supporters carrying Amigos de Pataki signs, and the governor addressed them in Spanish. Before the governor spoke, Elton Brand, the professional basketball star from Peekskill, who is black, told the crowd of his love for the Pataki family. He stood behind Mr. Pataki throughout the event.
"It's an integrated crowd, and that's a reflection of the work of the governor," Mr. Rivera said. 
At this stage, the governor appears to be in a strong position. Campaign finance records show that he has more than $16 million in the bank for his campaign. His popularity has soared since Sept. 11, and he has avoided deep budget cuts.
Mr. Cuomo and Mr. McCall have tried to question the governor's record. Mr. McCall, who is black, has said Mr. Pataki is not committed to civil rights. Mr. Cuomo has questioned the governor's performance after the terrorist attack. Both Democrats have hammered at Mr. Pataki for the struggling economy in upstate New York and the poor status of education in New York's cities. 
Mr. Pataki stood on the steps of City Hall here to declare his candidacy, saying that in doing so he was coming home, but that he had journeyed a long way since becoming Peekskill's mayor in 1982. 
He has become more flexible since his first campaign for governor in 1994, running on a narrow platform of cutting taxes, paring government regulation and restoring the death penalty. He has moved to the left on some issues since then, appropriating traditionally Democratic issues like the environment and health insurance for the poor.
Over the last year, he has also looked for votes in urban Democratic strongholds. He has courted Latino voters by taking a stand against the Navy's use of a Puerto Rican island as a bombing range, and pushing for a new Senate district dominated by Dominicans. 
He has also proposed several bills to soften the state's harsh sentences for drug offenses, a significant issue in black and Latino neighborhoods. Critics say his proposals still leave too much power in the hands of prosecutors and are spiked with tougher sentences for certain crimes, but his efforts have not gone unnoticed among black and Hispanic leaders.
After seven years in the Assembly minority, he ran against Senator Mary B. Goodhue, a Republican and former friend, defeating her in 1992 with an aggressive campaign. His first year in the Senate, he defied the majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, a Long Island Republican, and voted against the budget because it reduced neither spending nor taxes. 
That vote set him up for his first race for governor. He defeated the four-term incumbent, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, with the help of Senator Alfonse D'Amato. 
As governor, in 1995, Mr. Pataki cut income taxes and slashed spending for health care, mass transit and education, despite fierce opposition and in the face of a $5 billion deficit. The next year, he held up the budget for three months until he won changes to workers' compensation insurance. In his first term, he signed the death penalty law, revamped the welfare system, passed a bond act for the environment and persuaded the Legislature to abolish parole for violent felons.
He swept easily to victory in 1998 over a weak Democratic challenger, Peter F. Vallone, the speaker of the New York City Council. Mr. Pataki's policies in his second term have been markedly less conservative. The economic boom of the late 1990's made revenue soar, and he expanded spending on education and health care significantly. He also championed tougher gun control laws.
Mr. Pataki still says he believes in limited government, low taxes and a tough stance on crime, but these days he talks as much about health care for the poor and drug subsidies for the elderly as he does about cutting government and red tape. 
One sign of Mr. Pataki's drift leftward is his alliance with Mr. Rivera, a Democrat and the leader of 1199/S.E.I.U., the giant health care union. In January, Mr. Pataki pushed through legislation that ensured raises for most of Mr. Rivera's members despite the sinking economy. 
The union has repaid the governor with its endorsement. Hundreds of union members came to today's event from the city. Salsa music blared and drummers in dreadlocks played Afro-Cuban rhythms.
The governor's conflicts with the Legislature have continued, however. When the economy soured last spring, Mr. Pataki refused to raise spending beyond what he had proposed in January. A 10-month budget stalemate became a constitutional crisis when he sued the Legislature. 
The impasse was only broken by the Sept. 11 attack, which pushed the economy into recession and forced the two sides to come to terms. This year, as tax revenue has dropped, he has proposed a budget that averts major cuts to services by spending much of the savings he stashed away over the last four years.
The budget depends on more than $1 billion in one-time revenue. If the economy does not improve markedly, the next governor may have to raise taxes or slash services to deal with a gaping deficit next year.
Mr. Pataki made it clear today that he did not want to leave those hard choices to a Democrat, even if he never mentioned his opponents. "We have to continue to make the right decisions," he said.

HEADLINE: Sequels? Sure. But Godard, Too. 

BYLINE:  By ANITA GATES

 BODY:
THE Jedi knights are back. So are the under-age spies, the small-town serial killer, the talking mouse, the mod 60's agent with bad teeth and a pair of men who look great in black. Otherwise it looks like a catchall season, maybe because so much has happened since Americans last settled in for something as frivolous as a new batch of summer movies.
 There are films based on works by Melville, Wilde and Capote and just as many that began as Saturday-morning cartoon shows, Web-site series and theme-park attractions. In one unfortunate town, residents are being attacked by giant spiders; elsewhere, a young man in a red spider suit is attacking evildoers. 
 Godard, Rohmer, Chabrol and Zhang Yimou have new films, as do the American auteurs Steven Spielberg, Woody Allen, Steven Soderbergh and John Sayles. Some actors are playing at least slightly against character: Gwyneth Paltrow doing literary research, Tom Hanks getting tough as a hit man, Matthew McConaughey slaying dragons. Tom Cruise, Mel Gibson and Eddie Murphy are doing science fiction. And in a romantic triangle in which the wife is having an affair with a younger man, Richard Gere is playing the husband. 
Here are 145 or so of the films in our near future, with opening dates, as usual, very likely to change -- and change again. Hope you like sequels.

June

KAATERSKILL FALLS: "Knife in the Water" moves to the Catskills. In this low-budget, Americanized version of Roman Polanski's 1962 thriller, a Manhattan couple heading out on a country weekend pick up a young hitchhiker who ends up spending the night with them. The three are soon faced with a harrowing moral quandary. Josh Apter and Peter Olsen directed. June 5.

BAD COMPANY: One black, one white, both cops or private eyes or secret agents. Hollywood has found that a sure-fire box office formula in the last few years. But who would have thought that the next team would be Chris Rock and Anthony Hopkins? Mr. Rock plays a streetwise hustler whose twin brother, a C.I.A. agent with a different kind of savvy, has been killed. Sir Anthony is the veteran agent who has to train the hustler to take his brother's place, fast. A comedy directed by Joel Schumacher, who worked with another crime-fighting team in "Batman and Robin." June 7.

CHERISH: A thriller about romantic obsession, starring Robin Tunney as a love-starved animator. Put under house arrest (wrongly charged with a hit-and-run), she listens to entirely too much gooey 70's and 80's radio. What else is there to do? Fall in love with her parole officer (Tim Blake Nelson)? With Jason Priestley and Lindsay Crouse. Directed by Finn Taylor, who wrote the dreadful "Pontiac Moon." June 7.

DIVINE SECRETS OF THE YA-YA SISTERHOOD: Mothers and daughters don't always get along, but relatively few daughters actually get disowned. Ellen Burstyn and Sandra Bullock play Vivi and Siddalee, a less-than-friendly pair, in the film adaptation of Rebecca Wells's best seller. Callie Khouri, who made her reputation with the screenplay of "Thelma and Louise" 11 years ago, turns to the world of women's friendships again. She directed and wrote the screenplay with Mark Andrus, who also wrote "As Good as It Gets." Ms. Bullock's character is a Louisiana-born actress whose eccentric mother won't speak to her. The Ya-Yas are the mother and her best friends since youth (Shirley Knight, Maggie Smith and Fionnula Flanagan), who always enjoyed being bad girls. Now they're determined to help Vivi and Siddalee make peace. The cast also includes Ashley Judd (as young Vivi), James Garner and Cherry Jones. June 7.

THE FAST RUNNER (ATANARJUAT): Probably the only movie you'll see in Inuktitut this year. In fact, this fable from another millennium is the first feature film ever made by the Inuit people of northern Canada. The story, based on local legend, is a romantic triangle with a simple moral: it's never a good idea to fall in love with the fiancee of the chief's son. It received the award for best first feature at the Cannes Film Festival and the award for best Canadian film at the Toronto festival. A. O. Scott of The New York Times pronounced it a masterpiece when it appeared at the New Directors/New Films series earlier this year. With Sylvia Ivalu, Natar Ungalaaq and Peter-Henry Arnratsiaq. Directed by Zacharias Kunuk. June 7.

HARVARD MAN: A campus drama about one student (Adrian Grenier) who partakes of sex, drugs, gambling and, to some degree, higher learning. On the love-life front, there's a beautiful mobster's daughter and a beautiful philosophy professor. With Sarah Michelle Gellar, Joey Lauren Adams and Eric Stoltz. Directed by James Toback, who directed "Two Girls and a Guy" and wrote "Bugsy." June 7.

IVANS X.T.C.: Danny Huston -- son of John, grandson of Walter and brother of Anjelica -- stars as Ivan Beckman, a Hollywood version of Tolstoy's Ivan Ilyich. Ivan, a very hot talent agent, is dead at the beginning of the film, which proceeds to show us how it all happened. Drugs, debauchery, a terminal illness and his gun-loving, woman-hating, gay-bashing best client (Peter Weller) play major roles. With Tiffani Thiessen, Valeria Golino and the Muppet heir Lisa Henson. Directed by Bernard Rose. June 7.

MAMA AFRICA: A documentary about young women coming of age in urban Africa. From three African directors, the film is introduced by Queen Latifah. June 7.

CUBA FELIZ: A documentary about a 76-year-old Cuban street singer, Miguel del Morales, on a road tour with his guitar. In Spanish with English subtitles. Directed by Karim Dridi. June 12.

THE BOURNE IDENTITY: Richard Chamberlain starred in a television movie version of Robert Ludlum's novel. Now Matt Damon takes on the role of Jason Bourne, a master spy who has amnesia and so has no idea why hired killers are after him. But Bourne is pretty sure he's not a bank clerk, after he notices how good he seems to be at languages and self-defense. With Julia Stiles, Chris Cooper and Franka Potente. Directed by Doug Liman, who brought an impressive energy to his earlier efforts, "Swingers" and the lovable "Go." June 14.

CINEMA PARADISO: This is not your standard rerelease. This director's cut of 1990's Oscar winner for best foreign picture is now half an hour longer than the original. Philippe Noiret and Jacques Perrin are the stars of Giuseppe Tornatore's memory film about a director who goes back to the Sicilian village where he grew up and recalls how, as a boy, he fell in love with the movies. In Italian, with English subtitles. June 14.

THE DANGEROUS LIVES OF ALTAR BOYS: Back in the 1970's, what would two eighth graders in a Southern parochial school have done if they were dying of boredom? In this film, directed by Peter Care, they create a violent, sacrilegious comic book, a project that does not please their teachers, who include Jodie Foster as a nun with a wooden leg. Kieran Culkin and Emile Hirsch play the boys. The cast also includes Vincent D'Onofrio and Jena Malone. The film, based on Chris Fuhrman's novel, includes 12 minutes of animation. Of course the title, which was probably meant to be playful, takes on all kinds of unintended meaning now. June 14.

GANGSTER NO. 1: Malcolm McDowell, David Thewlis and Paul Bettany in a psychological portrait of a British career criminal and the new man who wants to be just like him. The film covers 30 years in their relationship and culminates in a major battle of wills. Directed by Paul McGuigan, who did "The Acid House." June 14.

THE GREEN DRAGON: A drama about Vietnamese refugees in California. From Timothy Linh Bui (who was co-writer of "Three Seasons," directed by Tony Bui, his brother), a story of cross-cultural friendships at Camp Pendleton. With Forest Whitaker, Patrick Swayze, Trung Nguyen, Jennifer Tran and Don Duong. June 14.

THE EMPEROR'S NEW CLOTHES: It's a romantic comedy about Napoleon, not Hans Christian Andersen's inadvertent nudist. Ian Holm (whose most recent role was Bilbo Baggins in "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring") plays two characters, Napoleon Bonaparte and the look-alike sailor who takes his place in exile. In this scenario, based on Simon Levy's novel "The Death of Napoleon," the great Bonaparte secretly sneaks back into Paris with a group of loyalists. The plan, of course, is to return him to the throne. (Although Napoleon was fed up with a lot about exile anyway. "Six years of English cooking!" he announces in horror.) But then he meets a woman: a melon seller called Pumpkin (Iben Hjejle, who was John Cusack's girlfriend in "High Fidelity"). Directed by Alan Taylor. June 14.

LOVE AND A BULLET: A drama about a hit man rethinking his career choice, especially after he's instructed to kill his boss's innocent girlfriend. The hit man is played by Treach, a k a Anthony Criss, from the rap group Naughty by Nature. And he's sure to be involved in a showdown. Directed by Ben Ramsey and Michael McCants. June 14. A related article is on Page 22 of Summer Movies.

THE NEXT BEST THING: Chris Eigeman in a satiric comedy about the New York art world. Mr. Eigeman is a starving artist who has a painting stolen, which the thief (Jamie Harris) makes famous but attributes to an imaginary artist. With Connie Britten and Farley Granger. Written and directed by P. J. Posner. Not to be confused with John Schlesinger's 2000 film "The Next Best Thing," in which Madonna and Rupert Everett have a one-night stand and a baby. June 14.

SCOOBY-DOO: Scooby hit television in 1969, a cartoon Great Dane with a decided aversion to anything scary. Yet he and his gang continue to solve crimes, all of them nonviolent. In Raja Gosnell's live-action film, Scooby is computer-generated and everyone else is live. Freddie Prinze Jr. plays the clear-thinking Fred, who has inexplicably been wearing an ascot since the 60's. Sarah Michelle Gellar is Daphne, who wears go-go boots, even now. Linda Cardelini is Velma, the intellectual of the group. And Matthew Lillard is Shaggy, who lives permanently in panic mode. Fred is in the haunting-debunking business, and Rowan Atkinson is his latest client. June 14. A related article is on Page 15 of Summer Movies.

SECRET SOCIETY: A British-German comedy about a fat factory worker (Charlotte Brittain) who becomes a sumo wrestler. Her unemployed husband (Lee Ross) has always loved the way she looks. Directed by Imogen Kimmel. June 14.

WINDTALKERS: Nicolas Cage stars in John Woo's World War II drama about the American military's use of the Navajo language as code. Mr. Cage's character, a marine, is assigned to protect a particular "code talker" (Adam Beach, who starred in "Squanto: A Warrior's Tale" and whose other 2002 project, oddly enough, is "Skinwalkers"). The tough part about this arrangement is that if a code talker is about to be taken prisoner, it's his protector's job to kill him first. Christian Slater, Frances O'Connor and Mark Ruffalo are also in the cast. Mr. Woo, of course, is no stranger to suspense or violence ("Mission: Impossible 2," "Face/Off"). June 14.

NOT NUDE THOUGH: A PORTRAIT OF RUDY BURKHARDT: The life and work of Burkhardt, the postwar photographer, filmmaker and painter. A documentary directed by Doris Kornish. June 19.

WAR PHOTOGRAPHER: An Oscar-nominated Swiss documentary about James Nachtway, who has covered wars around the globe for two decades. What makes him notable, Christian Frei, the filmmaker says, is that he's not a hardened cynic. "The worst thing is to feel that as a photographer I am benefiting from someone else's tragedy," Mr. Nachtway has said. "This idea haunts me." Filming locations include Kosovo, Ramallah and Jakarta. June 19.

JUWANNA MAN: A bad-boy basketball player gets kicked out of the pros, so he dresses like a woman in order to join the women's league. And it works. But like Dustin Hoffman's Tootsie before him, he falls in love with a beautiful colleague. Miguel A. Nunez Jr. stars, with Vivica A. Fox, Kevin Pollak, Kim Wayans and Lil' Kim. Directed by Jesse Vaughan. June 21.

LILO AND STITCH: Disney's major animated entry for summer. The tale of a strange little girl in Hawaii and her new pet (who is actually a six-legged space alien, pretending to be a dog because the intergalactic police are after him). Unfortunately the alien wreaks havoc wherever he goes. The girl is also a huge Elvis fan. Directed by Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois. With the voices of Tia Carrere, Ving Rhames, Zoe Caldwell and Mr. Sanders (as the alien). June 21. A related article is on Page 15 of Summer Movies.

MINORITY REPORT: Tom Cruise, directed by Steven Spielberg -- and that's enough to get a lot of people into the theater. Mr. Spielberg doesn't like to give away a lot about his movies in advance, but we do know that this is science fiction set about a half-century in the future and based on a story by Philip K. Dick. (Dick wrote "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?," which became "Blade Runner." ) Mr. Cruise plays a future cop in a world where law enforcement is allowed to execute murderers before they've actually killed. This is with the help of seers who alert the police to coming crimes. With Samantha Morton. Oh, and it's reported that Mr. Cruise's character drives a 2058 Lexus. June 21.

SUNSHINE STATE: In John Sayles's new comic drama about Florida real estate development, everyone and everything seem to be on the brink of change. Angela Bassett and Edie Falco play two hometown girls who have returned to their families after their individual, unrelated show business dreams have fizzled. As their quiet small town turns into just another corporate resort town, both women deal with their aging parents and try to plan new lives for themselves. With Jane Alexander, Ralph Waite, Mary Alice and Timothy Hutton. June 21.

SKIN OF MAN, HEART OF BEAST: A French thriller about violence and mental illness in a rural family, as seen by two children. Directed by Helene Angel. June 21.

MONEY BUYS HAPPINESS: Two lovers growing in different directions and trying not to. An absurdist comedy written and directed by Gregg Lachow, a Seattle filmmaker. June 26.

THE COCKETTES: They were a motley crew of San Francisco hippies -- men, women, gay, straight. They loved gender-bending drag 30 years ago, and some people say they invented glitter rock. David Weissman and Bill Weber reflect on those midnight shows ("Gone With the Showboat to Oklahoma," "Tinsel Tarts in a Hot Coma") in North Beach in this documentary. With appearances by John Waters, Holly Woodlawn and the omnipresent Sylvia Miles. June 28.

CROCODILE HUNTER: COLLISION COURSE: A crocodile has accidentally swallowed a top-secret satellite beacon, and Steve Irwin, the Animal Planet adventurer, is there. And he thinks the government agents chasing the crocodile are poachers trying to kill it. Spiders, snakes, guns! Directed by John Stainton. June 28.

HEY ARNOLD! THE MOVIE: Arnold, a big-city fourth grader with a large, football-shaped head, is the star of his own animated television series on Nickelodeon. In his first feature film, Arnold and his multicultural friends are up against bad grown-ups planning to build a "mall-plex" nearby. With the voices of Spencer Klein, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Christopher Lloyd. Directed by Tuck Tucker. June 28.

IN PRAISE OF LOVE: Godard lives. But his new film, released in France as "Eloge de l'Amour," was described by A. O. Scott in The Times as "a lavish expression of artistic impotence, a great filmmaker's elegy for his own lost relevance." The film's central characters are an elderly couple who worked in the French Resistance during World War II. They have finally agreed to sell their story to Hollywood because they need the money to hold on to their little country hotel. The film, which also involves a young man looking for a woman who may be the couple's granddaughter, is half color and half black-and-white. With Jean Davy, Francoise Verney, Bruno Putzulu and Cecile Camp. June 28.

LOVELY AND AMAZING: From Nicole Holofcener, who did "Walking and Talking," a comic family portrait of four neurotic but resilient women. Brenda Blethyn plays a mother of three. Jane (Catherine Keener) is in a miserable marriage. Elizabeth (Emily Mortimer) is an insecure actress who takes in stray dogs. And the little sister, Annie (Raven Goodwin), may be adopted, but she's showing signs of all the family hang-ups. June 28.

MR. DEEDS: The idea that Adam Sandler is playing the Gary Cooper role in a remake of Frank Capra's "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town" is cause for a double take. But then it's not exactly a remake. Mr. Sandler plays a small-town New Hampshire pizzeria owner who suddenly inherits a fortune from a long-lost relative. That includes $40 billion, a couple of sports teams and the world's largest media conglomerate. Chances are, the money won't change him -- except to make even clearer the things in life that are really important. Winona Ryder plays a reporter who disapproves of him. Steven Brill, who directed, also directed Mr. Sandler in "Little Nicky." Tim Herlihy, the screenwriter, also wrote "Billy Madison," "The Wedding Singer" and a few other Sandler hits. June 28.

PUMPKIN: Sorority girl falls for disabled boy. Christina Ricci stars in this romantic comedy going for a politically incorrect tone. In hopes of being named best sorority on campus, Carolyn (Ms. Ricci) and her collegiate sisters volunteer to coach local athletes who are mentally or physically handicapped. Carolyn ends up working with a boy named Pumpkin Romanoff (Hank Harris), who has a beautiful soul. Brenda Blethyn plays Pumpkin's overprotective mother, who calls Carolyn a slut and a pedophile. Directed by Adam Larson Broder and Tony Abrams. June 28.

A SONG FOR MARTIN: Bille August, who gave us "Pelle the Conquerer," wrote and directed this romantic drama. For Martin, a noted conductor-composer, and Barbara, a symphony violinist, it's never too late to leave their families (the children are grown now, after all), run away together and start a new life. But even in their beautiful home on the Swedish coast, bad things can happen to the happily remarried. With Sven Wollter and Viveka Seldahl. June 28.

DAHMER: THE MIND IS A PLACE OF ITS OWN: Jeremy Renner plays Jeffrey Dahmer (1960-94), who killed 17 men and cannibalized them. He was killed in prison by a fellow inmate. With Bruce Davison and Matt Newton. Written and directed by David Jacobson. June.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 19, 2002

 CORRECTION:
A listing last Sunday in Summer Movies, Part 2 of this section, misstated the title and release date of a comedy about the New York art world written and directed by P. J. Posner. It is "The Next Big Thing," not "The Next Best Thing"; it will open in New York on May 29; the general release is June 14.
A listing on May 12 in Summer Movies, Part 2 of this section, for "Minority Report," scheduled to open on June 21, referred incorrectly to the plot. It depicts a future world in which with the help of seers, people are arrested before they commit murders; they are not executed.

BYLINE:  By ANITA GATES 

 BODY:
THE Jedi knights are back. So are the under-age spies, the small-town serial killer, the talking mouse, the mod 60's agent with bad teeth and a pair of men who look great in black. Otherwise it looks like a catchall season, maybe because so much has happened since Americans last settled in for something as frivolous as a new batch of summer movies.
 There are films based on works by Melville, Wilde and Capote and just as many that began as Saturday-morning cartoon shows, Web-site series and theme-park attractions. In one unfortunate town, residents are being attacked by giant spiders; elsewhere, a young man in a red spider suit is attacking evildoers. 
 Godard, Rohmer, Chabrol and Zhang Yimou have new films, as do the American auteurs Steven Spielberg, Woody Allen, Steven Soderbergh and John Sayles.

Tom Cruise, Mel Gibson and Eddie Murphy are doing science fiction. And in a romantic triangle in which the wife is having an affair with a younger man, Richard Gere is playing the husband. 
Here are 145 or so of the films in our near future, with opening dates, as usual, very likely to change -- and change again. Hope you like sequels.

A GRIN WITHOUT A CAT: The 1960's look so romantic from a distance. Chris Marker, a Parisian-born filmmaker, created this three-hour documentary about the French left in the 1960's and 70's back in 1977, then updated it in 1993, after the breakup of the Soviet Union. Dave Kehr, writing in The New York Times earlier this month, called the film "a work of extraordinary journalism" as well as "a work of deft and subtle poetry." Castro, Allende, Guevara and the Shah of Iran make appearances. This is the American premiere of this version of the film. May 1.

HOLLYWOOD ENDING: In Woody Allen's newest comedy, which is scheduled to open the Cannes International Film Festival this week, he plays a has-been film director trying to make a comeback. Unfortunately, that may mean working for his ex-wife (Tea Leoni), who is now the studio head's girlfriend. Maybe that's why he goes psychosomatically blind. The cast also includes George Hamilton, Erica Leerhsen, Debra Messing and Mark Rydell. Which makes the average age of the male stars 65, and the average age of the female stars 31. Not that there's anything wrong with that. May 1.

UZUMAKI: A Japanese horror film about slime-covered snail people and and a working-class town obsessed with spirals. May 1.

ABC AFRICA: Abbas Kiarostami, Iran's Palme d'Or-winning director, usually makes more intimate movies, about personal relationships and the stages of life ("Taste of Cherry," "Through the Olive Trees"). This documentary, about the orphans of Uganda, is a considerable change of pace. There are two million Ugandans with H.I.V. and two million already dead, leaving more than a million and a half children without parents. In English and Farsi, with English subtitles. May 3.

DEUCES WILD: We haven't seen much in the teenage gang genre for a while. This one, directed by Scott Kalvert (a video director who moved on to feature films with "The Basketball Diaries"), is set in 1958 Brooklyn. There's a new gang in town, and the guys in the good gang have to stop them before they take over the streets. Matt Dillon, Stephen Dorff, Fairuza Balk and Frankie Muniz (of "Malcolm in the Middle") star. Some suggest that the unrest that year was because the Dodgers had moved to L.A. May 3.

FLEEING BY NIGHT: Some romantic triangles are more complicated than others. From Taiwan, the story of a theater owner's daughter torn between love for her fiance, who is a cellist, and feelings for an opera star. And just to keep things interesting, the fiance has feelings for him too. The setting is 1930's China. With Rene Liu, Lei Huang and Chao-te Yin. Directed by Chi Yin. May 3.

HOME MOVIE: Home being the operative word here. A tour of five extremely unusual residences and the unusual people who live there. The houses include a Hawaiian treehouse, a Bayou houseboat-mansion and a missile silo in Kansas. A documentary by Chris Smith("American Movie"), which won the 1999 documentary grand jury prize at the Sundance Film Festival. May 3.

THE MYSTIC MASSEUR: Ismail Merchant without James Ivory or their usual screenwriter, Ruth Prawer Jhabvala. Caryl Phillips, the Caribbean-born novelist, wrote this fable based on V. S. Naipaul's 1957 novel about diversity and cultural integrity in 1940's Trinidad. Aasif Mandvi, who was so impressive Off Broadway in "Sakina's Restaurant," plays Ganesh, a former teacher who wants to be an author but moves to the country, becomes a masseur and makes it big as a healer. Which means that now people want to buy his books. With Om Puri (as Ganesh's father-in-law), Ayesha Dharker and James Fox. May 3.

SPIDER-MAN: This isn't the next career move you'd expect from Tobey Maguire, who has made his mark as an innocent, sensitive type in films like "Pleasantville" and "The Cider House Rules." He's playing the young Marvel Comics superhero who fights crime by scaling buildings like an arachnid. In his first film, Spidey, as his friends call him, is up against the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe). The cast also includes Kirsten Dunst, as the superhero's love interest; Cliff Robertson, as his wise Uncle Ben ("With great power comes great responsibility"); James Franco, who was eerily good as James Dean in a TNT film last year; and the stage star Rosemary Harris. Written by David Koepp, who did the screenplay for "Panic Room" and was Michael Crichton's co-writer on "Jurassic Park." Directed by Sam Raimi, who did "A Simple Plan." This is not Mr. Raimi's first encounter with superheroics; 12 years ago he guided a relatively unknown Liam Neeson in the title role of "Darkman." May 3.

WARM WATER UNDER A RED BRIDGE: From Shohei Imamura -- who directed the Palme d'Or-winning film "The Eel" -- is the story of a Japanese businessman (Koji Yakusho) who has been through some difficult times and goes to a little seaside village. He's searching for a particular stolen Buddha, which would certainly cheer him up. He finds, among other things, a very unusual woman (Misa Shimizu) whose sexual satisfaction is so transporting that it affects nature around her. Based on "Akai Hashi No Shita No Nurui Mizu," a novel by Yo Henmi. In Japanese, with English subtitles. May 3.

DIAMONDS AND RUST: Life aboard a diamond mining ship off the coast of Africa. Directed by Adi Barash and Ruth Shatz. Playing with "Profit and Nothing But!" In English, Hebrew, Namibian and Spanish, with English subtitles. May 8.

PROFIT AND NOTHING BUT!: A documentary about the global economic system and its impact on developing countries. Written and directed by Raoul Peck. In English, French and Haitian, with English subtitles. May 8.

UNFAITHFUL: Richard Gere, Diane Lane and the sexy young French newcomer Olivier Martinez in an adultery thriller. Adrian Lyne, who does well with intense relationship stories ("Fatal Attraction," "Indecent Proposal," the underrated 1997 "Lolita"), has done a remake of "La Femme Infidele." The French original was about a husband who kills his wife's lover, which leads to her loving the husband more than ever. The American version is big on the psychology of guilt. May 8.

BLACKWOODS: A screenwriter cheerfully heads out on a weekend trip to meet his girlfriend's family. But the family turns out to have invited him there under false pretenses, and he is in huge running-through-the-woods trouble. With Patrick Muldoon, Michael Pare and Keegan Connor Tracy. Directed by Uwe Boll. May 10.

ESPN'S ULTIMATE X: An action documentary about the 2001 X Games in Philadelphia. That means skateboarding, biking, moto X (which has something to do with motorized bikes) and street luge. Directed by Bruce Hendricks, the film is 42 minutes and is being shown only on Imax and other large-format screens. May 10.

JANICE BEARD: Eileen Walsh plays Janice, a young Englishwoman who has moved to London for a good cause. She wants to earn money to get treatment for her agoraphobic mother. The job Janice finds is as a typist (the film's original British title was "Janice Beard: 45 Words Per Minute") at a car manufacturing company. There she meets and falls in love with the mail-room guy (Rhys Ifans, who was Hugh Grant's clueless flatmate in "Notting Hill"). Patsy Kensit plays Janice's boss. This is a comedy about, ultimately, industrial espionage. Directed by a newcomer, Claire Kilner. May 10.

THE LADY AND THE DUKE: Eric Rohmer, the French New Wave legend, is 82 now (he directed "My Night at Maud's" in 1969) and still creating. "L'Anglaise et la Duc" is the story of a Scottish noblewoman trapped in Paris during the French Revolution. Her relationship with Philippe, Duke of Orleans, a cousin of Louis XVI's, may or may not be a good thing. Lucy Russell and Jean-Claude Dreyfus star. If the film has an unusual 3-D look, it's because of the virtual sets: painted backdrops inserted digitally. May 10.

LAGAAN: ONCE UPON A TIME IN INDIA: A four-hour Bollywood musical about taxes. In 1893, in a small village in British-occupied India, a new land tax is imposed. But Captain Russell (Paul Blackthorn), the local overseer, decides to give the villagers a break. If they can beat the English in cricket, the tax will be repealed. Aamir Khan stars. In Hindi and English, with a half-dozen song-and-dance numbers. May 10.

THE NEW GUY: Here's a peculiar premise for a comedy. If you're an uncool high school student, just get yourself expelled and end up in prison. There you'll meet a lot of guys who can teach you everything they know about coolness. Then, after your release, you can start a new life at a new high school and be happy and popular. Unless a bully from your old school turns up. D. J. Qualls plays the fortunate uncool young man. His co-stars include Lyle Lovett, Zooey Deschanel and Eddie Griffin. Directed by Ed Decter. May 10.

CREMASTER 3: Matthew Barney's work is experimental, avant-garde and deliberately dreamlike. This three-hour film is the final one in his five-part Cremaster cycle, and a good deal of its action takes place in the Chrysler Building and the Guggenheim Museum. With Richard Serra, Aimee Mullins and a couple of New York hardcore bands. Mr. Barney appears as the Entered Apprentice, who is up against dental surgery, a woman who's half-cheetah and an all-Chrysler demolition derby. Wednesday.

STANDING BY YOURSELF: A 24-year-old filmmaker's Oscar-nominated documentary about his own 16-year-old brother's descent into drug use, binge drinking and generally antisocial behavior. The younger brother's best friend goes along for the ride, too. The film, from Josh Koury, was shown at Slamdance, one of the other film festivals in Park City, Utah. Wednesday.

STAR WARS: EPISODE II -- ATTACK OF THE CLONES: Little Darth Vader is growing up. He's still known as Anakin Skywalker and he's still in training to be a Jedi knight, but the young villain-to-be is now played by 21-year-old Hayden Christensen. This is the fifth "Star Wars" film, and the third from both the mind and directorial hand of George Lucas, and most of the old gang from the last one are still around: Natalie Portman as Amidala (who was a queen and is now a senator), Ewan McGregor as Obi Wan-Kenobi, Samuel L. Jackson as Mace Windu, R2D2, C3PO, Yoda and the annoying Jar Jar Binks. Thursday. A related article is on Page 3 of Summer Movies.

ABOUT A BOY: Hugh Grant is playing a bad boy again, with definite similarities to his character in "Bridget Jones's Diary." This time Mr. Grant is an irresponsible, independently wealthy London bachelor who revels in his single-guy privacy. But he decides to join a single-parents' group because it seems like a good way to meet women. No, he doesn't have children, but he invents a son. He's not at all interested in the frantic, suicidal vegetarian single mom played by Toni Collette, but her 12-year-old son (Nicholas Hoult), whom he meets on a double date, decides to make Mr. Grant his father figure. This may or may not turn our hero into a grown-up. Based on the novel by Nick Hornby (who also wrote "High Fidelity"). Directed by Paul and Chris Weitz, who gave us, of all things, "American Pie." Friday.

LATE MARRIAGE: If you're a 31-year-old bachelor in New York or Los Angeles or Kansas City, no problem. If you're a 31-year-old bachelor in Tel Aviv, you're a shame to your parents and your community. This is the unfortunate situation of Zaza (Lior Louie Ashkenazi), whose Georgian emigre parents are getting desperate for their son to find a nice girl and give them grandchildren, in "Late Marriage," an Israeli comedy about true love, family tradition and death threats. Seems Zaza has a good reason to be uninterested in all the nubile young women who are pushed in front of him. He's in love with a 34-year-old Moroccan divorcee (Ronit Elkabetz) who has a child. The film won nine Israeli Oscar-equivalents last year and earned enthusiastic reviews at the New Directors/New Films series in New York last month. Written and directed by Dover Kosashvili. In Georgian and Hebrew, with English subtitles. Friday.

BACK OF THE WORLD: A Peruvian documentary about the disenfranchised. Subjects include child labor in South America, a Turkish parliament member who was jailed for using the Kurdish language in a speech, and a death row inmate in Mississippi. Javier Corcuera directed. May 22.

THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST: Rupert Everett is Algernon, Colin Firth is Jack, Reese Witherspoon is Cecily, Frances O'Connor is Gwendolyn, and Judi Dench is Lady Bracknell, the key figures in Oscar Wilde's 1895 play. In late Victorian England, apparently, young bachelors occasionally bent the truth when speaking to young ladies, and two of those men are about to be found out during an eventful country weekend. There's also the matter of an infant found in a handbag at Victoria Station. Oliver Parker, who did the film version of "An Ideal Husband" three years ago, directed and wrote the screenplay. May 22. A related article is on Page 31 of Summer Movies.

BARTLEBY: Yes, it's an update of "Bartleby the Scrivener," Herman Melville's 1853 story. Crispin Glover plays the title character, a mild-mannered public records clerk, who really starts something when one day he tells his boss, "I would prefer not to." He refuses to work or to leave, which creates a problem for his boss. This is an absurdist black comedy directed by a newcomer, Jonathan Parker, and reviewed favorably at the New Directors/New Films series this year, with the observation that Melville may have been the spiritual father of Dilbert. With Glenne Headly, Joe Piscopo and David Paymer. May 24.

C.Q.: Roman Coppola, son of Francis, makes his feature-film directorial debut. The setting is 1960's Paris, where the director of a sci-fi film has gone off the deep end, partly because he's become obsessed with his star (Angela Lindvall), playing Dragonfly the secret agent. A young American filmmaker (Jeremy Davies, whose first starring film role was as an incestuous student in "Spanking the Monkey") is called in to finish the film, which is set in the future -- the year 2001, that is. Unfortunately, Dragonfly captures his fancy too. Gerard Depardieu and Giancarlo Giannini, among others, make appearances. Mr. Coppola, who is 36 and who made a brief childhood appearance in "The Godfather: Part II," wrote the screenplay as well. May 24.

ENOUGH: Jennifer Lopez tries on a damsel-in-distress-fights-back role. And Billy Campbell, the boyishly cute star of ABC's popular but dead series "Once and Again," shows us his villainous side. In the beginning she's a waitress and he's a rich contractor. The next thing you know, they have a dream suburban marriage and an adorable 5-year-old daughter. But soon the husband has become abusive and obsessive. The wife runs away to start a new life, but he finds her and she decides that the only solution is to murder him. (Didn't Julia Roberts already do this in "Sleeping With the Enemy"?) The cast also includes Noah Wyle and Juliette Lewis. Directed by Michael Apted, whose films include "Nell" and "Coal Miner's Daughter." Written by Nicholas Kazan, who did the razor-sharp "Reversal of Fortune" and the maudlin "Bicentennial Man." May 24.

INSOMNIA: An American remake of a 1997 Norwegian film starring Stellan Skarsgard as a Swedish detective on assignment. In the new film, Al Pacino plays an American detective sent to a small town in Alaska to investigate the murder of a teenage girl. He ends up playing cat-and-mouse games with the major suspect (Robin Williams), but the detective is being watched himself by a local police officer (Hilary Swank), who is checking out the death of the detective's partner (Martin Donovan). Directed by Christopher Nolan, who wrote and directed the intriguing Pinteresque thriller "Memento" last year. May 24. A related article is on Page 1 of Summer Movies.

SIA, THE DREAM OF THE PYTHON: For many cities, it's a recurring problem -- which young virgin to sacrifice to the snake god. This time, in poverty-stricken Kombi, it's Sia, the most beautiful girl in town. Her fiance, understandably upset, tries to stop it. A film, based on a seventh-century legend, from Burkina Faso and France, written and directed by Dani Kouyate (also from Burkina Faso). The cast includes Sotigui Kouyate, Habib Dembele, Hamadoun Kassogue and Fatoumata Diawara. In Bambara, with English subtitles. May 24.

SPIRIT: STALLION OF THE CIMARRON: A horse's Western adventures as told by the horse (the voice of Matt Damon). This animated film is the story of a wild mustang stallion captured by cavalry soldiers. Spirit has had no dealings with human beings, but he soon makes friends with a young Lakota (the voice of Daniel Studi) and falls in love with another horse. Kelly Asbury directed. With songs by Bryan Adams. May 24. A related article is on Page 15 of Summer Movies.

13 CONVERSATIONS ABOUT ONE THING: Karma in the big city. A drama about the interconnected lives of various New Yorkers (a vengeful businessman, a cheated-on wife and a cheerful young cleaning woman, among others). Matthew McConaughey, John Turturro, Amy Irving, Alan Arkin and Clea DuVall star in this drama, directed by Jill Sprecher, who did "Clockwatchers," a comic drama about office temps. Ms. Sprecher and Karen Sprecher, her sister, wrote the screenplay. May 24.

ELLING: An Oscar-nominated Norwegian comic drama about two mental-institution roommates who get out, are given a state-supported apartment of their own in Oslo and begin to try to lead normal lives. But the two have trouble -- answering the telephone, shopping for groceries and remembering to change their underwear. Per Christian Ellefsen plays the shy title character. Sven Nordin plays the sex-obsessed Kjell, who learns that you never know what new friends you'll find if you pick up a drunken neighbor passed out on the stairs. Petter Naess directed. May 29.

NIJINSKY: THE DIARIES OF VASLAV NIJINSKY: "I worked like an ox," Vaslav Nijinsky wrote in the diaries that he began in 1919. "I lived like a martyr." Derek Jacobi is Nijinsky's voice in this film based on those diaries, which were first published in 1949. Nijinsky was, of course, the Russian dancer who scandalized Paris in 1912 with "L'Apres-Midi d'un Faune." With re-creations of his works by dancers from the Australian Ballet and Leigh Warren & Dancers. Directed by the Dutch-born, Australia-based Paul Cox, whose other film subjects have included Father Damien and Vincent van Gogh. May 29.

MASTER OF THE FLYING GUILLOTINE: The New York theatrical premiere of a 1974 martial arts film. (A long story about an edit-happy American distributor, a few Midwestern drive-ins and lost negatives.) Wang Yu's film is about a blind monk's efforts to kill his archenemy, the one-armed boxer. With Jimmy Wang Yu, Kam Kang and Tak Chi Chen. In Cantonese, with brand-new English subtitles. May 31.

THE SUM OF ALL FEARS: Ben Affleck follows in Harrison Ford and Alec Baldwin's footsteps, playing Jack Ryan, Tom Clancy's he-man C.I.A. hero. It's a good thing he's around, because terrorists have found a nuclear device buried since the 1967 Arab-Israeli conflict. And they've decided the Super Bowl in Baltimore would be a nice occasion for detonation. In Mr. Clancy's 1991 novel, the terrorists were Arab; in the film, they've been transformed into neo-Nazis. With Morgan Freeman, James Cromwell, Liev Schreiber and Alan Bates. Directed by Phil Alden Robinson, who dealt with gentler themes in "Field of Dreams." May 31.

UNDERCOVER BROTHER: Eddie Griffin as a secret agent in an all-black brotherhood devoted to the unceasing battle against The Man. Now the agent is going undercover in order to sabotage Operation Whitewash, and it will require his wearing tennis sweaters and penny loafers. Luckily he has a beautiful partner, Sistah Girl (Aunjanue Ellis), with whom to go up against villains like Mr. Feather (Chris Kattan). Finally, a comedy based on a Web-site series. Directed by Malcolm D. Lee, who did "The Best Man." May 31.

JOSHUA: Tony Goldwyn plays the title character, a mysterious newcomer to a small town who begins doing a bevy of good works, from rebuilding a church to just bringing people together. The film is based on a 1983 novel by Joseph F. Girzone, a retired priest, in which he imagined Jesus' life if he had lived it in the 20th century. With F. Murray Abraham and Giancarlo Giannini. Directed by Jon Purdy, whose previous subjects have included Al Capone, John Dillinger and the Unabomber. May.

Is Your Health Insurance Hurting Your Credit?

BYLINE:  By EVE TAHMINCIOGLU 

 BODY:
BECAUSE she had health insurance, Martha Rudnik, a former home care aide from Westport, Mass., assumed that the bills for her hip-replacement operation last May would be handled expediently. The procedure, she said, was clearly covered under her plan. But in the weeks after her surgery, she received a flurry of past-due notices from the hospital and doctors, on bills totaling more than $20,000.
 It was only after four months of dunning phone calls to her medical providers and the insurer, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, that the matter was resolved, she said. "Our credit is very good," Mrs. Rudnik, 52, said, adding that she would never want an unpaid bill to come back to haunt her family. 
 Lisa Watson, 33, a homemaker from Levittown, Pa., found that out the hard way. She said a lender she had contacted recently about refinancing her home mortgage told her that she and her husband wouldn't qualify for the lowest available interest rate, because of a mark on their credit report. A billing error had delayed the payment of a $200 hospital bill for her son Ryan last year, and the physician turned over their account to a collection agency, she said. "I assumed it was taken care of," Mrs. Watson said. 
Their frustration is a familiar story. Medical payment delays have become almost routine, but left unresolved they can spell trouble for consumers, possibly affecting their ability to borrow for a new home or car, or even to get the best deal on a credit card.
Hard numbers are elusive, though credit counselors, consumer advocates and others say anecdotal evidence suggests that the problem may be on the rise despite laws in most states that are intended to protect consumers.
Richard Kirsch, executive director of Citizens Action of New York, says one of every five calls to the group's managed-care consumer assistance unit has to do with payment delays. "People are dealing with the enormous stress of having an illness, and on top of that they have the stress of bills," Mr. Kirsch said. In some cases, consumers, fearing that their credit will be damaged, end up paying the bill out of their own pockets even though it is the insurer's responsibility, he said.
Mary Rzeszut, who operates SMV Billing Solutions, a company in Mineola, N.Y., that assists consumers with medical claims, said: "Hospitals and doctors are quick to put you in collections these days. Doctors want their money, insurers drag their feet. But no one is willing to help the patient."
Medical providers and insurers blame each other.
"Insurance companies discovered the time value of money," said Timothy T. Flaherty, chairman of the American Medical Association in Chicago. He defended doctors' practice of quickly sending out past-due notices. "I think it's just good business practice; patients should be aware that their insurance company hasn't paid."
Unpaid bills can add up quickly. In New Jersey alone, about $1 billion in claims go unpaid annually because of insurance delays, according to a survey conducted last year by the Medical Society of New Jersey.
Insurers, though, contend that the providers are slow to file claims and often make billing errors. They also cite a lack of uniformity in health insurance forms. All providers need to move from paper to electronic billing systems if claims are to be paid immediately, said Karen Ignagni, president of the American Association of Health Plans, a managed-care lobbying group.
In Mrs. Rudnik's case, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts said the charges from her surgery were paid within 30 to 35 days from the time the providers' bills were submitted. If a provider billed the patient, that was out of Blue Cross's hands, said Susan Leahy, a company spokeswoman.
Caught in the middle are consumers, some of whom may be unaware of serious problems until long after the fact. "When we pull a consumer's credit report and an outstanding medical charge appears, they say, 'What's that?' " said Patty Hasson, president of the Consumer Credit Counseling Service of Delaware Valley, a nonprofit group in Philadelphia.
In many cases, she added, consumers themselves do little to help the hospital or doctor straighten out a charge with an insurer. The provider then sends the patient's bill to a collection agency, she said.
While some employers who offer coverage will help with claims, it is often up to consumers to stay on top of their medical bills. The first step is to review the health insurance policy. "You can't rely on your doctor or billing office to know what coverage you have," Ms. Rzeszut said.
Consumers should also make sure that all the information on their insurance forms is correct and has been properly submitted, especially if they are receiving care from doctors who are not among the policy's network of providers. The greatest delays in medical claims are for out-of-network charges, because they involve providers who may be unfamiliar with the insurer's procedures, said William Garnett, president of the Benemax Company in Medfield, Mass., which manages employee benefits for more than 150 companies.
MS. RZESZUT recommends that consumers not pay a bill if they are certain that it is covered by their policy. If such a bill ends up in collections, she said, they should not feel threatened by the bill collectors. "Work with them to get the claims resolved," she said.
Credit reports often note when a claim is sent to a collector. These reports, maintained by the three major credit bureaus -- TransUnion, Experian and Equifax -- should be monitored by consumers at least once a year, financial experts say.
If a medical bill that should have been paid by an insurer appears on the report, the patient should immediately notify in writing all three credit agencies, which are required by law to review items a consumer disputes, experts say. The patient should then contact the insurer and the collection agency to find out why the payment was not made, they say.
Getting a black mark removed from your credit report can take several weeks or months of wrangling with the insurer, the provider and the collection agency. In the meantime, credit bureaus do allow consumers to include a 100-word statement on their credit reports explaining an outstanding debt. It can be a simple statement saying that you were fully covered by insurance at the time and that you are trying to resolve the matter.
Ms. Hasson of the credit counseling center in Philadelphia says she has found that lenders are more understanding when it comes to medical debt.
Lisa Mihailuk, a senior vice president in Countrywide Home Loans' consumer division in Plano, Tex., said consumers whose accounts are sent to a collection agency because of medical debt are typically considered a lower credit risk than those with other types of unresolved debt, because the problem is seen as an isolated incident and not a sign of a consumer's overall creditworthiness. There's a difference, she said, between raking up thousands in charges on a credit card and needing surgery. But the consumer will still have to remove the medical debt from the report in order for a conventional loan to be approved.
Consumers are not without protection. Most states have "prompt pay" laws regulating how long an insurance company may wait before making a payment -- usually 30 to 60 days -- though health care experts say some of the laws need more teeth. A few states are rewriting their laws to include tougher provisions. New Jersey, for example, recently revised its law mandating that electronic claims that are "clean," or clearly covered by insurance, be paid within 30 days and clean paper claims within 40 days; under its old law, clean claims had to be paid within 60 days.
New York State requires insurance companies to pay undisputed claims within 45 days. Since the law was signed in 1997, the state Department of Insurance has imposed fines totaling nearly $1 million for failure to comply. 
Texas is among the most aggressive states in enforcing such rules. Last year it fined 18 insurance companies more than $10 million for prompt-payment violations.
Mrs. Watson, the homemaker from Pennsylvania, is covered by a prompt-payment law in her state. But she says consumers must do their part first in ensuring that clean claims are paid on time. It cost her a low mortgage rate, and although her insurer eventually paid her claim, she is now trying to have the debt removed from her credit report. "It was my fault," she said. "I didn't stay on top of it."

Some Ways to Avoid Billing Surprises
Following are some tips from experts for keeping track of insurance claims:
* Check records. Make sure that your medical provider has all the correct billing information, including the identification or group number of your insurance plan.
* Stay in contact. After receiving a bill, check with the provider or the insurer to be sure that the claim is being processed. Write down the names of people with whom you speak, the dates and the confirmation numbers, if available. 
* Learn the codes. Verify that the medical procedure for which you are being charged is the one that was performed.
* Watch the numbers. Check with your insurer if you think you are being billed twice or being charged more than the contracted rate between the insurer and the provider.
* Get help at work. If your employer provides your insurance, the human resources manager or benefits department may be able to help with your claim.

Everyone Has a Peace Plan. And They Can All Wait.

BYLINE:  By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
TWO tense armed standoffs have been resolved in the past two weeks, even as bombs keep exploding and tanks roll toward expected reprisals. An international peace conference looms this summer. Israel and the Arab world have outlined competing visions that, however far apart, each claim the aim of a Palestinian state. The United States is off the sidelines and back in the fray.
 So it's time for progress toward peace in the Middle East? Maybe not. In fact, there is every sign that a new waiting game has just begun. The three most important players in this game -- President Bush, Ariel Sharon and Yasir Arafat -- have all shown signs that they see reasons to wait rather than press for a final deal now. 
 Since announcing plans for the peace conference, the Bush administration has gone out of its way to say that it will be only a meeting of ministers, to talk about what to talk about, not to make a deal. The administration's primary passion in the Middle East remains reserved for toppling Saddam Hussein, and managing the Israeli-Palestinian crisis is still seen as less of a priority, a means toward that end. 
Prime Minister Sharon of Israel talks of a whole new period of incremental security arrangements before a final peace settlement, meaning that true Palestinian statehood might have to wait 15 or 20 years. He and his aides say peace talks cannot even begin again until the Palestinian Authority is reshaped to replace Mr. Arafat as the sole leader.
Mr. Arafat, though under enormous pressure from Washington and Arab leaders to rein in violence, knows that in the long run, demographics, world opinion and perhaps the tide of history favor the cause of Palestinian statehood. American intelligence analyses have long held that he is never more patient, or content to wait for a better deal, than when everyone else is clamoring for movement. That was one lesson of Camp David.
Only the moderate Arab states, under pressure to defuse calls for reform from their own restless populations, express particular urgency about the need for quick progress toward ending the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, seizing on it as a proxy for grappling with their internal problems.
"Today, we stand on the knife's edge, and the danger is not only to the region but to the world," King Abdullah II of Jordan said in a speech at Rice University in Houston on Thursday, adding: "Today, I believe we need less process and more peace."
Similar sentiment is widespread in Europe. But all parties agree that only the United States has enough credibility and clout to force progress. And despite counterintuitive calls by some experts that the current stalemate provides an opening to leap ahead to what King Abdullah called "the finish line," the Bush administration has shown few signs it is willing to do so.
Under domestic political pressure to support Israel, the administration hasn't put forward a broad plan of its own. President Bush has publicly assured Mr. Sharon that "I'm never going to tell my friend the prime minister what to do on how to handle his business."
One senior administration official said of his and previous administrations: "Most of the time in the Middle East, we don't have an American plan. We listen to the parties. We don't sit in our capitals and think up great ideas. Sometimes, we have to add our ideas to the mix. But we hardly ever start a negotiation by going, 'Plunk!' "
Even Saudi Arabia, whose Crown Prince Abdullah recently proposed the carrot of broad Arab peace with Israel in exchange for Israel's withdrawal from lands occupied in the 1967 war, has shown no real willingness to brandish the stick of an oil embargo, which would hurt its own weak economy as much as the West's. Nor has the prince offered Israel the tantalizing prospect of direct talks, or a dramatic personal gesture equal to that of Anwar el-Sadat when he all but dared Menachem Begin to invite him to Jerusalem.
So despite the resolution of Israel's siege of Mr. Arafat's compound in Ramallah and of the armed standoff at the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, all sides are still playing for time. The latest suicide bombing in Israel last week left Secretary of State Colin L. Powell warning of the potential for setbacks even as he vowed to "keep moving forward."
"It's not rocket science where you have to get, and keeping a sense of where you have to get gives people the sense that the pendulum will oscillate around a fixed point," said James B. Steinberg, who was deputy national security adviser in the Clinton administration and is now at the Brookings Institution.
"The problem right now is that people have lost some sense of confidence that a deal can be done around that point," he added. "The Israelis have lost confidence that if they make concessions on territory and reach settlements on refugees and Jerusalem they will have real peace. And the Palestinians have lost confidence that what will be on offer any time soon is something that walks and talks like a state."
Israel and the Palestinians came close to those goals two years ago, before the collapse of peace talks at Camp David and Taba, Egypt, which had progressed as far as details of borders and control of Jerusalem. King Abdullah and other Arab leaders insist that new peace talks should build on that framework, not start from scratch, as Mr. Sharon is suggesting.
"If we're going to have a conference where we talk about timelines and modalities, that's frankly a waste of time," said Adel al-Jubeir, a foreign policy adviser to Crown Prince Abdullah.
SENIOR Israeli and American officials are just as insistent that they do not see a return to Camp David-style talks any time soon. They say 19 months of Palestinian terrorism and Israeli reprisals, together with the intense personal loathing between Mr. Sharon and Mr. Arafat, make that all but impossible.
Still, a number of respected experts have begun arguing that now is the time for a final settlement, which the United States and the international community would sketch out in advance, then push Israel and the Palestinians to accept in negotiations. These experts argue that the Oslo peace process allowed both sides to keep jockeying for advantage, by taking only interim steps and pushing off the toughest questions.
"The parties will be unable, if left to themselves, to stand down from this current situation, which is really characterized by violence, unless they have a political rationale and exit strategy," said Edward P. Djerejian, director of the James A. Baker III Institute of Public Policy at Rice University and a former ambassador to Syria and Israel. "I think the conference idea should be a step toward getting international consensus on exactly how the parties can be influenced toward negotiations, and it is really important to set out certain parameters. You don't have to reinvent the wheel."
But Mr. Djerejian added: "This is a period of intense policy formulation, because of the seriousness of the situation on the ground. It's going to take a few months to see where we actually come out."

Disparate Mediums, Familiar Messages

BYLINE:  By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
DEMOCRATS sometimes fret that there are too many disparate voices in their party and too many prospects for the White House in 2004. But maybe they should think again. While the field is indeed packed, discord isn't what you hear on the campaign trail. In fact, many possible candidates sound like they are reciting the same talking points.
 That is because often they are. 
 Democratic pollsters have been busy, scrutinizing the whims of voters and presiding over focus groups. And by and large, they've been coming to the same conclusion: Democratic voters don't want to criticize the war on terror, but they have bones to pick with the Bush White House on bread-and-butter issues. That advice is having an intriguing effect: when it comes time to deliver speeches, the candidates often seem to be speaking from exactly the same playbook. Sometimes, they use identical language. 
The biggest differences are not in content, but in how the speeches are written and what emphasis they give to one topic or another. Democrats all criticize the Bush tax cut, but they do not dare call for its repeal. They try to reclaim the education issue from Republicans. And they remind audiences that Mr. Bush's considered lowering arsenic standards in water.
The conventional wisdom is that the Democrats have a disjointed message because, without the White House, there is no leader to lay out a coordinated message. But maybe party leaders should get more credit. 
"In an odd way, the Democrats are moving toward a kind of consistency that is coming from all this listening to people," said Stanley Greenberg, a Democratic pollster. Senator Robert G. Torricelli, a New Jersey Democrat, said: "I hear the same people testing the themes all the time."
The most striking example occurred at a recent gathering in Orlando of the Florida Democratic Party. Several of the party's luminaries were there, and here are some samples from their speeches:
On terrorism, patriotism and following the leader:
Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts: "Make no mistake: we are united as never before in the effort to win the war abroad. But we cannot permit Republicans to pretend the war is the only issue before our country."
Senator John Edwards of North Carolina: "In many ways our country has never been more united. . . . While we fight these wars overseas, we can never forget to stand up for what's right here at home. The American flag represents freedom, opportunity and justice for all -- and that's what we believe in as Democrats!"
Former Vice President Al Gore: "All of us Democrats and Republicans are united on the war on terrorism. . . . We do stand shoulder to shoulder with the president and with our brave servicemen and women in defending America from terrorism. . . . Here in America, patriotism does not mean keeping quiet."
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut: "Right now, in the war on terrorism, I'm proud to say we Democrats are standing shoulder to shoulder with the president as we should. We're putting country above politics, as we must. For this war is about one thing, and only one thing: America, and defending our way of life."
Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic national chairman, speaking of Mr. Bush: "Patriotism demands that we stand shoulder to shoulder with him."
On the Bush tax cut:
Mr. Kerry: "They want to give a tax cut to the wealthiest Americans at the expense of the average citizen and the economic health of our nation."
Mr. Gore: "They wanted to shovel it out to the wealthiest tax brackets in the form of tax relief for those who need it least and the rest of the country gets peanuts and the American people get stuck with the bill."
Mr. Lieberman: "Instead of a plan to expand opportunity and grow the middle class, President Bush just gave us a tax cut."
On education:
Mr. Kerry: "It's also time to remind our Republican friends you can't keep saying teaching is your most valued profession but not value it with decent pay. You can't attract a new generation to the profession if you demagogue your way to office by bashing teachers."
Mr. Edwards: "We have to stand up, fellow Democrats, for the kids in this country who so desperately need a good education but can't get it because their school system is not providing it."
Mr. Gore: "Education has gotten short shrift. We made real investments in improving education. They the Republicans were satisfied in making headlines on education."
Mr. Lieberman: "The smartest investment we can make is to give our public schools the tools they need to meet our high standards. In particular, we can't expect our teachers to do the job we need them to do unless we give them the respect they deserve and the professional salaries they have earned."
On Social Security:
Mr. Kerry: "Social Security is a lot more than just a program. It's about the relationship between the government and its people. It's the promise we make to people who after a lifetime of labor in good faith have a right to expect that good faith will be honored."
Mr. Edwards: "People in this country who go to work every week and see that money going out of their paycheck to Social Security, to Medicare, should not have to worry whether Medicare or Social Security will be there when they finally retire."
Mr. Gore: "They've turned their back on America's covenant with our greatest generation, raiding the Social Security and Medicare trust funds without pause, without remorse and seemingly without even a thought to the long-term consequences of what they're doing."
On the collapse of Enron:
Mr. Gore: "We're the party of Main Street U.S.A. They're the party of the pirates of Enron."
Mr. Kerry: "We're not going to let George W. Bush do to Social Security what Arthur Andersen and the administration's friends did to Enron."
On the environment: 
Mr. Gore: "Who could forget when they tried to convince us that our water was too clean, and didn't have enough arsenic in it?"
Mr. Edwards said of his children: "I wonder if they will have clean air, and clean water to drink."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: FLUSHING; 
Bill Clinton, the Club (Not the Kind With Turkey)

BYLINE:  By JIM O'GRADY 

 BODY:
Since President Bill Clinton left office in January 2001, there hasn't exactly been a rush to name public facilities after him. Neither staff members from his Harlem office nor the Clinton Presidential Center in Arkansas could point to a single building or facility that has honored Mr. Clinton by adopting his name. 
 But somebody had to go first. So the New Century Democratic Association, a 300-member political club in Flushing, plans to rename itself the William Jefferson Clinton Democratic Club of Queens. 
 "I'm really excited about it," said the club president, John Dorsa. "It's going to provide us a higher profile." He said his would be the first political club in New York City to take Mr. Clinton's name. "We might be the first one anywhere," he added. 
To be fair, it often takes years before a public figure sees his name chiseled into a building. The most recent American president with his name on a New York public school is Lyndon B. Johnson (P.S. 223 in Jamaica, Queens, and P.S. 151 in Bushwick, Brooklyn).
The club plans to celebrate its change with a party Tuesday at Terrace on the Park in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. Mr. Dorsa said more than 300 tickets at $90 each had been sold by the middle of last week, mainly because the former president will be the guest of honor.
State Assemblyman Brian McLaughlin, who helped found the club in 1997, is also president of the New York City Central Labor Council of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., and so many club members are union members. Several of them cited the 90's economic boom as a reason for their fondness for Mr. Clinton. "You have to give him credit for it," Peter Manno, an electrician from Flushing, said of the former president.
Mr. McLaughlin said the only objections to the name change that he was aware of came from nonmembers who scrawled what he called wisecracks about the former president onto party invitations returned by mail. 
"Whoever Bill Clinton's detractors are, they usually criticize him for his personal behavior," he said. "Not his public policy." 
Paul Belliveau, a 41-year-old paperhanger and club member, said he not only supports the name change but also would like to see Mr. Clinton become more involved in local politics. "Maybe we can get him to run for City Council," he said. 
Mr. Belliveau, who plans to attend the party with his parents, wife and three children, may get the chance to offer his suggestion to Mr. Clinton in person. If the two men want to discuss the matter further, they could adjourn to the Stage Deli in Midtown Manhattan and order corned beef, chopped liver and onion on rye, a sandwich known as "The Bill Clinton."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH; 
Will Wall Street Become a Regular at the Courthouse?

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
BROKERAGE firms' stocks have been battered since Eliot L. Spitzer, the New York attorney general, released documents showing how alarmingly symbiotic the relationship was between Merrill Lynch's research and investment banking departments in recent years. Assuming that more damaging revelations are coming, investors have driven down the American Stock Exchange Securities Broker/Dealer index of 12 publicly traded securities firms by 12 percent in just the last month or so. 
 Merrill Lynch alone has lost $10.6 billion in market value since the attorney general's investigation was made public. Merrill's shares have fallen to $41.53, or around 1.7 times their net worth or book value, and they look alluringly cheap. Since 1995, the company has traded in a range of 1.31 to 3.7 times its book value. 
 Several securities analysts have said that the loss in Merrill's stock seems well in excess of the litigation costs the firm will incur dealing with analyst conflicts and that the shares are worth buying. But Brad Hintz, brokerage analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, in New York, is more cautious. In his recent reports on what the sundry investigations might mean for the industry and its stocks, Mr. Hintz has concluded that the potential litigation costs from a variety of plaintiffs could be much higher than some analysts have estimated. 
The psychological impact of the cases and the negative publicity they might bring could also delay a recovery in investor activity. Mr. Hintz reckons that the lawsuits will drag on into 2004. 
So far, assessments of Wall Street's vulnerability to customer lawsuits have focused on cases brought by individuals who bought stocks based on recommendations made by Henry Blodget or other Merrill Lynch analysts. Mr. Hintz argues that pension funds may also sue investment firms to recoup losses. He thinks the people who administer and manage these funds may be obliged, under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, known as Erisa, to sue an investment firm if the fund could recover substantial amounts of money.
There is no doubt that lots of money vanished in the technology stock bubble. Considering only the seven Internet stocks identified by Mr. Spitzer in his filing against Merrill Lynch, losses in market value from peak to trough totaled $118 billion, Mr. Hintz noted. Given Merrill Lynch's market share of Nasdaq trading during the period, Mr. Hintz estimates its maximum liability at $3.8 billion to $5.2 billion on the stocks.
Obviously, Merrill will do whatever it must to keep from having to foot such a bill. Still, the numbers provide some perspective on the potential liability at some Wall Street firms. 
There is another risk for investors. One lawyer, an expert on Erisa who spoke on condition of anonymity, reasoned that the Labor Department, as an administrator of Erisa, might bring action against firms where conflicts were apparent. The problem for Wall Street is that the Labor Department looks at firms as a whole and not as separate operating units. The lawyer explained, "If a Merrill Lynch advisory arm represents a pension plan and is buying stocks that Merrill Lynch is hyping through their analysts, and the firm is going to get some potential investment banking fees out of that, that is a potential conflict that I could see the Labor Department waking up to someday." 
There is no indication that such transactions took place at Merrill or at other firms. But throughout the 1990's, Wall Street firms built themselves into financial supermarkets, offering investment services of all kinds to all people. Such a vertical integration can lead to potential conflicts between the operations if the firms are not careful. And in the mania, who was?

Where TelecomBargain Hunters Turn

BYLINE:  By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
IT has been two months since Ivan G. Seidenberg, the chief executive of Verizon Communications, mused at an investment conference that his company might bid for WorldCom "for the fun of it" if the stock price of that long-distance and Internet carrier continued falling. 
 Since then, WorldCom's shares have dropped 80 percent, to $1.58 on Friday. But as Mr. Seidenberg wryly suggested, conditions in the communications sector are so tough that Verizon has no real interest in WorldCom at any price. Verizon, along with rivals like SBC Communications, BellSouth and Deutsche Telekom, all have plenty of their own problems without taking on WorldCom's, which include gigantic debt and an accounting investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 How bleak has the telecommunications scene become? Verizon's shares closed yesterday at $39.35, down 17 percent for the year, yet its investors can count themselves lucky. Telefonos de Mexico is the only member of the American Stock Exchange's index of 14 large North American telecommunications companies that has fared better since Jan. 1. Telefonos has risen 4.3 percent for the year, while the index has declined by 39.2 percent.
Such troubles invariably create opportunities for bargain hunters. Some portfolio managers have begun snapping up shares of equipment makers like Lucent Technologies, Nortel Networks and JDS Uniphase in the belief that the worst is over for them. Risk-tolerant investors have been heeding analysts who believe that the prices for some bonds issued by Qwest Communications International had dropped too far. Since April 30, the 10-year note issued in March by Qwest Corp., the company's operating subsidiary, has risen 3.4 percent to $100.54. And despite a drop in Worldcom's credit rating to junk status, the company's 3-year note maturing in May 2004 rose 23 percent for the week, closing at $68.77.
Some stock analysts recommend that investors consider companies like Alltel, CenturyTel and Commonwealth Telephone that serve rural areas. "Rural phone companies are great defensive alternatives," said Cannon Carr, who follows them for CIBC World Markets. Such companies receive government subsidies, have minimal involvement in the money-losing wireless segment and can market higher-priced services like broadband Internet links with less competition from the cable industry. On May 2, Commonwealth, based in Dallas, Pa., projected revenue growth of at least 3 percent this year and raised earnings estimates by 15 cents a share, to at least $2.
Abel Garcia, portfolio manager of the AIM New Technology fund, says the best bets in the sector are leading equipment companies, especially those in the consumer segment like Nokia, the world's largest cellphone maker, or UTStarcom, a leader in China's rapidly growing wireless business. "But we're not recommending any exposure to telecom," Mr. Garcia said. "Tech investors are better off looking at semiconductors or game companies."
From Wall Street's perspective, the industry's biggest problem may be its inability to merge long-distance companies like AT&T and WorldCom into the large local and wireless carriers. Wall Street would also like to see the wireless industry consolidate into three or four national companies. 
"The telecom industry is beset by destructive competition in almost every sector," said Frank J. Governali, who follows the major conventional telecommunications companies for Goldman, Sachs. But Edward E. Whitacre Jr., the chief executive of SBC, told investors last Monday that the government appears to oppose more big mergers.
Wireless companies are still adding customers, but they spend less time on their phones. Most of the companies are losing money, and there is uncertainty about consumers' willingness to pay for services like high-speed data transmission. AT&T Wireless, the largest publicly traded cellphone service in the domestic market, closed at $7.47 on Friday, down 75 percent from its initial offering price of $29.50 in 2000.
The conventional, or landline, companies, which Wall Street expected as of November to report revenue gains of 9 percent for this year, are now projected to end up with a 12 percent decline, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. The biggest phone companies are expected to continue cutting capital investments this year, which could deepen the slump at equipment suppliers.
It was fashionable last year for analysts to see the industry's problems as a temporary adjustment to excessive investment in new networks and services in the late 1990's. Now fears are rising that telecommunications has too much in common with industries like steel and airlines, in which profitability has been undermined repeatedly by overcapacity and competitive pressure.
That pressure extends well beyond the obviously declining segments, like long-distance voice service via landlines. Internet traffic doubled last year, but carriers were able to increase revenues from it by only 17 percent, according to estimates published last week by RHK, a market research firm. 
Adam Quinton, who follows the landline carriers for Merrill Lynch, recently concluded that their modest growth prospects over the next five years were comparable to those for gas and electric utilities. But big regional phone companies like Verizon are trading at an average of 12.5 times projected earnings for next year, compared with 11.3 times for the major electric utilities. That makes the phone sector look like a riskier bet. The only stock Mr. Quinton is recommending among those he follows is AT&T, and that is only because the company still owns the huge cable television business it has agreed to sell to Comcast. Until that deal closes, AT&T is a back-door way to invest in cable, according to Mr. Quinton.
AT&T and WorldCom provide a broad range of voice and data services to global companies, but their long-distance phone businesses are losing traffic to cellphones, e-mail, instant messaging and systems that send calls over the Internet. In addition, Verizon, SBC, BellSouth and Qwest, which own the local phone businesses created by the AT&T breakup in 1984, are gaining regulatory clearance to re-enter the long-distance business in their territories. 
IN the first group of states where the Baby Bells have begun selling long-distance along with local service, they have quickly grabbed as much as 20 percent of the market. Analysts from research firms like the Yankee Group expect that share to rise to 50 percent over the next few years. The battle is shifting quickly toward which companies can offer the most attractive bundles of local, long-distance, wireless and broadband services. That leaves the Baby Bells as the likely winners and better bets for long-term investors, many analysts say. 
Fans of the Baby Bells say these companies' dominance in their home regions gives them a strong foundation for riding out the sector's problems, and, to the extent allowed by the government, for buying assets from bankrupt competitors. Two of them -- Verizon and SBC -- also have solid dividends, yielding well over 3 percent. 
Patrick Comack of Guzman & Company expects that many prime assets of AT&T and WorldCom, including their services for big businesses with global operations, will eventually end up in the hands of one or another of the Baby Bells, known in the industry as regional Bell operating companies, or RBOC's. "At the end of the day, you're going to have the RBOC's battling each other," Mr. Comack said.

'Interactive' isn't aword cable customers are interested in.

BYLINE:  By Seth Schiesel 

 BODY:
IF anyone has deserved to be called Mr. Interactive Television in recent years, it has probably been Mitchell E. Kertzman, chief executive of Liberate Technologies. With almost $90 million in revenue over its last four quarters, Liberate is a leading independent developer of software for cable television set-top boxes that allow viewers to use two-way services.
 Liberate counts just about every major cable television company in the world among its clients. Mr. Kertzman has been so bullish about interactive television that last year he even tried, without success, to persuade Microsoft to sell its interactive television business to Liberate. 
 So it was a bit surprising last week at the cable industry's national convention in New Orleans that when asked for his assessment of the interactive TV landscape his first words were, "I've tried to stop talking about interactive television."
Come again?
"To me, the consumer, 'interactive television' sounds like interactive television is about making television harder to watch, like I have to work at television when I just want to watch it," Mr. Kertzman said. So now, he said, Liberate is trying to position itself as part of the cable industry's "core digital infrastructure."
After a few days at the National Cable and Telecommunications Association's convention, it became clear why Mr. Kertzman had changed his tune. 
In the cable business these days, expansive visions of the future are out. Detailed attention to operational details is in. Making new promises is out. Fulfilling past promises is in. 
If interactive television means ordering a pizza with your remote control or checking your child's report card on the picture tube, then interactive television is definitely out. For now, at least. There may be a few small interactive trials in scattered corners of the country, but it is not coming to you, the consumer, any time soon. 
Right now, the cable industry is focused on actually selling services that might have sounded futuristic just a few years ago but are deliverable today: digital television with hundreds of channels for the living room and high-speed office-caliber Internet access for the PC in the den. 
And the vision on the horizon is not interactive digital town meetings, but rather video on demand, enabling consumers to watch "The Sopranos" or "60 Minutes" whenever they want. 
"You start out with all of these broad visions, and then you come back to what is actually deliverable," said Michael K. Senken, chief executive of the Royal Philips Electronics broadband networks group, which sells equipment to television providers. "Look at Microsoft. They start out with all of these grand goals for television. Now it's, 'We have an interactive program guide.' "
Financially, the reasons for the restraint are fairly simple. The cable television industry has invested about $50 billion of investors' money over the last five years to upgrade cable networks to deliver digital services. Those investors now want to see serious returns before they hear about the next wave of new spending required to deliver full-fledged "interactive television.
That is a big reason cable stocks are down this year. Of the roughly 73 million United States homes served by cable television, about 15.2 million subscribed to digital television at the end of last year. About 7.2 million subscribed to a cable-modem service and about 1.5 million received local phone service over cable wires. 
All of those figures are up from essentially zero just a few years ago. But for investors, they are not yet enough. 
The cable operators "are really down to basics,"Mr. Kertzman said. "Hard reality set in, the stock market. Cable is out of favor right now and that is because cable has not yet demonstrated that it can deliver on the promise of digital."
And that is how one ends up with a convention full of seminars with titles like "Marketing Broadband," "The 110 Percent Solution: Solving Cable's Value/Price Equation" and "The Care and Feeding of Care and Feeding: Customer Service Today." 
Whether or not digital cable and cable-modem service are being introduced as quickly as investors might like, the cable industry certainly deserves credit for one thing. 
Even three years ago, satellite providers like Hughes Electronics' DirecTV and EchoStar Communications' Dish Network offered a demonstrably superior product to cable: hundreds of channels, compared with perhaps 60 on the typical cable system; dozens of digital music channels while cable had none; and digital picture quality rather than cable's sometimes ghostly analog. 
Now, though, most homes have access to digital cable and for most viewers, digital cable is at least the equal of satellite television. Satellite's one big remaining advantage is that DirecTV has the full National Football League package, and cable does not.
On the other hand, cable retransmits just about every local broadcast station in most markets, which satellite still does not. With basic parity achieved, the satellite-cable battle will be fought over new products and service. 
Of course, the number of combatants will be smaller. EchoStar and DirecTV plan to merge, if regulators let them. And mergers in the cable industry are reducing the field to a dwindling number of big players. The annual cable convention used to draw just about every pay-television network and equipment supplier in the world, because the show was a convenient way to meet as many as possible of the nation's dozens of significant cable operators. 
Now, those same networks and vendors can see all the major players in a few trips to the New York area (Time Warner Cable, Cablevision, Mediacom, Insight), the Philadelphia area (AT&T Comcast, Adelphia), Atlanta (Cox) and St. Louis (Charter). 
At its peak in 1998, the cable convention attracted about 32,000 registered visitors. Last year, the number was about 24,000 and this year it was only about 17,500. Even one of the trade show's quasi-official daily publications felt compelled to comment, although with a positive spin, "Obviously, numbers are down, but the floor layout gives the illusion that there's good traffic."

HEADLINE: Patents; 
The Patent Office faces huge backlogs, extremely technical inventions, and absurd ones.

BYLINE:  By Teresa Riordan 

 BODY:
WACKY inventions are a mainstay of American culture: self-tipping hats, refrigerated running shoes, leashes for canaries, to name just a few.
 Even so, five-year-old Steven Olson raised eyebrows last month when he patented a new way to swing on a swing. 
 Steven -- or rather his father, Peter Lowell Olson, who happens to be a registered patent attorney in St. Paul, Minn. -- claimed that his "invention" was to alternately pull on the chains of a swing so that it swings side to side rather than forward and backward. 
Mr. Olson has said he applied for the patent only to teach his son how the inventor's process works. The Olsons, he said, have no plans to patrol playgrounds seeking royalty payments on their U.S. patent 6,368,227.
But the swing patent has once again raised the seemingly perennial fear that something is terribly wrong at the Patent Office. 
These days even James E. Rogan, who became the director of the agency in December, is making ominous predictions. In a February cover letter to the budget outline for 2003, he suggested his agency is so backlogged that unless fundamental changes are made, inventors soon may have to wait more than three years to be issued a patent. Even now investors and patent laywers consider the current average wait, a little more than two years, much too long.
The patent office plans to hire 688 patent examiners this year. About 500 of them have already been brought aboard, bringing the current corps to 3,300. If the Patent Office gets the 20 percent budget increase it has requested from Congress, an additional 1,000 examiners would be hired next year.
Why the big demand for examiners? First, employee churn has been a chronic problem for the agency, whose salaries are often not competitive with the private sector. Moreover, even while the economy ebbed, patent applications continued to rush in.
"The volume of patent applications has gone up substantially, and also the complexity of patents has increased," said James Malackowski, president of the Licensing Executives Society, a professional organization, and a contributor to "From Ideas to Assets," a new book on intellectual property.
But others suggest something else may be afoot aside from personnel shortages. Several law-journal articles in recent years have suggested that the threshold of what is patentable has fallen significantly in the decades since 1952, when Congress changed the definition of what is patentable. Before that, an invention was supposed to exhibit a "flash of genius." Since then, an invention must merely be "nonobvious."
Although statistical evidence is hard to come by, the definition of what is nonobvious may be seriously eroding. Cecil Quillen, a senior adviser with Cornerstone Research, published an article last year in the Federal Circuit Bar Journal showing that more than 90 percent of all patent applications eventually became patents, suggesting that, with a little perseverance, a person can patent just about anything. 
"Historically, the Patent Office has always faced challenges having to do with new technologies," said Josh Lerner, a professor at the Harvard Business School. "But then things equilibrate and reach a steady state. What is new and different is that the pressures on the Patent Office today are much greater than in the past."
Kien T. Nguyen, the examiner in charge of the Steven Olson swing patent, appears to be an experienced examiner who since 1996 has issued hundreds of patents, many of them covering different types of swings. Did Mr. Nguyen, in the case of the Olson patent, merely apply an overly expansive definition of what is patentable? Or was he simply so overworked he let an absurd application slip by?
Brigid Quinn, a Patent Office spokeswoman, said she could not comment on individual patents, but did say that the patent was under review.
According to Ms. Quinn, the agency is undergoing a top-to-bottom review. "It's a new day," she said. "Quality is of utmost importance to the director. At this point, everything is on the table."
Early this month, when he was addressing the Licensing Executives Society at their annual meeting, Mr. Rogan -- who was a Republican Congressman from southern California before becoming director of the Patent Office -- suggested new approaches. The proposals included contracting out some work and possibly creating a two-tier patent system, with some patents undergoing rigorous review and others merely being registered much as trademarks or copyrights are.
Gregory Aharonian, publisher of the Internet Patent News Service, an online newsletter, and a longtime critic of the agency, is less than sanguine about reform. He cites a 1943 report from a National Commission on Patents. "It was asking, 'How good are these patents, does anyone know?' " Mr. Aharonian said. "The same questions are being asked 60 years later. I mean, has this field made any progress?"

HEADLINE: Some See a Young Ovitz in Emerging Power Broker 

BYLINE:  By LAURA M. HOLSON with BERNARD WEINRAUB 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 12 

 BODY:
For some people in Hollywood, there is something eerily familiar about Jeffrey Evan Kwatinetz, co-founder of the Firm, the upstart entertainment management company perhaps best known for representing music acts like Korn and Limp Bizkit.
 To many music industry executives and associates, Mr. Kwatinetz, 37, is reminiscent of a young Michael S. Ovitz, the aggressive agent who helped start the Creative Artists Agency talent firm in 1975 and rose to be one of Hollywood's most feared power brokers in the 1980's. 
 More recently Mr. Ovitz's career has faltered and his current company, the Artists Management Group, is in such upheaval that, seven days ago, Mr. Ovitz, 55, decided he had little choice but to sell most of the company to the up-and-coming Mr. Kwatinetz for an undisclosed sum. 
In a town devoted to archetypal plotlines, there is every temptation to see this story as the deposed king giving way to the ambitious prince. 
"It took a strong personality to build C.A.A., and Michael bumped a lot of heads," said Jay Cooper, an entertainment lawyer in Los Angeles. "Now he's paying the price for it." And, Mr. Cooper warned, "If Jeff does similar things -- and I don't know here if he will or not -- he could struggle with the same issues."
Already Mr. Kwatinetz (pronounced KWAH-tin-ets), a Harvard-trained lawyer who started managing bands while still an undergraduate at Northwestern University, has a reputation for fiercely aggressive business tactics that have won him ardent loyalists and resentful enemies. He is highly secretive and very protective of his public image, offering helpful relationships to reporters who agree not to quote him by name. (Mr. Kwatinetz has been known to utter grandiose comments -- as when he said a few years ago that he hoped his company would one day rival AOL Time Warner -- whose memory now make him cringe.)
As for power brokering, Mr. Kwatinetz, like Mr. Ovitz, has been active on the national political scene. "They are similar, like-minded men," said Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the Missouri Democrat, who has known Mr. Ovitz more than a decade and refers to Mr. Kwatinetz as "a friend." In February Mr. Kwatinetz played host at a Los Angeles fund-raiser that raised $300,000 for Mr. Gephardt and Representative John Conyers of Michigan, both interested in issues involving musicians' rights.
And as Mr. Ovitz in his prime often fielded calls from high-profile magazines like Vanity Fair and Fortune, so did Mr. Kwatinetz's office last week, as journalists along with talent agents, studio executives and even other managers were suddenly asking: Who is this guy?
"I'm just trying to run a company," Mr. Kwatinetz said last Thursday, sighing heavily as he dashed out the door of his Beverly Hills office to go try to avert a blowup on the set of a Limp Bizkit music video, after an art director upset Fred Durst, the band's frontman.
But compared with Mr. Ovitz, who made his mark as a traditional talent agent, then stumbled as he tried to transform himself into a media mogul, Mr. Kwatinetz is operating as an entertainment manager in a field fast evolving beyond conventional definitions.
Mr. Kwatinetz founded the Firm in his Malibu apartment in 1997, along with Michael Green, a talent manager, who was bought out in 2001. Five years ago, consolidation was beginning to sweep every corner of the music industry -- radio, concert promotion and record companies alike -- and becoming more corporate in the process. Management companies should combine too, Mr. Kwatinetz concluded, giving artists more control and managers more power.
Now the Firm has 130 employees and is known largely for its talent management arm, which represents music acts like Linkin Park, the Dixie Chicks and Mary J. Blige (but no longer the Backstreet Boys, whom industry executives say were unhappy with the Firm's representation). The company also has actors as clients, including Martin Lawrence and Vin Diesel. Mr. Kwatinetz says he believes the future lies in managing "brands" -- whether in the form of people, productions or products.
In the past two years he has acquired a disparate array of licensing agreements and product lines, which now account for more than 50 percent of his company's revenues, according to one industry executive. The Firm's revenues, this executive said, are estimated in the low tens of millions of dollars. 
Mr. Kwatinetz's company paid an undisclosed sum for the nearly defunct Pony sneaker brand in 2001 with the idea that the Firm's stable of stars would wear those shoes, generating buzz. Retail sales are expected to reach $45 million for the 18 months ending in August, said David Schulte, Mr. Kwatinetz's friend and former neighbor, who is the executive overseeing the Pony brand.
The Firm owns a 50 percent stake in the marketing rights to Build-A-Bear Workshop, a chain of shopping mall stores where children make their own teddy bears. It also has an agreement to develop animated television and film projects for the children's animated character Arthur. The Firm recently hired an executive to oversee both film and television production.
In agreeing to buy the talent management business from Mr. Ovitz's company, a deal whose financial details are still being worked out, Mr. Kwatinetz is welcoming aboard two friends, Rick Yorn and Julie Silverman-Yorn, Mr. Yorn's sister-in-law, along with a roster of clients that includes Cameron Diaz and Leonardo DiCaprio.
As it expands, the Firm's biggest challenge may be the economic environment. Right now, few entertainment-related companies -- whether mighty AOL Time Warner or Mr. Ovitz's battered firm -- are thriving. 
The billionaire Haim Saban, who made his name with the "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers" children's television and product franchise, has talked to Mr. Kwatinetz as a potential investor. Mr. Saban said he believed that the Firm should focus on representing talent -- that without a distribution arm it would be hard to succeed with film and television projects. Tom Burnett, a Wall Street analyst who has studied the media consolidation wave, says all companies are "vulnerable" right now.
But vulnerability is not a concept that Mr. Kwatinetz acknowledges.
"He's a risk taker, and any time anyone is like that, they make friends and enemies," said James A. Wiatt, co-chief executive of the William Morris Agency.
In many respects Mr. Kwatinetz has created a company with the aura of an exclusive club -- one in which he hand-picks the guests because they are success-driven but can get along with one another. "I wouldn't say it's a clique," said Stephen Bannon, a former investment banker who recently joined the Firm to advise on strategy. "But people who join, have the DNA." 
As many executives at the Firm acknowledge, though, the company is at best a work in progress. "We aren't naive," said David Baram, the Firm's president and himself a lawyer. "I start off every meeting talking about how we execute." 
But execution requires know-how. And critics note that Mr. Schulte, the executive in charge of Pony, is a former licensing executive who has never run a shoe company. (A bona fide shoe executive will be brought on within a year, Mr. Schulte said.) The Firm only recently hired its first chief financial officer. And even on its best days, said one person who deals regularly with talent managers there, "it is organized chaos."
Mr. Kwatinetz has a reputation for being litigious, an image that many executives say stems from a nasty breakup with his former employer, Gallin-Morey Associates. He was hired by the company in 1995, while he was already representing the band Korn. When Mr. Kwatinetz wanted out of his five-year contract two years later, the company's co-founder Sandy Gallin refused.
Mr. Kwatinetz sued and, according to court records, accused Mr. Gallin of asking Mr. Kwatinetz to secure male dates for him. Mr. Gallin denied the charge and in a countersuit accused Mr. Kwatinetz of embezzlement. The lawsuits were settled, and Mr. Kwatinetz left Gallin-Morey. 
Mr. Gallin did not return a reporter's calls about the matter, and Mr. Kwatinetz would not comment on the case. 
It was during his two years at Gallin-Morey that Mr. Kwatinetz "started to understand power," said John Scher, the president of the promoter Metropolitan Entertainment Group and a friend who has known Mr. Kwatinetz for more than a decade. 
Mr. Kwatinetz also became involved in a legal spat in 2000 with Robert Sillerman, founder of Clear Channel Communications' promotional division SFX Entertainment division, who had agreed to buy the Firm for $200 million. Mr. Kwatinetz filed a lawsuit accusing Mr. Sillerman of not following through on various promises. The suit was eventually settled and the deal called off, after Mr. Kwatinetz issued a public apology, calling the lawsuit "a mistake."
It has been Mr. Kwatinetz's negotiations with record executives on behalf of his clients that have perhaps been the most contentious. He has an explosive temper, say executives who have negotiated with him, and will threaten legal action if a record label does not give in to his clients' demands. The trait is apparently part of the Firm's DNA.
Simon Renshaw, a Firm executive who manages the Dixie Chicks, a group embroiled in a contract dispute with the Sony Music Group, put it this way: "I don't think we are litigious. It's America. If it gets to a point we can't do anything else, that's what we do. We all play to win. A lawsuit is a part of that win. If Jeff is guilty of anything it is that he really, really wants to win."
A friend who has worked with Mr. Kwatinetz for years, but who would talk about him only on the condition of anonymity, summed up Mr. Kwatinetz's mission: "It's not about the money, it's about the power. He wants to create a company where everyone has to go to him."

HEADLINE: ARTS ONLINE; 
Museum's Cyberpeeping Artwork Has Its Plug Pulled

BYLINE:  By Matthew Mirapaul; E-mail: mirapaul@nytimes.com

 BODY:
An Internet-based artwork in an exhibition at the New Museum of Contemporary Art was taken offline on Friday because the work was conducting surveillance of outside computers. It is not clear yet who is responsible for the blacking out -- the artists, the museum or its Internet service provider -- but the action illuminates the work's central theme: the tension between public and private control of the Internet. The shutdown also shows how cyberspace's gray areas can enshroud museums as they embrace the evolving medium. 
 The work in question is "Minds of Concern: Breaking News," created by Knowbotic Research, a group of digital artists in Switzerland. The piece is part of "Open Source Art Hack," an exhibition at the New Museum that runs through June 30. The work can be viewed as an installation in the museum's SoHo galleries or online at newmuseum.org. Although the installation is still in place, and the work's Web site remains live, the port-scanning software that is its central feature was disabled Friday evening and was inactive yesterday afternoon. 
 Port scanning sounds like a cruise-ship captain's task. The term actually refers to a technique for surveying how other computers are connected to the Internet. The software essentially strolls through the neighborhood in search of windows that have been left open. Merely noticing where they are is no crime. Things get dicier, though, if what is seen is conveyed to a ne'er-do-well relative, who then breaks in somewhere, rearranges the furniture and makes off with a gem-encrusted putter.
One court has ruled that port scanning is legal so long as it does not intrude upon or damage the computers that are being scanned. Internet service providers, however, generally prohibit the practice, which can cause online traffic jams. That prohibition appears to be what led to the shutdown.
After the Knowbotic work started its peeping, the Internet service provider for one of the targets of the scan complained to the museum's Internet service provider, Logicworks. In turn, Logicworks notified the museum that port scanning violated its policies. On Friday, Lauren Tehan, a museum spokeswoman, said the museum was seeking a creative technical solution to keep the work online.
That effort did not succeed. Ms. Tehan said the museum, at Logicworks' request, shut down the work after the museum closed on Friday evening. On Saturday morning, Christian Hubler of Knowbotic Research said the group realized the port-scanning software had been disabled and decided to move the work's Web site to an Internet service provider in Germany. Ms. Tehan said that the museum suggested a way to put the work back online but that Knowbotic rejected the proposal.
The dispute calls attention to one of the very points the piece is intended to make. Because the lines between public and private control of the Internet are not yet clearly defined, what artists want to do may be perfectly legal, but that does not mean they will be allowed do it.
Before the New Museum exhibition opened on May 3, Knowbotic Research had already decided to remove the most troublesome features of the port-scanning software. Mr. Hubler said the group changed the work after consulting with a lawyer who specializes in Internet law. "I wanted to know the situation I'm in," Mr. Hubler said, "because when I work with the border as an artist, I want to know at least what the border might be."
When it is functioning, "Minds of Concern" resembles a slot machine. Viewers are prompted to scan the computer ports of organizations that protested in February against the World Economic Forum. While colored lights flash, a list of the vulnerable ports and the methods that might be employed to "crack," or penetrate, them to gain access to private information scrolls across the bottom of the screen. No internal information is exposed, but the threat is suggested.
European digital artists are more politicized than their American counterparts, and "Minds" is designed to advance a social agenda. By choosing to explore the computers of antiglobalization groups instead of Nike or Coca-Cola, Knowbotic is warning those groups that they are at risk of losing sensitive data.
But to present the work at the New Museum, Knowbotic had to defang it. At first, the group reviewed the 800 tools in the port-scanning program and removed 200 it deemed intrusive or malicious. After consulting with a lawyer, the group then encrypted the name of the organization being scanned because it was unsure if publishing the information was illegal. In place of the name on the screen, one saw the phrase "artistic self-censorship."
The group's disappointment in having to scale back the work was obvious in a message to an electronic mailing list: "Due to the ubiquitous paranoia and threat of getting sued, the museum and the curators made it very clear to us that we as artists are 100 percent alone and private in any legal dispute."
There is a sense of a missed opportunity here. The dozen works in "Open Source Art Hack" are intended to prompt discussion about the public versus the private in cyberspace while demonstrating how artists "hack," or misuse technology, to creative effect. Port-scanning software, for instance, is meant to be used for reconnaissance, yet Knowbotic has made it a political tool.
But "Minds of Concern" is also the only online work in the exhibition to operate in a legal gray area. In its fully functional state, it had the potential to cause a ruckus that might have yielded some black-and-white rulings. But instead, the exhibition commits no real transgressions.
Steve Dietz, the new-media curator at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, was one of the exhibition's curators. Its goal, he said, "was more nuanced than bringing cracking to the dull havens of a museum."
"Being bad and doing something illegal hold very little interest for me," he said, "but being tactical and creative hold a great deal.'
Artists like to be bad, and although museums are sometimes their targets, they can also serve as shields when artists become controversial. A recent example was the exhibition "Mirroring Evil: Nazi Imagery/Recent Art," for which the Jewish Museum, not the participating artists, took most of the heat.
As museums embrace cyberspace, its fuzzy rules are posing unfamiliar problems, and "Minds of Concern: Breaking News" is a case in point. As for how well those issues can be raised within a museum's walls, Lisa Phillips, director of the New Museum, said: "That really is the dilemma. We can only go so far."

PERSON: Prof. Florence G. Roswell 

HEADLINE: Florence G. Roswell, 97, Expert On Teaching Children to Read 

BYLINE:  By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Prof. Florence G. Roswell, who spent more than half a century teaching and writing, particularly about ways to diagnose and overcome reading disabilities, died May 4 at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 97. 
 A former director of the reading clinic at the City College of New York, she remained active into her 90's, with several of her books and manuals published or reissued within the last few years. 
 She worked with Dr. Jeanne S. Chall, another leading expert on teaching children to read, to devise instructional materials to guide teachers. First published in the 1950's, these materials had a revival in the 1990's and remain in print. Dr. Chall died in 1999.
In 1997, Educators Publishing Company reissued the "Roswell-Chall Auditory Blending Test," and the "Roswell-Chall Diagnostic Reading Test of Word Analysis Skills."
Florence Garfunkel Roswell was born in Manhattan in June 1904. She entered New York University at 16, majoring in English literature; she graduated in 1924.
She taught second grade for several years while taking graduate education courses at Teachers College. When children in her classroom were having trouble learning to read, she asked them to come to school earlier and stay later to help them catch up.
City College offered her a teaching fellowship in 1942, asking her to test children with various reading problems and to supervise student teachers. At the time, conventional wisdom regarding reading disabilities was that a child's difficulties were rooted in emotional problems, and that not much could be done by the teacher until the problems were addressed. 
Based on her experience in testing and teaching poor readers, Professor Roswell took a more positive tack. She concluded that a child's reading deficiencies required special attention regardless of emotional problems. Her views and those of like-minded teachers eventually prevailed. Their stand brought about recognition of distinct disabilities like various kinds of dyslexia.
For teaching reading, she advocated using phonics along with the whole language method, or a system that chiefly exposes students to the sight of words. The dual approach meant that readers could be able to decode sounds and words. 
Her first text, "Reading Disability: A Human Approach," was published in the 1960's and had four printings. Most recently she was a co-author of "Teaching Children to Read, a Step-by-Step Guide for Volunteer Tutors" (Continental Press, 1998); and "Creating Successful Readers" (Riverside, 1994).
Professor Roswell is survived by a son, Dr. Arthur, of Bridgewater, N.J.; a daughter, Elaine Roswell of New Haven; three grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren. Her husband, David S. Roswell, an economist, died in the 1960's.

HEADLINE: Dissent in House G.O.P. Forces Leaders to Change Plan for Medicare Drug Benefit 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 12 

 BODY:
A quiet rebellion by Republican backbenchers has forced House Republican leaders to reconsider and revise their plan to provide drug benefits to the elderly under Medicare.
 The dissent is being voiced by party members who find themselves caught in the middle of a fierce election-year battle among lobbyists for doctors, hospitals, nursing homes, health maintenance organizations, home care agencies and other health care providers fighting over a limited pot of Medicare money. 
 The Republicans complained that the plan would finance drug benefits, in part, by cutting Medicare payments to hospitals and other health care providers. They asked Speaker J. Dennis Hastert why they were being forced to vote against their local hospitals in this election year. 
Many also objected to the plan because it left a big gap in drug coverage. For an individual patient, Medicare would pick up much of the first $2,000 in drug expenses and the full cost above $5,000 a year. But the patient would be entirely responsible for amounts from $2,000 to $5,000.
When Mr. Hastert unveiled the Republican plan on May 1, he predicted confidently that the House would pass it by May 24, when lawmakers leave town for Memorial Day. But House Republican leaders now say they will probably miss that deadline because they are still tinkering with the plan, trying to round up votes and tamp down dissent.
Representative John E. Sweeney, Republican of New York, said the cuts being considered by House Republican leaders would have "awful consequences" for hospitals and other health care providers.
In a letter to Speaker Hastert, Mr. Sweeney and nine other Republican House members from New York said: "New York's health care providers can no longer sustain Medicare payment reductions without cutting back on the level of care they deliver to our communities. We can see no justification for such reductions."
House Republican leaders said they were following advice from the Bush administration, which in March suggested that Congress trim payments to hospitals and use the savings to pay doctors more.
But Representative Charlie Norwood, Republican of Georgia, a longtime advocate of patients' rights, said he was inclined to vote against the plan because it did not do enough on prescription drugs and would hurt hospitals and home health agencies.
"Many hospitals are already providing service at or below cost," Mr. Norwood said. "Cut payments any further, and we'll have a mass exodus of providers from Medicare."
Likewise, Representative John E. Peterson, Republican of Pennsylvania, said the bill would have "a devastating impact on home health agencies" that care for the elderly.
Representative Greg Ganske, Republican of Iowa, said he could not understand why anyone would propose cutting hospital reimbursement. "I am hearing from small-town hospitals all across Iowa that they are getting close to bankruptcy," Mr. Ganske said.
Members of Congress say doctors appear to have the strongest case for an increase in Medicare payments. Medicare cut payments to doctors by 5.4 percent this year, and the government foresees further reductions in each of the next three years, for a total decrease of 17 percent from 2002 to 2005.
The American Medical Association leads a coalition of lobbyists trying to overturn these cuts. The coalition consists of the American College of Surgeons, the American Academy of Family Physicians and more than 40 other medical groups.
The nation's 5,000 hospitals are also a potent lobbying force. Every Congressional district has at least one hospital. More than 260 of the 435 House members are co-sponsors of legislation to increase Medicare payments to hospitals.
Speaking for the elderly, John C. Rother, policy director of AARP, said: "Health care providers are entitled to reasonable reimbursement. But every additional dollar spent on health care providers is one dollar less for Medicare drug benefits."
President Bush touched off the current struggle in February, when he declared that any increase in Medicare payments to some health care providers must be offset by cuts for others.
Kenneth C. Robbins, president of the Illinois Hospital Association, said: "It's an unfortunate ploy to pit one group of health care providers against another. Doctors deserve higher Medicare payments. But to try to satisfy that legitimate need by reducing payments to hospitals is extremely unfair."
The pressures on members of Congress are illustrated in Connecticut, where two incumbents are running against each other in one of the nation's hottest Congressional races. The Republican candidate, Representative Nancy L. Johnson, is chairwoman of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health and a member of the team writing the Republican Medicare bill.
The Democrat running against Mrs. Johnson, Representative Jim Maloney, said: "The Republicans are cutting back hospital and nursing home reimbursement so they can move money into a prescription drug program. They're robbing Peter to pay Paul."
Mr. Maloney contends that Republicans created this predicament for themselves by voting for tax cuts that reduced the federal budget surplus.
Representative Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland, said that he, like most lawmakers, had been deluged with pleas from health care providers seeking higher Medicare payments. Invariably, he said, he tells them they should have been involved last year, when Congress was debating the tax cuts.
Mrs. Johnson said she well understood the financial problems of hospitals and would try to address them. In March, she introduced a bill to increase payments to doctors.
Under current law, hospitals would receive a full update for inflation, about 3 percent a year, each year from 2004 to 2007. The House Republican plan would reduce the update by one-half of a percentage point each year, saving $5 billion over five years.
Laurence A. Tanner, president of New Britain General Hospital, in Mrs. Johnson's hometown, said his costs -- for nurses' wages, prescription drugs and liability insurance -- were rising far more than 3 percent a year. "I have no expenses rising less than 3 percent a year," Mr. Tanner said.
Richard J. Pollack, executive vice president of the American Hospital Association, said: "The administration's proposal to cut hospitals is terribly shortsighted and misguided. One out of three hospitals is in the red today. One in two loses money caring for Medicare patients."
But Thomas A. Scully, administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said that Medicare payments to hospitals were adequate, and that hospital costs were growing more slowly than expected this year.

HEADLINE: The Bermuda Tax Triangle 

 BODY:
Stanley Works ought to change its name to Stanley Flees. The maker of distinctive black-and-yellow tools that for 159 years has made its home in New Britain, Conn., is planning to reincorporate in Bermuda in order to stiff Uncle Sam. Stanley is only the latest in an alarming exodus of greedy companies, but the prospect of the venerable firm taking off for a tax haven caused one local congressman to note that Benedict Arnold, too, left Connecticut and sailed off to Bermuda. 
 Though perfectly legal, Stanley's move would be an accounting gimmick, aimed solely at cutting its tax bill. A mail drop is about all a company needs to claim residence in Bermuda, which has no corporate income tax. After Stanley announced that it had obtained shareholder approval last week, its move was delayed because of alleged irregularities in the balloting process. It now says it will hold another vote. At issue was whether employees were misled into believing that unvoted shares held in retirement accounts would be counted against the Bermuda plan. If Stanley does go forward with the move, under Bermuda law its management will be less accountable to pesky shareholders. 
 Like a number of insurance firms and other industrial companies that have gone before it, Stanley says its move would be a way to remain competitive in a global economy. The United States, unlike many countries, taxes its companies' overseas profits. By setting itself up as an offshore entity, Stanley would shield from the Internal Revenue Service its profits made elsewhere, for an estimated annual savings of $30 million. Whether the tax code's treatment of overseas earnings should be revised to level the playing field between American companies and foreign competitors is worth debating. But in our democracy, fleeing to Bermuda is not a constructive way of participating in the national dialogue.
More insidiously, Stanley would also be in a position to avoid paying taxes on profits made within the United States. This becomes possible under a popular tax-avoidance scheme being peddled by major accounting and law firms that involves, in addition to reincorporating in Bermuda, establishing corporate residence in a second sunny offshore jurisdiction, Barbados. Under the terms of a favorable tax treaty, corporate profits earned in the United States can be shipped there and essentially laundered into deductible expenses. 
Congress must look at ways of closing these loopholes. Even in the best of times, it is outrageous for companies to engage in offshore shenanigans to avoid paying their fair share of taxes. Doing so after the Enron scandal, in dire fiscal times and when the nation is at war is unconscionable. What was John Trani, Stanley's chief executive, thinking?
Senators Max Baucus and Charles Grassley, the top Democrat and Republican on the Finance Committee, have proposed a bill to stop recognizing tax-driven moves so that if a company seeks to move its domicile offshore for tax purposes, the I.R.S. would still tax it as American-based. Congress should hasten to pass this legislation. 
In recounting its history, Stanley's Web site recounts how as a young man in 1843 Frederick T. Stanley founded the company, with a vision to create a "hardware company with unsurpassed customer service, product innovation and integrity." The vision probably never included a flight to an offshore tax haven.

HEADLINE: Cinematography and Chilling Out? That's Scouting 

BYLINE:  By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN 

 BODY:
Krystal Weber, 12, a Junior Girl Scout in Fremont, Calif., can reel off the moments in her day when she feels stressed: during Chinese class, during physical education, at lunch and most notably on her way home, when she has to hoist her rolling backpack up the bus steps while being jostled by tired and hungry schoolmates.
 But, like the model Girl Scout she is, she knows just what to do. "I think about something soothing and peaceful, usually a cloud," Krystal said. "Then I do my elevator breathing, inhaling slowly through my nose and exhaling slowly through my mouth. I do that 10 times. It slows you down." 
 With about 68,000 other Girl Scouts around the country, Krystal is the proud recipient of the Stress Less badge, introduced last fall and embroidered with a swinging hammock, part of a new wave of badges reflecting contemporary American life.
Like tie widths and lapel sizes, badges reflect the culture, and the Girl Scouts have diligently kept up with changing times, using online surveys and their own research institute. Where the earliest scouts strove for badges like Child Nurse, Invalid Cooking, Dairy Maid and Matron Housekeeper, scouts today can earn the new Ms. President patch, designed to encourage political participation, and the United We Stand Junior Girl Scout badge, a new patriotic badge -- one of several -- for which girls learn how to display the flag appropriately and say the Pledge of Allegiance in sign language.
The Boy Scouts of America, which has no connection to the Girl Scouts, has its share of fashionable new badges, like cinematography and white-water canoeing, and recently approved a fly-fishing badge. It will require scouts to accurately cast a fly using overhead and roll-cast techniques. In true scout tradition, young anglers must also recite the dangers of this contemplative sport, like puncture wounds, insect bites and hypothermia, and what to do about them.
Fly-Fishing is consistent with the woodsy legacy of earlier badges like Beekeeping, Indian Lore and Stalking. The Boy Scouts offer 119 merit badges and review suggestions every five years, adding and retiring badges as needed. Among the badges put out to pasture are some touchstones of America's agrarian past, including Farm Records and Bookkeeping, Hog and Pork Production and Grasses, Legumes and Forage Crops.
Many badges still hark back to the values of Lord Robert Baden-Powell, a hero of the Boer War who founded the scouting movement to increase boys' physical and mental stamina. This is why the Boy Scouts will probably never offer a Stress Less badge. "In the scout geography of masculinity, manhood needs proving," said Jay Mechling, a professor of American studies at the University of California at Davis and the author of "On My Honor: Boy Scouts and the Making of American Youth" (University of Chicago Press, 2001). "Stress makes men strong."
Among Girl Scouts, however, especially in high-stress places like Silicon Valley, scouts and their parents have embraced Stress Less.
"World events today are closer to home," said Lauri Howard, 40, co-leader of Troop 459 in Santa Clara and Sunnyvale, whose sixth-grade daughter, Jennifer Brown, earned the badge. 
The aftermath of the terrorist attacks was compounded in Silicon Valley by pervasive job insecurity.
"Some of the girls would come into the meeting and say, 'My dad's company is doing layoffs again,' " said Bev Gray, 42, a troop leader. "It became apparent that this was the perfect badge."
Known for progressive politics that included early support for the United Nations and the Equal Rights Amendment, the Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. was founded in Savannah, Ga., in 1912 by Juliette Gordon Low, who wanted to bring girls out of the home to serve their communities and experience the open air.
Some of the original Girl Scout badges -- Electrician and Flyer, for example -- were ahead of their time. The Civics Badge of 1916 required reading John Stuart Mill's "On the Subjection of Women" and "The Women Voters Manual" "four years before women had the right to vote," said Mary Logan Rothschild, a professor of women's studies and history at Arizona State University and the author of a forthcoming book on the Girl Scouts. 
Two years ago, the organization started the Girl Scout Research Institute, to do studies on "healthy development of girls," said Dr. Harriet S. Mosatche, a psychologist and the director of program development, which oversees badges. The Stress Less badge, she said, came out of a growing body of scientific literature on "how stressed girls are today."
The United We Stand badge evolved from a survey of 1,500 girls, including nonscouts, before and after Sept. 11. Coming soon, Dr. Mosatch said, may be a driving badge as well as a public speaking badge. Speaking in public is "the No. 1 fear among girls," she said.
Troop 459 in Sunnyvale, meanwhile, is organizing a stress clinic for third-grade Brownies. It will include the troop's favorite aromatherapy massage lotion recipe (Take 3 ounces of Velvacol cream; add 4 ounces of artificial glycerin rose water and a teaspoon of vitamin E oil. Whisk until smooth.)
A recent attempt to make anti-anxiety squeeze balls out of balloons and Play-Doh was not entirely successful. "The Play-Doh was too oily and disintegrated the balloon," said Lindsay Gray, a troop member. "It was very stressful."

HEADLINE: Contributors in Newark Race Are Drawn From Near and Far 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD LEZIN JONES 

DATELINE: NEWARK, May 12 

 BODY:
They are simple, staccato entries on pages filled with dollar signs and zeroes: Hector A. Rodriguez, police officer, $450; Janice M. Hoffman, homemaker, $425; Philip D. Jackson, head coach -- Los Angeles Lakers, $2,200.
 They are the names of civil servants, housewives, the celebrated, the anonymous -- a hodgepodge of contributors that is fast helping Newark's contentious mayor's race become the most expensive this city has ever seen. 
 Of all the noteworthy aspects of the contest between Mayor Sharpe James and Councilman Cory A. Booker, which culminates in Tuesday's nonpartisan election, the most striking may be the combined $5 million that the candidates have raised as they seek to lead New Jersey's largest city.
A review of the most recently released campaign finance reports from both candidates, filed on May 3, sketches a race in which each candidate has successfully won support from predictable quarters and also drawn campaign money from contributors outside the city who in the past may have had no discernible interest in Newark politics. 
The bulk of that outside support has gone to Mr. Booker, who aides say has so far raised $2.8 million. That is a slight edge over Mr. James, who, according to campaign documents, has gotten $2.3 million. The third candidate, Dwayne Smith, who has received only scant contributions, has not filed any reports.
Analysts say they think that when the final figures are submitted after the election, the combined total of contributions is likely to rank as the highest ever in Newark politics and may rival the spending in some high-profile Congressional races.
"It's astonishing," said Richard McGrath, a spokesman for the James campaign, referring to the tally of each camp.
The contributions' sources reflect the divergent constituencies that Mr. Booker and Mr. James are courting.
Mr. James, a fixture in local politics for more than three decades, has portrayed himself as a public servant who stood shoulder to shoulder with Newark residents through the city's lean years and wants to see the city's revitalization completed.
Mr. James, facing the most serious political challenge since he took office in 1986, courted constituencies that he might not have wooed in past campaigns -- winning, for the first time, endorsements from the city's police and fire unions along with support from other civil service and labor groups. 
Nearly two-thirds of the contributors on Mr. James's most recent campaign reports listed the City of Newark as their employer. About a third of the mayor's total contributions for the campaign came from city employees.
Mr. Booker, the maverick councilman who has billed his campaign as an effort to infuse new leadership and new ideals into Newark politics, has embraced an eclectic coalition of supporters. As someone who unabashedly concedes that he exists outside the city's traditional -- and James-led -- political establishment, Mr. Booker has drawn on his Ivy League connections for support.
The most recent financial filings by his campaign showed that about 9 of 10 of the most recent contributors lived outside Newark and more than 4 of 10 did not live in New Jersey. About a quarter of all of Mr. Booker's contributions have come from financial companies and Wall Street firms.
Mr. James's supporters pointed to the donations to Mr. Booker from beyond New Jersey to bolster their contention that he is beholden to outside business interests. Those outside interests, the mayor's supporters say, will try to exploit Newark if Mr. Booker is elected.
Mr. Booker's supporters view Mr. James's extensive support by city workers as little more than effective arm-twisting by the head of the Newark's vast political machine.
But analysts and political scientists say the differences in the two candidate's monetary support may also represent smart fund-raising.
Mr. James sought to consolidate a homegrown constituency and drew on a wellspring of friends and favors built up over 30 years. Mr. Booker, a political outsider, understandably went to other outsiders for support.
To be sure, scholars said, the cost of advertising has dictated much of the candidates' spending.
Mr. Rebovich, the political scientist, said that Mr. James -- who calls himself "The Real Deal" on billboards and in cable-television commercials -- has had to rethink his campaign-advertising strategy against the media-savvy Mr. Booker.
"Cory Booker has gotten so much favorable media and celebrity endorsement and I think Sharpe James has tried to compete there with paid ads," Mr. Rebovich said.

HEADLINE: Bazaar Brings A Bit of Israel To a Synagogue 

 BODY:
At first glance, it looked like any other church or synagogue bazaar: tables with jewelry, T-shirts, posters and religious objects, and hundreds of people buying all sorts of things they needed (and didn't). 
 But the basket of metal bolts on a table by the door at Congregation Kehilath Jeshurun, on East 85th Street in Manhattan, made clear that this sale was somehow different. 
 The bolts came from one of the suicide bombs that have rocked a store, Jewels of Jerusalem, on Ben Yehuda Street in Jerusalem, in recent months. The owners, Yuval Boteach and his brother, Joey, said they could not remember the exact date (Joey Boteach said their store had been damaged in four bombings), but both were grateful that no one at their store was killed. "Baruch ha-shem," or "Praised be God," both added quickly. 
Yesterday's bazaar featured 13 merchants and artists from Jerusalem, along with American importers of Israeli products. The Israelis have been hit hard in recent months by a downturn in tourism. Several shops represented are on Ben Yehuda Street, a main shopping area and a frequent target of suicide bombers. 
The idea for the bazaar came from Kehilath Jeshurun's sisterhood, which enlisted the help of nine other Manhattan congregations.
Money was raised to fly the merchants and their wares to New York. Hotels donated rooms, and members of Kehilath Jeshurun played host to the merchants. Money from sales went to the merchants and artists. 
In all, 115 volunteers helped the overwhelmed merchants, who clearly had not seen days this busy for quite a while. The owner of Shkalin, who sells what he called "trendy religious clothing," said his business had been off more than 50 percent. 
A volunteer, Leslie Penn, sold prints by Motke Blum, an artist. Mr. Blum was back in Jerusalem, where he has a studio at the foot of David's Citadel, outside Jaffa Gate. "Blum was my arts and crafts counselor at Camp Cejwin in Port Jervis in the summer of 1968, and we've stayed in touch," Mr. Penn said.
By noon, three hours after the opening, Bernie Cohen had sold all his Sea of Life health and beauty products made with ingredients from the Dead Sea.
David Kessler, 27, a portfolio manager, bought a poster from the table of the Israeli Poster Center, on King George Street in Jerusalem. "I came," he said, "to help out the economy."

Party Vote Defies Sharon, And Slows Peace Efforts
The Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, suffered an embarrassing defeat within his own Likud Party that will make new diplomacy in the Middle East more difficult, even as he put off a planned offensive into the Gaza Strip. After a bitter debate the central committee of his party defied him, going on record in support of a resolution against ever agreeing to an independent Palestinian state, a move that is bound to anger the Arab world. Mr. Sharon chose not to begin a dangerous offensive in the tightly packed refugee camps of Gaza, but defense officials said the army still intends to go into Gaza. A1

Doubts About Bombing
The chief of the Palestinian Authority's intelligence service, Amin al-Hendi, said that a suicide bombing last week in Israel did not appear to be the work of Palestinian terrorists but rather seemed to have been conducted by Israeli criminals against an illegal gambling club. Israel said that the talk was irresponsible and without foundation and reasserted its position that Hamas, the radical Islamic group, was responsible for the bombing. A9

Status of Militants Weighed
European officials say they must sort out the legal status of 13 Palestinian militants now in Cyprus before the men can be flown to their various host countries. The Palestinians, all of whom are considered "senior terrorists" by Israel, arrived in Cyprus on Friday under an agreement that ended the standoff at the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem. A8

Songs Instead of a Siege
Sunday services were celebrated at the freshly scrubbed basilica of the Church of the Nativity for the first time since the end of a 39-day siege. The basilica looked completely restored to its former state. A8

Support for Israel
American sympathy for Israel has been on the rise, a trend that has been on display in Congress and recent opinion polls. A8

Carter Arrives in Cuba
Former President Jimmy Carter began a five-day visit to Cuba with a promise from President Fidel Castro that he could inspect any of the island's biotechnology research facilities. The offer seeks to blunt accusations by the State Department that Cuba had developed a limited capacity to make biological weapons and that it had shared biotechnology with rogue nations. A3

Hope for Russia Arms Pact
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov of Russia, appearing in an unusual joint interview via a satellite hookup, both expressed optimism that their nations would sign a new arms control agreement by the time their leaders hold a meeting in Russia this month. But both men stopped short of saying that such an accord would be signed. A6

Some Republicans Want Medicare Plan Rewritten
Some Republicans in the House have forced their leaders to revise a plan to provide drug benefits to the elderly under Medicare. Speaker J. Dennis Hastert said earlier this month that he was confident the plan would pass. But the dissenters said it would cut payments to health care providers, making it harder for Republicans to win their races in the fall. A13

Rule Has Hold on Haitians
About 300 Haitians seeking political asylum in the United States have been held in detention centers for more than five months under a Bush administration policy that does not apply to refugees of any other nationality. A10

Bomb-Sniffing Bees
Trained bees picked out a truck tainted with traces of explosives last summer in two tests before the Sept. 11 attacks. Federal officials and scientists working on the project insist that the idea shows great potential in fighting terrorism. A problem, Pentagon officials say, is the "giggle factor." A10

Rove's Long Reach
The influence of Karl Rove, President Bush's top political adviser, might be increasingly spreading into foreign policy matters. That is not unusual for a president's top adviser. However, the depth of Mr. Rove's involvement, administration officials say, is rubbing some the wrong way, including Secretary of State Colin L. Powell. A1

A $20 Million Solution
American Electric Power, accused by the Environmental Protection Agency of violating the Clean Air Act in Cheshire, Ohio, is solving at least some of its problems by buying the town for $20 million.

Force Behind Charlotte Franchise Sees Kidd Push It to the Edge

DATELINE: CHARLOTTE, N.C. 

 BODY:
IT is not just the team he helped bring here, to a now-outdated arena on the outskirts of the city, that Harvey Gantt said he would miss. There would be an indisputable sadness in the loss of the event, the hot playoff afternoon, even the mixed-bag pleasure of watching the best player take over the game and leave with the prize.
 "He's a great, great player, no question about it," Gantt said admiringly from his aisle seat in Section 110 as Jason Kidd paraded to the free throw line in the last two minutes at Charlotte Coliseum, repeatedly raised his fingers to his mouth and put the Nets and the National Basketball Association in ready position to kiss this Bible Belt city goodbye. 
 The Nets were on their way home to New Jersey for Game 5 on Wednesday night with a 3-1 lead in the Eastern Conference semifinal series, following their leader, their battered but unbowed point guard. Kidd played yesterday the way he looked, like a brawler, but he emerged from an inelegant performance with the big rebounds, the clutch plays, the blue-collar road victory the Nets came for. 
He sent 13,864 jilted fans, including one former mayor, into the parking lot fearing that the next home game for a team this city supported rabidly for most of its 14 seasons would be played in New Orleans.
"We'll miss this, my family and I," said Gantt, sitting a handful of rows up from the court with his wife, Cindy, as the Nets' 89-79 victory played out. "I've brought my children here, my grandchildren."
Gantt was mayor of Charlotte from 1983 through 1987, when George Shinn, the now-despised co-owner, first sought the expansion franchise that made its debut in 1988. Gantt floated the bond issue to build the Coliseum a few years before it would be called obsolete by Shinn because it was constructed just before the proliferation of the almighty luxury box. Gantt purchased his season tickets from Day 1 and held them through two narrowly unsuccessful bids to unseat Jesse Helms in the United States Senate, and back into the private sector, in a local architectural firm.
"I remember the first night, sitting right here with David Stern," Gantt said, nodding across the aisle. "We lost by 40 and gave the team a standing ovation. Stern knew he was in a great market."
It was a franchise that led the league in attendance for eight straight years, but Stern's owners voted Friday to let the Hornets move to New Orleans, soon to leave Gantt and his former constituency nothing but memories. 
He talked about the team's first playoff success, when Alonzo Mourning hit a jumper over Boston's Kevin McHale in May 1993 and the Hornets eliminated the world-famous Celtics. They got to play host to North Carolina's own Michael Jordan in the playoffs and Patrick Ewing's Knicks, and rare was the occasion that Gantt missed an opportunity to watch those worth the inflated price of the ticket.
"To see the great players at this level, how athletic and gifted they are, has been a privilege," he said.
Gantt had to admit after yesterday's fourth quarter that Kidd ranked high in the pantheon of visiting superstars. Maybe Kidd didn't finish off the Hornets; he did continue his own amazing maiden ride through the East with a gritty effort that was as colorful as the area around his right eye after it slammed into David Wesley's head in Game 3 last Thursday night.
"It's just an eye," Wesley groused when asked about the plays Kidd made, some that showed up in the box score and others that did not. "Oh my God, he got stitches. What did you expect him to do -- limp?"
No, but it was still extraordinary to watch the player whose participation was a game-time decision and whose eye remained narrowed under at least 15 stitches rise above all others. "Jason Kidd took over," the Hornets' candid coach, Paul Silas, said. Kidd didn't win the game by himself, but the Nets ran their late-game offense through him on the post and he had his fingerprints on nearly every play that went their way, including the 3-pointer that set them off on a decisive 12-3 run from a 68-67 lead.
It was an effort that was simply Jordanesque, and, incidentally, did we mention what Jordan's response was when Gantt, a Democrat and an African-American, asked for his endorsement during one race against Helms? "Republicans wear shoes, too," the ever-attentive sneaker pitchman said.
Business is business, Gantt the politician understood, still promoting the intangible communal good from footing the professional sports bill. "I understand the debate about public financing and economic development," he said. "But this has been a place where you could come out and see your neighbor, be part of a community happening. If we ever build a new arena, I'll tell you one thing: you won't find me in a luxury box."
Gantt would gladly offer his architectural skills to the planning for a new building downtown. He believes the N.B.A. will be back with another team, and he was not abandoning hope that the Hornets would return Friday for Game 6. Die-hard fans root against all odds. The people who came out yesterday were as loud as 20,000 strong, but it wasn't enough. Men in suits had given their team to New Orleans. Jason Kidd suited up and the Hornets may never play Charlotte again.

BYLINE:  By ALLISON FASS 

 BODY:
The Hispanic population in the United States has grown 58 percent in the last decade, to 35.3 million people, or 12.5 percent of the total United States population, according to the Census Bureau. No wonder marketers are increasingly interested in the media habits of Hispanic television viewers and Internet users. 
 The number of Hispanic households with televisions increased 32 percent, to 10.2 million from 7.7 million from January 1998 to January 2002, according to a study by the VNU group of research companies, which include Nielsen Media Research and Nielsen/NetRatings. 
 The show most watched by Hispanics, in either English or Spanish, is Amigas y Rivaleson Univision on Tuesday nights, the study found. 
 Hispanic users of the Internet at home increased 136 percent, to 6.7 million in March 2002 from 2.9 million in March 1999, the first month that the company recorded such data. (The Internet survey was based on respondents recruited in English only.) ALLISON FASS

HEADLINE: Prada Plans Stock Sale To Pay Off LargeDebt 

BYLINE:  By SUZANNE KAPNER 

DATELINE: LONDON, May 12 

 BODY:
After two false starts, Prada is expected to say this week that it will proceed with a plan to sell 30 percent of itself to the public in an initial stock offering, people close to the company said today.
 Patrizio Bertelli, Prada's chief executive, is expected to provide more details of the plan on Thursday, during a news conference in Milan. The stock sale, which is scheduled for midsummer and could value the company at roughly $4 billion, would be one of the largest initial public offerings this year, and would serve as a barometer for other companies seeking to tap the public markets. The sale is expected to raise about $1.2 billion. 
 The proceeds will be used to pay down about $1.1 billion in debt amassed over the course of a buying spree in which Prada, the Milan-based fashion house, acquired controlling stakes in a wide range of companies. They include Jil Sander, Helmut Lang, Church's shoes, Azzedine Alaia, Carshoe and the Genny Group, along with a sizable hunk of Fendi, which it later sold to LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton.
Despite an economic slowdown and the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, events that caused Prada to cancel plans to go public on two previous occasions, the company continued to open lavish stores. Its latest in SoHo, designed by the architect Rem Koolhaas, cost an estimated $40 million. Prada now owns 150 boutiques in Manhattan, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Paris, Milan and Tokyo.
When the stock offering was indefinitely postponed for a second time, Prada found itself strapped for cash. By the end of November, it sold a 25.5 percent stake in Fendi to LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton for $260 million. And in December, Deutsche Bank underwrote a $624.1 million bond sale that can be converted into Prada shares if the company goes public within three years.
Deutsche Bank and BNP Paribas are jointly underwriting Prada's stock sale.
The designer Miuccia Prada and her husband, Mr. Bertelli, who control Prada, transformed a family luggage business, founded by Ms. Prada's grandfather Mario in 1913, into a world class brand by selling must-have shoes and handbags like the $800 bowling ball bag that was a fashion essential in 2000.
Aside from overextending itself financially, Prada's expansion has been besieged by other problems, notably Mr. Bertelli's management style. For instance, he clashed with Ms. Sander, who shocked the fashion world when she defected in January 2000 from the label that bears her name.
Luxury goods companies in general have struggled since Sept. 11, when many consumers held off making large or extravagant purchases. Mr. Bertelli indicated earlier this year that demand was starting to pick up, noting that Prada's sales had risen by double-digits in the United States and Japan. He is expected to provide more details about the company's performance this week.

HEADLINE: Calling Arabs' Bluff 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SAFIRE; E-mail: safire@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
After American diplomatic persuasion, Israel has (1) withdrawn its forces sent into the West Bank to hunt down the terrorists the Palestinian "Authority" not only condoned but supplied and incited; (2) freed Yasir Arafat, whose first response was to call Israelis "Nazis"; (3) freed the armed terrorists who broke into a Christian church to escape capture in Bethlehem; and (4) held back from retaliating for the bloody suicide attack timed to disrupt the Bush-Sharon meeting in Washington. 
 If terrorists see this pattern of restraint as a sign of weakness and take it as an invitation to wear down the Israeli will, Israel will be forced to respond mightily. Prepared to strike into Hamas headquarters and suicide-bomb factories in Gaza, Israel waits to see if President Bush can get the Saudis and Egyptians to deliver on their side of the "pressure bargain." 
 That places the war-ending ball squarely in the royal court. Arab rulers in Riyadh, Amman and Cairo, pledged to exert pressure on Palestinians to defeat Hamas and related terror centers, now face their moment of truth. 
Arafat's phony arrests, revolving-door jails and pious condemnations no longer fool anybody. Only an internal crackdown will end the killing and impose order. If Arabs cannot prevail on a Palestinian leadership to deliver this, talk of peace and statehood is a waste of lives. 
In an interview with three U.S. columnists just before hurrying home last week, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon was curiously confident that what he called the moderate Arab states would carry out their promises to Bush to lean on Arafat to share power. 
"To reach a peace agreement," he told us, "comprehensive reform of the Palestinian Authority is a precondition. We know that key members inside that authority are calling for change. They will cooperate with an approach by moderate Arab leaders to bring Arafat to the status of 'symbolic leader' whose hold on the levers of power will gradually diminish."
Why would Arafat agree to that? "Only if he is pressured by the U.S., the European Union, Russia and Arab countries. We are in contact with Jordanians and Egyptians, in concept not in details." Not the Saudis? "The problem with the Saudis is that they come with a vision of peace between the Arab world and Israel, but documents we have captured show how their interior minister is supporting Hamas terror even after Sept. 11. They must stop it." 
What would convince him that Palestinian reform was real? "Pressure must be applied to reorganize not just the security bodies but the economic system," Sharon replied. "All financial means should not be in the hands of one man. Institute legal and law enforcement systems with a prime minister ostensibly subordinate to Arafat but the sole point of contact with foreign aid and security officials." 
Jim Hoagland of The Washington Post wanted to know if negotiation with Palestinians at a regional meeting could take place first. "Implement reform immediately. Arafat should be told, 'Look, we won't provide you with financial means unless you agree to these reforms.' Now is the time for the coalition of war -- Iran, Iraq and Syria -- to be countered with a coalition of peace -- Israel, Egypt, Jordan, the Saudis after they stop supplying terrorist organizations, one or two of the emirates, maybe Morocco and peace-minded Palestinians. Bush and I agreed that reform of the Palestinian Authority was the most important thing." 
Sharon really wants the Arabs to come up with a Palestinian leadership he can do business with. Back in Israel, his Likud compatriots have voted against acceptance of a Palestinian state. They point out that a "demilitarized state" is a fiction, as shown by Germany after Versailles, and that a Palestine capable of making treaties with Iran and Iraq, and of importing arms as on the terror ship Karine A, and of blocking Israeli planes from tight turnarounds in its air space, would be one dangerous state. 
That positions Sharon as a centrist. He will stick to his plan: cessation of terror, interim agreements, compromises on land, steady establishment of trust. The former general is confident he can handle both his soft-left and hard-right flanks. Now he is putting it up to Arabs to come up with a real partner for peace.

HEADLINE: Slip, Fall, Collect 

 BODY:
As the city struggles to close a $5 billion budget gap without cutting into essential services, one area of spending makes a particularly tempting target: the half-billion dollars the city paid out last year to people who sued it. Mayor Michael Bloomberg is campaigning, both in the City Council and in Albany, for changes in the law that would make the city less vulnerable to costly damage awards. He is hardly the first mayor to wage this fight, but he is right to try, and the City Council, the State Legislature and the governor should support his efforts. 
 Damage awards against the city have skyrocketed in recent years. In 1978, the cost of lawsuits was $21.4 million. By last year, it had soared to $557 million, an amount that the mayor likes to point out is larger than the budget of most of the city's agencies. The city does not seem to have become significantly more careless in that time. The driving force appears, instead, to be a legal climate in which the city is seen as an easy mark and a deep pocket. 
 In 1979, in an attempt to clamp down on litigation excesses, the "pothole law" was passed, which made the city liable in slip-and-fall cases only if it had prior notice of the specific defect in the sidewalk. But New York's plaintiff's bar responded by hiring a mapping company to scour the sidewalks annually, and formally putting the city on notice about every bump and crack that was found.
Mayor Bloomberg is making several reasonable proposals to the City Council. He wants to make private property owners, rather than the city, liable for most accidents that occur on city sidewalks. That makes sense, since the owners are already responsible for maintaining the sidewalks in front of their property. The mayor is also proposing to put some teeth back in the pothole law, by toughening the rules for notifying the city about sidewalk defects.
Other reforms, which could save the city considerably more money, will require approval from Albany. One proposal is to rewrite existing liability rules that force the city to pay the whole damage award in cases where it is only partly at fault. In one case the city likes to cite, a taxi caused an accident while crossing the 86th Street transverse in Central Park. Although the taxi was held to be 95 percent liable, the city was stuck paying the entire $3 million economic-damages award. The city is also seeking, quite reasonably, to prevent plaintiffs from double dipping by collecting tax-free city pensions and damages for lost earnings at the same time. The trial lawyers' lobby is strong in Albany, but the mayor should not let that deter him from pushing for changes in the law.
Civil lawsuits are an important part of America's justice system, and every year we hear of cases in which innocent people are cruelly harmed by the city's incompetence or neglect and deserve top-dollar compensation. But when plaintiffs and plaintiffs' lawyers win huge damage awards against a city that was only minimally involved in creating the conditions that caused an accident, they make everyone else the losers.

HEADLINE: MIDEAST TURMOIL: THE OVERVIEW; 
REBUFFING SHARON, PARTY REPUDIATES PALESTINIAN STATE

BYLINE:  By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, May 12 

 BODY:
The Likud Party voted tonight in favor of a resolution never to allow the creation of a Palestinian state, defying its leader, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, as he put off a planned offensive into the Gaza Strip. 
 The vote does not change the policy of the current coalition government, but will make it harder for Washington to build on the current military lull and to begin serious political negotiations toward a Middle East settlement. 
 Mr. Sharon himself has said that a Palestinian state is inevitable, although in a strong speech to the party meeting tonight in Tel Aviv, he demanded an end to Palestinian terrorism and the enactment of political reform before there is any talk of establishing a state.
The vote is bound to anger the Arab world by suggesting that Palestinians should not expect a state to emerge from negotiations with Israel, and thereby giving an advantage to those groups, like the radical Palestinian movement Hamas, which argue for continued armed struggle. 
Responding to the vote, a Palestinian spokesman, Saeb Erekat, said it "unmasked many things." The vote, he told The Associated Press, "just shows that the war being waged by Israel against the Palestinians is not a war against what they call terror, it's really their war to maintain the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza." 
He said the vote was "a real slap in the face" for President Bush, who has spoken in favor of a Palestinian state.
The new pressures on Mr. Sharon come at a time of a fragile diplomatic opening. Egyptian, Saudi Arabian and Syrian leaders met this weekend and said they reaffirmed their commitment to a peace initiative, and the director of central intelligence, George J. Tenet, is expected to come to the region next week to begin security talks.
The Gaza operation has not been scrapped, a senior Israeli military official said, but the army began sending home some of the reservists it had called up.
Mr. Sharon and the defense minister, Benjamin Ben-Eliezer, decided that the element of surprise had been lost, that Palestinian militants of Hamas and Islamic Jihad had gone into hiding and that there was a chance that an operation in Gaza would be fierce but not achieve its goals. 
After some diplomatic pressure from both Washington and the Arab world, Mr. Sharon also sought to get credit by choosing not to launch a dangerous offensive in the tightly packed refugee camps of Gaza.
Israeli military officials said the army still intended to go into Gaza, although in a more limited and targeted way, depending on intelligence.
"The troops are still there," the senior military official said, "and we will have to go into Gaza sooner or later. Gaza is the capital of Hamas and a huge haven for terrorists that has been untouched by us." 
The Likud Party vote tonight was orchestrated by Mr. Sharon's rival, the former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who wants to lead the party into elections. Mr. Netanyahu had bet on the Sharon government lasting only a few months, and he remains popular within Likud, taking a stance even further to the right of Mr. Sharon's and calling for the expulsion or elimination of Mr. Arafat.
The vote is a measure of the difficulty Washington has in trying to bring peace to the Middle East. The Bush administration has said publicly that the Palestinians should have an independent state as a conclusion of peace negotiations.
But Mr. Netanyahu, who still controls the Likud central committee from his own time as prime minister, organized the vote to undermine Mr. Sharon within his own party -- at a time when Mr. Sharon has his highest approval ratings in opinion polls for his tough stance against terrorism and his military campaign against the Palestinians in the West Bank.
In his speech to the party meeting, Mr. Sharon again criticized the Palestinian leadership. "We do not deal at all with the Palestinian state now," Mr. Sharon said. "It does not stand on the agenda of the day." 
He said the Palestinian Authority "must reform itself at its base in all areas -- security, economic, legal and social -- and it must take responsibility over itself.
"We cannot have peace with a corrupted, terrorist dictatorship," he added.
Mr. Netanyahu said that "it is clear now that we cannot reach any kind of solution at all with the Palestinians," and repeated his call for a buffer zone between Israel and Palestinian-ruled areas and the expulsion of Mr. Arafat. 
Mr. Netanyahu said an independent Palestinian government might be possible, "but a state with all the rights of a state, this cannot be, not under Arafat, nor under another leadership, not today nor tomorrow."
Mr. Sharon has talked of an independent Palestinian state, but essentially a demilitarized one, without the means to attack Israel.
Despite Israel's military campaign in the West Bank, a senior defense ministry official said, "we are intercepting almost one suicide bomber a day and finding a car bomb a day."
Mr. Ben-Eliezer believes, the official said, that even in the West Bank, after the Israeli military operation that began March 29 and was recently concluded, "after two to three months, maybe four months, things will be back to the way they were before."
Mr. Ben-Eliezer told the Israeli cabinet today that Israeli forces had captured 15 would-be suicide bombers in raids launched into the West Bank over the last two weeks.
He told reporters today, touring the site of the suicide bombing Tuesday night near Tel Aviv, that Israel's decision to defer an assault should not be misinterpreted as a surrender to terrorism. "We reserve the right to respond when we want and how we want -- period," he said. "It is our duty to fight against terror."
Beyond the military considerations, Mr. Sharon evidently did not want to face further international criticism now and disrupt what he regards as a favorable diplomatic climate, aides said, pointing to the Bush administration's support for the idea of needed reforms in the power structure of the Palestinian Authority -- including a single, unified security service, less corruption and more democracy.
In a sign of the tensions in the Gaza Strip, a Palestinian laborer shot dead his Israeli employer near a checkpoint leading to the Jewish settlement of Rafiah Yam, an army spokesman said. On the West Bank, in Tulkarm, Israeli soldiers raided the town again and arrested two men they said were Palestinian gunmen.
Mr. Sharon's decision to put off a strike into Gaza was also tied to new signs in the Arab world of a willingness to press Mr. Arafat to crack down on terrorists and to reform his administration.
In Sharm el-Sheik, Egypt, today, President Hosni Mubarak and Saudi Arabia's crown prince, Abdullah, finished two days of talks on the Middle East, which on Saturday included the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad.
The men "discussed coordination with the Palestinian side" and urged the international community to help repair Palestinian towns and infrastructure destroyed in Israel's offensive, an Egyptian spokesman said. 
In Bethlehem today, Christians of varying denominations prayed at the Church of the Nativity on the first Sunday since the end of a 39-day siege.
Cardinal Roger Etchegaray, an envoy of Pope John Paul II, led hundreds of Catholics in prayers along with the Latin Patriarch of the Holy Land, Michel Sabbah.

HEADLINE: Utility Buys Town It Choked, Lock, Stock and Blue Plume 

BYLINE:  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: CHESHIRE, Ohio, May 8 

 BODY:
This would have been an ordinary little town except for the bizarre blue plume that periodically emerged from the gigantic power plant and stalked through the streets, leaving townspeople complaining of raspy throats, burning eyes, sore lips, mouth blisters and grime everywhere.
 The village clerk read a list of cloud incidents at a recent public meeting. 
 "Sightings of blue cloud."
"Touchdown of blue haze."
"Complaints of spots on vehicle."
"Citizen complains of fly ash release."
The words could have come from a science-fiction movie, except that in this story, the blue plume was no mystery and everyone already knows the ending. 
Two years after the Environmental Protection Agency accused the plant's owner, American Electric Power, of violating the Clean Air Act in this southeast Ohio hamlet, the company, which is contesting that accusation, is solving at least some of its problems by buying the town, for $20 million.
Over the next few months, all 221 residents of Cheshire will pack up and leave. The 90 homeowners here will get checks for about three times the value of houses they probably could not have sold anyway. In return, they have signed pledges never to sue the power company for property damage or health problems.
The deal, announced April 16, is believed to be the first by a company to dissolve an entire town. It will help the company avoid the considerable expense and public-relations mess of individual lawsuits, legal and environmental experts said.
The sale of an entire town is extremely rare in corporate and environmental history. Since 1973, about two dozen neighborhoods -- Love Canal and Times Beach are famous examples -- have been bought out because of environmental problems. Then it was the government, not the polluting company, that bought the houses, and only after years of legal challenges. In cases where companies did the buying, the numbers of houses were much smaller.
In this case, while threats were made, no one has sued American Electric Power. Despite residents' complaints, no one has documented an abnormal rate of long-term health problems, and the village is not a toxic Superfund site. At this point, the company is not even in violation of E.P.A. rules, having spent $7 million to fix the blue plume problem, which the company says resulted from two antipollution devices that did not work properly together.
Still, most residents appear happy to go, no questions asked.
"It's just not healthy here," said Carolyn Little, 55, a longtime resident who plans to rent a trailer a few miles away. She glanced at the thick brown puffs overhead. "You can't live under this all day, every day."
Residents have agreed not to disclose the terms, but the word locally is that the 90 homeowners will each receive about $150,000, three times the assessed value of their homes, assuming they could be sold at all.
At that rate, the houses will cost the company $13.5 million. Three lawyers hired by residents to negotiate the deal are said to be getting $5.6 million. An additional million or so will cover $25,000 payments to renters and miscellaneous costs.
"None of us could sell our homes if this didn't take place," Ms. Little said, calling the buyout "more than fair."
American Electric Power, the nation's largest utility, with annual revenues of $61 billion, has acknowledged unspecified "concerns" by the community but says that the residents initiated the negotiations and that the company agreed to buy the town chiefly to expand its plant. 
"We've become an increasing annoyance, no doubt about it," said Pat Hemlepp, a company spokesman. "The dust, the noise, the occasional blue plume, spots on vehicles and homes. These are the problems of living next to any large industrial site." The desire to avoid litigation "did factor into it," he said of the company's deal with the town. "But it wasn't a primary factor."
Legal and environmental experts said that avoiding legal liability can be a powerful motivator. John Stanton, vice president for air programs at the National Environmental Trust, an advocacy group, said the purchase of Cheshire could be saving the company millions.
"The payment of damages in and of itself can create a stigma and adverse perception of property value," Mr. Stanton said, "and that can trigger additional claims by additional people who were in proximity to the original claims. That is the danger: what other towns are hiring attorneys?"
Sprawled along the Ohio River, the Gen. James M. Gavin Power Plant has two of the world's largest coal-fired generating units. Each is big enough to contain the Statue of Liberty. The plant burns 25,000 tons of coal a day, enough to power 2.6 million homes. It was built in 1974 and had major renovations in the mid-1990's. For $616 million, the company installed scrubbers to reduce carbon dioxide and replaced the single 1,100-foot-high stack with two 830-foot stacks. With these changes, the plant could still burn its high-sulfur coal, which is dirtier but cheaper than low-sulfur coal, but it also meant that emissions fell closer to home.
"The scrubbers meant no more acid rain," Mr. Hemlepp said, adding that the Gavin plant was now one of the cleanest-burning coal plants in the country. "It was applauded in the Northeast. It was a great success story. But unfortunately the people next door have to move."
Last year, the plant undertook another renovation, installing a $195 million system to reduce the nitrogen oxide emissions. That is when the blue plume made its debut.
An analysis of the plant's emissions published in January by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, a division of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, found that the levels of sulfur dioxide and sulfuric acid in the town "pose a public health hazard to some residents, particularly residents with asthma." While the levels were not life-threatening, the report said, they were high enough to cause breathing problems and "adverse effects on the lungs."
Mr. Hemlepp said those problems had been fixed and the emissions were well within federal limits. 
In any case, before the town and company agreed to the buyout, federal regulators had threatened to force the plant to burn low-sulfur coal. But in an agreement reached last week, the regulators dropped that very costly requirement and essentially withdrew from the scene, leaving the plant to monitor its emissions itself. The plant said it would keep some low-sulfur coal on hand to burn if the blue plume reappeared. 
Mr. Hemlepp said the company still had a strong incentive to fix its antipollution controls. "We've already spent the money on it," he said. "And since we have other plants that may end up with the same combination of technologies, it's important for us to get the fix."
As it was forced to add pollution controls over the years, the plant has expanded, crowding right up to the Cheshire town property line. At the same time, Mr. Hemlepp said, the plant has exhausted many of the local coal mines, so it imports much of its coal by barge and needs yet more space for unloading them.
"This deal provides us with the buffer we need and space for the barges, and it addresses the neighbors' concerns," Mr. Hemlepp said. 
If there is no problem, as the company insists, why are people leaving? They say they are tired of fighting the plant, and for many people, the immediate concern is less their health than their economic stability. 
Jennifer Harrison, the village clerk, said: "We're not going to have another chance to leave, and financially I cannot buy another house without this. I don't want to start all over again. This is a chance to get out. If we have to stay here and take it to court and fight it, we'd probably sit here another 10 years."
Others are starting to question the deal, particularly town employees who do not live within the village limits but are upset that they were not included. Some wonder if selling out was an overreaction and if it might have been smarter to somehow solve the dust problem rather than move the residents out. They also question whether the village elders sold the town for too little.
"We thought they were going to make the plant clean up," said Helen Preston, who at 87 is the village's oldest resident and does not want to leave. She lives in the house where she was born, and most of her family is buried nearby. "But the village just accepted the first offer, grabbed it up. Now people are saying we sold out too cheap."
At their monthly meeting the other night, the first since the deal was announced, the village mayor and council began confronting the mechanics of their self-abolition.
Already, bill collectors are coming around, with the Ohio Water and Development Authority first in line to make sure it recoups a $20,000 loan to Cheshire for its sewer treatment plant before the village vanishes.
The council members agreed to renew the trash contract monthly instead of yearly. They voted to put a hold on expenses but wanted flowers at the riverfront park. "Annuals, not perennials," one said mordantly.
One of the biggest puzzles is what to do about the schoolchildren. Charla Evans, Gallia County school superintendent, is, as she put it, "squealing like a scalded cat" over the deal's leaving out the schools, which sit just outside the village limits. She is meeting with company lawyers to address the problem.
Teresa Mills, director of the Buckeye Environmental Network, which helps communities wage environmental challenges and supported the buyout, said that in the end, the buyout was easier than trying to force the plant to clean up.
"The villagers got to the point of, 'Just get us out of here,' " Ms. Mills said. "Is $20 million fair? No. Do I think A.E.P. got off easy? Absolutely." But, she added, the villagers "just wanted out, and they reached an agreement they thought they could live with."

HEADLINE: Economics of Terrorism 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Nicholas D. Kristof ("Behind the Terrorists," column, May 7) doesn't find a connection between poverty and terrorism because he doesn't divide the developing world into three groups.
 The poorest group provides the foot soldiers for war, as in Afghanistan and Pakistan, whereas the middle-income group provides the strategists. 
Modern terrorism is expensive and needs educated managers. 
 Middle-income countries like Saudi Arabia and Egypt have suffered huge declines in their per capita income growth since 1973, without any obvious policies to rebuild their industries that the World Trade Organization would sanction.
With rising unemployment and economic stagnation, the brightest in these countries are attracted to violent opposition politics.

HEADLINE: Question Marks at Cable and Wireless 

BYLINE:  By SUZANNE KAPNER 

DATELINE: LONDON, May 13 

 BODY:
In the last three years, Graham Wallace, chief executive of Cable and Wireless, has defied critics by transforming a lumbering phone company into a New Age provider of Internet services to large corporations.
 Now that strategy -- and Mr. Wallace's job -- is on the line. With Cable and Wireless's stock price floundering, investors are increasingly calling for a shake-up, including the shutdown of some units and the resignation of Mr. Wallace. 
 Yet the first of any resignations is likely to be that of Mr. Wallace's boss, Sir Ralph Robins, people close to Cable and Wireless said. Sir Ralph is expected to resign as chairman, perhaps as soon as Wednesday, when the company reports financial results for the year ended March 31. His departure, however, is likely to be attributed more to age -- he will be 70 this year -- than to the company's travails.
Other boardroom shuffles are a possibility; Robert Lerwill, the finance director, may take a more subordinate role, analysts said.
Peter Eustace, a Cable and Wireless spokesman, declined to comment on the possible management changes. He also gave no sign that Cable and Wireless was preparing for a revamping.
"We believe that our basic strategy is the right one for long-term value," he said.
Investors apparently disagree. Frustrated by Cable and Wireless's worsening fortunes -- the company has lowered its financial targets three times in 12 months -- they have erased some $9.8 billion in market value the last year. On Monday, the shares closed down 3.75 pence in London, at 199 pence ($2.91).
Cable and Wireless is expected to report a 54 percent decline in earnings, before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, to $:820 million, for the recently completed financial year, according to a consensus of analysts. Revenue is expected to decline 28 percent, to $:5.8 billion.
Among the problems facing the company is how to stem losses at its Web-host unit, Cable and Wireless Global. Mr. Wallace invested heavily to acquire networks in Japan, the United States and Britain, as did rivals. Too much competition and the slowing economy caused prices to plummet. As a relative newcomer to the field, the backbone of Cable and Wireless's services is still in voice transmission, rather than specialized data services, making the company more vulnerable to the downturn, analysts said.
Unlike rivals like Global Crossing and WorldCom, which are struggling with heavy debts, Cable and Wireless is flush with roughly $:2.2 billion in cash. Yet rather than throw good money after bad, some analysts said, it should close its Web-host operations in Japan and the United States, where it is too small to compete effectively. Instead, it should focus on Britain, which accounts for 60 percent of the division's revenue.
"In Japan and the United States, Cable and Wireless is subscale and disadvantaged compared with the competition," said Paul Moran, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston in London.
Other issues have bothered investors. A Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into the way Global Crossing and other telecommunications companies account for revenue on capacity they sell to one another has raised eyebrows in London. The Accounting Standards Board, Britain's main accounting rule maker, is looking into the matter, though no formal investigation has begun.
Alan Cook, the board's technical director, said it was possible that new rules to take effect next year might prevent telecommunications companies from recognizing such swaps as revenue.
The changes would have an impact on Cable and Wireless's revenue, 4.6 percent of which came from swaps in the 2001 financial year.
Mr. Eustace, the spokesman, said the company was complying with British accounting rules; if the rules change, he said, it will be obliged to follow the new guidelines.
Cable and Wireless's old business, known as Cable and Wireless Regional, which supplies telephone services in Panama and the Caribbean, remains its biggest money maker. That is not a ringing endorsement of Mr. Wallace's vision, said Mr. Moran, the analyst, noting that "if you want to change the strategy, then you change the C.E.O."

PERSON: Stanford Matson Calderwood 

HEADLINE: Stanford Calderwood, 81; Fostered PBS Theater Series 

BYLINE:  By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Stanford Calderwood, a businessman and arts patron who brought the Masterpiece Theater to public television in America, died Thursday at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. He was 81 and lived in Belmont, Mass.
 The cause was pancreatic cancer, his attorney, John M. Cornish, said. 
 Earlier, Mr. Calderwood had a career with the Polaroid Corporation. At 49 in 1970, he resigned as its executive vice president to become president of WGBH-TV, the Public Broadcasting Service outlet in Boston.
He served only months in that position. But vacationing in London, he paid BBC-2 an unheralded call to suggest that the Boston station put a dramatic series on the air -- if the money was right.
He proposed that the British network cut its prices and that he in turn would find a corporate sponsor to underwrite the program for the American audience. It turned out that this was easier said than done despite the bargain he had driven in London.
He made the rounds with premier episodes of "Vanity Fair," "Portrait of a Lady" and "The First Churchills." By his own account he showed them to about 40 prospects and was rejected by all of them.
Finally Joseph Daly, president of the advertising agency Doyle Dane Bernbach, introduced him to Herbert Schmerz, the public affairs chief at Mobil Corporation, another client of the agency. Persuaded, Mr. Schmerz delivered an initial grant, the agency waived its usual 15 percent commission and Masterpiece Theater was on.
The broadcasts began in January 1971, and they continue today as one of PBS's longest-running series. Mr. Calderwood stayed on as a consultant into 1972.
He then worked for a money management concern owned chiefly by Yale University, counting the World Bank and Cal Tech among his first portfolios. In 1981 he bought control of Trinity Investment Management of Boston, and by the time he sold it in 1998 the company had more than $8.3 billion under management.
Stanford Matson Calderwood was born in Scottsbluff, Neb., and graduated from the University of Colorado in 1942. He served as a lieutenant in the Navy on sea duty in the Atlantic and the Pacific.
After some years as a reporter and press photographer in Boston and Philadelphia, he joined Polaroid's advertising department in 1953. He went into marketing, and by the time he resigned as executive vice president of the parent company, he had been president of subsidiaries from Milan to Tokyo.
He served as a trustee of Radcliffe College, taught economics at Wellesley College and was elected a Harvard Fellow in 2000.
He endowed the directorship of the Boston Athenaeum and professorships at Wellesley and the University of Colorado. In tribute to his wife of 60 years, he made similar gifts to the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and the Fogg Art Museum at Harvarad, among others.
His wife, Norma Jean Smith Calderwood, formerly of the Boston College art faculty, remains unaware of the endowments bearing her name. Confined to a nursing home with Alzheimer's disease, she is his only survivor.
When he bargained with the BBC in 1970, he later recalled, he told them: "Look, that old stuff sitting in the can is like a hotel room unsold -- it's worthless. Why not give us some cut prices and use it as a loss leader?"

HEADLINE: Kabul Journal; 
In the Afghan Capital, Rents Go Through the Roof

BYLINE:  By BARRY BEARAK

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan, May 13 

 BODY:
House No. 181 on 15th Street, while spacious, is definitely a fixer-upper. The kitchen cabinets, built with cheap plywood, are cracked. The linoleum floors in the halls are buckling. Wires hang like nooses from bedroom ceilings.
 The last tenant paid $500 a month for the place, an amount that now seems decidedly paltry in this city of galloping rents. The current cost is $10,000. 
 Location, location, location: the usual rules of real estate apply. But who would have thought Kabul, a bombed-out cadaver of a city, was as well situated as Manhattan? 
Six months ago, with the Taliban still in power, landlords were more apt to think they were sitting on a sinkhole than a gold mine. Afghanistan had been through 22 consecutive years of war, leaving about 40 percent of Kabul looking post-apocalyptic. 
"In a matter of months, the market has gone wild," said Azizullah, one of the city's best-known property dealers and these days a man of uncommonly good cheer. "A $70,000 house is now worth $1 million, and even for $1 million, most owners wouldn't sell." 
The value lies in Kabul's very woe. Afghanistan is being placed on the comeback trail. Foreigners -- aid groups, businessmen, the media, the United Nations -- are setting up shop or expanding operations. Refugees, some well fattened in the West, are returning. 
Demand easily surpasses supply, particularly in Kabul's two elite neighborhoods, Wazir Akbar Khan and Shahr-i-Naw. Foreigners vie for houses with the comforts of home, wanting electricity in relatively steady supply, preferring toilets that allow one to sit rather than squat. 
Many tenants are willing to pay a landlord six months rent in advance, some a full year. Some have no scruples about signing two leases, one for the actual price and the other for a bogus pittance, a document the owner can then use when the time comes to pay taxes. 
"I had no idea this house would ever be worth $3,000 or $4,000 a month," a self-satisfied man named Wahidullah said the other day. He had just moved back to Kabul from Pakistan. Carpenters and electricians, working for $8 a day, were readying his family's property. "Maybe I will never have to work again. Maybe I will have it made for life." 
Unfortunately, there are but a few winners in Kabul's real estate bonanza and a great many losers. Those who can afford the higher rents are displacing those who cannot, who in turn push out those even lower on the economic ladder. Evictions have become epidemic. 
In the poorer neighborhoods, where sewers run in an open ditch and houses have mud floors, people are stunned by the upheaval of escalating prices. 
Kabul has an estimated population of two million, including 200,000 refugees who have come in just the past few months, seemingly limitless rivals for extremely limited shelter. 
On Saturday, a distraught woman named Farishta visited a property agent in Khair Khana, a low-income neighborhood. For years, her rent had been about $12.50 a month. Suddenly, her landlord has demanded $95. She must find another place. 
"I am a teacher and my husband is an engineer," she said, her voice a quivering plea emerging from beneath the camouflage of a burka. "There are no houses that even literate people can afford. What are the very poorest going to do?" 
Shah Bacha, a proud man wearing the threadbare clothes of a day laborer, is among the poorest. His family lives in one of the squalid hovels of Khwoja Bhugra, paying about $6.25 for rent. Last week, the owner of the house said the rent was rising to $90, an impossible sum for Mr. Bacha. "I will have to take my children and sleep in the streets," he said. 
On Sunday, an organization of charities working in Kabul -- the Agency Coordinating Body for Afghan Relief -- issued a plea for rent controls and an easing of restrictions on new construction. Part of the blame for inflated rents was placed on some of the international do-gooders in their midst: the World Bank, the United Nations, prosperous aid groups.
A fair bit of sniping is going on between those agencies paying the higher rents and others who are holding to a stricter budget. Medair, a charity best known here for fighting tuberculosis, was spending $500 a month for its headquarters in Shahr-i-Naw. 
"The landlord told us his family was moving back here, and according to the lease, we had to go," said Claire Rowe, the organization's finance and administration manager. "Of course, they just wanted us out so they could move in someone else for more money." 
That someone turns out to be the financially strapped World Food Program of the United Nations, which is now paying $8,000 a month to use the building as residential space. "It's an unfortunate situation, and everyone has had to face it," said Jennifer Abrahamson, a spokeswoman for the agency. 
Prices are quoted here with little evident shame, the way they would be in Hong Kong or London or the Hamptons. Subtle pressure is applied to customers, who are told that once the billions of dollars in Western aid begin arriving, 20,000 more foreigners may descend on Kabul, heightening the competition. 
As Azizullah, the well-known real estate man, mentioned this, he sent his eyebrows skyward, denoting the direction that rents would go. He continued a tour of available homes. At House 181 on 15th Street, in Wazir Akbar Khan, one of the owner's employees helped show off the $10,000-a-month space. 
To be candid, the place did not look so great. There were paint stains on the floors. "If you want, we will carpet this with some kind of carpet," the man said offhandedly. 
There was a yardlong gap between one section of the house and the other, with a two-foot drop in between. "If you want, some kind of bridge can be made," the man said. 
There were bathtubs and wash basins with the enamel chipped away. "If you want, this too can be fixed," said the man, who by then had begun to grow impatient, wondering what a foreigner expected for $10,000 a month.

This fixer-upper is for rent at $10,000 a month.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TRAVEL: ON THE GROUND; 
In Hong Kong

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER 

 BODY:
Hong Kong is still woozy from its second economic slowdown in four years, but there are signs of revival. Tourism is booming, the stock market has stabilized and the real estate market -- Hong Kong's lifeline -- is alive again. In a sign the former British colony has not lost its hubris, it is building two of Asia's tallest skyscrapers on either side of Victoria Harbor, an 88-story monolith to house the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and a 102-story headquarters for the mass transit system.
 Hong Kong recently chose the British architect Norman Foster to design a new waterfront in Kowloon. Lord Foster, who designed the soaring airport terminal, has come up with a characteristically brash proposal: throw a vast canopy over the waterfront, sheltering a yacht basin, concert hall, cinemas, and office buildings. Projected cost: $3 billion. 
 Such fantastic sums do not faze people here. Hong Kong remains one of the world's most expensive cities, largely because its currency's peg to the American dollar has made it a safe place to do business. But as the currencies of its Asian neighbors have weakened, Hong Kong is finding it harder to compete on costs.

HOTELS
The MANDARIN ORIENTAL (011-852-2522-0111, $232 for a standard single room) is the doyenne of Hong Kong's business hotels, with faultless service, sumptuous bars and restaurants and a prime location in the heart of the Central district.
The CONRAD INTERNATIONAL (011-852-2521-3838, $212) atop the pricey Pacific Place shopping mall attracts hordes of business travelers with its spacious rooms and first-class business center.
The J. W. MARRIOTT (011-852-2810-8366, $212) offers beautiful views of Victoria Harbor, a fine swimming pool, and access to the same mall as the Conrad. And the REGAL AIRPORT HOTEL (011-852-2286-8888, $119 to $145), a vast and well-equipped transit hotel, has generous rooms, conference facilities and an air-conditioned bridge to the terminal. (Rates do not include a 13 percent room tax.)

DINING OUT
The CAF (011-852-2522-0111, $36 for two for breakfast) in the Mandarin Oriental Hotel buzzes in the morning, as bankers and lawyers huddle before heading to their offices nearby.
The jaw-dropping harbor views of the GRAND CAF (011-852-2588-1234, about $64 for lunch for two, not including wine) in the Grand Hyatt Hotel make it hard to focus on business, even though it is next door to the convention center.
The slick MEZZ RESTAURANT AND BAR (011-852-2523-8989, $60 for lunch, $100 for dinner, including wine) in the Prince's Building attracts an appropriately slick lunch crowd. It is quiet and comfortable at dinner.

ENTERTAINMENT
1/5 (011-852-2520-2515) is a scorching-hot new bar and nightclub in Wanchai, the neighborhood immortalized by Suzie Wong. Prepare to line up at the door. Weekdays: 6 p.m. to 2 a.m.; Friday: 6 p.m. to 3 a.m.; Saturday: 8 p.m.-3 a.m.
At VONG ( 011-852-2522-0111) in the Mandarin Oriental Hotel, skip the restaurant and go straight to the bar, which has dazzling views and serves dizzying Martinis. Open 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. to 11 p.m.

ON YOUR OWN
One of Hong Kong's best attractions is also one of its cheapest. For 28 cents, catch the STAR FERRY from the terminal in Central and take the 10-minute ride across the harbor to Kowloon. The green-and-white ferries chug through roiling waters, dodging freighters, cruise ships, junks, even sampans. The views are magnificent; the sea air is bracing.
If you want to buy gifts for your children, be sure to stop at the SMOCK SHOP (011-852-2524-8708) in the terminal building before you board the ferry. This hole-in-the-wall stocks some of the prettiest children's clothes in Hong Kong at unbeatable prices.
While you are buying gifts, amble over to Pedder Street in Central, where the local merchant David Tang has his flagship store, SHANGHAI TANG (011-852-2525-7333). It sells delightful Teddy bears and, for your spouse, Chinese-style jackets for men and women and knick-knacks that trade on the image of Mao Zedong and other heroes of the Communist revolution.

LOCAL LORE
*Hong Kong's richest woman, Nina Wang, is waging an epic legal battle over the $3 billion estate of her husband, Teddy Wang, who was kidnapped in 1990 and is presumed dead. Mrs. Wang, who likes to be called by her nickname, Little Sweetie, claims her husband left her his fortune in a will drafted shortly before his abduction. Mr. Wang's father, Wang Din-shin, says that document is a forgery and the lucre is his from an earlier will.
*In a city obsessed by money, the 35-year-old billionaire Richard Li is as big a celebrity as any movie star. Newspapers breathlessly chronicle Mr. Li's acquisitions, which include sundry yachts and a $20 million weekend home in the upscale enclave of Shek O.

This feature about places to stay, eat and visit in leading business destinations appears every Tuesday.

HEADLINE: The Great Evasion 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Last week Stanley Works, a Connecticut tool company, postponed its plan to evade taxes by incorporating itself in Bermuda. The decision reflected pressure from the White House, which denounced the move as unpatriotic in a time of national emergency.
 I am, of course, making that last part up. The shareholders' vote approving Stanley's move was challenged by Connecticut officials; also, the company has been put in the spotlight by David Cay Johnston, The New York Times's invaluable tax reporter. But the Bush administration, always quick to question the patriotism of anyone who gets in its way, has said nothing at all about Stanley Works, and little about the growing number of U.S. corporations declaring themselves foreign for tax purposes. 
 To be fair, the administration didn't create the loophole Stanley wants to exploit. And it's not enough just to denounce corporations that exploit tax loopholes; the real answer is to deny them the opportunity. Still, the administration's silence is peculiar. What's going on? 
The closest we have to an official statement on the issue of companies moving offshore comes from the Treasury Department's chief of tax enforcement: "We may need to rethink some of our international tax rules that were written 30 years ago when our economy was very different and that now may be impeding the ability of U.S. companies to compete internationally." 
Unfortunately, that statement misrepresents the issue. For one thing, U.S. companies don't necessarily pay higher taxes than their foreign counterparts; Germany's corporate tax rate is significantly higher than ours, France's rate is about the same, and Britain's is only marginally lower. Anyway, the Treasury statement makes it sound as if we're losing revenue because U.S.-based companies are moving their headquarters to lower-cost locations, or because they are losing market share to foreign rivals. Neither proposition is true. In fact, we're losing revenue because profitable U.S. companies are using fancy footwork to avoid paying taxes.
By incorporating itself in Bermuda, a U.S.-based corporation can -- without moving its headquarters or anything else -- shelter its overseas profits from taxation. Better yet, the company can then establish "legal residence" in a low-tax jurisdiction like Barbados, and arrange things so that its U.S. operations are mysteriously unprofitable, while the mail drop in Barbados earns money hand over fist. In other words, this isn't about competition; it's about tax evasion. 
The natural answer would seem to be to crack down on the evaders -- to find a way to tax companies on the profits they really earn in the U.S., and prevent them from using creative accounting to make the profits appear somewhere else. It's hard, but not impossible.
But here's the key point: Administration officials don't want to help collect the corporate profits tax. Unable to push major corporate tax breaks through Congress, the administration has used whatever leeway it has to offer such breaks without legislation. The Hill, a nonpartisan publication covering Congressional affairs, recently reported on "a series of little-noticed executive orders . . . that will provide corporations with billions of dollars in tax relief without the consent of Congress." 
And now the silence on Stanley becomes comprehensible. The administration doesn't want to say outright that it's in favor of tax evasion; but it also doesn't really want to collect the taxes. Better to say nothing at all. 
The trouble is that hinting, even by silence, that it's O.K. not to pay taxes is a dangerous game, because it can quickly grow into a major revenue loss. Accountants and tax planners have taken the hint; they now believe that it's safe to push the envelope. Tax receipts this year are falling far short of expectations, even taking the recession into account; my bet is that it will turn out that newly aggressive tax avoidance by corporations (and wealthy individuals) is an important part of the story. And it will get worse next year.
Furthermore, what does it say to the nation when companies that are proud to stay American are punished, while companies that are willing to fly a flag of convenience are rewarded?
If the administration wants to eliminate the corporate profits tax, let's have a real, open debate -- starting with an explanation of how the lost revenue will be replaced in a time of severe budget deficits. Meanwhile, let's crack down on tax evasion.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TRAVEL: ON THE ROAD; 
Life Can Be Pretty Good 5 Miles Up

BYLINE:  By Joe Sharkey; On the Road appears each Tuesday. E-mail: jsharkey@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
ONE attraction of the job of reporter is that you occasionally get to experience how the swells live, without actually having to do all of the things that are necessary to become one. 
 Thus it was recently that I flew to Columbus, Ohio, on a capacious Boeing Business Jet. That's the luxury liner of the private jet world, an airplane with a 6,000-mile range and an interior cabin that is 66 feet long and nearly 12 feet wide. 
 The next time you're crammed into one of those snowsled-size seats in a Boeing 737, look around and imagine the same plane with only eight or twelve seats. Put in a cozy conference room, two big bathrooms with full-size showers, and a bedroom aft with a queen-size bed. Plunk down $50 million or so, and you've got yourself a Boeing Business Jet. 
I was bound to Ohio for a lunchtime tour of the sprawling facilities of NetJets Inc., the company that revolutionized the business-jet market by offering fractional shares of airplanes to those who don't want to buy the whole thing.
On board, happy flight attendants pass trays of food and pour drinks. No one is muttering darkly about laptops being thumped around like parcel post packages by airport security checkers. Instead, there is the twitter of cocktail-party chatter as the clouds blow by. "Brie?" the flight attendant asks.
O.K., I'll knock it off. Though I fly frequently on a wide variety of planes, I am not a habitue of private jets. My usual airline seat, in fact, is in steerage, unless I manage to score an upgrade to first class thanks to my frequent-flier status. Domestic first class, as all business travelers know, is almost exclusively full of frequent fliers who have been upgraded from coach as a way to keep them flying on a particular airline.
With a sour economy and with business travel both sluggish and stubbornly resistant to any higher costs, it would seem counterintuitive to suggest that there is resiliency to the corporate jet's aggressive incursion into the business-travel market in recent years. But in fact, after a slight dip this year and next, the growth in business jets appears poised to continue strongly through the next decade, according to industry research. 
Most forecasters have predicted a modest decline in orders and deliveries of business jets this year. In the first quarter, 173 business jets were delivered, down from 196 in the first quarter of 2001, according to the General Aviation Manufacturers Association.
Forecast International/DMS, an aerospace research firm, issued a revised forecast yesterday that projected that this year's dip in production, to 775 jets, would drop further to 728 jets in 2003, before a recovery in 2004. In all, 7,815 new business jets, worth $123.5 billion, will be produced from 2001 to 2010, the research firm said. 
The strong customer dissatisfaction with commercial airlines and with the airport security problems that had been expected to bolster short-term private jet growth was offset by the bad economy, said Raymond Jaworowski, a senior aerospace researcher at Forecast International. 
Another complicating factor occurred this year, when United Airlines abruptly shut down its fledgling Avolar fractional business jet subsidiary,
"Avolar was talking about a fleet of 300-odd aircraft," said Mr. Jaworowski, who added that Avolar had not ordered anywhere near that number. In a short time, he said, orders from existing companies in the fractional market will make up whatever Avolar would have bought.
All indications are that the fractional market will continue growing as more companies opt in, and other companies add fractional-share planes to existing fleets.
Fractional ownership companies "account for about 45 percent" of the present backlog of orders at the five major manufacturers of business jets, Mr. Jaworowski said. Two companies, NetJets, with about a 50 percent share of the market, and Flight Options Inc., with about a 33 percent share, dominate the fractional field.
Darnell H. Martens, the assistant to the chairman at Flight Options, which now has 1,700 owners with shares in 200 airplanes, said that his company planned to double the fleet in five years. He foresees an accelerating shift away from the strictures of the current commercial air system, driven partly by growing dissatisfaction with flying from major hub airports.
There is, he added, "a growing pool" of companies and individuals with "some small level of travel that fractional ownership can handle." That market is "far larger" than any current projections, he said. 
His own predictions are audacious: "If we fast-forward five years, I think fractional ownership moves into a whole different level where it almost fully supplants" the most frequent business travel that is now claimed by the airlines, he said.
Currently, one of the fastest-growing segments of the business jet market is for long-range models with price tags of $30 million to $35 million, according to Forecast International. This is an indication that more businesses are using private planes for long-haul travel that the airlines depend on for most of their revenue. 
Still, no one is yet claiming to be making any money in the fractional-share niche.
NetJets, for example, has 449 business jets, with another 565 on order. That's a lot of investment in airplanes. And NetJets, which was founded in 1986 by Richard T. Santulli and purchased by the investor Warren E. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. in 1998, isn't expecting to become profitable for years to come.
"We have a 10-year plan, and we're probably behind where we thought we would be" by now, Mr. Santulli, the chairman and chief executive, said at the NetJets operations center in Columbus. 
Steady, long-term market share is the key, and that requires patience and lots of money, he said. Mr. Santulli added that Mr. Buffett "doesn't judge me based on how much money we made last quarter."

HEADLINE: Off the Reservation, Onto the Dealer's Lot 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: CARTHAGE, Miss. 

 BODY:
Frontier Ford, a nondescript dealership with a few rows of cars lined up in its lot in this small central Mississippi town, does not look like much of a competitive threat.
 "I don't see how a little dealership in Carthage, where we have two red lights, can cause this much fuss," Butch Smith, the general manager, said while his salesmen leaned on cars, awaiting customers. 
 Earlier this year, the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, whose reservation is centered 25 miles east of Carthage, bought Frontier, provoking an uproar among the state's dealers. The dealers worry that the Choctaw tribe, because of its tax status, will undercut rivals on prices, even though it has promised not to do so.
That the tribe is considered an adversary worthy of concern is evidence of its stunning turnaround from economic basket case to local juggernaut. In the 1970's, the jobless rate among the Choctaws was more than 50 percent, and college degrees were rare. Today, unemployment has fallen to 4 percent; with ventures all over Mississippi and even in Mexico ranging from a greeting card plant to an automotive dashboard instrument company, the tribe is one of the state's five largest employers and has become one of the most successful Native American tribes in the country. Of its 8,900 members, more than 400 are in college. 
So, as enterprises like casino gambling have transformed the economic power of tribes, Indians have become respected, even feared, business rivals.
"When a tribe starts to have economic power," said Jacqueline Johnson, the executive director of the National Congress of American Indians, a Washington advocacy group, "we have other kinds of obstacles."
When tribes buy land off their reservations, they can apply to turn it into, in effect, a mini-reservation. Since tribes are exempt from federal, state and local taxes, this can provide a significant business advantage. In Texas, a California tribe, the Rumsey Band of Wintun Indians, also bought a Ford dealership this year, but dealers there see that tribe as less of a threat because an out-of-state tribe cannot buy land and convert it into reservation territory.
The Mississippi Choctaws have promised the state attorney general that they will pay all sales and property taxes. Besides, car buyers who are not Indians have to pay sales taxes anyway when they register their vehicles with the state and get license plates. But dealers say the tribe's promises can be broken. The dealers want the state's motor vehicle commission to rescind the tribe's license to operate the dealership and grant one that is conditional on the tribe's waiving all tribal rights.
"If things get slow, they might stop charging sales taxes," said Matt Gregory, co-owner of Triple M Motors, a General Motors dealership separated from Frontier by a Pizza Hut and a farm bureau office. "If they would just come in on the same playing field as everybody else, it would be fine."
One group dedicated to fighting the economic incursion of tribes nationally -- the Coalition Against Sales and Excise Tax Evasion -- consists of trade groups representing operators of truck stops, convenience stores and gas stations, which often compete against Indian-owned businesses. "It's been a very uphill battle," said Holly Tuminello, a spokeswoman for the coalition. "Tribes are a very powerful and well-moneyed lobbying force." 
In the case of the Choctaws, the Mississippi Automobile Dealers' Association is leading the push to curb the tribe's tax advantages. It recently brought in former Senator Slade Gorton, Republican of Washington, to testify before the motor vehicle commission. Mr. Gorton has been a longtime nemesis of tribes, and his electoral defeat in 2000 was brought about in part by the first concerted fund-raising effort by Indian groups against a national politician.
The dealers have also sued for access to the tribe's financial records, a case now before the state Supreme Court. Kevin Watson, a lawyer for the dealers, said, "If they're going to get in the free enterprise system and compete with every other business in the country, they ought to play by the same rules."
He added: "Where does it stop? Today it's a car dealership, tomorrow a bank, the next day an insurance company."
Choctaw officials have insisted that the playing field will be level. "We've been accused of being the next Wal-Mart, that we're going to buy 50 dealerships," said James W. Clancy, the tribe's attorney general. He said the purchase of the car dealership was part of the tribe's effort to become self-sufficient. With some 600 Ford vehicles used for official business on tribal lands, one intent is to use Frontier to buy, sell and service those cars.
He called the dealers' move part of "a concerted effort to eventually tax tribes in this country."
The dealers also say the tribe will have an edge because it pays no income taxes; the tribe says it uses those savings to pay for schools, police and fire departments.
Neither the Mississippi sale nor the one in Texas was part of the Ford Motor Company's effort to increase the number of minority-owned dealerships. As happens when any dealership changes hands, however, the company had to sign off on it.
"We granted them a franchise because they met all the requirements," Ken Zino, a Ford spokesman, said of the Choctaws.
As for the tribe's further plans beyond reservation land, Phillip Martin, the longtime chief, said, "This is a free country, and anybody can go into any business that they want to, as long as they're legitimate."
It is not the dealers' job, he said, "to make sure the tribe doesn't get off the reservation."
The dispute does not fit a stereotypical image of red man versus white man. For example, Mr. Clancy, the tribe's attorney general, is white, and more than 60 percent of the tribe's workers are non-Indians. None of the 40 people employed at the dealership are Choctaws.
In January, the motor vehicle commission denied the Choctaws a license to operate Frontier, but relented in February and issued one. Now it is considering revoking the license. A final decision could come on May 15.
Mike Moore, a Democrat who is the state's attorney general, says his office will no longer represent the motor vehicle commission in the matter. In a sharply worded letter, he said the commission had overstepped its authority and had no cause to consider revoking the Choctaws' license. He added that the commission was trying to "fabricate a case against the tribe."
The chairman of the Mississippi State Tax Commission, Ed Buelow Jr., said the tribe had always been fair in how it handled taxes. "I don't see what the fuss is, frankly," he said.
Jim Moors, the director of franchising and state law for the National Automobile Dealers Association, who attended one meeting of the state motor vehicle commission, said: "The main issue is what are the rules? Is there a level playing field among dealers?" He added that "we're getting a lot of questions" from dealers around the country.
Most Choctaws were evicted from Mississippi in 1831, forced to take the Trail of Tears into the Oklahoma Territories. But some stayed behind, living a hardscrabble existence that continued into the 1970's. Rae Nell Vaughn, the chief justice of the tribal court, said she lived with her grandparents, who were sharecroppers.
"They lived in a frame house with a fireplace for heat and outdoor plumbing," she said. "The memories my children will have of their grandmother, my mother, is being in a modern house with a nice car."
Mr. Martin, 76, the tribe's chief since 1979, is credited with the turnaround -- an unusual one, since it predates the rise of tribal casinos after the federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988. After returning from the Air Force in the 1950's, he recognized that the impoverished band of sharecroppers faced an uncertain future. "The thought occurred to me: Why not bring industry to the reservation?" he said.
He lobbied for government grants and gradually developed an industrial park. Today it has numerous enterprises, from its Silver Star Resort and Casino in Choctaw, Miss., to a factory that makes cards for American Greetings to a satellite-imaging lab. There are so many well-paying jobs that the tribe's first business venture, the car dashboard instrument maker, was moved to Mexico for its cheaper labor market.
Though the tribe gets tens of millions of dollars a year in federal grants, that is less than half the income it needs, a spokeswoman said. But the casino is lucrative enough, the chief said, that each member gets an annual payout of about $1,000, which would be higher if so much was not invested in scholarship programs and new ventures, like a water park.
The tribe's transformation can be seen in the neighborhoods around the casino, where government-issue cinder-block houses have given way to nicer suburban homes and even a trendy development, River Oaks.
"We're uptown now," said Creda Stewart, the tribe's public relations director, who is half Cherokee. "We get our lattes at the Coffee Bean."
With success comes some downside. One local businessman, who insisted that his name not be used, said there was some bitterness among locals, though it was not deep seated.
"I don't know whether you'd call it resentment," he said, "or envy."
Ed Kossman Jr., a car dealer in Cleveland, Miss., and one of the state motor vehicle commissioners, said, "I admire their entrepreneurial spirit," but added that tribal tax protections were now outdated, having been set up in a different era. 
"Today, they are becoming more affluent and they are doing business away from the reservation," he said. "As times change, sometimes things need to be revisited."
Ms. Johnson, of the National Congress of American Indians, said, "As long as we're poor, impoverished, lack health care facilities and have the worst education system in the country, as long as that's the case, we don't hear from anyone. 
"The fact is, these tribes are sovereign nations, and they have the right to determine their tax structures," she said.

HEADLINE: TRACK AND FIELD; 
Drossin Is Surging To Forefront

BYLINE:  By FRANK LITSKY 

 BODY:
For a decade, since injuries started closing down the long and glorious career of Mary Decker Slaney, the United States has been searching for a female distance runner who could compete with the world's best. She seems to have arrived in Deena Drossin, a 29-year-old University of Arkansas graduate.
 Last November, Drossin finished the New York City Marathon in 2 hours 26 minutes 58 seconds, the fastest marathon debut by an American. This year, she has had an amazing two-month stretch. 
 MARCH 9 In Jacksonville, Fla., Drossin ran a 15-kilometer road race in 48:12, an American record. "That's where I gained the most confidence this year," she said.
MARCH 23 In Dublin, she finished second to Paula Radcliffe of Britain in the world cross-country championships, running eight kilometers in 27:04. "I was surprised," she said, "because my goal was to be in the top five."
APRIL 7 In Carlsbad, Calif., Drossin ran five kilometers in the fastest time for a woman in a road race, 14:54. "That surprised me, too," she said.
MAY 3 In Palo Alto, Calif., she set an American record of 30:50.32 for 10 kilometers on the track, breaking Lynn Jennings's 10-year-old record of 31:19.89. Drossin was not overly impressed, saying, "I still don't feel really sharp, and I feel that I can get in better track shape."
Overnight success? Hardly, Drossin said last week from her training base at 8,000-foot altitude in Mammoth Lakes, Calif.
"It's been many years of hard work," she said. "My progress has been very gradual. The marathon training I did last year gave me a great base going into this year. Since January, I've been lifting weights two hours a day, three days a week. It's very strenuous, and I think I got a lot of strength and speed from it.
"My form has improved. My running is much more efficient. I have the confidence to start taking more risks in a race, and that's what it takes to break records. I have the security that I lacked in previous years."
Much of that security, she said, comes from her training regimen, although her economical build (5 feet 4 inches, 105 pounds) leaves little room for bulging muscles. She spends eight months a year in Mammoth Lakes and four months at the Olympic Training Center in Chula Vista, Calif., outside San Diego. She trains with Team USA's dozen or so other male and female distance runners, including Jen Rhines, Meb Kelfezighi, Matt Downin and Tony Cosey.
They are coached by Joe Vigil, for 35 years a highly successful distance-running guru. He likes Drossin's approach to running.
"Most runners take time off between seasons," Vigil said from Mammoth Lakes. "But this is her job, and she takes no time off. It's not dangerous, because she listens to her body, and we run blood profiles every three or four months. There's nothing wrong with working every day.
"There are many reasons for her improvement, starting with the residual effect of six years of hard training. She has set high goals for herself. As a physiologist, I see room for improvement. She's going to get better. She may not run at a faster pace, but she will keep up her speed for longer distances."
Drossin will be in New York tomorrow for the J. P. Morgan Chase Corporate Challenge in Central Park, but only to give a pep talk or to fire the starting gun. Her next races are the 10-kilometer Bolder Boulder on May 27 in Colorado, the 10-kilometer New York Mini Marathon on June 8 in Central Park and 5,000 meters on the track in the national championships June 22 in Palo Alto.
Then come three European races in 10 days: 1,500 meters in Cork, Ireland; 3,000 meters in Rome and 5,000 meters in Stockholm. She plans one marathon this year, Oct. 13 in Chicago. Drossin wants to run in the 2004 Athens Olympics in the 10 kilometers or in the marathon. Meanwhile, she is back home in California and life is wonderful.
"I'm extremely happy where I am with my training and racing," she said. "A lot of things I dreamed about years ago are becoming reality for me. I'm at maybe 85 percent of where I can be long term. There's always room for improvement, and I'm going to improve. You always strive for higher things. It's a lot of hard work, and I like that. I do love what I do."

HEADLINE: Newark Arena Financial Plan Is a Mix of Old and New Ideas 

BYLINE:  By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: NEWARK, May 13 

 BODY:
The financial partnership between the state and the owners of the New Jersey Nets and Devils to build a $355 million arena in Newark is a mix of the familiar and the novel: It cobbles together several old proposals by the teams and state officials, as well as new features that some critics say violate the State Constitution and may undermine pledges that taxpayers will not be put at risk.
 While details of the financing are still being debated and are subject to approval by a wary Legislature, some lawmakers are already taking aim at the proposed use of state income tax revenues from the arena development as a secondary repayment source for borrowed construction funds. They say that this violates a prohibition in the State Constitution against using the income tax for anything but property tax reduction. 
 Opponents of the plan said the only mechanism available to avoid such a constitutional violation would force state officials to dip into the general fund, something Gov. James E. McGreevey has vowed will not happen. 
The outlines of the financing plan for the arena were announced last week by Governor McGreevey and Len Coleman, the chief negotiator for the teams' owners, the YankeeNets. Under the preliminary agreement, the YankeeNets would make an initial investment of $120 million in the arena. The state's Sports and Exposition Authority would issue $165 million in construction bonds. Essex County would contribute $15 million, and Newark would kick in $35 million. The remaining $20 million would come from two equal loans from the YankeeNets and the state.
The announcement came after nearly three and a half years of often-stormy talks between the teams and a succession of state officials in three administrations. In that time, both sides have argued about the economics of building an arena in Newark, the amount of state subsidy versus the amount of private investment, and whether the state's creditworthiness should be staked to the arena deal as it was to the deal for the arena's deficit-ridden predecessor, the Continental Airlines Arena.
Much in the new plan was drawn from earlier plans, including the idea of creating a special taxing district for the arena whose sales tax revenue would be the primary source for repaying borrowed funds. Another feature in previous plans was the $50 million contribution of Newark and Essex County.
But much is new, including the McGreevey administration's insistence that the YankeeNets buy bond insurance to insulate taxpayers from the risk that they might eventually be saddled with the cost of the arena, and the use of funds from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to aid the development.
The boundaries of the special taxing district, with its hefty 6 percent sales tax, are more confined than in earlier plans, and consequently less onerous to a host of Newark businesses and residents, some of them struggling. And the required cash contribution of the YankeeNets has increased modestly to $120 million, from $115 million in an earlier plan.
The total of $185 million that would be borrowed is only a little bit less than the $190 million in state-backed bonding in a plan last year that Mr. McGreevey ended up opposing during his campaign for governor.
Critics like Bret D. Schundler, Mr. McGreevey's Republican opponent, argue that no amount of insurance could relieve taxpayers of liability if the arena becomes an economic fiasco. They argue there should be a statewide referendum on the project.
John O. Bennett, the leader of the Republicans in the evenly split State Senate, focused his criticism on the repayment mechanism for the $165 million in bonds the Sports and Exposition Authority would issue. The estimated $12 million in annual debt service on those bonds would come first from the 6 percent sales tax levied in a sports and entertainment district made up of the arena, an adjacent hotel and a parking garage, according to the proposal. But if that proves insufficient, the authority would tap the state income tax revenues drawn from employees of the district, including the basketball and hockey players who play there.
Mr. Bennett said the State Constitution requires that all state income tax revenues flow into a fund "exclusively for the purpose of reducing or offsetting property taxes." He said that creating "a playground for millionaire team owners" was a far cry from lowering property taxes.
Some familiar with state finances, like Albert Porroni, executive director of the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services, said that recourse to the state's income tax as a secondary repayment guarantee was included in the prospectus of many of the state's bond issues as an additional assurance to the underwriters. But that provision had never been invoked, and its constitutionality never tested, because the state had never fallen short on its primary repayment source, he said.
Moreover, there are other ways to avoid running afoul of the prohibitions on use of the income tax, said state and YankeeNets officials familiar with the financing plan.
Ever since last year, when Acting Gov. Donald T. DiFrancesco proposed a special tax district, state officials have intended to use a business incentive program that allows the Legislature to set aside each year from the general fund a percentage of the projected income tax revenue from a specially created economic development district like the arena district. Normally this money is returned to the businesses and their employees as an incentive to locate in the state, but in the case of the arena, the state would hold those funds as a hedge against any shortfall in the sales tax revenues.
Mr. Bennett said that the business incentive program was intended to encourage new businesses and expanded payrolls that would ultimately ease property tax burdens statewide, and not to help an existing business move within the state. "And even if the governor uses state funds this way, it is exactly what he said he wasn't going to do," he said.
The use of some $10 million in Port Authority funds may also raise questions about Mr. McGreevey's assertion that the state would not spend general-fund money on the arena. In a resolution last month, the agency voted to make the money available to the New Jersey Redevelopment Authority to help "create value in New Jersey's urban communities."
While Mr. McGreevey's plan calls for the state to lend this money for preconstruction costs only if necessary, critics will argue that this money could be used to reduce expenditures from the state general fund.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL; 
The Cable Guys

BYLINE:  By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

 BODY:
The Seattle Mariners have 26 victories this season, but none of them include their local ratings triumphs in prime time over dramas and comedies like "West Wing," "Frasier" (the Seattle radio shrink who would not know where Safeco Field is) and "Survivor."
 Playing in a popular new ballpark before a well-heeled populace and featuring a group of likable players that includes the hitter known as Ichiro, the Mariners are the top-rated team in Major League Baseball, far higher than the Yankees, Mets, Dodgers or Cubs. 
 Their 15.7 cable rating on Fox Sports Northwest is 69 percent better than the 9.3 rating for the No. 2 team, the Cleveland Indians.
"The city stops for a game," said Tracy Dolgin, president of Fox Sports Net, which includes Fox Sports Northwest among its 21 regional affiliates. "The only equivalent is the Packers in Green Bay." 
Remarkably, although the Seattle market is less than one-quarter the size of New York, Mariners games are drawing more households a game than the Mets or Yankees.
The Mariners are, in essence, a daily reality series starring Lou Piniella, as the wise former hell-raiser from Tampa, Fla.; Ichiro Suzuki, as the mysterious, lovable superstar hitter whose utterances in Japanese are examined for their profundity; and Ruben Sierra as an Odysseus-like character, returned from his travels with his batting skills restored.
The Mariners are as real as MTV's "Osbournes." They live at Safeco Field, which is about the same size as the house Ozzy et famille inhabit in Beverly Hills, Calif. The Mariners deftly wield bats that are swung; Ozzy once ate bats that fly.
"We used to get pretty good ratings when people tuned in to see how badly they could screw up," said Dave Niehaus, who has called nearly all Mariners games on radio or television since their creation in 1977.
The Mariners' ratings potency was on vivid display last Tuesday, when they lost to Toronto, 4-1. The game rated a 16.1 (or 265,204 households). The broadcast network program closest to it, "Frasier," produced a 13.6 on the local NBC station.
Last Wednesday, the Mariners rallied in the bottom of the 10th inning to beat the Blue Jays, 5-4. The game generated a 19.1 rating (which equals 314,950 households). NBC's "West Wing," its closest pursuer, was 68 percent behind, with an 11.6 locally.
On that night in the New York metropolitan area, the Giants-Mets game on the MSG Network received a 2.1 rating, or 154,782 households, which was dwarfed in its time period by a 16.2 for "West Wing," and a 16.9 for "Law & Order" on the local NBC station.
One of the highest-rated Mariners games of this season, on April 17 against Oakland, produced a 19.2 locally. The No. 2 program, "Law & Order," drew a meager 9.6. Each Seattle market rating point equals 16,472 cable households.
Regardless of the time the Mariners play, they invariably win their time slot. When they played the Yankees in New York on May 5 -- a 10 a.m. starting time in the Pacific time zone -- the game chalked up a 17.2.
Fox Sport Northwest is paying dearly to carry the Mariners. A new deal that began last season paid the team $37 million, one of the steepest payments in baseball. The previous year, the fee was $18 million. The cable channel carries 107 games; a broadcast channel, KIRO-TV, is showing 35.
"At least a good thing happened when we paid this," Dolgin said. "They invested it in the club."
Exactly why the Mariners are such a dominant television attraction is not a feat of magic, merely of alchemy.
The team, except for losing years in 1998 and 1999, has been improving, enough to weather losing Randy Johnson, Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex Rodriguez. And it got well in time for the opening of Safeco Field in mid-1999, then seemed to be touched by fairy dust when Suzuki joined the team last season.
Suzuki's stellar rookie season was the main engine for the 59 percent rise in last season's ratings. "There's a huge Japanese-American population here," said Mark Shuken, general manager of Fox Sports Northwest, which sold a package of home games to Japan's NHK network because of Suzuki and is working on a deal to beam games to Hawaii.
The team does not break out the demographics of its Japanese, Japanese-American or Asian-American fan base. About half of its fans come from outside King County, where Seattle is located and where 10 percent of the population is Asian.
"We work with Japanese travel companies now," Howard Lincoln, the chairman of the Mariners, said. "Until this started, when the typical Japanese tourist thought of going to the U.S., it was San Francisco or Los Angeles. Now, we're getting a huge number of Japanese tourists, and the reason is the Seattle broadcasts."
And, the Mariners have become the baseball team of the Northwest, with games also seen in Portland, Ore., and Vancouver, British Columbia. 
"They have no baseball competition to the north, and nothing to the east for 500 miles," Rick Burton, the director of the Warsaw Sports Management Center at the University of Oregon, said. "And there's no team to the south until you get to San Francisco. Their appeal has a really wide circle."
But even within its local circle, the Mariners have the advantage of being in a less cluttered market than New York, which has one of the wealthiest populations in the country. With the Seahawks and SuperSonics, there are only three major league teams in Seattle. But the market is strongly collegiate with the Washington Huskies and Washington State Cougars.
"It's been Huskies town, not a Seahawks town," Rodney Fort, an economics professor at Washington State, in Pullman, said. "When you go to Husky Stadium, you see that they expect the Rose Bowl."
But now, with the Mariners' renown surpassing anything the entertainer Danny Kaye and his partners could have envisioned when they acquired the expansion franchise in 1976, Lincoln said, "The Mariners are the most popular team in the region because we play every day" -- bigger than the Huskies' football team, which won the 2001 Rose Bowl.
Lincoln could be partly right. Compare the Mariners' 15.7 average to some of last year's Huskies games on ABC. The local rating when the Huskies played Michigan last Sept. 8 was a 14.7; the Oct. 13 game at U.C.L.A. rated a mere 7.1; while a Nov. 17 Washington-Washington State game matchup produced a 19.7.
"Seattle is a wonderfully supportive sports town," Gary Barta, the senior associate athletic director at Washington, said. "Given their success, it's no surprise the Mariners are getting the support they're getting." 
And that support, especially on television, would be the envy of George Steinbrenner, the principal owner of the Yankees. On his new YES Network -- still without a deal with Cablevision and its three million households -- the games are getting a 2.2 rating, or 160,623 homes.
On that score, the Mariners own the Yankees.

HEADLINE: Demolition of Nuclear Plant Illustrates Problems Involved 

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WISCASSET, Me., May 10 

 BODY:
Power company executives, environmentalists and state government officials fought for most of the 80's and 90's about whether the Maine Yankee nuclear power plant was safe and economical. But once the owners agreed that the plant should close, the debate turned really complicated. 
 Suddenly, said Ray Shadis, who had fought for years to shut down Maine's only reactor, "there were a lot more things to argue about." 
 How much radioactive building material could safely be left at the site? Should nonradioactive concrete and concrete structures below the ground be removed? What should happen to the highly radioactive spent fuel, which the federal government is supposed to take, but, for the next few years at least, has no place to put? 
Now, more than five years after Maine Yankee split its last atom, the cumbersome process of decontamination and demolition gives a hint of what lies ahead for the 103 power reactors still operating around the country -- whether economic problems close them, as happened here, or fear of terrorism shuts them, a threat faced by Indian Point in New York, or whether they run for years to come and retire at a ripe old age.
First comes the argument over how much radioactive material can be left. Some experts have described as excruciatingly tough the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's standard, which says the annual extra dose of radiation of the person most heavily exposed should be no more than 25 millirem. People who do not work with radiation are exposed to about 350 millirem a year, counting cosmic rays, radon gas and radiation from medical procedures and naturally radioactive rocks and minerals.
In the regulatory commission's calculation, the individual is assumed to live 24 hours a day at the site. That is unlikely at many reactor sites that will remain industrial -- as will probably be the case here -- where workers typically spend eight hours a day. Maine Yankee, one of the first big reactors to be shut, has rail service, town water and sewerage, access to the electric grid, and a river full of water for barge traffic or cooling, all of which contribute to its industrial appeal. 
The commission's calculation also assumes the individual is a subsistence farmer who drills a well in the most contaminated spot and uses its water for drinking and irrigation. Coastal Maine has no such farmers, and the water under the site is brackish, company officials say, making it unsuitable for drinking or irrigation.
But after protracted debate, the state decided that the commission's standard was too loose; it imposed a standard of 10 millirem a year. That standard is so low that technicians have difficulty determining whether dirt or concrete has enough radioactivity above natural background that it will contribute to extra exposure. So hundreds of tons of material are being shipped out to other states on the presumption of being slightly radioactive, because shipping is cheaper than testing. 
Not all environmentalists are convinced that this is sound.
"Parts of this can be depicted by others, outside the state of Maine, to be pretty selfish," said W. Donald Hudson, who is the president of the Chewonski Foundation, an environmental educational institution a mile from the plant.
Moving the material does not make it any less radioactive, although it may end up somewhere with a lower population density and less rainfall, reducing the likelihood that contaminants will be washed into drinking water.
Mr. Hudson said plants decommissioned in the future might not be able to ship out so much material, because states designated to receive the waste might "put their foot down." 
Nationally, only three low-level waste dumps are operating, and one, at Hanford, Wash., accepts material only from the Pacific Northwest. The other dumps are in Barnwell, S.C., and at a desert site about 80 miles west of Salt Lake City, which is expected to receive most of Maine Yankee's contaminated concrete. Thus one certainty of decommissioning is a long trip.
About 65,000 tons of radioactive waste from the plant will require shipment off site. More highly radioactive materials will go to Barnwell. About 50,000 tons of material that is not radioactive will go to an ordinary industrial landfill in Niagara County, N.Y. About 75 trainloads of radiaoactive and nonradioactive waste have already been shipped.
If all goes as scheduled, it will take eight years to demolish the plant, which took four years to build. The construction was easier, because at that point all the material was clean, said Wayne A. Norton, president of the company. 
Demolishing the plant and shipping the waste will cost $500 million, more than twice the $231 million the plant cost to build (although that was in 1972, when a dollar bought more concrete than it does today.) The job is 61 percent done and on budget, managers say.
Maine Yankee is a single-unit plant, about two-thirds the size of Indian Point 2 or 3 in New York, which suggests the cost of decommissioning a plant the size of Indian Point could well exceed $1 billion,
Another factor in deciding how thoroughly to clean up the site is radiation exposure to workers performing the decommissioning. The more exhaustive the operation, the more that level will rise. Maine Yankee has a "budget" of no more than 1,150 rem of exposure to all of its workers collectively during the entire cleanup, although the actual exposure will probably be somewhat lower. In contrast, 200 rem to 400 rem was typical for a year in which the plant was operating.
But neither Maine Yankee nor any other power reactor can really be fully decommissioned now because there is no place to put spent fuel. So a major policy issue that remains is how to store the fuel, which is now kept mostly in spent fuel pools around the country. 
At Maine Yankee, workers are preparing to put the fuel into 60 giant stainless steel canisters, which will be dried out and filled with an inert gas to prevent rust. Each will be loaded into its own giant concrete cylinder, with holes to allow air circulation. Those will go on concrete pads, surrounded by razor wire, motion detectors and armed guards. The casks are licensed for 20 years by the regulatory commission and guaranteed by the builder for 50 years, but their stay at the site could be a lot longer. An application by the manufacture to license the casks for shipping is pending.
The fuel must be loaded into the canisters under water, because in open air, the radiation it gives off would be lethal. But the plan is that after loading, workers will dismantle the pool, so the site will lose the ability to repackage the wastes if something goes wrong with a canister in a few years. 
State officials say the casks may be vulnerable to terrorist attack.

HEADLINE: WOES FOR COMPANY RUNNING SCHOOLS 

BYLINE:  By DIANA B. HENRIQUES and JACQUES STEINBERG 

 BODY:
Edison Schools, the company that pioneered the idea that public schools can be run more effectively by private operators, is facing a financial crisis that could imperil its most ambitious assignment to date -- the takeover of 20 failing schools in Philadelphia -- and hurt its operations nationwide.
Edison has long depended on investors' willingness to overlook its chronic losses and high overhead -- problems that echoed those that plagued earlier business ventures run by its founder, H. Christopher Whittle.
 In the past, Edison, by far the nation's largest commercial operator of public schools, has paid its bills and covered its mounting losses largely by issuing new shares of stock. But now, with its stock price down 85 percent since January, the company is suddenly scrambling to raise enough cash to continue its operations into the next school year. 
 In a conference call scheduled for this afternoon, company executives are expected to present a financing plan intended to reassure investment analysts, educators and parents who have grown skeptical of some of the company's claims about its growth prospects and its academic success. 
Analysts have estimated that Edison needs to raise as much as $40 million before next fall to fulfill the Philadelphia contract and to sustain the schools it already runs, which educate 75,000 children in 22 states.
The recent decline in Edison's share price from more than $20 a share in January to $2.66 at the close of the stock market yesterday makes the sale of fresh shares unlikely.
Borrowing remains an option, but an expensive one. Edison had to pledge $61 million in assets last fall as collateral for a loan of only $20 million. It has paid as much as 20 percent interest on other loans, equivalent to credit card rates. It could still seek an infusion from private investors, help from government or aid from private foundations that look favorably on its mission.
An Edison spokesman, Adam Tucker, declined to comment until after the company's announcement today. Typically, companies do not comment in the days leading up to the disclosure of their quarterly financial results, which Edison will also make today.
Edison's crisis is not the first for Mr. Whittle. His previous business, a media company centered on a controversial TV network for schools, Channel One, fell far short of its investors' expectations and was essentially sold off in pieces by the mid-1990's.
Michael Masch, a vice president at the University of Pennsylvania and one of five members of the state panel overseeing the Philadelphia schools, said he expected that Edison would remain "a going concern."
Nonetheless, he said, the panel has "asked our lawyers how to protect us" in the event that Edison suddenly pulls out of Philadelphia.
Should Edison be forced to retrench, many of the traditional public schools it operates would simply revert to their home districts, though it is not clear what would happen to the curricular materials, computers and other equipment that Edison has installed. An abrupt departure might be more difficult for students and teachers at the public charter schools that Edison runs, which are often independent of any district.
Educators and politicians have long looked to Edison as the acid test for the proposition that an innovative for-profit company, given the same amount of money a school district gets, could produce both better schools and a rich return for shareholders. But it has consistently warned that it cannot make a profit without a critical mass of schools to provide economies of scale.
Much of the recent slide in Edison's stock has been attributed to Wall Street's disappointment that the new Philadelphia contract, announced late last month, gave Edison fewer than half the schools it had projected.
Until recently, Wall Street had been willing to overlook complaints from some educators that Edison was overly generous in calculating the number of schools it ran, in interpreting the test scores at those schools and in comparing its costs with those of schools it competes against. While Edison says that it can operate a public school for less money than a district can, thus turning a profit, it often receives more money than districts spend to educate the same students -- and it still has not made a profit, critics say. 
Across the country in recent days, some of the parents and teachers who are Edison's clients have been tracking the company's market decline with apprehension, worried that classroom life will be disrupted if the company's financial condition continues to deteriorate.
The anxiety has been especially high in Philadelphia, where Edison has less than four months to take over and upgrade 20 schools serving 14,500 students. In the past, according to company records, it has spent about $2,500 for each student in start-up costs at each of its new schools, including money for computers, new textbooks and teacher training.
The steep decline of Edison's stock also raises the question whether Mr. Whittle can retain his dominant stake in the company. According to the company's most recent records, made public in February, he has pledged virtually all his Edison stock to a New York bank as collateral for personal loans. Should he default, the bank, Morgan Guaranty Trust, could take control of his shares.
Mr. Whittle, 54, began his career as a media entrepreneur, gaining attention first as the rescuer of Esquire magazine in the early 1980's and later as the founder of Whittle Communications, which was best known for creating Channel One. While he profited on the sale of Esquire to Hearst Communications in 1986, he was far less successful with Whittle Communications, which was essentially dismantled by the mid-1990's.
It was then that he created Edison Schools, first known as the Edison Project. After luring Benno C. Schmidt Jr. from Yale, where he had been president, Mr. Whittle announced that their new company would build a national network of private schools. When that model proved to be unworkable, the company began seeking contracts to manage existing public schools.
After Edison went public in 1999, its fresh concept and robust growth dazzled a stock market that was inclined to value a company's potential more than its current profits. Edison's revenue grew to nearly $375.8 million last June, from $38.6 million in June 1997. Over the same period, its student enrollment increased to 75,000 from just 7,150.
Edison's expenses, fed by growing overhead at its Fifth Avenue headquarters in Manhattan, have consistently outstripped its revenue, creating cumulative losses that by December exceeded $240 million.
Charting how many schools Edison operates is not quite as straightforward. While the company says that number is currently 136, the company defines a single school by its grade levels. Thus a school that has kindergarten through the eighth grade under the same roof could be counted twice -- as an elementary school and as a middle school.
But until recently, investors and analysts had been optimistic, in part because Edison had been able to point to improving test scores at most of its schools. Critics, however, have noted that comparable improvements often have been recorded at non-Edison schools in the same districts.
Even its most basic claim -- that it can operate schools for less for each pupil than a district can -- is problematic. For one thing, Edison arranges for some of its schools to be subsidized by private charities.
Moreover, while most Edison students are in elementary and middle schools, the company typically charges a district a fee based on the average amount the district spends on all students, including those in high schools -- an amount that is often much higher than the district spends on its elementary and middle schools. Even with this built-in edge, the company has yet to make money.
Edison's financial records, going back to the mid-1990's, show how dependent it has been on investors' willingness to overlook not only its persistent losses but also generous loans to insiders and school board clients, and several unprofitable acquisitions. 
As of last October, it had lent about $12.6 million to corporate officers, most of that to Mr. Whittle and to Mr. Schmidt. By December, it had also lent $82.6 million to various independent charter schools that had hired Edison, up from less than $14 million in June 1999.
Its acquisitions have sometimes been disappointing and difficult to understand. For example, in July 2000 Edison's school construction staff was spun off as Ksixteen, with Edison paying $35,000 for a 35 percent stake and steering new contracts to the new company. A year later, Edison bought the rest of Ksixteen for $260,000 in cash, but that exceeded Ksixteen's identifiable net assets by at least $800,000, perhaps as a result of accumulated losses.
In its conference call today, Edison is expected to report its financial results for the first three months of 2002, the third quarter of its fiscal year. It previously warned that its cash from previous stock sales and borrowed money would be enough to see it through only the current fiscal year, which ends next month.
Its clients around the country, many of which have recently signed five-year contracts, are hoping that this crisis, like so many others in Edison's past, can be resolved.
"If worse comes to worse, we'll take back our schools," said Carlos Garcia, the superintendent of the Clark County schools in Las Vegas, which hired Edison to manage seven schools last fall. "I'd be really disappointed. I'd love to have them several years so we can establish a track record on whether or not they're being successful. It's still too early to judge."

HEADLINE: Arafat Finally Leaves Ramallah, But Avoids Testy Crowd at Camp 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: JENIN REFUGEE CAMP, West Bank, May 13 

 BODY:
Yasir Arafat left Ramallah today for the first time in more than five months, visiting three other West Bank cities ravaged in Israeli military sweeps.
 But it was what he did not do -- stop his motorcade as it left a nearby cemetery to address more than 1,000 Palestinians who waited under a blazing sun in this smashed camp -- that said the most about the obstacles he faces, now that he is free and under renewed international pressure to act against Palestinian violence. 
 Mr. Arafat risked heckling from some critics if he had taken the microphone waiting for him here. But by failing to speak, he angered even some supporters. 
"We didn't expect him to come and turn his back on us," said Abdul Ghani, 27, a vendor in the vegetable market. "We expected him to come, see the destruction and immediately give the order to start rebuilding."
One of Mr. Arafat's top aides insisted that he was unaware of any plan for him to speak, but local residents disputed that claim. Tareq Alghoul, a leader here of Mr. Arafat's Fatah movement, tried to put a bright face on the matter, insisting that the camp's residents understood that his aides had security concerns.
"We would protect him!" interrupted Hussein Hamdan, 45.
Another man, in a white T-shirt, shouted: "Don't give him excuses! The president didn't want to come!"
Traveling by car and borrowed Jordanian helicopter, Mr. Arafat examined damage in Bethlehem, Nablus and the city of Jenin. He assured Palestinians that they were marching inexorably toward their own state, with its capital in Jerusalem.
But as the price for progress toward statehood, the Bush administration has demanded a crackdown on Palestinian violence. Any thoroughgoing crackdown would put Mr. Arafat on a collision course with many Palestinians here. And people in the camp also are impatient with the snail's pace of Palestinian civic reform and economic development.
The Jenin refugee camp has long been a problem for Mr. Arafat as well as for Israel, which said its military operation there had been necessary because the camp had produced 23 suicide bombers. In fact, some Palestinians here contend that Mr. Arafat may have colluded in the Israeli attack, to suppress his own opposition.
Human rights groups have said Israeli soldiers committed abuses here, including using people as shields. The Israeli Army has denied such accusations, and Israel fought off a planned United Nations investigation.
"It doesn't concern me if he didn't come to the camp and shake hands with me," said Sujood Hawashin, a sixth-grader in a blue-and-white striped dress. "He's someone who doesn't let us do operations." That was a reference to Mr. Arafat's call last week for his security forces to block "terror attacks against Israeli civilians."
On a black cord around her neck, peeking out under her lace collar, Sujood wore a medallion bearing a photograph of her 13-year-old brother, Muhammad, who she said had been killed in the fighting here.
Before Israel locked Mr. Arafat into Ramallah in December, he traveled much of the time -- often overseas. But he seldom visited places like this one.
In fact, residents said, he has not been to Jenin since Israel turned the city over to the Palestinian Authority in November 1995. He has not been in the refugee camp, one longtime resident said, since he visited undercover in the 1960's.
"He just remembered us now, after the camp was destroyed?" said one 18-year-old fighter.
As evidence of the tension among Palestinians, a fight broke out after the crowd had all but dispersed through the field of rubble left by Israeli bulldozers.
Earlier, Mr. Hamdan, a sanitation worker and longtime Fatah member, grabbed the microphone to demand that all Palestinians who had not been in the camp while it had been under attack leave the area. Later as the crowd thinned, another Palestinian accosted Mr. Hamdan, argued with him and then drew a pistol and shot him in the thigh. Other gun-waving men rushed in to separate them, as shouting and the bitter smell of gunpowder filled the air.
Last fall, after Mr. Arafat complied with Israeli requests and ordered the arrest in the Jenin camp of Mahmoud Tawalbeh, the local leader of the militant Islamic Jihad organization, violent protests broke out.
Mr. Tawalbeh, who was held south of here in Nablus, eventually escaped when the jail there was attacked by Israel, and he died in the fighting. Many young men here were wearing Mr. Tawalbeh's image today on cords around their necks; no one was seen wearing Mr. Arafat's image.
Palestinian officials have spoken repeatedly of a massacre here, but so far 42 bodies have been buried in a cemetery at the camp's edge, which Mr. Arafat visited today. Most of the dead found so far were gunmen. Israel lost 23 soldiers in the fighting.
After it left the cemetery, Mr. Arafat's convoy passed by the edge of the most devastated area of the camp, where the crowd awaited him. Zuhdi Hijazi, 75, said Mr. Arafat had popped out of a sunroof and made V signs. "I couldn't talk to him -- I just managed to shake hands with him," said Mr. Hijazi, delighted.
In his remarks in the city of Jenin, Mr. Arafat praised the refugees' endurance and called the camp "Jenin-grad," a reference to the siege of Leningrad in World War II.
As they flew off, the two helicopters carrying Mr. Arafat's party banked over the dwindling crowd here, and while some people waved at him, others waved him away.
Nabil Abu Rudeineh, a top aide who accompanied him, said there had apparently been a mix-up. "Maybe some misunderstanding happened," he said. "A group of people were waiting for him -- I don't know why -- nobody here knows anything about it." He added of the camp, "There is no real authority there."
People in the camp, including leaders of Al Fatah, insisted that they had been assured that Mr. Arafat would visit with residents.
"I was disappointed," said Jamal Shati Hindi, a Fatah member of the Palestinian legislative council. "The visit was not implemented the way it was planned in the schedule, and left unpleasant feelings. Why did these people wait for the president in the hot sun? It was a sign of love."
The recent destruction is feeding frustration over Palestinian governance here, though; many residents said assistance had been slow. "I wish I had had a chance to tell him my story," Safiyeh Milhem, 63, said of Mr. Arafat as she stood by the remains of her home. "I was waiting for him since early this morning. I was expecting him to issue an order to start building my house."

HEADLINE: Angola Urged to Trace Its Revenue From Oil 

BYLINE:  By RACHEL L. SWARNS 

DATELINE: LUANDA, Angola 

 BODY:
With more than two decades of fighting seemingly at an end, the Angolan government is facing new pressures to account for its enormous oil revenue and to devote more of its resources to rebuilding this war-shattered country.
 Angola is sub-Saharan Africa's second-largest oil producer and the seventh-largest supplier of crude oil to the United States. Yet 70 percent of the people live in poverty and the hardships have only worsened as oil exports have surged, according to the United Nations and the advocacy group Global Witness. 
 For years, the government has placed the blame for Angola's misery on the bitter civil war that has raged, with few interruptions, since it won its independence from Portugal in 1975. But with a cease-fire signed in April with rebels led by the late Jonas Savimbi, the government is facing increased scrutiny. 
In recent weeks, the United Nations has reported that much of the spending of oil revenue is unaccounted for in Angola's budget.
In addition, Global Witness says $770 million in tax revenue is missing. It cited the Ministry of Petroleum as saying that the government was paid $3.8 billion in taxes in 2000 while the Finance Ministry reported that only $3 billion had been received. The advocacy group fears that the missing money was stolen. The government denies any wrongdoing and says accounting problems are responsible for the gap.
The United Nations office here has not accused Angolan authorities of pocketing public money. But its report, released in March as the rebels and the government were negotiating a cease-fire, made it clear that the United Nations wanted officials to come clean about oil revenue. 
Oil accounts for 90 percent of the country's total exports.
"Donors and observers would like to see how oil income is accounted for and how the government intends to use its proceeds to reverse worsening social trends," the United Nations said in an assessment of Angola's economy.
From 1995 to 2000, oil production surged, to about 750,000 barrels a day from about 650,000, according to the Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm of the United States Department of Energy. In the same period, the percentage of people living in extreme poverty rose to 26 percent from 13 percent, the United Nations says. 
Angolan officials say critics like Global Witness fail to recognize that the government had to spend oil revenue on weapons to defend the country against the rebel group -- known as Unita, the Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola -- which had reneged on a peace deal. 
In April, the government accused Global Witness of trying "to mislead national and international public opinion and to spread lies about the government." 
"The so-called discrepancies found in the fiscal accounts, which organizations such as Global Witness attributed in bad faith to diversion of public funds by government officials, have been shown to be a mere accounting problem regarding resources financed by oil revenues and public expenditures made with those resources," the government said.
Since the cease-fire was signed on April 4, President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and other officials have emphasized their commitment to rebuilding roads, creating jobs and directing more money toward crumbling hospitals and schools. 
"We will have to attend to the physical reconstruction of the country and the traumas caused by war," Mr. dos Santos said in a recent speech. "Transport, communications and energy infrastructure need to be renovated in every sector of the country."
Officials have repeatedly made such promises in recent years as the war has ebbed. But the United Nations, which studied the country's recent budgets, found no evidence of increased spending on social programs over the past three years despite the public pronouncements.
Deeply indebted and desperate for low-interest loans, Angola agreed last year to open its oil accounts to the International Monetary Fund and to redirect its oil revenue from armaments toward rebuilding.
But Western diplomats and I.M.F. officials have expressed great frustration with the government's delays in releasing requested financial data.
"They know that the I.M.F. and some members of the international community are concerned about the way they are using the oil money," Mussagy Jeichande, the United Nations representative to Angola, said in an interview. "They are aware that they need to assign more funds and more assistance to social education and infrastructure."
Mr. Jeichande praised the government for taking responsibility for feeding and housing the demobilized Unita soldiers and their relatives. He said Angola would still require aid to assist people displaced by the war.
Simon Taylor, a director at Global Witness, said the government would probably spend more on development now that the fighting seemed to have stopped. Angola's oil output is expected to exceed one million barrels a day in coming years.
But Mr. Taylor and others think the growing interest in Angolan oil has made some Western officials reluctant to press for greater accountability because they fear risking access to lucrative oil contracts.
About 40 percent of Angola's oil exports go to the United States. Walter H. Kansteiner, a senior State Department official, has urged the government here to be more open about its spending, but Mr. Taylor and others say a tougher stance is needed.
Until officials agree to a public accounting of oil revenue and expenditures, though, it will be difficult to know whether Angola is truly benefiting from its mineral riches.
"They're going to have to deliver something, but are they going to deliver 50 percent of what they could?" asked Mr. Taylor, who is also pressing oil companies to disclose how much they pay Angola.
"Something has to be done to stop that revenue from disappearing," he said. "The state is not putting all that it should into development."

HEADLINE: Baruch to Add 42 Professors And a Dean to Lead Them 

BYLINE:  By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
Baruch College, which is making a strong effort to push its graduate business program into the ranks of the nation's top-ranked business schools, announced yesterday the appointment of a new dean and plans for hiring 42 new full-time faculty members.
 It now has about 150 tenure-track professors. 
 Baruch, which is part of the City University of New York, announced that it had tapped John A. Elliott, 56, an accounting professor and associate dean at Cornell University's Johnson Graduate School of Management, to be the next dean of its Zicklin School of Business. 
The appointment, effective Sept. 1, is subject to approval by CUNY's trustees, who are expected to give it. He will replace Sidney Lirtzman, 70, who will step down in September after seven years as dean.
Baruch also announced that it had hired at least 20 new full-time faculty members, who will start in September. Most are recently minted Ph.D.'s -- including ones from Duke University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and New York University -- who will start as assistant professors.
"To bring the school to a different level of excellence, we had to replace about 40 substitute professors," Dr. Lirtzman said.
Baruch's business program, which accounts for the great majority of the college's students, has changed substantially since its beginning as CUNY's downtown campus, offering accounting and other business programs. Historically, many of its students took classes in the evenings, and many worked full time.
Over the past decade, Baruch has worked to build its undergraduate business program. But since a business school's reputation rests largely on its full-time, daytime program for a master's degree in business administration, Baruch five years ago focused on developing such a program, building it around a small honors program for students who were given free tuition and laptop computers. Since then, Baruch has expanded the program, although it no longer provides free tuition. This year, in fact, it raised full-time M.B.A. tuition for New York State residents to about $6,000 per year from about $4,000, to help pay for new professors.
Matthew Goldstein, then Baruch's president and now chancellor of CUNY, raised about $60 million for the college, much of it from successful Baruch alumni like Lawrence Zicklin, a Wall Street executive, after whom the business school is named.
Today Baruch, the largest business school in the United States, has about 13,500 business students, out of a total enrollment of about 15,000 students. About 2,000 are graduate business students, including 200 in the full-time M.B.A. program.
To make it into the nation's top 25 schools, Baruch will need to continue to upgrade the quality of its students, its faculty and its job placements, Dr. Lirtzman said. He said the plan was to keep the full-time M.B.A. program small, with no more than about 300 students.
Dr. Elliott earned a bachelor's degree in economics and an M.B.A. at the University of Maryland and -- after working in business -- a Ph.D. at Cornell. He said that Baruch's business school was larger than Cornell's, which has about 600 students. He said he was looking forward to returning to a public university, getting to know the 150 existing faculty members, finding a way to be a mentor to the new professors, and helping to recruit 20 more.

HEADLINE: Proposed Deal Could Help Both Retailers' Web Sites 

BYLINE:  By BOB TEDESCHI 

 BODY:
If Sears, Roebuck's planned acquisition of the catalog and Internet retailer Lands' End goes as planned, analysts say, the e-commerce operations of both companies, already among the leaders in their respective online categories, may benefit. 
 "While Sears has been focused on how to tie e-commerce to their stores," said James Crawford, a retail analyst with Forrester Research, "Lands' End is very focused on improving the customer experience online. They'll be very complementary, in that there's not a lot of overlap in what they're trying to do with e-commerce." 
 The Sears Web site ranks third among department store retailers' sites, behind Target's and Wal-Mart's. Sears says its site helped produce $500 million worth of store sales last year, mostly in "hard lines," like appliances and power tools, which require a good deal of research before a customer buys. 
Sears largely abandoned its conventional catalog business in the 1990's and has made its Sears.com Web site more of a marketing medium than a mail-order business. A full 40 percent of the products that Sears sells online are picked up by customers at the stores. 
Lands' End has a reputation for e-commerce innovation, rolling out such offerings as a custom clothing feature that lets customers essentially tailor garments to suit their bodies. Its Web site was responsible for $327 million, or 21 percent, of the company's sales last year, making it one of the few success stories in an online category that has been nearly bereft of good news.
Neither Sears nor Lands' End would comment yesterday on how they would merge their Web operations. But because the two companies have such divergent approaches to e-commerce, analysts said there would be little opportunity to save money by integrating the two. 
According to Michael Petsky, principal of Petsky Prunier, an investment firm in New York that specializes in mergers and acquisitions in the direct marketing industry, Sears essentially shut its internal catalog division in the mid-90's. It has instead chosen to work with "catalog syndication" companies, which actually operate warehouses and fill customer orders, he added. 
So Sears owns little of its own warehouse and distribution capabilities for direct sales through Sears .com and its catalogs, Mr. Petsky said, and it has little in the way of assets to merge with the publishing, warehousing and customer service divisions of Lands' End. 
Sears could conceivably make more money on catalog and Internet sales by handling them internally through the Lands' End distribution system. But Mr. Petsky said such an approach would be difficult, given that the Lands' End system was set up to sell and distribute shirts and trousers, not stoves and tires. 
In the early going, the bigger online beneficiary of the merger will probably be Lands' End, which will be able to market its Web site to Sears.com visitors, to the 130 million customers in the Sears database and to recipients of the 90 million newspaper inserts that Sears distributes each week. 
While many analysts were enthusiastic about the proposed acquisition, some cautioned that the move might be too similar to Federated Department Stores' $1.7 billion purchase of the direct marketer Fingerhut in 1999. That merger quickly ran into trouble, but Fingerhut had problems that Lands' End does not. Fingerhut foundered on a mountain of bad credit card debt, and its low-budget products proved a poor match for Federated, the parent of Macy's and Bloomingdale's. 
Despite such cautionary tales, there will probably be more deals between direct marketers and department stores in the near future, said Mr. Petsky, the analyst. "We're seeing a big uptick in mergers and acquisitions activity, focused on direct marketers," he said. 
Many traditional retailers realized that they could not successfully build Internet and catalog operations of their own, Mr. Petsky said, but they have come to appreciate the wisdom of selling to customers through different channels. And while there have been few Internet retailers worth picking up from the dot-com trash heap, he said, some traditional catalog companies with Web sites, like J. Jill and Spiegel, have generally retained their value.
"Many major marketers," Mr. Petsky said, have the money "to do substantial direct marketing deals."

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Proposes Block Grants To States for Feeding the Poor 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 13 

 BODY:
Five states could eliminate the food stamp program and receive lump sums of federal money to feed poor people in any way they wanted under a new provision of the welfare bill coming to a vote this week in the House of Representatives.
 A similar proposal, part of the House Republican manifesto known as the Contract With America, touched off a furor in 1995. It was dropped from the welfare bill that President Bill Clinton eventually signed in 1996. 
 Under the proposed new demonstration project, five states could receive "block grants" to provide food assistance to needy individuals and families. The states would have broad discretion to set eligibility criteria and the amount of assistance for each recipient, bypassing federal standards that now establish uniform national policies. 
States would apply to the Agriculture Department, which could approve lump-sum grants to each state for a maximum of five years.
Spending on food stamps is closely linked to economic conditions. When unemployment rises, so does the number of food stamp recipients. By contrast, with a block grant, a state would receive a fixed amount of federal money for food assistance, a sum that would not vary with the number of needy people.
The amount of each state's block grant for the next five years would be equal to its food stamp benefits and administrative costs this year, or its annual average from 2000 to 2002, whichever figure was greater.
House members have held no hearings on the proposal. It materialized suddenly on Friday, when Republicans introduced the welfare bill that they plan to take to the floor this week.
Supporters of the grant proposal say if states had more flexibility they could devise innovative food programs, just as they have done with cash assistance. Some state officials said they would like to establish a common set of eligibility criteria and work requirements for food stamps and cash welfare benefits.
The original version of the Contract With America would have repealed the Food Stamp Act of 1977 and consolidated all nutrition programs in a block grant to the states. But lawmakers from farm states, including many Republicans, opposed the idea and insisted that the federal government preserve the food stamp program as the ultimate national safety net for poor people. 
Food stamps thus remain an entitlement program, available to anyone who meets eligibility criteria set by federal laws and regulations.
One of the most outspoken opponents of a block grant for food stamps in 1995 was Pat Roberts, the Kansas Republican who was chairman of the House Agriculture Committee and is now a senator.
Senator Paul Wellstone, Democrat of Minnesota, said today that he would fight the proposed block grant.
"We are a national community," Mr. Wellstone said. "As one country, one people, we have agreed that the nutritional status of poor children will not be left up to an individual county or state."
The proposal for a food stamp block grant apparently originated with a few Republicans on the House Agriculture Committee, which is responsible for food stamps.
Gov. John Engler of Michigan, a Republican, strongly supported the idea in 1995 and still favors it. Susan M. Shafer, a spokeswoman for Mr. Engler, said today: "The block grant would let states tailor food programs so we could better serve our customers. It would give states a chance to achieve the same type of success and flexibility we've had with welfare."
But Representative Eva Clayton of North Carolina, the senior Democrat on the agriculture subcommittee responsible for nutrition programs, said: "This proposal comes as a surprise. It has received no discussion or debate and has been inserted in the welfare bill without any hearings or action by the House Agriculture Committee."
Mrs. Clayton said the idea of a block grant ought to be shelved. 
"The proposal undermines the ability of the food stamp program to respond to economic needs during economic downturns," she said.
Under the proposal, she added, states would be both tempted and allowed to shift money from food assistance to other programs like employment and training.
"This is tantamount to taking food out of the mouths of babes and the elderly," Mrs. Clayton said. 
Major provisions of the 1996 welfare law expire this year. The House Republican bill would reauthorize the program for five years. Most of the bill, including stricter work requirements for welfare recipients, follows Mr. Bush's recommendations.
The president did not propose a block grant for food assistance. But in Chicago today, as he did on Friday in Columbus, Ohio, Mr. Bush said Congress should let state and local officials use their own judgment about how to help needy families. In some states like Ohio, he said, administrative costs account for 25 percent of spending on food stamps.
"With fewer rules and regulations," Mr. Bush said, "a lot of that money would end up going to benefit people."
Under a separate section of the Republican bill, states could receive exemptions from federal laws and rules so they could combine federal programs for low-income people. Those programs include cash assistance, food stamps, public housing, job training, child care, literacy classes and aid to the homeless.

HEADLINE: Reversing Course, Bush Signs Bill Raising Farm Subsidies 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, May 13 

 BODY:
President Bush this morning reversed six years of Republican efforts to wean farmers from huge government subsidies, signing into law a bill that increased those federal payments by at least $83 billion over the next 10 years.
 Mr. Bush signed the bill at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building next door to the White House before traveling here. 
 "It's not a perfect bill, I know that," he told farm state lawmakers. "But, you know, no bill ever is." 
Mr. Bush also said the bill would provide a safety net for farmers "without encouraging overproduction and depressing prices" while giving farmers an opportunity "to plan and operate based on market realities, not government dictates."
Many of his aides, speaking on condition of anonymity, said signing the bill was painful for a president who came to office promoting a government commitment to free markets. But one senior official traveling with Mr. Bush here today said it would have been "political suicide in the November election" to stand in the way of farm-state politicians who demanded huge increases in federal support after years of declining farm prices.
Republicans said in 1996 that the United States would spend far less on agricultural subsidies in coming decades. But the measure Mr. Bush signed into law today increased spending by nearly 80 percent over the cost of existing programs even though the budget deficit this year was likely to exceed $100 billion. 
Mr. Bush called on lawmakers to show fiscal restraint, but the White House, aware that Republican victories in agricultural states could win back control of the Senate, made little effort to scale back the spending in this bill.
While the legislation must be renewed after six years to remain in effect, its estimated 10-year cost is $190 billion. The $83 billion in new spending is part of that cost, which includes increases in payments to farmers who produce wheat and corn and renewals of subsidies for wool, mohair and honey. The 1996 Freedom to Farm bill, pushed through by Republicans at the height of their legislative powers, was intended to limit such payments.
Many Republicans were urging Mr. Bush, up to the last moment, to veto the bill.
"We're stepping backward for farmers in this country," said Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas, one of 28 Senate Republicans who voted against the bill along with seven Democrats. But Senator Brownback is not up for re-election until 2004. Republicans from farm states who are running this year strongly supported the legislation.
"I would love to see him veto it," Senator Don Nickles, Republican of Oklahoma, said on Fox over the weekend. "It is a budget buster."
But other Republicans, including Representative Mike Pence of Indiana, praised the bill.
"The President recognizes the difficulties American farmers face, both from unfair trade barriers in other countries and tough economic times in the United States," Mr. Pence said. 
"This new law will curb the need for ad hoc expenditures, increase funding for conservation programs, reduce payment limitations and enable additional agricultural research," said Mr. Pence, a member of the House Agriculture Committee. "I am confident that this farm bill will provide the necessary resources to keep farmers in Indiana and across America competitive in a global marketplace."
The push for new farm subsidies comes at a time when the administration is pushing European and Asian nations to reduce subsidies to their farmers. 
"He has undercut the United States position greatly," said I. M. Destler, director of the center for security and economy policy at the University of Maryland and one of the country's leading historians of trade negotiations. "Until this year, we would have believed the trend was in the other direction. Now the Europeans will feel that they are no longer the stand-out sinners. The Japanese will feel relieved, and it's hard to imagine how it would be possible to negotiate a new global agreement" opening agricultural markets "at a moment that we are going the other way."
European officials say that the farm bill and Mr. Bush's decision to impose tariffs of up to 30 percent on imported steel suggest that the United States has taken a sharply protectionist turn even as it urges other nations to open up further.
But at the same time, European officials did little to reduce their subsidies in the six years since the passage of the Freedom to Farm bill. Nor did the Japanese. Also Congress passed emergency aid to farmers each year, which Mr. Bush argued today was "a bad fiscal habit." Those payments "created uncertainty for farmers and ranchers, and their creditors," he said.
He added, "The farm bill supports our commitment to open trade and complies with our obligations to the World Trade Organization."
Mr. Bush said the measure he signed into law "is generous enough to eliminate the need for supplemental support later this year and in the future," though farm lobbyists were likely to press for such additional help if prices continued to decline.
The European Union has already said that it is likely to challenge the new subsidies before the World Trade Organization, which has a trade court that adjudicates such disputes. But the new law gives the agriculture secretary, Ann M. Veneman, the power to adjust the subsidies to bring them in line with international agreements.
Under the organization's limits, American farm subsidies are limited to $19.1 billion annually.
Mr. Bush said nothing about the farm bill during his trip today to Chicago, which focused on welfare reform. His top political adviser, Karl Rove, told Republican senators recently that the president had favored a low-profile ceremony, to avoid drawing further attention to the bill, especially among conservatives who believed that it was too expensive and that it violated the party's free-trade principles.
Moments after signing the bill, Mr. Bush announced he would sign a major arms reduction agreement with Russia, news that was certain to reduce attention to the farm bill.
Mr. Bush also attended a fund-raiser for Jim Ryan, the Illinois attorney general who is running for governor.
"When we bring some fiscal discipline to Washington," Mr. Bush assured the audience, the revived federal budget deficits will come down.

HEADLINE: Victim's Father May Be Given Spot on Rebuilding Committee 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki is expected today to appoint the father of a financial analyst who was killed in the attack on the World Trade Center to the board of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, a state official said yesterday.
 Thomas S. Johnson, the chairman of GreenPoint Bank, whose 26-year-old son Scott worked for the investment firm of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, in 2 World Trade Center, was introduced to members of the development corporation's Families Advisory Council yesterday, the official said. 
 GreenPoint Bank is a subsidiary of GreenPoint Financial Corporation, where Mr. Johnson is also chairman and chief executive.
Mr. Johnson will become the only family member of a victim to be named to the 16-member board. His wife, Ann Johnson, is a member of the Families Advisory Council.
Family members of the victims have pushed for representation on the board since it was formed in late November, when several representatives of family groups expressed dismay that they did not have an official voice in the process. The board originally had 11 members, seven of them appointed by Mr. Pataki and four appointed by Rudolph W. Giuliani, who was then mayor.
Officials of the development corporation, a state-city agency charged with overseeing the redevelopment of Lower Manhattan, including the 16-acre site of the former World Trade Center, maintained that the family members were included in the process through the advisory council, whose primary purpose is to advise the planners on the creation of a memorial to the victims.
Last month, the board was expanded to 16, allowing Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to name four of his own representatives, and giving Mr. Pataki an eighth appointee. At the time, family members again complained that they were being excluded, but Mr. Bloomberg said that he wanted to appoint board members with skills critical to the rebuilding process.
Mr. Bloomberg's new appointees were Sally Hernandez-Pinero, a lawyer who was a deputy mayor for economic development under David N. Dinkins; Billie Tsien, a principal at the architecture firm of Tod Williams Billie Tsien & Associates; E. Stanley O'Neal, president and chief operating officer of Merrill Lynch; and Carl Weisbrod, president of the Alliance for Downtown New York, the business improvement district.
Mr. Pataki has not publicly committed to naming a family member to the board as his eighth and final appointee, but he has been interviewing candidates in recent weeks, according to people close to the development corporation.

HEADLINE: NUCLEAR ARMS TREATY: MOSCOW; 
Russia Sees Pact's Virtue As Closer Ties With the West

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, May 13 

 BODY:
The wholesale reduction of strategic nuclear weapons announced today may help sustain the slow-motion momentum of Russia's realignment toward the West, and it may give the architect of that realignment, President Vladimir V. Putin, a marginal political lift at home.
 But beyond the staggering size of the reductions -- 4,000 warheads, give or take a thousand, for each side -- the latest exercise in strategic diplomacy between what used to be two superpowers seemed only to seal the victory of one, the United States. 
 Russia has been downsizing for at least a decade, since the unsustainable Soviet empire fell and took standards of living, population totals and industrial production levels with it. A drastic reduction of nuclear weapons stocks is not just long overdue, Russian experts noted. It is natural in a nation that does not want to take over the world any more, and does not have the economic or military capacity to do so. 
President Bush announced the new arms deal today by declaring that the cold war had been laid to rest. Russia's view is more clear-eyed: what the accord formalizes, at last, is the United States' victory in that war. "We are managing the light of a star which has been dead for 10 years," Dmitri Trenin, a leading foreign policy expert at the Moscow Center of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said in an interview tonight.
Today's announcement lays to rest the last of Moscow's notions that it can be an equal partner with Washington, at least soon, in setting and managing the new world order.
Nobody disagrees that the new arms treaty serves Russia's interests as much as those of the United States, if not more so. Under Mr. Putin, Moscow has utterly rewritten its concept of national security to focus on domestic concerns -- terrorism, narcotics trafficking and so on -- instead of a superpower rivalry that no longer exists. Mr. Putin has also ordered a sweeping reorientation of the military from a global cold war force to one whose mission is largely defensive. Six thousand nuclear warheads are useless to such a military.
Sergei A. Karaganov, deputy director of the Institute of Europe, based in Moscow, and a foreign policy and defense expert, said the mere fact of an agreement was a victory for two nations that, before the global realignment set off by the Sept. 11 attacks, seemed to be drifting apart.
Moreover, he said, Russia comes away with some prizes: the levels to which the warheads of both sides would be reduced are almost precisely what Russian strategists had sought, and the agreement on weapons cuts paves the way for cooperation on other issues -- most notably, curbing weapons proliferation. "I think we're getting a bit more than people could have predicted," Mr. Karaganov said.
Beyond codifying cuts Russia already was pressed to enact, Mr. Putin did overcome American resistance to making the accord a formal treaty. For its part, the White House wore down Russian objections to warehousing deactivated nuclear warheads and launchers, meaning that a share of the so-called stockpile reductions will in fact remain in the arsenal, ready for use.
Russia's other main objection to current American defense strategy -- the creation of a missile defense -- is not directly addressed in the treaty announced today. The two sides are working on a statement on missile defense that could land on the agenda when Mr. Bush meets Mr. Putin in Russia next week.
Perceived or actual American high-handedness toward Russia, from the Bush administration's abandonment of the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty to its criticism of Russia's war in Chechnya, is an article of faith here. Several analysts noted, however, that the agreement said as much about Mr. Putin's strategic vision as it did about his being bested by Washington bargainers.
Former President Boris N. Yeltsin, a staunch pro-Westerner, nonetheless bristled at any suggestion of American encroachment on Russian interests. Mr. Putin, still not a confirmed democrat in Western eyes, has however conceded critical points to the White House in arms control talks, perhaps with an eye on the larger goal of permanently anchoring Russia in the West.
In that view, concessions on methods of counting warheads or erecting missile defenses are a small price for admission to a Western alliance that could well shape global politics for the foreseeable future.
In contrast to previous arms talks, Mr. Trenin said, "the prize is not a concession from the U.S."
"The prize," he continued, "is Russia's integration into the world community which is dominated by the United States."

HEADLINE: NUCLEAR ARMS TREATY: NEWS ANALYSIS; 
Pulling Russia Closer

BYLINE:  By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 13 

 BODY:
The strategic arms reductions that the United States and Russia announced today represent radical cutbacks impossible to even ponder during the cold war, despite the warhead storage issues that remain. 
 But though the nuclear arms reductions are a critical milestone in cleaning up the legacy of the cold war, the treaty that President Bush and Vladimir V. Putin will sign in Moscow marks the beginning of an even larger enterprise, a long-term and difficult program of integrating Russia into the West. 
 It is an undertaking that suffered major setbacks in the first decade after the Soviet collapse.
President Bush and his senior advisers have begun to conceptualize such a program, though strong ideological resistance remains within the administration to giving Russia a genuine role in Western affairs. But if the integration of Russia is successful, it will drag Russia further into Europe than Peter the Great ever imagined when he anchored his empire on the Gulf of Finland with a new capital, St. Petersburg, the city of canals, cathedrals and "white nights," where Mr. Putin will welcome Mr. Bush next week. 
Yet this is still the administration that came into office arguing that Russia simply did not matter anymore. It came into office after a decade in which ceremonies of pomp and high oratory welcomed Russia into the European family only to see it storm out again over NATO's campaign in the Balkans, and NATO's expansion toward Russia's borders.
It has been clear ever since Mr. Bush and Mr. Putin met in Slovenia last June that, to Mr. Bush, Russia matters as an ally against terrorism, a broker for peace in the Middle East and, one day perhaps, a competing source for oil and gas in a time of Middle East crisis.
Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, the first Western leader to take a close look at Mr. Putin, has encouraged Mr. Bush by pressing for a great Russian role in NATO. 
Mr. Bush announced the breakthrough saying, "This treaty will liquidate the legacy of the cold war." 
After that, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell flew off to Reykjavik, Iceland, to make final a separate agreement that would transform Russia into a partial member of the 19-nation NATO alliance. Russia would for the first time, in a "NATO at 20" council, join deliberations on major security issues like the war on terrorism and peacekeeping interventions, though the alliance would preserve control over membership and other core military issues. An earlier attempt to create a NATO council to consult with Russia on NATO decisions failed. 
Beyond NATO, Russia under Mr. Putin has been looking for a pragmatic international role, one that would give its battered economy and industries a chance to compete in Western markets, while also taking up diplomatic tasks that would maintain its prestige as a great power, however tarnished that image has become over the last decade. 
Russia, along with the United States, the United Nations and the European Union, is working to become host to a proposed international conference on the Middle East this summer.
At the United Nations Security Council, Russia, one of the permanent members, is sponsoring the resolution that will call on President Saddam Hussein to open Iraq's borders for the return of a small army of United Nations inspectors searching for weapons of mass destruction.
That is not all. The nuclear legacies of Russia and the United States remain a huge threat if they are allowed to despoil the environment or, worse, fall into the wrong hands. Mr. Bush has gradually discovered that the United States and Russia will have to work jointly on security issues that are in both nations' interests, a number of analysts say. 
"The biggest threat mankind faces is the legacy of nuclear material and the cold war and the whole question of dealing with catastrophic terrorism," former Senator Sam Nunn, soon headed for Moscow himself, said today.
"These are the most essential questions and Russia has to be a player, an important player," Mr. Nunn said. "They have to have a voice in NATO affairs, not a veto, but a strong voice." Russia's economy needs to integrate with Europe's, he said, and "step by step" Moscow needs a role in everything Western. 
A senior administration official indicated today that Mr. Bush and Mr. Putin also plan to issue another document in Moscow, a "broad statement of principles" that will include "language which talks about enhanced cooperation in many areas, to include enhanced cooperation in missile defense activities."
Mr. Bush himself was clearly trying to signal today that the strategic accord was evidence of a profound new beginning with Russia.
"When I sign the treaty with President Putin in Russia, we will begin the new era of U.S.-Russian relationships, and that's important," Mr. Bush said today. "The new era will be a period of enhanced mutual security, economic security and improved relations."
Michael McFaul, a Stanford University professor who has advised the Bush White House on Russia's evolution through the 1990's, said: "I do think Bush is serious about this. He has a straightforward view: Russia was once part of Europe and shall be again."

Maybe the Portrait Will Age
Is LUCIANO PAVAROTTI having his portrait painted for the Metropolitan Opera House?
 The question came up after he skipped something besides the Saturday-night performance of "Tosca." Mr. Pavarotti had been scheduled to receive a lifetime achievement award from the Italian consul general, GIORGIO RADICATI, but bowed out of the ceremony just as he bowed out of the Met, blaming the flu. But the realist painter NELSON SHANKS -- who also received a consular award at the Crestanello Gran Caffe Italiano on Fifth Avenue -- said he expected to start working on a Pavarotti painting this summer. 
 Mr. Shanks, who did the last commissioned portrait of Diana, Princess of Wales, said the Pavarotti painting had been in discussion since the mid-1990's. "I think he's seeing his finish at the Met, so this time it's very serious," Mr. Shanks said.
At the Met, this raised the question -- again -- of Mr. Pavarotti's status. "We don't have portraits hanging of artists who are not retired," a Met spokesman said. "I think he's not retired. They're all saying he's going to continue singing for several years, so at the appropriate time, we would hang it." Mr. Pavarotti's manager, HERBERT BRESLIN, was in Vienna and unreachable, his office said.

The Secret's Out
Days after signing what amounted to a confidentiality agreement, LEONA M. HELMSLEY told all to a reporter from The Wall Street Journal. Now a judge has bared all.
All the documents that were sealed when Mrs. Helmsley settled her lawsuit with PATRICK WARD, the optometrist she brought to New York from Miami in 2000 to run what remained of her real estate empire, have been ordered unsealed by JUSTICE WALTER B. TOLUB of State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
According to Mr. Ward's lawyer, RAYMOND N. HANNIGAN of the firm of Herrick, Feinstein, that includes information about her million-dollar payment to Mr. Ward, who gave back 60 apartments she had sold him for $800,000.
The only people not talking yesterday were Mrs. Helmsley and her spokesman, HOWARD J. RUBENSTEIN, who said, "I've been unable to reach her or her lawyer, so I don't have a comment."

White Hair, Red Carpet
Now, about AL PACINO's hair.
There it was, blond-to-white and spikey-looking. It was enough to make full-time celebrity watchers as well as full-time celebrities do double takes on Saturday at the premiere of the film "Insomnia" at the TriBeCa Film Festival.
On the red carpet, the paparazzi were busy snapping such celebrities as ROBERT DE NIRO, WHOOPI GOLDBERG, BILLY CRYSTAL, MARISKA HARGITAY and EDWARD NORTON. The apparently dateless SALMAN RUSHDIE avoided the flashbulb fusillade by using a non-V.I.P. door.
Just then, ROBIN WILLIAMS screamed: "There's Mr. Pacino! There's Roy Cohn!" (Mr. Pacino is playing Roy Cohn in the HBO production of "Angels in America," directed by MIKE NICHOLS.)
Mr. Williams could not resist playing reporter. He began interviewing the first star he could shove a borrowed microphone in front of -- ANNABELLA SCIORRA, as it happened.
"There's Al Pacino, looking like Billy Idol," he said. "What do you think?"
She delivered a usable sound bite: "He looks like a rock star."
Mr. Pacino knew what the buzz was. "They're talking about it, aren't they?" he said. "I should have looked in the mirror before I left the house."

'Def Poetry' Goes Broadway
In another sign that hip-hop has gone mainstream, RUSSELL SIMMONS will take "Def Poetry Jam" to Broadway for six weeks, beginning Oct. 8. After auditioning hundreds of writers and performers from among hundreds of regulars at poetry slams and in clubs and colleges, he chose nine for the stage version of what fans say is a program that lends a voice to the voiceless and what those less captivated say is open-mike night on steroids. To direct the show, Mr. Simmons, left, has hired STAN LATHAN, the director and an executive producer of a similar poetry series on HBO and of "Russell Simmons's Def Comedy Jam."

Don't Leave Home Without It
MAYOR MICHAEL R. BLOOMBERG just loves his American Express card. He really does. Yesterday, as he welcomed the company back to its corporate headquarters in the World Financial Center, he whipped out three of them -- one gold, one platinum and one a corporate card. And no wonder: Last month, his company, Bloomberg L.P., sent employees an e-mail message saying that the firm was switching to the American Express Corporate Card from Diners Club. And in his first address to the City Council in January, the mayor claimed to be so pleased with American Express -- whose chairman and chief executive, KENNETH I. CHENAULT, is a buddy of his -- that he urged New Yorkers to use Amex and only Amex when they are out stimulating the economy. With Jennifer Steinhauer

HEADLINE: NUCLEAR ARMS TREATY: WASHINGTON; 
Treaty Offers Pentagon New Flexibility for New Set of Nuclear Priorities

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 13 

 BODY:
There is a reason the nuclear arms treaty President Bush plans to sign at the coming Moscow summit meeting is only three pages long. It is intended to provide maximum flexibility to the Pentagon.
 The new accord does not require the destruction of a single missile launcher or warhead. Each side can carry out the reductions at its own pace, or even reverse them and temporarily build up its forces. 
 The only real constraint is that each side must have no more than 1,700 to 2,200 warheads at the end of 2012. At that point, the treaty is set to expire, leaving each side free to have as many weapons as it would like unless the accord is extended. 
"What we have now agreed to do under the treaty is what we wanted to do anyway," a senior administration official said today. "That's our kind of treaty."
In other words, it is a fitting agreement for Pentagon planners who are more concerned about protecting the United States' nuclear options than constraining those of the Russians. It marks a break with traditional approaches to arms control. 
While arms control can be a highly technical enterprise, the logic of the Bush administration's new approach to nuclear weapons treaties is fairly simple. Throughout the cold war, the United States saw arms control as a way to contain the Soviet nuclear threat and constrain Moscow's ability to carry out a first strike.
The Pentagon's big worry was that the Soviet Union would outpace the United States in an arms race in which each side rushed to deploy new missiles and warheads. American defense officials were especially anxious about the Soviets' heavy SS-18 land-based missile, which carries 10 warheads and was code-named Satan by NATO planners. 
That ability gave Washington an enormous stake in arms agreements that had strict provisions mandating weapons cuts and that forced the Russians to give up their most threatening weapons. Negotiating a ban on land-based missiles with multiple warheads like the SS-18 was a top priority for the first Bush administration.
With the end of the cold war and the collapse of the Soviet military, however, the Pentagon has a very different set of priorities. The Pentagon is counting on Russia's beleaguered economy to force a contraction in the Russian nuclear arsenal. Its primary goal now is not to constrain the Russian nuclear force but to maintain its own flexibility in planning the American one.
The Pentagon's new philosophy was spelled out in its classified Nuclear Posture Review. That study called for reducing the United States arsenal to the level of 1,700 to 2,200 -- precisely the limit that the new treaty says the two sides must reach by the end of 2012. According to the study, the planned force will consist of 14 Trident missile-carrying submarines, 500 Minuteman III land-based missiles, 76 B-52H bombers and 21 B-2 bombers. 
Even that force, the Pentagon says, may not be sufficient given an uncertain world or what the Pentagon prefers to call "potential contingencies." If relations with Russia or China worsen, administration officials say, the United States may need to expand its nuclear arsenal quickly. 
President Bush may talk about building relations with a new Russia that is no longer an adversary, but the agreement he plans to sign is intended to keep open Washington's option to expand its nuclear arsenal if relations with Moscow sour.
Under the agreement, for example, the Pentagon expects to reduce its arsenal gradually so that it shrinks the strategic nuclear force from around 6,000 warheads today to 1,700 to 2,200 at the end of 2012, a significant cut. But if tensions rose with Moscow or China, the United States could suspend the reductions for a few years or even increase the arsenal without violating the treaty.
"In the event that U.S. relations with Russia significantly worsen in the future, the U.S. may need to revise its nuclear force level and posture," the Pentagon said in its nuclear review. 
The United States is under no obligation to extend the treaty when it lapses after 10 years. The agreement also contains an escape hatch: each side can withdraw on three months' notice. That is half the amount of time required to withdrawn from the Antiballistic Missile Treaty of 1972.
Nor is there any link in the treaty to the issue of missile defenses, as Moscow once insisted. 
To obtain such a degree of flexibility, the Bush administration had to make concessions. The accord will be legally binding, as the Russians have insisted. Bush administration hard-liners initially resisted doing even that, but Russia wanted a binding accord to make the nuclear balance more predictable and put some limits on the Americans.
"The Russians got a treaty, and the U.S. got its flexibility," said Ivo Daalder, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. "The U.S. can go down when it wants to, and it can go back up when it needs to. That is what Bush set out to accomplish in his new nuclear policy." 
Because the Bush administration insisted on maximum flexibility in planning its arsenal, it also had to allow Moscow the freedom to plan its strategic forces. As a result, the Russians will be free to deploy new land-based missiles with multiple warheads, such as the three-warhead version of the SS-27, and to keep old ones like the SS-18.
The ban on land-based missiles with multiple warheads, which President Bush's father so actively promoted as a way to eliminate the most destabilizing weapons, has essentially been cast aside.
It is cheaper to put several warheads on a missile than to build a missile for each warhead. So this gives Moscow a cost-effective way to maintain its nuclear arsenal -- or expand it should the United States field an effective missile defense. 
That point has not been lost on some of the skeptics. Mr. Daalder observed, "Maximum flexibility is a two-way street."

 BODY:
The burgeoning federal deficit, coupled with new spending for defense and homeland security, will soon put health care, education and other social programs in a serious squeeze. Yet this crunch can be eased if America's richest nonprofit groups distributed more of their money now instead of saving for the future. They could provide America with some $20 billion more a year to spend on urgent social needs.
 As a nation, we've made a huge investment in nonprofit organizations. People who give to charity get a write-off, and charities pay little or no tax on their income. The tab for these subsidies comes to roughly $50 billion a year -- more than all federal aid to education combined. We grant these incentives to boost giving for good causes, and in one sense the strategy has worked. Personal charitable contributions, driven by a strong economy, rose 87 percent in the last decade, to top $150 billion in 2000. Foundations and other endowed nonprofit organizations (primarily universities) now control almost $1 trillion in investment assets. 
 Yet these organizations generally distribute only 5 percent of their financial assets each year, a sum well below the income generated by their investment returns -- which averaged more than 12 percent over the last decade. These returns, along with new contributions, have allowed nonprofit groups of all types to increase the size of their endowments dramatically. Assets held by charitable foundations, for example, grew from about $140 billion in 1990 to almost $490 billion at the end of the decade.
To be sure, large endowments burnish a group's reputation and enable it to deal with future problems. But these organizations should be judged by their achievements, not by their endowments. Their current strategy is especially harmful today, when some 13 million children live in poverty, nearly 41 million Americans have no health insurance and many urban schools are failing. The decision by nonprofit groups to increase their endowments in the face of these needs suggests that for some, the endowment has become an end in itself.
Perhaps nonprofit executives can learn some lessons from their counterparts in the for-profit sector. In business, managers decide whether to make an investment based on how much it will earn and how quickly it will earn it. Future returns are discounted -- that is, treated as less valuable than those earned this year. Discounting quantifies the common-sense notion that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow.
Consider a foundation with $1 million. Each year it invests in stocks and bonds and disburses 5 percent of its assets in grants. If the foundation has typical costs and investment returns, the initial $1 million will result in more than $6 million in grants over a 50-year period. But because the money is distributed over time, the present value of those grants -- assuming an annual discount rate of 13 percent -- will be only about $600,000.
The foundation's impact is thus diluted by the decision to distribute its funds slowly. (Corporate foundations tend to recognize this and on average paid out at a higher 18 percent rate in 2000.) The current disbursement practices of most endowed nonprofit groups leave too many good causes short of funds each year.
Charity can never replace government: the need is too great. But just as we scrutinize how corporations and governments manage their resources, it is fair to ask if nonprofit groups are managed in ways that maximize social benefit and merit their enormous tax subsidies. Faster disbursement rates could not only help offset the temporary shift in our fiscal priorities, but also promote new notions of nonprofit stewardship.

PERSON: Joseph Lowenbach Steiner 

HEADLINE: Joseph L. Steiner, 95, a Founder Of a Well-Known Toy Maker 

BYLINE:  By MARCIN SKOMIAL 

 BODY:
Joseph Lowenbach Steiner, a co-founder of the company that made toys like the Bubble Rocket and the Easy-Bake Oven, died on Saturday at a hospital in a suburb of Cincinnati. He was 95.
 Mr. Steiner was born in Baltimore and was raised in Cincinnati. He obtained a bachelor's degree in economics at Harvard. After a brief stint in the office of budget at the State Department, Mr. Steiner returned to Cincinnati in the early 1940's to work in a business with his brothers. 
 In 1946, Mr. Steiner, with his brothers, Philip and Albert, and a nephew, Robert, founded Kenner Products in Cincinnati as a soap, flavoring and extract business.
The founders' research into bubbles led to their first toy, the Bubble Matic, a gun that shoots streams of soap bubbles. The toy led to the development of the Bubble Rocket, which sold over a million units in the company's second year.
"Homegrown talent and homegrown ideas accounted for much of the company's success," a nephew, Corky Steiner, said.
Joseph Steiner took charge of the company's sales and marketing. He had traveled extensively throughout the country, promoting and selling Kenner toys. He also made trips to Europe, where he sought to license European products as well as to license Kenner's products to European toy manufacturers.
During a trip to England, Mr. Steiner met Denys Fischer, who invented a toy that used circular templates and color pens to create intricate designs. Mr. Steiner talked his brothers and nephew into licensing the Spirograph and the company introduced it in 1967. The toy became one of the best sellers in Kenner's history.
Throughout the 1960's, Kenner created toy versions of adult activities like the Easy-Bake Oven and the Close'n Play phonograph.
The company was acquired by General Mills in 1967. Mr. Steiner and his two brothers retired in 1971 by agreement with General Mills. Robert Steiner remained with the company as president, retiring a year later. Kenner was a division of General Mills until it was spun off in 1985.
Mr. Steiner is survived by a son, John Albert Steiner of Boulder, Colo.; two grandchildren, Elizabeth and Michael; and three nephews, Corky Steiner of Cincinnati, Robert L. Steiner of Washington, and Rick Steiner of Cincinnati.

HEADLINE: MANHATTAN: RETAIL SPACE; 
Rent Report Cites Signs of Rebound, Even Downtown

BYLINE:  By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
The amount of retail space available in Manhattan declined slightly from the end of September to the end of March, to 11.2 million square feet from 11.3 million, while the overall average rent being asked per square foot increased by $3, to $87 a square foot a year from $84, a Real Estate Board of New York survey shows. 
 Compared with a year previously, however, the average rent being asked in Manhattan was significantly lower. On March 31, 2001, the figure was $98 a square foot, and 10.6 million square feet were available. The board's semiannual report, based on the findings of 17 realty companies that surveyed 2,118 stores available for rent throughout Manhattan, is to be released today. 
 The September-March increase occurred even as the rents sought declined downtown, which means south of Canal Street. Retail activity there was mainly in the World Trade Center's shopping mall, according to the Real Estate Board.
Despite the destruction and fear engendered downtown by the attacks, the decline in the rents being asked through March of this year was only $2 a square foot less than the $60 a square foot that downtown stores had sought at the end of last September. The asking price reported on March 31, 2001, was also $60.
But signs of improvement downtown abound, the report said. Downtown stores that had been open six days a week are now open seven days. One participant in the survey said that retail activity was stronger south of Wall Street than it was a year ago. Another participant reported 550 inquiries for a retail space available downtown. All survey respondents were cited anonymously.
"Notwithstanding 9-11, that extraordinary event didn't signal a long-term downturn," said Ben Fox, the executive vice president of Newmark New Spectrum Retail and a member of the Real Estate Board's stores committee advisory group. "There is still a vibrant population downtown, and the increase in tourists wanting to visit the site of the terrorist attacks is a positive for retail." While some major cities have many empty stores in prime areas, he added, "you don't see that anywhere in New York."
In addition to downtown, the other areas covered by the survey were the East Side (60th Street to 96th, Fifth Avenue to the East River), Midtown (31st Street to 59th Street), Midtown South (Canal Street to 30th Street), Upper Manhattan (97th Street and higher, Fifth Avenue to the East River; 111th Street and higher, west of Fifth Avenue to the Hudson River) and the West Side (60th Street to 110th Street, Hudson River to west of Fifth Avenue). 
Other than downtown, the West Side was the only other neighborhood where the rents being asked at the end of March were even fractionally less than at the end of last September. They were $91, down from $92.
"The significant variations within each market mean that overall figures for available space and asking rents can't, by themselves, provide a truly detailed portrait of the retail market," said Steven Spinola, the president of the Real Estate Board. To supplement the numerical information in the report, the survey also contains data compiled from a summary of brokers' insights and their accounts of submarkets. 
The average asking rent this spring for ground floor space varied greatly according to location and size. On Madison Avenue between 57th Street and 67th, it was $170 a square foot for 385 square feet and $800 a square foot for 2,800 square feet. The rent sought in Times Square on Broadway between 42nd Street and 47th Street ranged from $70 a square foot for 320 square feet to $600 for 21,000 square feet. And on Fifth Avenue between 48th and 59th Streets, the asking price was $120 a square foot for 1,689 square feet and $500 for 20,000 square feet. 
While brokers have usually provided the rents being sought to the Real Estate Board, they have not done the same for the actual rents.

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE; 
Warehouse Vacancy Rates Are Up as Rents Fall

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL BRICK 

 BODY:
Out on the western edge of St. Cloud, Minn., there is a 1.1 million-square-foot box, put there in part because the city is not much farther from any one big coastal American city than from any other. It was built for the single purpose of gathering baseball bats and sofas and coffee makers and all manner of goods together in one place, where they could be packaged into made-to-order bundles and sent out to the homes of customers.
 The structure's interior is completely automated, with racking systems, conveyer belts, scales and bar-code scanners -- $7.5 million worth of improvements in all to a plot of land worth less than $600,000. The use of technology was appropriate for the owner, the Fingerhut Corporation, an e-commerce unit of Federated Department Stores Inc. that is headed for liquidation after talks to sell the business fell through last week. The company also has warehouses in Spanish Fork, Utah, and Piney Flats, Tenn. 
 They are prized assets, but they could be difficult to sell. 
The warehouse industry is in a slump all over the country, with vacancy rates rising to 9.9 percent nationwide at the end of the first quarter from 7.5 percent in the quarter a year ago, according to Cushman & Wakefield, the real estate brokerage and services company. In the corresponding period, annual asking rental rates have fallen to $5.75 a square foot from $6.16. 
Some of the most stagnant property listings in the portfolios of real estate brokers -- although probably accounting for less than 1 percent of all warehouse space, brokers and analysts said -- are the facilities used by all the vanquished rivals of Amazon.com.
"Kind of a double whammy when the bottom fell out was that these e-commerce companies had built and leased not only big buildings, but big buildings with specialized equipment," said James L. Dieter, executive managing director of the United States industrial group at Insignia/ESG, a commercial real estate services company.
While e-commerce companies owned and leased a negligible amount of warehouse property in the overall market, they helped alter the way companies approach storage and delivery. They shuffled priorities for industrial space in an evolution that was helped along by advances in logistics technology and a shift toward reliance on delivery by third parties. 
In the current market, landlords are making plans based on their contrasting views of the way companies will reset their priorities for warehouse space in the future, at the same time those companies are re-evaluating storage and transportation strategies and making few leasing or purchase deals. Though the pace of construction has quickly diminished, speculative building has glutted the market nationwide, and vacancy rates are rising and rents falling as companies cut costs in a soft economy, and as they tinker with delivery patterns.
In the nationwide industrial real estate market, 17.1 million square feet of space have been completed so far this year, according to Cushman & Wakefield. Of that amount, warehouse space accounted for 14.4 million square feet, and the other categories -- high-tech, manufacturing, office service and other -- accounted for more than 2.7 million square feet. Cushman estimates that the total amount of existing industrial space is 7 billion square feet, including 4 billion square feet of warehouse space.
"We got a tremendous amount of vacancy from overbuilding," said Thomas T. Lynn, executive vice president in the Dallas office of the Staubach Company, a real estate services concern. He attributed the continued pace of construction, even as the state of the economy declined, to "the herd mentality of developers. It was working, just like in the 80's, buildings were being built, and they were being leased."
Owners that are seeking to fill empty space are resorting to incentives that include waiving payment for part of the lease term.
"We are starting to see free rent, which we haven't seen in many years," said David R. Kahnweiler, president of Colliers Bennet & Kahnweiler, a corporate real estate company in Chicago.
Investment firms suggest that the sluggishness presents an opportunity. A new draft report by Laler DeCosta II and Steve Walker of Lend Lease Real Estate Investments makes the case that "investing in mature locations in the biggest industrial markets is a strategy for success, even if the most contemporary product is unavailable."
Whether investors accept that depends on their view of how companies will adjust their inventory patterns. And there are development companies and property owners to represent nearly every view.
"There is going to be net less demand for warehouse space, particularly warehouse space for storage," said Hamid R. Moghadam, chief executive of the AMB Property Corporation, an industrial real estate investment trust based in San Francisco that owns more than 900 buildings.
Mr. Moghadam's company lost more than $20 million investing in Webvan, an online grocer that closed last summer. Their warehouses were retrofitted with 100-foot-long computerized lazy susans and other high-technology modifications. On pure property though, Mr. Moghadam said his company his come through the experience well because the three facilities ABM still owns that it once leased to Webvan are small and close to city centers, characteristics he thinks companies will find desirable as they shift storage and delivery patterns. He has told investors that two of the facilities have new tenants.
Trammell Crow has a different view, one that includes a vision of an eventual need for millions of square feet of new warehouse space. Burned in the last slump by its holdings in land, the company has concentrated on structuring joint development agreements to keep all but about 20 of the 1,000 acres on which it intends to build warehouses sheltered from the balance sheet. The company is waiting until the properties can be leased before building.
In contrast, ProLogis owns 1,600 acres around the country, enough to develop 32 million square feet of warehouse space. The company's strategy is based on the same belief held by Mr. Moghadam, that companies will keep shrinking rather than increasing the amount of space they use, but that they will simultaneously shift to different, smaller facilities. That prospect would seem to leave developers with the same problem of too much space.
"Not if you're gaining market share," said John W. Seiple, the company's president. He said ProLogis is holding so much land, a gambit that seems to simultaneously contradict his stated agreement with AMB and ignore the worries about land ownership and interest payments expressed by Trammell Crow, because the land is a resource needed to fill new demands.
Building only for committed tenants did little to protect the industrial developers from the most recent downtown in the economy.
"When landlords underwrote facilities as single tenant facilities in an obscure location, they were really underwriting the tenant's credit as opposed to the asset itself," said Gregory Whyte, a managing director of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter who is responsible for covering commercial real estate investment trusts.
Some developers said they would refuse to build for tenants in particular industries, like e-commerce. This has not proven to be a perfect fix. In Mira Loma, a suburb of Los Angeles, there is a 750,000-square foot building outfitted like the Fingerhut warehouse in St. Cloud. ToysRUs.com put in expensive conveyer systems but never moved in, and the landlord had to find a new tenant. That new tenant, which moved in less than 18 months ago, is Kmart, a traditional retailer that has since filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 and is reorganizing.

HEADLINE: California Governor Seeking Tax Increase to Cut Shortfall 

BYLINE:  By BARBARA WHITAKER 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 14 

 BODY:
After months of saying he had no intention of raising taxes, Gov. Gray Davis announced a revised budget today to reduce a $23.6 billion shortfall with the help of far-reaching spending cuts and tax increases.
 The deficit outlined by Mr. Davis, a Democrat who is up for re-election in the fall, is almost twice the figure predicted in January and equals one-third the $80 billion general budget. Mr. Davis attributed the shortfall to the decline in the stock market and the economic repercussions of Sept. 11. 
 Officials attributed much of the difference to a $19 billion drop in revenues since January 2001, some 90 percent of which was said to have come from a falloff in capital gains and stock options.
To make up for the loss, the budget for the 2002-2003 fiscal year, beginning on July 1, calls for $7.6 billion in cuts, including steep reductions in health programs and aid to local governments. 
Mr. Davis also proposed temporarily increasing vehicle license fees, which have been reduced to a third of 1998 levels and increasing cigarette taxes. In addition, he called for borrowing $4.5 billion against money that the state expects to collect from its settlement in 1998 with tobacco companies.
Republican legislators, whose support will be necessary to garner the two-thirds votes necessary to pass the budget, have warned the governor against raising taxes to balance the budget and criticized him for spending too much.
"We don't have a deficit because car owners have done something wrong," State Senator James L. Brulte, the Republican minority leader in the Senate, said. "And doubling the car tax, penalizing working Californians, simply because Gray Davis is a big spender, we don't think makes a lot of sense."
Mr. Davis defended his performance, telling reporters: "The problem is not spending. The problem is lack of revenue, given the decline in the performance of stock market. That is the heart of the problem."
He said that education remained his top priority and that he was able to meet the financing requirements of Proposition 98, which guarantees minimum levels of financing for education. The budget provides financing for enrollment growth for 80,000 students and cost-of-living adjustments for schools, as well as increasing per-pupil spending, to $7,183 from $6,618.
The budget includes $672 million for health care coverage for every eligible child, a total of 624,000 children by the end of June 2003.
For the first two years of his administration, Mr. Davis benefited from large surpluses and was able to cut taxes. But those surpluses slipped away along with the dotcoms and amid the energy crisis. The revised budget was based on April tax receipts, which were far below forecasts.
The last time that the state confronted such dire circumstances was when the shortfall reached $14 billion in 1991, an era of extensive layoffs in the aerospace industry. 
"Closing this budget gap has been an extremely difficult process," Mr. Davis said. "But the people of this state elected me for exactly this reason, to make the tough decision, and that's exactly what I've done."
The tax issue, however, is expected to lead to intense struggles as lawmakers review the plan. Under state law, the Legislature has to send a budget to the governor by June 15, a deadline that is unenforceable, however, and not frequently met.

HEADLINE: Abortion Clinic Wins a Round In a Fight Over Its New Home 

BYLINE:  By PAUL ZIELBAUER 

DATELINE: BRIDGEPORT, Conn., May 14 

 BODY:
A clinic that performs abortions mostly for low-income women won an important if technical victory this evening in its efforts to relocate after the city's Zoning Board of Appeals refused to hear a last-ditch argument against the move by two Democrats on the City Council.
 That refusal means that the clinic, the Summit Women's Center, which opened at its new site on Main Street this morning after 25 years downtown, will stay open as it fights further appeals and possible legal action by the council members' lawyer. 
 In January 2001, the city condemned the Middle Street building from which Summit had leased space to make way for a new courthouse. But John M. Fabrizi, the Council's president, and Councilwoman Josephine Covino said they learned of the move to Ms. Covino's district only in late March, after the deadline to appeal had passed. The two officials, both Democrats, said they opposed the clinic's new location because anti-abortion demonstrators would hurt other businesses in the area and create a safety problem for the clinic's clients and neighbors. 
But tonight, the zoning board's chairman, Richard Bepko, noting the tardiness of their appeal, refused to listen to Mr. Fabrizi or his lawyer, Raymond Rizio, saying, "You're too late."
Mr. Rizio said later that he planned to change tactics by contending that the city had approved Summit's new building based on "material misrepresentations" of fact by its owner, David Lipton, and his lawyer, who dismissed the allegations as a ploy.
The clinic's move had clearly become political, with bipartisan support for it coming in letters and speeches from United States Representative Christopher Shays, a Republican from Bridgeport; Richard Blumenthal, the Democratic state attorney general; both leading Democratic candidates for governor; and several Republican and Democratic mayors and first selectmen from neighboring towns. 
Although the board's refusal to hear out Mr. Fabrizi tonight provided some breathing room for Summit and its low-income patients, the continuing dispute over its zoning permit will certainly not end the weekly protests and decades of recriminations between those on either side of the abortion debate.
"We are outraged that the center has moved and continues to operate," said Joseph McAleer, the spokesman for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Bridgeport. He said Friday morning prayer vigils outside the clinic would continue at the new location. "We pray that the clinic will close, and we pray that pregnant women will realize that they have an alternative, namely adoption."
Mr. Lipton, who owns five other abortion and gynecological clinics in Hartford, Atlanta, Detroit and Alabama, welcomed a chance to move. Because the old clinic had no private entrance, protesters routinely clogged the sidewalk beside the clinic's door, shouting down or pleading with pregnant women, many of them escorted from their cars by volunteer protectors.
The new clinic, in the heart of an old but prosperous business district, occupies a two-story office building with a private, fenced-in parking lot and mirrored yellow windows.
In late March, when Summit's plans to move became public, Operation Save America, a national anti-abortion group, began organizing loud protests outside the clinic's old offices.
On April 3, the two council members filed an appeal protesting the move because, they said, the clinic did not have the proper zoning permit to perform surgical procedures like abortions. But, as Jennifer Jaff, a lawyer for the clinic, pointed out, state law exempts clinics that do not keep patients overnight. 
Summit doctors perform about 100 abortions a month, using five-minute surgical outpatient procedures, Mr. Lipton said. If the clinic closed, he said, low-income women who rely on Medicare or Medicaid would be forced to travel to Stamford or New Haven to have abortions.
This afternoon, Mr. Fabrizi admitted his appeal was based on only a technicality to keep Summit from opening in the new neighborhood, just a few blocks from the diocese's headquarters. He said his real reasons for opposing the clinic's move had to do with the negative economic and public safety consequences of moving an abortion clinic into a business district that was bound to suffer from the throngs of protesters.
"This is a very vibrant, strong, busy retail area," he said. "X amount of times a week you have to put a dozen cops out there." He said he would rather see the clinic "in a much, much less densely populated, less high-profile commercial area."

HEADLINE: Downtown Families Eligible for More Housing Aid 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
Families living in Chinatown and Little Italy will be eligible for housing assistance grants of up to $750 more than previously proposed under a revised plan that is expected to be announced today, state officials said yesterday.
 The revision in the housing aid plan by the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation increases to $1,750 the amount available to families in the area, which extends north from Canal Street to Delancey or Kenmare Streets and east from Lafayette Street to the East River. 
 The new benefit is similar to those already proposed for Manhattan residents who live below Canal Street. Households with at least one child under the age of 18 that have committed to remain in the area for at least one year will receive a $750 family bonus. In addition, as previously proposed, a $1,000 grant per household is available for residents who lived in the area on Sept. 11. 
The proposed revision is included in a $300 million assistance plan for people and businesses affected by the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center on Sept. 11. The final version of the plan was forwarded to the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development for approval this week, state officials said.
Sheldon Silver, the State Assembly speaker whose district includes Lower Manhattan, pushed for the changes, which were also supported by Gov. George E. Pataki, officials said. 
State officials also said the development corporation would allow owners of residential buildings in Lower Manhattan to increase rents charged to residents who receive the grants, in some cases to levels above what was charged for those apartments before Sept. 11.
The development corporation also agreed not to withhold from grants offered to Battery Park City residents the equivalent of any benefits they receive from the Battery Park City Authority related to Sept. 11. Some residents have been withholding payments due to the authority while they seek compensation for changes in the value of their apartments related to the disaster. The development corporation had previously proposed offsetting any negotiated benefits from the grants awarded to those households.

HEADLINE: Census Shows Bigger Houses And Incomes, but Not for All 

BYLINE:  By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 14 

 BODY:
The celebrated prosperity of the 1990's brought a surge in the size and values of homes and in family incomes, according to new Census Bureau statistics covering 13 states, including California, Illinois, Indiana, Washington and Wisconsin. Many more Americans earned college and graduate degrees, and the incomes of the elderly jumped about 60 percent. 
 But the data, covering 75 million people, or more than a quarter of the United States population, indicate that the decade's prosperity bypassed many Americans. 
 The poor gained little. Following the overhaul of the welfare system six years ago, poverty among single mothers with young children declined. But poverty among all families remained largely unchanged from its 1980 and 1990 levels, an average of 8 percent in the 13 states. To be deemed poor, a family of four in 2000 had an income less than $17,600. 
Most women's incomes rose in the decade, but men's stagnated or fell. 
"Some people did really well," said Annabel Kirschner, chairwoman of the department of rural sociology at Washington State University in Pullman. "Other people did not." Along with the poor, she said, unskilled workers fared poorly, with wages failing to keep up with the rate of inflation.
The demographic shifts disclosed today show up in the Census Bureau's so-called long form, a list of 53 questions that about one in six households nationwide filled out to supplement the less detailed Census 2000 short form, the results of which were published last year. The long form treats many issues the other did not, like income, education, home value, ancestry and divorce. 
Today the bureau released long-form data for Alaska, California, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Oregon, Montana, Wisconsin and the Dakotas. Last week it released data for Mississippi, Nevada and Washington. Data for other states will be released over the next three weeks. New York's and New Jersey's are due on Monday. 
According to the data covering the 13 states, the typical home grew in size to 5.3 rooms, from 5.1 rooms. The numbers of married people declined. The numbers of divorced people rose 30 percent, to nearly five million. Median home values surged past $100,000 in all but Mississippi and the Dakotas. Million-dollar homes sprang up around all major cities. Immigration, which the long form broke down into richer detail about origin and current residency than the first report, reached levels that altered the character of cities.
"In round numbers, two-thirds of our population growth in the 1990's was foreign-born, and two-thirds of that was Hispanic," said Max Dieber, director of research services at the Northeastern Illinois Planning Commission in Chicago.
In California, a longstanding immigration trend reversed course. The number of people moving to the state from other countries and elsewhere in the United States slowed sharply, said Andrew Reppenstein, a demographer at the state census data center in Sacramento. "California is again a state where a majority of the residents were born in the state," Mr. Reppenstein said. 
The statistics do not differentiate the decade's biggest winners -- people with large stock market gains and million-dollar salaries -- from those who were struggling just above the poverty line. Reports to be released in the fall should clarify those distinctions, but analysts today said there was little doubt that working-class Americans saw few gains for themselves.
Government programs moved low-skilled workers away from dying industries and into manufacturing jobs in new technology industries, said George Hough, demographer at the Center for Population Research and Census at Portland State University. But he said those new jobs typically paid an average of $15,000 a year. "That puts them above the poverty line," Mr. Hough said. "But what's $15,000 going to get you?"
A wide gap between the incomes of working men and women narrowed in the 1990's, the statistics show. Women's earnings rose in all 13 states except Alaska. But stagnant and declining men's wages contributed to the narrowing, too.
"This is an irritation for both groups," said Andrew Beveridge, a demographer and sociology professor at Queens College and a consultant to The New York Times, who compared 1990's and 1980's data. 
Demographers and sociologists explain that many men lost high-paid industrial and mining jobs in the 1990's. In Washington, for example, men lost thousands of logging jobs in communities where unemployment rates subsequently soared. At the same time, more and more women went to college and qualified for higher-paying jobs. For Washington men working full time, incomes barely rose, with inflation taken into account, to $40,687 a year from $40,267. In contrast, women's wages rose to $30,021 from $26,745, narrowing the gap between men's and women's wages to 26 percent less for women from 34 percent. 
In other states the gap showed similar changes. In Illinois, women earned 30 percent less than men in 1999, compared with 35 percent less in 1989. 
As a result of more women in the work force, median family incomes rose, typically about 10 percent, to more than $50,000 a year in most of the states. One exception was California. There, the number of women working full time slipped to 51.3 percent from 53.4 percent, and the median family income rose only $385 in 10 years, to $53,025. 
Mr. Beveridge's calculations also show that poverty levels hardly changed over two decades, even though the welfare overhaul moved the largest group of those on welfare -- single mothers -- into the work force. Percentages of families deemed poor were roughly consistent with the percentages of those on welfare -- about 8 percent in the 13 states. One state showing a clear decline in poverty was the poorest of the 13, Mississippi. There, 16 percent of families fell below the poverty line, down from 20 percent in 1990. 
For the better-off, middle-class, home-owning Americans, mortgage payments typically grew more than incomes. In Illinois, the median income grew 14.8 percent in two decades, Mr. Beveridge's analysis shows, while mortgage payments grew 38.7 percent. 
For those over 65, however, incomes grew, in part because Social Security payments are tied to inflation and in part because of stock market gains they were able to reap. As a result, poverty among the elderly dropped in nearly all the states. In Indiana, for example, poverty in this group dropped from 10.7 percent in 1990 to 7.7 percent in 2000; in Washington, it dropped from 11.3 percent to 9.5 percent.

HEADLINE: For China's Wealthy, All but Fruited Plain 

BYLINE:  By CRAIG S. SMITH 

DATELINE: PINGHU, China 

 BODY:
Li Qinfu, snapping his fingers to emphasize the points he is making, races his purple Lamborghini toward what looks like the United States Capitol rising above the canola fields south of Shanghai.
 As he turns into the manicured grounds surrounding the domed marble building, a slightly smaller copy of Washington's own, he points to the pinnacle. There, instead of the original's Statue of Freedom, stands an 18-foot, three-ton bronze likeness of himself, right hand raised as if beckoning to the future. 
 "It would have been too dangerous to cast the hand waving with the palm turned out," he said, referring to the gesture that is still reserved for statues of Mao here.
Mr. Li, at 40 one of China's wealthiest private businessmen, is well aware of the suspicion with which the new super-rich are regarded here and of the symbolism of his politically inspired edifice and effigy high in the air. 
While the Communist Party publicly embraces capitalists these days, inviting them in a controversial decision last July to join the party, it is still trying to restrain the emergence of a wealthy class.
The party worries that the disparity between rich and poor is potentially dangerous in a country where, according to Lu Zhiqiang, a senior government official addressing the Asian Development Bank recently, 70 percent of citizens feel that the fast-growing gap threatens social stability. Bold displays of riches are rare.
Yet, try as the government might to keep capitalists from amassing huge amounts of capital, people like Mr. Li, whose money comes from printing and garment manufacturing joint ventures with a Japanese company, are beginning to blip onto the world's wealth radar screens.
There are now thousands of multimillionaires in China, and the super-rich have reached such critical mass that Forbes compiles a list, however imperfect and incomplete, of the country's wealthiest individuals. Mr. Li ranks 71st, though he asserts that his true ranking is much higher. 
Last year, No. 5, a Shanghai real estate developer, stunned tycoon-thick Hong Kong by paying $30 million for the territory's most ostentatious house, an unheard-of public show of wealth by a mainland businessman.
Mr. Li, who estimates his wealth at hundreds of millions of dollars, is also not afraid to show his money, though he steers clear of Chinese reporters. Besides his Lamborghini, which he said cost him about half a million dollars after paying China's exorbitant import duty, he owns a Bentley, two Mercedes-Benzes, several BMW's and a fleet of Japanese luxury cars. 
The Pinghu Capitol houses the headquarters of his manufacturing operation, complete with showrooms and spacious offices for designers and executives. His Shanghai offices are like a five-star hotel occupying a three-floor glass cube atop one of the city's tallest new office towers. From the Jacuzzi in his private gym he can survey booming Shanghai below.
A forest of bureaucratic barriers and government prejudices make the accumulation of such vast wealth difficult, even risky. One reason is the government's fear that without restraint, the population could slip back into the stark disparity that marked China in the 1930's and 1940's, when a very few enjoyed inordinate wealth amid a sea of poverty.
The government report presented to the Asian Development Bank conference says China now has one of the world's greatest wealth gaps, from almost none 20 years ago. 
But a more immediate concern is that wealth begets political power, which the Communist Party is loath to share.
Mr. Li, wearing a tailored black suit from one of his own factories, lifted his hands repeatedly off the Lamborghini's wheel and touched his wrists together, miming a man in handcuffs, as he listed fellow entrepreneurs who have ended up in jail.
"They all ran into trouble when their wealth grew too great," he said, adding that he had been far more careful in acquiring his riches. For example, he said he was scrupulous about separating personal from corporate assets and paid taxes in three countries: China, Japan and the United States.
Mr. Li believes that the Communist Party is misguided in its effort to suppress the upper reaches of society to keep glaring social inequalities to a minimum. 
"It does help social stability, but only in the short term," he said later over a glass of expensive Bordeaux in one of his private dining rooms. "In the long term it will hurt China."
He suggests that a more democratic political system would be a better way to ease the social pressures, and worries that without one the slow polarization of Chinese society can spell trouble. "In a one-party country everything looks peaceful," he said, "but when there's a problem, it's a big problem."
Meanwhile, the widening wealth gap is good for the economy, he argues, because it creates incentive among the masses to better their lot. "The current problem is that there's isn't enough competition and people aren't worried," he said.
His own career tracks China's slow march from a Stalinist state back toward a market economy.
The eldest of five children born to a farmer and raised not far from his mock Capitol, he vowed to devote his life to the Communist Party as a red-neckerchiefed member of the Young Pioneers, the organization that nurtures future party members.
"We spent our days in bayonet practice," he recalled.
A decade later, he was fired from an electric fan workshop for, he said, "advocating capitalism."
Then, in 1983, he took advantage of sweeping economic reforms under Deng Xiaoping that let individuals take over government-owned enterprises and run them as quasi-private businesses if they guaranteed the government a fixed return.
Mr. Li, then 21, promised to pay the local government $240 a year for the right to operate a defunct textile factory. As part of the deal he was obliged to keep all of the factory's 40-odd employees. But he could keep any profits after paying the local government its annual fee.
He started with $60 in savings making polyester shirts and pants that were then in huge demand in Beijing and Shanghai among an urban population eager to cast off the faded cotton clothes of the Cultural Revolution. He netted more than $7,000 the first year.
"There was a lot of pressure," he said. "If I didn't do well the officials would give me trouble, but if I did well they'd also give me trouble."
By 1988 the government had ratcheted its annual rent on the business up to $24,000, but the factory was still earning double that, so the government took it back, making him an employee.
"In America the law is bigger than any leader, but in China the leaders are bigger than the law," he said.
After that, he looked outward for help. 
He found a Japanese partner for the factory and in 1990 formed a joint venture that began making uniforms for Japanese companies. In 1993 he and his new Japanese backers started a high-quality printing business.
Last year, after taking the Chinese side of the garment joint venture public, Mr. Li bought the local government's share for $15 million. His Capitol-inspired headquarters was built on the site of the original factory.
He is vague about how the few million yuan he saved as contractor of the factory multiplied so much in just a few years, but says he and his businesses are debt-free. 
Today he owns 30 percent of a group of companies that include the biggest supplier of company uniforms to Japan -- where most employees of many companies wear uniforms -- and China's biggest printer of airline tickets and receipts for payments of the value-added tax, a kind of sales tax.
"It's like printing money," he said, stopping by one of the print shops to watch the machines whir.
Despite his political views, Mr. Li did not arrive at such wealth without plenty help from government officials, though he will not name benefactors.
"In China you have to have relations with the government," he said. When state-owned enterprises want to do something, he said, the government clears the way, but for private companies, he added, holding up his hand like a cop stopping traffic, "we still need a lot of approvals."
He says he spends most of his time petitioning the government or entertaining officials to win permits or understand policies that frequently change and are often not made public.
Though he is not a party member, his wife is, and he is a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Congress, an advisory body to the central government made up mostly of prominent non-Communists. Friends say he is being courted for membership in the National People's Congress, the country's largely ineffectual parliament.
"If you want to succeed you have to socialize with powerful people," he explained while showing a guest around the club on his company premises, which includes Japanese and Italian restaurants, karaoke rooms where guests can snuggle with hired hostesses, and a bathhouse that offers massages.
"Those people won't go out to a restaurant or come to your office, so you have to have a place like this," Mr. Li said.
On the road back to Shanghai, he was pestered by bankers. "Give me three more points and I'll deposit 30 million," he barked into a tiny cellphone.
He says he never borrows from them, but because China's private businessmen remain largely hidden, bankers and brokers are two of the most important sources of information about his peers.
He parks the Lamborghini at his villa in a new compound of closely packed homes on the edge of Shanghai and switches to his purring Bentley. Later, in his offices high above Shanghai, he straightens oil paintings on the wall. One is a portrait of himself in early 19th-century European dress striking a Byronic pose. On an adjacent wall hangs a painting of Napoleon.
But among the snapshots of Prime Minister Zhu Rongji, former President George Bush and King Abdullah II of Jordan posing with Mr. Li is one small black-and-white photograph of his family in 1963, wearing padded peasant garb and sitting on crude bamboo furniture in front of a rickety farmhouse.
His trajectory from that humble beginning is aimed at steering him clear of the turmoil that marked his early years. Though he travels on a Chinese passport, half of his wealth is invested abroad. His 16-year-old son lives in a Manhattan apartment near the United Nations with a chaperon and a chauffeur to ferry him to a private school in Scarsdale.
Said Mr. Li, "He prefers it there."

HEADLINE: LESSONS; 
Court Lacks Last Word In Aid to Religious Schools

BYLINE:  By Richard Rothstein 

 BODY:
THE Supreme Court will soon decide if public money can pay for tuition at private religious schools. Advocates and opponents of vouchers await the ruling with great excitement or dread. But the decision may be less important than they think. 
 Whatever the ruling, constitutional policy will change little because the government already supports religious schools by providing them with busing, textbooks and remedial aid. Tax policy helps as well, because donations are deductible. 
 Last year's federal tax cut also included credits for private (including religious) school fees. Arizona and Pennsylvania have their own tax breaks for charities that subsidize such fees. Other states are weighing similar plans.
But the main reason the court's ruling will have little impact is that private schools' attraction as a way to improve education is beginning to wane. A decade ago many policy makers believed that private education was less bureaucratic and that competition for students would spur all schools to improve. They thought that poor and minority students in particular would achieve more if they could go to private schools.
But evidence is now accumulating that privatization is no simple answer. Consider the urban Roman Catholic schools that sometimes post higher scores than nearby public ones. Recent carefully controlled studies have more ambiguous results than expected. In New York City, black students gained 5.5 percentile points in math and reading, on average, after being offered subsidies to attend private (mostly Catholic) schools for three years. Some grade levels gained more, others less. Yet in Washington, black students gained nothing over all. Hispanics gained nothing in either city.
These murky results are not surprising. Catholic schools and public ones face similar problems, like poor academic support from disadvantaged parents. Catholic-school teachers, paid less than those in public schools, are often as unqualified as the least-prepared public-school teachers. Even where Catholic-school teachers are nonunion, firing bad teachers is almost as hard as in public schools. It is never easy to replace teachers if adequate replacements cannot be found. Also, Catholic-school administrators usually follow due process in evaluating teachers, making terminations for less than blatant malfeasance unlikely.
Charter schools -- run like private schools but technically public -- have also been no panacea. Some charters have higher scores than comparable regular schools, but others do not. Some states are now tightening charter laws because achievement has declined in some charter schools.
The high cost of private education also shows why it may not be the wave of the future. The most prestigious private schools serving affluent families charge far more than public agencies can pay. In addition, private schools have not shown that they can adequately serve lower-income students for the amount public schools spend.
Edison Schools Inc., for example, the nation's largest for-profit school chain, was founded in 1992 to create private schools that produced better results at less cost than public schools. Its officers thought public schools wasted money on bureaucracy, so Edison could still profit by cutting administrators and charging less tuition than public schools spent.
But Edison could not design a system that cost less than public education. Now, when the company contracts with districts to operate regular schools, it charges the full amount that public schools spend. Ironically, Edison asserts that even at this price the company is unprofitable because its administrative costs are too high. Its officers say the company must now expand, by adding more schools, to gain economies of scale that will reduce the per-pupil cost of bureaucracy.
Yet with 75,000 students, Edison is already one of the nation's largest school systems. When a public district gets this big, it often becomes less efficient, not more. For example, a superintendent can no longer supervise each principal, so new layers of oversight are needed. The most efficient districts probably have about 20,000 students.
In the long run, private education will grow only if it yields high achievement more efficiently than public schooling, especially for disadvantaged children. Private schools may be unwilling to subject themselves to this test. In Milwaukee, for example, a city whose vouchers' continuation will depend on the Supreme Court ruling, a requirement that private schools report test scores for voucher students was dropped after advocates of vouchers objected.
Demonstrating higher achievement at less cost may not be impossible, but is more difficult than it once seemed. The Supreme Court's decision cannot enhance the quality of this evidence.

HEADLINE: Edison Schools In Settlement With S.E.C. 

BYLINE:  By DIANA B. HENRIQUES and JACQUES STEINBERG 

 BODY:
Edison Schools, the nation's largest commercial operator of public schools and a pioneer in the field of for-profit school management, provided inaccurate information about its past revenue and maintained inadequate financial controls, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced yesterday.
 The commission also disclosed that Edison had agreed to a settlement with the commission that requires the company, which did not admit or deny any wrongdoing, to revise the way it reports its revenue and to hire an internal audit manager to strengthen its financial procedures. No financial penalties were imposed by the S.E.C., which noted that Edison had fully cooperated with its inquiry. 
 The commission's announcement came less than half an hour before -- and effectively upstaged -- a conference call by Edison executives that was intended to reassure investors, educators and parents that a recent steep decline in Edison's stock price would not derail the company's plans to take over 20 failing schools in Philadelphia this summer or impair its nationwide operations. 
In that call, Edison's founder and chief executive, H. Christopher Whittle, reported that the company was in serious discussions to raise $30 million to $50 million from an investor whose identity he could not yet disclose. "Our hope is to conclude this within the next few weeks," Mr. Whittle said. He noted, in a later interview, that the company had long been successful at attracting capital over the years, but acknowledged that the recent 85 percent decline in its stock price and the apparent erosion in investor confidence pose a special challenge.
Mr. Whittle also announced that, after the coming school year, the company would sharply scale back its pace of growth, from more than 60 percent a year to about 30 percent, so that it could both reduce the amount of cash it consumes and move toward making a profit. Under contracts with school districts and charter schools, Edison educates about 75,000 children in 22 states. 
At the heart of the S.E.C.'s complaint is the fact that Edison, which has dazzled investors with the pace of its revenue growth but has never made a profit, had not disclosed that about half of its reported revenue actually consisted of money that its client school districts paid to others -- teachers, bus companies and cafeteria vendors, for example -- on Edison's behalf. 
For example, of roughly $376 million in revenue that Edison reported for the fiscal year that ended last June, $154 million had never actually landed in Edison's bank account. But because Edison also included those district-paid amounts in its own expenses, its revenue-reporting policy had no effect on its profits -- or, more accurately, its losses.
By failing to disclose "that a substantial portion of its reported revenues consist of payments that never reach Edison," the commission said, Edison's financial reports "have not provided accurate disclosure regarding significant aspects of Edison's business." Edison promised that it would clearly separate district-paid expenses from revenue in the future.
In settling the complaint, Edison also agreed to revise some of its previous financial reports to lower its reported revenue on a handful of its school contracts. For example, its total revenue for the fiscal year that ended last June will shrink about 7 percent, to $350.5 million from $375.8 million. 
Similar shrinkage will occur in the revenue amounts Edison reported for the 1998, 1999 and 2000 fiscal years, while revenue reported for the first half of the current fiscal year, which ends next month, will contract by about 11 percent.
Mr. Whittle apologized yesterday for the S.E.C. investigation and its consequences. Because Edison, which he called "the most scrutinized school system in the country," stands "at the vanguard of an important movement," it needs to "be right 100 percent of the time," he said.
And in this case, he said, Edison and its auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers, thought the company had been reporting revenue correctly. Indeed, the S.E.C. acknowledged that Edison's accounting treatment of the district-paid expenses did not violate generally accepted accounting principles.
But Wayne M. Carlin, regional director of the commission's New York office, said that Edison's case showed that "technical compliance" with those general principles "will not insulate an issuer from enforcement action if it makes filings with the commission that mischaracterize its business, or omit significant information."
Mr. Whittle's comments yesterday were in sharp contrast to his aggressive defense of the company's revenue-recognition policies in mid-February, when those policies were questioned by Bloomberg News. In fact, Edison reported at that time that any other accounting treatment "would be incorrect and misleading."
But Edison executives, in response to questions by several Wall Street analysts during the conference call yesterday, stoutly defended their decision not to disclose the existence of the S.E.C. inquiry until yesterday. Edison's chairman, Benno C. Schmidt Jr., the former president of Yale University and former dean of the Columbia University law school, said in an interview last night that it was "extremely difficult and dangerous, if not impossible" to clearly define the scope of an S.E.C. inquiry before it is concluded.
"Putting that out into the market just gives free rein for people to assume the absolute worst," Mr. Schmidt said. Instead, he said, the company decided to refrain from disclosing its negotiations with the S.E.C. until all the details and consequences could be disclosed as well. 
Edison's announcement of the settlement came almost immediately after the S.E.C.'s.
And almost as an afterthought to yesterday's crowded agenda, Edison announced its financial results for the first three months of this year, the third quarter of its fiscal year. It reported that its revenue -- presented as the S.E.C. desired -- had increased 31 percent, to $121.9 million, over the period last year. But in part because of a $6.8 million write-down in the value of Edison's investment in Apex Learning, a company that offers advanced placement courses online, Edison's losses totaled $16.9 million.
That translates to a loss of 31 cents a share, about 10 cents more than analysts had expected.
But the analysts focused most of their questions yesterday on Edison's Philadelphia contract. Last month, the state panel assigned to oversee the troubled Philadelphia system voted to assign Edison 20 schools -- 25 fewer than what some state officials, as well as Edison itself, had led investors to expect. A succession of downgrades of Edison by analysts followed, and the value of the company's stock plunged from nearly $13 a share in early April to less than $3 last week. It closed yesterday at $2.94, up 28 cent, and rose to more than $3.50 in after-hours trading.
Last night, acknowledging the analysts' disappointment in the Philadelphia decision and the apparent erosion of investor confidence, Mr. Whittle said, "We managed to take our greatest win and turn it into an expectation defeat."
The company could pick up several additional schools -- though far from the 25 more it is seeking -- as soon as this afternoon, when the state panel meets in Philadelphia.
But even so, after the coming school year, Edison intends to slow its pursuit of new contracts across the country, Mr. Whittle told the analysts. Some of them questioned whether this pullback would delay Edison's achievement of profitability, which it has long said was dependent on rapidly achieving economies of scale.
Mr. Whittle, however, insisted that slower growth would actually hasten the company's ability to turn a profit because it would be able to reduce high start-up costs involved in opening new schools, and invest in management improvements that would further reduce its headquarter expenses.
Those overhead costs grew in the third quarter, both in absolute dollars and as a percent of revenues, totaling nearly $54 million so far in the current fiscal year, compared with less than $39 million in the comparable period last year.
Adam Feild, the company's chief financial officer, blamed higher legal and accounting expenses the company incurred in dealing with the S.E.C. investigation and the protracted negotiations in Philadelphia for some of the growth in headquarter expenses.

HEADLINE: Senecas Vote to Approve Plans for 2 Casinos 

BYLINE:  By SHAILA K. DEWAN 

DATELINE: CATTARAUGUS INDIAN RESERVATION, May 14 

 BODY:
Members of the Seneca Nation of Indians in western New York voted 1,077 to 976 today in favor of two proposed casinos for Buffalo and Niagara Falls, and the hundreds of millions of dollars they are expected to bring.
 The casino compact between the Seneca Nation and the state must still overcome legal challenges and pass a federal review, but approval by the nation overcomes a major hurdle. The closely contested vote today drew Senecas from as far away as Florida and Virginia. "The people sent us out to do this, and we went out and did it," said Cyrus M. Schindler, the nation's president, who was elected two years ago on a pro-casino platform. 
 The compact could bring as much as $4 billion to the tribe over the 14-year life of the agreement, tribal officials say. The state, which would take a portion of the proceeds from slot machines at the two casinos, stands to make $300 million to $400 million a year from the Seneca casinos plus four others that are planned, according to a spokeswoman for Gov. George E. Pataki, and would give 25 percent of that money to the casinos' host cities. Some of the money would also be used to treat gambling addicts, said the spokeswoman, Suzanne Morris.
An expansion of gambling faced stiff opposition in the State Legislature, particularly in the Republican-led Senate. But with the harsh fiscal realities brought on by Sept. 11, resistance melted away, and last October, lawmakers passed a bill allowing the governor to negotiate compacts for six casinos, three in western New York and three in the Catskills. The bill also allowed video lottery terminals at racetracks and participation in a multistate lottery, with tickets going on sale Wednesday. The governor has argued that casinos are a badly needed pump for the upstate economy, and that New York is losing revenue to Canada and to other states that permit gambling.
The promise of gambling riches has also proved to be a strong lure within the Seneca Nation. The tribal council ran television and newspaper advertisements urging a yes vote, promising that money from the casino would pay for better education, housing, health care, pensions for tribal elders and even a sewage treatment plant. It would also, the council promised, provide each Seneca with a regular check.
But there is no specific plan now for how to use the gambling windfall. "The possibilities are open," said Richard E. Nephew, a member of the tribal council who owns a smoke shop. "There's just so much." 
Mr. Nephew stood in pro-casino headquarters on Route 438 near the polling site. The rented house was hung with 'Vote Yes' banners and bustling with Senecas helping themselves to heaping plates of baked chicken.
But down the road, the Wolf's Run smoke shop and diner offered corn soup and fry bread to those who voted no. Sally Snow, the owner, sniffed out indecision in a customer, Frank Guite, 52, a construction contractor who had come from Virginia Beach. Half his family disapproved of the casino, he admitted, but the other half wanted to know how soon they could board the bus.
"Gambling is one of the worst sins we can commit as traditional Iroquois people," Ms. Snow told him. The casino proponents, she said, were greedy, and the compact with the state would compromise, not increase, the tribe's sovereignty.

HEADLINE: Contemporary-Art Auction Sets Records for 15 Artists 

BYLINE:  By CAROL VOGEL 

 BODY:
"Who wants to die with money in the stock market when you can have Rothkos on your walls?" a collector asked as he was leaving Christie's sale of postwar and contemporary art last night.
 Not many, at least among the standing-room-only crowd of collectors, dealers and curiosity-seekers who crowded the Rockefeller Center salesroom. The 90-minute sale broke records for 15 artists, including Jean-Michel Basquiat, Donald Judd, Louise Bourgeois and Ed Ruscha. 
 For the first time since November 1997, Christie's put its postwar and contemporary artworks together in one sale, and it was a buoyant evening. Of the 67 works, 56 sold. The sale totaled $46.9 million, just under its high estimate of $47 million. 
"It was just amazing," said a dazed Christopher Burge, honorary chairman of Christie's in America and the evening's auctioneer. "It was fast and furious. I was fielding bids from all over the room. I'm completely exhausted."
The two top sellers last night, both paintings, were being sold by Lars Ulrich, the songwriter and drummer for the band Metallica. Of five works he was selling, Jean-Michel Basquiat's "Profit I" (1982), a dark canvas dominated by a skeletal black man, was the most popular. Two determined bidders fought for the painting, estimated at $3 million to $5 million. It sold to an anonymous telephone bidder for $5.5 million, a record for the artist.
Mr. Ulrich was also selling Dubuffet's "Paris Montparnasse" (1961). Five bidders tried to buy the large, dense painting, which brought $4.7 million, far above its high estimate of $3.5 million. The buyer was David Gray, the Chicago dealer.
(Final prices include Christie's new commission: 19.5 percent of the first $100,000 and 10 percent of the rest. Estimates do not reflect commissions.)
Sculpture has brought high prices for several seasons and last night was no exception. An untitled 1967 monumental stainless steel and plexiglas wall piece by Donald Judd was estimated at $3 million to $4 million. The seller was Irving Blum, the California dealer, who was to sell the work at Christie's in November but got cold feet after Sept. 11.
Those days seemed far away last night. Two bidders vied for the Judd, which sold to a telephone bidder for $4.6 million. The price eclipsed the artist's previous record, set just the night before when another 1967 wall piece sold at Phillips, de Pury & Luxembourg for $1.3 million. There was much speculation about the buyer; many art experts believed him to be Francois Pinault, the luxury goods magnate who owns Christie's.
Mr. Pinault certainly was a seller last night, offering a group of Louise Bourgeois sculptures identified in the catalog as coming from a private collection. The artist's "Blind Man's Buff" (1984), an abstract marble sculpture of rounded shapes resembling udders, was estimated at $600,000 to $800,000. James Cohan, a Manhattan dealer, wrestled the sculpture away from three other bidders for $1.4 million, a record for the artist. After the sale, Christie's executives said Mr. Cohan had bought it for an American institution, but they declined to say which one.
Pop Art brought strong prices, as it has all spring. Andy Warhol's "Four-Foot Flowers" (1964) was being sold by the auction house, which owned the silkscreen. Estimated at $1.8 million to $2.2 million, it sold to an unidentified telephone bidder for $3.7 million. Phillips sold another version of the image on Monday night for $2.2 million.
Christie's also had three Pop works from the 1960's from the collection of Reinhard Onnasch, a Berlin real estate developer, dealer and collector. Mr. Onnasch bought the works from 1970 to 1974.
Mr. Ruscha's "Talk About Space" (1963), a takeoff on the American billboard in which a single word is the subject, was expected to sell for $1.5 million to $2 million. Five bidders went for the painting, which sold for $3.5 million, a record for the artist. At Phillips on Monday night, another one-word painting executed by Mr. Ruscha in the same year brought $2.5 million.
A collage by Tom Wesselmann, "Great American Nude No 44" (1963), also from Mr. Onnasch, was expected to fetch $600,000 to $800,000. Four people tried to buy the collage, which depicts a naked woman standing in a colorful living room with a bright red wall telephone hung against a bright blue wall. It sold to Maxwell Davidson, a Manhattan dealer, for $944,500, another artist's record.
Roy Lichtenstein's "Red Barn 1" (1969), a Pop version of a quaint American barn set in a bucolic landscape, was estimated at $1.4 million to $1.8 million, A telephone bidder paid $2.4 million.
As the audience was leaving Christie's, many were trying to make sense of the market. Some believed that in this shaky economy, putting money in art may be a sounder way to go, and a more enjoyable one.
"There was a bit more money floating around," said Anthony d'Offay, the London dealer. "Everything was strong."

HEADLINE: THE NEWARK ELECTION: NEWS ANALYSIS; 
As Civil Rights Battles Recede, Generational Fights Replace Them

BYLINE:  By RICHARD LEZIN JONES 

DATELINE: NEWARK, May 14 

 BODY:
Thirty-five years ago, this striving city still digging itself out of the rubble of riot -- played host to one of the first national conferences on black power. The theme of the conference was simple: energizing a sometimes passive electorate and positioning black candidates to run for elective offices dominated by a white establishment. 
 It is a curious bit of symmetry that the mayoral election here today represented a different kind of quandary -- the struggle for power between one generation of African-American politicians and another. 
 With his victory in today's fiercely contested race against City Councilman Cory Booker, Mayor Sharpe James did more than just withstand an assault on one of the Northeast's most entrenched political machines. 
In a larger sense, he also circumvented deep rifts within the black political establishment that have further heralded the emergence of a new wave of black leaders, born after the civil rights movement, who are often the beneficiaries of the struggles fought by the leaders they now seek to unseat.
To be sure, the forces at work here were not novel. Cities across the nation have seen the vanguard of emerging young black leaders gently -- or sometimes not so gently -- nudging their elders away from center stage. And the political dynamic in Newark was certainly not as portentous as it was three decades ago.
But the bitterness and vitriol that characterized the contest between Mr. James and Mr. Booker highlighted the continuing evolution of black political power and the internecine tensions between the established forces that wield it and those who seek to claim it.
"The natural order of things is for the young to replace the old," said David A. Bositis, a senior political analyst with the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, who has compiled a 30-year study of black elected officials. "There comes a time when even if old black leaders don't necessarily want to leave power, nature reminds them it's time to go." 
For Mr. James, now, at least, it's not that time. Although Mr. Booker tried to rouse the electorate by charging that the steps Newark had made toward economic revitalization had not been significant enough, voters disagreed. Mr. Booker, 33, raised in suburban Bergen County with an Ivy League pedigree, had sought to tap into that sense of dissatisfaction and of a mission incomplete among many here.
Voters, however, agreed with Mr. James, 66, who countered by pointing out the strides that the city made after it was torn by the riots of the summer of 1967 and asked, after 32 years in political office -- 16 of them as mayor -- for more time to finish the job.
He also won a fifth term as mayor by playing on a sort of xenophobia and civic chauvinism among Newark residents, who turned away a candidate that Mr. James had described as a carpetbagger, even though he grew up only two counties away.
Mr. James also played upon internal ethnic conflicts, as well as class and social differences among many blacks in the still troubled city. He questioned whether the upper-middle-class Mr. Booker could effectively relate to -- and by extension, govern -- the residents of a city that is still gripped by stunning poverty in many neighborhoods. 
That message was a risky one for Mr. James in a changing Newark where the old rules of ethnic politics -- as played by Mr. James's generation -- may no longer apply. "Newark is increasingly a city that cannot be explained simply by a black-white social calculus," said Clement A. Price, a history professor at Rutgers University-Newark who has closely followed the campaign.
Still, though, in this city, which is just over half black and nearly a third Latino, the support of those ethnic groups has historically gone to Mr. James, and there were few indications heading into today's election that that would change.
Mr. James also played up his record as a civil rights advocate and pointed to the support that Mr. Booker had received from whites and those outside Newark to bolster his claims that the councilman was beholden to some who might try to exploit the city. 
Mr. Booker said Mr. James's long stint at the helm of the sometimes cumbersome gears of the city's political machine made the prospect of rapid or significant change unlikely.
Those perspectives represented generational differences between the old and new black political guards that may become only more pronounced as both generations age.
"What makes these generational differences so striking is that there was a time when the difference between the young politician and the old politician was just age," Mr. Bositis said. "Now you have different experiences and different viewpoints."
Despite those differences, however, both candidates share similar core beliefs -- a concern for civil rights and social justice and a belief in using government to improve the lives of their black African-American constituents.
And although Mr. James's resume as a civil rights crusader in the 1960's still carried great weight with today's electorate, its significance may be diminishing.
"To people from the segregated South, the oppressor was the white world," Mr. Bositis said. "When they were growing up, there were very few black Americans who were embraced by the white world. So it's very easy to slip into the 'Cory Booker is white-centered' or 'Conservatives have brought him in.'
"But, let's face it, in another 20 years you're not going to find another black politician who will have had the experience of segregation, even in the South."

Priceline Cuts Ties With Hill, Holliday

BYLINE:  By Bill Carter and Jim Rutenberg 

 BODY:
Priceline.com said yesterday that it had ended its relationship with Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos in Boston after almost three years. Priceline, the online seller of discount travel services like airline tickets, will handle its own advertising. 
Last year, it spent about $40 million on advertising, according to the CMR division of Taylor Nelson Sofres.
 Brian Ek, a spokesman for Priceline in Norwalk, Conn., confirmed a report of the decision in the online edition of Adweek. He declined to discuss the reason, as did Eileen O'Connor, a spokeswoman at Hill, Holliday, part of the McCann-Erickson World Group of the Interpublic Group of Companies. The company's recent radio commercials, however, were produced internally by Priceline. 
 Hill, Holliday created the humorous commercials for Priceline featuring the actor William Shatner, who will continue to appear in the campaign, Mr. Ek said.

A New Tale Of 2 Cities, But Both Are Newark

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW PURDY 

DATELINE: NEWARK 

 BODY:
MONDAY night's rain had cut attendance at Sharpe James's pre-election rally to 200, from the planned 2,000. There was extra food and an extra-loud band, and anxiety rippled through the paltry crowd in the cavernous bus garage that had been cleared out for the event. "I'm surprised there's not more people," one woman said nervously.
 Mr. James seemed as if he couldn't care less. "We complained about the drought," he said. "The Lord gave us rain." 
 It sounded like something a politician might say on the eve of being washed up. Then the band played: "Don't worry about today. With Sharpe James, it's gonna be all right."
It sounded like a song the band might play the night before things would not turn out all right. Mr. James, wearing a wool hat that said "Newark," danced a little, spinning a few supporters across the garage floor. Then he said good night to the crowd with final instructions for the morning: "Early to rise, early to polls. Back to pull more votes."
Mr. James, chased by a younger, more energetic challenger, was perfect for the part of the older, wily warrior. This was his ninth election for city government, and while Cory Booker, a one-term councilman, had given him a surprising scare in a vicious contest, Mr. James was careful to show no fear. The election had long ago turned from political to personal.
"He wants to run the largest city in New Jersey without any experience," Mr. James said Monday night. "We have a right to be offended by this."
Mr. James was more offended than anyone. He was one of the black politicians who emerged after the 1967 riots to lead the wounded city. He beat Kenneth Gibson, the city's first black mayor, in 1986. He built a political machine like the city has not seen in a generation, one that was singed, but not engulfed by corruption. And he has overseen the beginning of a rebirth of Newark, which is far from complete.
Not only did Mr. Booker -- half his age at 33 -- not pay proper homage, but he represented a challenge to the perception of Newark that was Mr. James's legacy.
There were many conflicts at work in the election. Machine versus insurgent. Young versus old. Political fixture versus newcomer. But one of the most bitter divides was between the inside perception that Newark has pulled itself back onto its feet, and the outside perception that Newark is still reeling from the devastation of the riots 35 years ago.
THAT outsider view was the subtext of much of the national attention focused on Mr. Booker: What's a nice, bright guy like this doing in a city like that?
In his lighter moments, the attention drawn by his opponent drove Mr. James to humor. At a rally a few weeks ago, Mr. James compared Mr. Booker's golden resume with his own recent award as New Jersey's best mayor. "What does that make me, chopped liver and chitlins?" he asked, mixing shtick with soul.
It also drove Mr. James to crank up his political apparatus for one more victory.
Mr. Booker battled impressively against Newark's parochial politics. "That's the way it always is in Newark," said Allison Burgess, a crossing guard on Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, on Monday afternoon. "If you're not from here, you're not supposed to be here controlling anything."
Mr. James's victory, no matter how he casts it, was not a vote for one perception over the other. The facts are the facts. Crime is down and construction is up, but the city is beset by high unemployment for adults, low birth weight for infants and high dropout rates for teenagers. The Hayes Homes, public housing projects that stood opposite the police station where the riots started, are long gone, replaced by 206 town houses. But Springfield Avenue, the commercial district that was looted and burned in the riots, still has long vacant stretches.
In victory last night, Mr. James was suddenly above the fray of the election that had threatened him. "Tomorrow, we must come together to continue to rebuild our city," he said. "This election was not about Sharpe James; it was about the future of Newark."
But yesterday afternoon, with the polls still open, the election was about the future of Sharpe James.
"One side is going to win, and one side is going to lose," Mr. James said, at a final campaign stop. But just in case anyone thought he had become philosophical with his legacy in the balance, he added one last emphatic thought: "We're going to be the ones that win."

HEADLINE: THE NEWARK ELECTION: OVERVIEW; 
James Wins 5th Term in Newark as Challenger Is Rebuffed

BYLINE:  By ANDREW JACOBS 

DATELINE: NEWARK, May 14 

 BODY:
Sharpe James became the first mayor in Newark's history to win a fifth term tonight, staving off a fierce challenge from Councilman Cory Booker and cementing his reputation as one of New Jersey's most formidable politicians.
 Mr. James, who had never lost a race in his 32-year political career, won with 53 percent of the vote to Mr. Booker's 47 percent after a bitter contest in the most expensive election Newark has seen. A third candidate, Dwayne Smith, received less than half a percent. 
 Despite being outspent by his rival, an Ivy League-educated lawyer exactly half his age, Mr. James, 66, convinced enough voters that his efforts to bring about an economic revival in this long-distressed city were moving in the right direction. 
In an exultant victory speech at 10:55 p.m. standing beside the Rev. Al Sharpton, the mayor first thanked Gov. James E. McGreevey, saying, "I would not be here without the support of a great governor." When he mentioned his opponents by name, thanking them "for their participation in the democratic process," boos welled up from the floor, but Mr. James quickly calmed the crowd. "Tomorrow we go forward as a family," he said.
Mr. James feted his supporters inside the ballroom of the Robert Treat Hotel, which sits across from one of his administration's greatest triumphs, the New Jersey Performing Arts Center.
In contrast, the Booker campaign, which tied its fortunes to the idea that Mr. James had neglected the neighborhoods, gathered at a Brazilian restaurant in the city's Ironbound section.
Surrounded by a half-dozen City Council candidates who were part of his slate, Mr. Booker tried to ease the gloom by vowing to continue fighting for his adopted city. "We don't even need to say we'll be back because we're not going anywhere," he said to thunderous cheers. 
He also promised to keep working on behalf of two Council candidates who face runoff elections next month. "We have slipped the small end of a larger wedge into the door of this political machine," he said. "Let us show our dignity by being gracious in this minor defeat." 
Turnout in the nonpartisan race was moderate amid scattered reports of voter intimidation and minor election-law violations, although the United States attorney here said none of the incidents were serious.
As the most fiercely contested mayoral race in recent Newark history, the election was closely watched by both the United States Justice Department and national news organizations, who were drawn by this made-for-TV drama featuring a veteran populist battling a political newcomer. In the end, Mr. Booker raised $2.8 million for his campaign; Mr. James, facing his first serious political challenge since becoming mayor in 1986, raised about $2.3 million.
Ronald L. Lester, a pollster for the James campaign, said tonight that the results showed that Mr. James, not his rival, was the real agent of change. In the end, he said, Mr. Booker's spending could not move loyalists away from the mayor. "This was not a generational struggle," he said. "This was a struggle between outside interests over city interests. That theme seemed to resonate with voters."
In their final push to win undecided voters and rally the faithful, the candidates darted around the city today. During an afternoon sweep through the city's Ironbound section, Mr. Booker was mobbed by cheering youngsters and women offering hugs. "This is a wonderful day for Newark," he said amid the throng of well-wishers. "The problems we have are not bigger than we are." 
Mr. James spent part of his day campaigning with Mr. Sharpton, and stopped in at the headquarters of the Newark Teachers' Union to thank a roomful of supporters who were making calls to voters. As the union president, Joseph DelGrosso, nodded in agreement, Mr. James called his opponent a Republican dressed as a Democrat, noting Mr. Booker's past support for school vouchers and his fleeting association with prominent Republicans like former Representative Bob Franks and Bret D. Schundler, the unsuccessful gubernatorial candidate.
"If you walk like a duck and quack like a duck, you're a duck," Mr. James said. "You can't walk with Republicans to get national fame and then say you're a Democrat."
At the city's 121 polling places, voters were passionate about their candidates soon after voting. Rakima Henderson, 25, a recreation therapist, said she had been wary of Mr. Booker's promises and worried about his lack of experience. With Mr. James, she said, "you know what you got -- you put somebody else in there, he's saying one thing and you don't know what he's going to do."
Kevin Nelson, a 41-year-old mechanic, said he had been concerned about election-year promises and unfulfilled pledges made by Mr. James. "Every year we're talking about the same things," he said. "Sixteen years is long enough. I think Cory Booker can do it."
A former state senator and something of a local legend, Mr. James was backed by New Jersey's Democratic establishment, from Governor McGreevey to Newark's entire City Council -- except, of course, for Mr. Booker. 
"James is probably the most powerful African-American political figure in the history of New Jersey," said Merle Treusch, a political science professor at Kean University, in Union. 
Although Mr. Booker lacked union and party support, he compensated with paid labor and a battalion of volunteers sold on his promise to bring significant change to Newark, a place that has made notable progress but still ranks as one of the nation's poorest cities.
His rallying cry, "It's time for a renaissance for the rest of us," was aimed at Mr. James's claim that Newark's downtown development reflected a true civic renaissance. Mr. Booker claimed that the progress was largely superficial and had come at the expense of Newark's outlying wards, where a third of the residents live in poverty. 
Mr. James had countered with his own broadsides citing a 52 percent drop in crime, 4,000 new units of housing and the city's new-found optimism. Mr. James's supporters tended to be longtime residents and city employees who felt he had helped turn the city around.
Many of Mr. Booker's supporters were 20-something professionals and recent college graduates. "For a lot of people, it's been more of a movement than just a political race," said Alle Ries, 30, Mr. Booker's coordinator of volunteers. 
In the end, however, the race largely pivoted on the symbolism of two very different men: Mr. James, a veteran of the civil rights era, and Mr. Booker, a suburban-bred wunderkind whose journey through Stanford, Oxford and Yale Universities was eased by the struggles of men like Mr. James. 
Not surprisingly, during the campaign Mr. James got his most fervent support from older voters who could recall his rise from neighborhood defender during the 1967 riots, to one of Newark's first black councilmen, and later, the mayor who helped rehabilitate the city's reputation. Mr. Booker, by contrast, generated his most enthusiastic support from younger voters and the growing number of Latin American immigrants who felt no loyalty to Mr. James.
Despite weeks of nastiness in the campaign and Election Day accusations of unsavory politicking, many experts saw the race as a watershed event in Newark history. Even if his greatest aspirations lay beyond Newark, the fact that Mr. Booker moved here six years ago and ran for public office, those experts said, shows how far Newark has come. 
"Ten years ago, I don't think anyone on his way up would have said this is a good stepping stone," said Richard C. Leone, a chief aide to former Gov. Brendan T. Byrne. "For the longest time, this was the place politicians stayed away from."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares Rally After Unexpectedly Healthy Retail Sales

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Stock prices rallied for a second consecutive session yesterday, pushed higher by a retail sales report that was stronger than expected, bullish comments on Intel and healthy first-quarter earnings gains at Wal-Mart Stores and J. C. Penney. 
 Spirits were lifted further after the close, when Applied Materials, a bellwether indicator for turns in technology, reported first-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street expectations and said that new orders jumped more than 50 percent from three months ago. 
 "We are starting to get some attention back in the technology market with some pretty big marquee names," said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Company. "This is the first two-day run we have seen in the past few weeks." 
Stock prices jumped at the opening, after a report from the Commerce Department that showed retail sales rose 1.2 percent in April, a gain that was about double what most economists had expected. And the market remained strong throughout the session. 
By the close, the Nasdaq composite index was up 66.51 points, just over 4 percent, to 1,719.05. Big names like Intel, Microsoft, Cisco Systems and Dell Computer led the advance. 
Intel and Microsoft are also components of the Dow Jones industrial average, and the blue-chip index gained 188.48 points, or 1.9 percent, to 10,298.14. Wal-Mart and I.B.M. were also big contributors to the gains in the Dow.
And the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 22.72 points, or 2.1 percent, to 1,097.28.
Over the last two sessions, the Nasdaq has gained more than 118 points; the Dow is up more than 250, and the S.& P. 500 has risen by more than 40 points.
While welcome, the smattering of good news has not fundamentally altered what remains a cautious mood.
"We are not completely out of the woods," said Robert Harrington, head of listed equity trading at UBS Warburg.
"The Dow is not going to go up 188 points every day," he added. "The market is going to heal slowly. As the economy recovers, the market should create higher lows."
James W. Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis, said, "There is not enough profit momentum to carry the day.
"Indeed," he added, "it is hard to see how either the stock or the bond market can get any lasting momentum without earnings."
Wal-Mart said its first-quarter earnings rose 19.4 percent from a year ago. The stock gained $2.35, to $57.39 a share. And J. C. Penney gained $1.69, to $24.89, after it reported that net income more than doubled in the quarter, and said it was raising its forecast for the year.
Intel led technology shares higher after an analyst at Robertson Stephens upgraded it. Intel gained $1.63, to $30.15. 
Shares of Applied Materials gained $1.06 during regular trading, to $26.64, and moved $1.20 higher after the close, when the company released its first-quarter results.
Pharmaceutical and tobacco stocks, often viewed as defensive havens in times of uncertainty, struggled yesterday.
Johnson & Johnson fell 80 cents, to $61.04. And Novartis shed 60 cents, to $42.30 a share. Philip Morris dropped 83 cents, to $54.91.
As stocks rose, bond prices fell for a second day. Interest rates rose across the maturity spectrum. 
By late in the session, the Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 16/32, to a price of 96 27/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.29 percent from 5.23 percent. The 30-year bond dropped 25/32, to 94 25/32. Its yield climbed to 5.75 percent from 5.69 percent.
Here are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of a four-week bill:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)

Price: 99.864
High Rate: 1.745
Coupon Yield: 1.775
Low Rate: 1.710

HEADLINE: NATO STRIKES DEAL TO ACCEPT RUSSIA IN A PARTNERSHIP 

BYLINE:  By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: REYKJAVIK, Iceland, May 14 

 BODY:
More than 50 years after its founding and a decade after the end of the cold war, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization approved an agreement today accepting Russia, the former enemy it was formed to fight, into a new partnership with the allies on terrorism, arms control and international crisis management in a post-Sept. 11 world.
 "Together, the countries that spent four decades glowering at each other across the wall of hatred and fear now have the opportunity to transform Euro-Atlantic security for the better," the NATO secretary general, Lord Robertson, said at a meeting of foreign ministers here. 
 The British foreign secretary, Jack Straw, called the agreement "the funeral of the cold war," which he pronounced "kaput."
Coming just a day after the United States and Russia announced that they had reached agreement on a new treaty to reduce nuclear warheads by two-thirds, the decision today solidified an almost surreal sense of a major change in Russia's relations with the West. "We don't yet quite have a cliche to capture this all," Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said this evening. 
The NATO rapprochement with Russia occurred not far from the guesthouse where Ronald Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev met in 1986 for the "snap summit" that narrowly failed to end the nuclear arms race but wound up marking the beginning of the end of the cold war.
Under the agreement, Russia will for the first time become an equal partner at the table for discussions and actions with the 19 NATO members on a variety of issues, including nonproliferation, military cooperation and civilian emergency planning. But those 19 nations, including the United States, will preserve full control over membership in the alliance and over core military decisions and the use of allied troops to defend member nations, and they can vote to restrict discussion of any topic they choose.
For Russia, the new arrangement amounts to considerably less than full membership, though it will now have a say on many questions important to it and the prestige of association with the West's pre-eminent military alliance. For their part, American officials said they expected that the alliance would tap Russia's expertise on questions like civil defense, growing out of its experience with the nuclear accident at Chernobyl and fighting terrorism. In the end, as Lord Robertson has said, it may be more a question of chemistry than of arithmetic.
The ministers also approved a communique pledging to improve their military abilities and compatibility and declaring that NATO "must be able to field forces that can move quickly to wherever they are needed." In doing so, they acknowledged that the alliance now faced unpredictable threats far afield from Europe, even as some have questioned its continued relevance because the United States made only selective use of the members' forces in the Afghanistan campaign.
The need to reduce the gap between the United States' military capacity and Europe's comparatively outdated forces had been a central American demand for this meeting. Senior administration officials said they were pleased with the communique's strong language, which says that "NATO must be able to field forces that can move quickly to wherever they are needed, sustain operations over distance and time, and achieve their objectives."
The accord with Russia will be signed by President Vladimir V. Putin and the 19 NATO heads of government outside Rome on May 28.
Secretary Powell, speaking to reporters after the main morning meeting today, said, "We believe we can lay the foundation for new cooperation between NATO and Moscow while fully protecting the alliance's ability to act independently."
Later, after an hourlong meeting with Secretary Powell, Russia's foreign minister, Igor S. Ivanov, said: "We must now together build the new world order, and this will be a long process, a difficult process." In its relations with the United States, he added, Russia wanted "partnership relations, constructive relations and predictable relations."
The two-day meeting here also continued NATO's review of requests for new membership from nine nations in Central and Southeastern Europe, and added a 10th applicant, Croatia, to the list. Foreign ministers repeatedly declined to signal which candidates were favored for membership. But they said in their final communique that they agreed that whatever nations are invited to join the alliance at a summit meeting in Prague in the fall should all come in at once.
While the United States is set to spend about 3.7 percent of its gross domestic product on defense this year, spending by about half the alliance's European members has dropped below 2 percent of gross domestic product, barely the level that the United States expects new applicants for membership to meet.
Lord Robertson, emphasizing this point to reporters, warned that "NATO must change radically if it is to be effective," and said it must "modernize or be marginalized."
For his part, Secretary Powell said, "The kinds of challenges NATO may be facing in the future won't always be located in Central Europe, and NATO has to have the ability to move to other places. 
"We all need to have highly mobile, sustainable forces with modern combat capabilities," he said, "forces that can get to the fight wherever it is and carry out a mission with efficiency and precision."
Even participants seemed hard-pressed to absorb the change that will result from the agreement. 
Describing the latest arms control agreement with Moscow to reporters on his plane here, Secretary Powell inadvertently referred to the "Soviets," before smiling and correcting himself, saying, "When you're as old as I am. . . ."
Secretary Powell noted that the current point of tension between the United States and Russia was not the arms race but Russian barriers to American poultry imports.
"I am more worried about chickens going back and forth than missiles going back and forth," he said. "This is good."
The new arrangement between Russia and the alliance replaces a five-year-old agreement under which Russia could participate in discussions with NATO, but only after all of the alliance's members had reached agreement on a unified, pre-coordinated position, to which Russia could then respond. That arrangement had not proved particularly satisfactory to either side, and some critics have predicted that the new arrangement will also be problematic.
But Mr. Ivanov called it "a radically new step in our relationship," and Mr. Straw said the change "could make an enormous difference in the war on terrorism."

HEADLINE: Debt Limit Must Be Raised, Administration Tells Congress 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 14 

 BODY:
The Bush administration warned Congress today that it was running out of time to raise the legal limit on the national debt, saying the Treasury Department would have to begin using financial gimmicks in the next few days to keep the government solvent.
 If no Congressional action is taken by the end of next month, Treasury warned, the government faces the possibility of a technical default. 
 After months in which Congress has failed to take up the White House's plan to raise the debt limit by $750 billion, to $6.7 trillion, the administration sought to jolt the House and Senate into action by setting a deadline of June 26. 
"The Treasury faces obligations in late June that, on the basis of current projections, cannot be surmounted without an increase in the statutory debt limit," the Treasury Department said in a statement. 
The national debt is rising rapidly mostly because the government issues bonds as promises to pay Social Security benefits to future retirees. But some of the increase in the debt also stems from the re-emergence of budget deficits in the wake of the recession and the tax cut pushed through Congress last year by President Bush.
As a result, what is largely a technical issue has become deeply politicized. Despite the pressure from the White House, House Republicans have avoided dealing with the issue, knowing that Democrats will say the growth of the debt proves that last year's tax cut was irresponsible.
Many conservative Republicans have also been loathe to cast an election-year vote on increasing the debt limit, a step that would appear to run counter to their calls for smaller government.
But neither party wants to be responsible for sullying the reputation of the United States government as the most credit-worthy borrower of all. Ultimately, administration officials and members of both parties said, Congress and the White House have to reach a deal.
The White House has signaled that it is willing to take the political hit involved in passing the measure to avert possible turmoil in the financial markets. But Republican leaders in Congress continue to search for a politically palatable solution.
Representative Dick Armey, the Texas Republican who is the House majority leader, said today that he would deal with the debt-limit increase as soon as he could attach it to another piece of legislation.
Democratic leaders in the Senate have promised to bring up the measure as soon as it passes the House. But Democrats have also made it clear that they would use the debate to make their case that the country was in a fiscal mess because of Mr. Bush's tax cut.

HEADLINE: CARTER ADDRESSES THE CUBAN NATION AND URGES REFORM 

BYLINE:  By DAVID GONZALEZ 

DATELINE: HAVANA, May 14 

 BODY:
Former President Jimmy Carter, in an address to the Cuban people broadcast live on television across the nation, called on President Fidel Castro tonight to allow a referendum to bring broad reforms in political rights and castigated the socialist system for denying basic freedoms.
 As Mr. Castro sat listening in the front row, Mr. Carter, speaking in Spanish, also called on the United States to lift a four-decade trade embargo on Cuba and ease travel restrictions. 
 Mr. Carter is the most prominent American political leader to visit Cuba since Mr. Castro took power in a 1959 revolution. The uncensored transmission of a speech on Cuban soil by such an influential American has no precedent under the Communist government. 
"Cuba has adopted a socialist government where one political party dominates, and people are not permitted to organize any opposition movements," Mr. Carter said. Noting that Cuba's Constitution allows freedom of speech and association, he said "other laws deny these freedoms to those who disagree with the government."
Though the former president's criticisms of Cuban communism could have been made by the Bush administration, his appeal for improved relations with Cuba found no echo today in the White House. Mr. Bush is to speak to Cuban exiles in Miami on Monday, and an official in Washington said the president planned to announce tightened economic pressure on Cuba and travel sanctions on Americans who go there. Page A10. 
Mr. Carter, who spoke in an ornate hall at the University of Havana before Mr. Castro as well as Cuban officials and students, acknowledged the social advances made by the Cuban revolution, but faulted it for failing to guarantee civil freedoms.
He referred directly to a petition signed by more than 11,000 Cubans that was presented last Friday to the National Assembly, calling for a national referendum to bring civil rights and an amnesty for political prisoners. 
"When Cubans exercise this freedom to change laws peacefully by a direct vote, the world will see that Cubans, not foreigners, will decide the future of this country," Mr. Carter said. 
Those remarks drew testy retorts from some members of the hand-picked audience in a question-and-answer session after his speech. Despite the tense interchange, Mr. Castro led the audience in giving Mr. Carter a sustained standing ovation at the end of the evening.
Cuban officials had hoped that Mr. Carter would issue a call for an end to the embargo, which has put Cuba in an economic stranglehold that Mr. Castro has never been able to break. But Mr. Carter's favorable comments on ending the embargo will make it difficult for Mr. Castro to dismiss his sharp criticism of the government, certainly some of the most candid comments Cubans have ever heard on television about their political system. 
There was little chance that any of the measures Mr. Carter urged would be enacted either by Mr. Castro or by Washington. But his comments bolstered human rights activists on the island, and were cautiously welcomed by other Cubans. 
"It was a breath of fresh air because it was from a man used to dialogue talking to a people used to monologues," Jose Pratts Soreol, a Cuban writer and intellectual, said in a telephone interview from his home. "He made the distinction between social achievements and individual rights. I agree that individual rights only enrich our social achievements. That is the vacuum we need to fill."
Elizardo Sanchez, the island's leading human rights advocate, said, "We expected him to mention some of these themes, but not with so much emphasis. 
"It was an unprecedented speech that will go down in Cuban history," said Mr. Sanchez, who met with Mr. Carter on Monday morning. "Now the statesmen and other leaders in Havana and Washington must take seriously what this man proposed in such a good-faith manner." 
Mr. Carter also urged Cuba to resolve disputes over confiscated properties in order to usher in an era of reconciliation between Cubans on both sides of the Florida Straits.
He called on Mr. Castro to allow a visit from the top United Nations human rights official. 
Mr. Carter expressed optimism that a new era might soon come.
"After 43 years of animosity, we hope that someday soon, you can reach across the great divide that separates our two countries and say, 'We are ready to join the community of democracies,' " Mr. Carter said. "And I hope that the people of the United States will soon open their arms to you and say, 'We welcome you as friends.' "
Mr. Carter proposed that "as the most powerful nation," the United States first lift the embargo and allow free travel to Cuba. But he cautioned that Cuba's economic woes were not caused by the embargo. Still, lifting the ban, he said, would be a gesture of good will.
"I want the people of the United States and Cuba to share more than a love of baseball and wonderful music," he said. "I want us to be friends, and to respect each other."
While Cuba has been increasingly faulted abroad and challenged at home, the government's control over state-run media gave it the ability to suppress criticism of human rights abuses and one-party rule. But Mr. Carter's remarks gave ordinary Cubans a glimpse of the political parallel universe just 90 miles away.
The United States and Cuba, longtime adversaries, have been ratcheting up the political oratory recently. Last week the State Department charged that Cuba had developed a limited capacity for germ warfare research, allegations that Mr. Carter disputed Monday. Mr. Castro angrily denied the accusations. 
Mr. Carter acknowledged that the rights record of the United States was "hardly perfect," saying that many people still lack health care and that minorities are disproportionately jailed or executed.
"Still, guaranteed civil liberties offer every citizen an opportunity to change those laws," Mr. Carter said.
A law professor in the audience told him after the speech that the petition project for a referendum was the creation of a fringe group that had no domestic support. He asked Mr. Carter if the United States would allow a small group of people to change its founding principles.
"An individual has the right to exercise his opinion," Mr. Carter replied. "Not just verbally, but also through elections."
Bush administration officials had been uneasy since Mr. Carter announced in March that he was accepting Mr. Castro's invitation to visit the island, where he is touring hospitals, schools and scientific research centers. 
Officials had been worried that a visit by Mr. Carter would give Mr. Castro a breather from the barrage of international criticism and lend support to American lawmakers and others who favor lifting the trade embargo and allowing free travel.
Mr. Carter had previously been critical of the embargo and had sought to improve relations with Cuba during his term, securing the release of thousands of political prisoners and permitting family visits by Cuban-Americans.
The administration did not dissuade Mr. Carter and issued the Treasury Department license that is necessary for travel to Cuba. While administration officials gave him no specific message to carry on what was a private trip, several said publicly that they hoped that he would speak out on human rights.

HEADLINE: U.N. Broadens List of Products Iraq Can Import 

BYLINE:  By SOMINI SENGUPTA 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 14 

 BODY:
The Security Council unanimously approved a resolution today overhauling its economic sanctions against Iraq, with the goal of dampening their impact on civilians while keeping pressure on Saddam Hussein.
 The new measure, passed 15 to 0, will allow far more consumer goods -- from bicycles to sewing machines -- to enter Iraq, even as it continues to block items that could be used for military purposes, like high-speed computers. It represents the most radical redrawing of the sanctions since 1996, when Baghdad was allowed to trade oil for food. 
 Though the resolution appears to ease the sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, it was seen as a significant victory for the United States and its allies on the Council. 
The resolution was intended to blunt any drive to end the sanctions altogether and to deflate criticism that the measures are hurting ordinary Iraqis more than their leader. It also seemed part of the diplomatic groundwork the Bush administration is seeking to lay as it presses its case that Mr. Hussein should be removed from power, perhaps by force. 
"The focused controls on military-relevant goods and simplified procedures for civilian goods eliminates excuses for inaction or evasion of U.N. sanctions on Iraq," the White House spokesman, Ari Fleischer, said today. 
The new sanctions system takes effect in July, and would have to be renewed in six months. The sanctions are to stay in place until United Nations weapons inspectors can verify that Iraq has met the obligations it agreed to after its defeat in the Persian Gulf war to dismantle programs to develop weapons of mass destruction. In its war against terrorism, the Bush administration has cited Iraq's chemical, nuclear and biological weapons programs as a prime threat. 
Iraqi officials, perhaps looking to stave off American action, have in recent months discussed with Secretary General Kofi Annan the possibility of reopening the country to inspections. The last inspectors left Iraq in December 1998, on the eve of four nights of American and British airstrikes after repeated standoffs with Iraqi officials.
Washington's European allies on the Council applauded the resolution, saying it puts the onus on the Iraqi government to spend its oil revenues wisely and to meet its obligations.
"It removes Saddam's spurious excuses for the suffering he inflicts on the Iraqi people and puts more pressure on the regime," the British foreign secretary, Jack Straw, said in a statement.
Acknowledging the mounting threats against Iraq, its ally and neighbor Syria, which currently holds a rotating seat on the Council, had pushed for language in the resolution to recognize Iraq's right to defend itself. The Syrian proposals were rejected earlier this week. 
But the Syrian delegate to the United Nations, Mikhail Wehbe, insisted today that it was "high time" to lift the sanctions against Iraq.
He also used the occasion to criticize the Council for failing to compel Israeli cooperation with a United Nations inquiry into Israel's attack on the Jenin refugee camp last month. 
In the end, though, Mr. Wehbe said his country would assent to the resolution to maintain unity on the Security Council and help it "retrieve its credibility," particularly in the Arab world.
Iraq's representative, Mohammed Aldouri, had little to say about the potential impact of the resolution, except that it offered his country little to celebrate. The new system, he said, would erect expensive bureaucratic hurdles to the import of necessary goods. 
"I can tell you, my country, we are always unhappy to see these kinds of resolutions coming out of the Security Council," he said. "It will be very costly for Iraq."
He declined to say whether the resolution would prompt Baghdad to suspend the export of oil, as it did last month in protest against Israeli military action in the West Bank. 
At the moment, all exports to Iraq, except food and some medicines, are scrutinized by a sanctions committee of the Security Council. Any member can block such imports, and the United States has used the system to keep more than $5 billion worth of goods from reaching Baghdad. 
Under the new system, the sanctions committee will ponder the fate of only those items that figure on a lengthy list of goods that may be used for military purposes. High-speed computers are part of that list -- anything with chips as fast as a Pentium IV, for instance, but not one with a Pentium III. 
Certain kinds of communication equipment fall under the 300-page list of "dual use" goods as well, but consumer goods like domestic appliances and farm equipment do not. 
United Nations officials will be responsible for culling items that fall within the list. Those that do will be forwarded to the sanctions committee, which will have 30 days to decide whether they can be allowed into Iraq. 
The resolution was the product of a compromise between the United States and Russia, Iraq's staunchest ally on the Council. 
The Russian ambassador, Sergey Lavrov, today praised the resolution as an important tool to restore Iraq's infrastructure, but said his country would continue to push for more. "It is only through the lifting of the sanctions that Iraq can rebuild its economy," he said.

HEADLINE: Bush Plans to Tighten Sanctions on Cuba, Not Ease Them 

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 14 

 BODY:
While Jimmy Carter called for easing sanctions against Cuba, President Bush said today that he would hew to a tough line when he speaks Monday on his policy toward Cuba.
 Officials said that Mr. Bush would speak at a fund-raiser in Miami and possibly to the Organization of American States in Washington, and that he would announce measures to strengthen the economic pressure and political isolation of President Fidel Castro's government. 
 The measures include stepping up enforcement of travel restrictions, promoting aid to dissidents and strengthening American government broadcasts of news and opinion, according to an official who follows the policy.
The United States also plans to ask European and Latin American nations, particularly Mexico and Spain, to help build support for Cuban critics of the government. 
Administration officials denied that Mr. Bush's announcements had been timed to embarrass the former president, Mr. Carter, who would just be ending his five-day trip to Cuba. But officials did acknowledge concern that Mr. Carter's trip might provide momentum for calls to ease American policy toward the Castro government. 
In Miami, Mr. Bush is to address a fund-raiser for the re-election campaign of his brother, Gov. Jeb Bush. South Florida is a bastion of Cuban exiles who oppose any softening toward Havana, and President Bush's remarks are likely to be warmly received.
The president is a strong supporter of the four-decade-old American trade embargo against Cuba. His stance has won him the devotion of a large swath of the Cuban-American community, without which he probably would not have won the state of Florida, and the presidency, in 2000.
President Bush, in remarks to the news media today during a visit of the prime minister of Malaysia, said his message on Cuba was not affected by Mr. Carter's visit. 
He foreshadowed the tough line he is expected to take on Monday, Cuba's independence day, saying, "My message to the Cuban people is: Demand freedom, and you've got a president who stands with you." 
While the president is preparing to increase the pressure against Cuba, his administration is caught in a debate over public allegations that Mr. Castro's government is developing biological weapons. 
After John R. Bolton, the undersecretary of state for arms control, made the allegation last week, both Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld distanced themselves from the accusation. Asked today if the administration had any evidence to support the allegation, the White House spokesman, Ari Fleischer, said only, "We have concerns."
The administration's new measures on Cuba, a result of a review ordered by the president, are intended to crack down on illicit American travel to the island and bolster internal opposition to the Castro government, officials said.
Otto J. Reich, the State Department's policy maker for Latin America, is expected to outline the measures at the White House on Monday, then fly to Miami to join President Bush. Mr. Reich was not available today, his spokesman said. 
But in remarks last week to the Council of the Americas, a business group, Mr. Reich said the policy review sought to "help accelerate Cuba's transition to democracy."
He added that the administration would maintain economic pressure against the Castro government. "The United States will continue supporting freedom in Cuba," Mr. Reich said. "We will not throw a lifeline to save a regime that is sinking under the weight of its own historic failures."
As a whole, the steps are relatively modest and represent little more than modifications of a policy in place. Officials decided to wait until Mr. Carter had left Cuba before announcing the measures so Mr. Carter's presence would not overshadow the policy statement.
It was not immediately clear how the administration intends to crack down further on illegal travel. Tens of thousands of Americans defy the ban each year, flying to Havana and Cuba's beach destinations from Canada, Mexico and the Bahamas. Another 137,000 authorized travelers went last year, including academics, journalists, students and Cuban-Americans on family visits, according to the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council in New York.
Over the past year, the administration has tried to stanch the flow of tourists, saying they say provide the Castro government with badly needed cash and, unlike the authorized travelers, do little to ease the burden of ordinary Cubans. The Treasury Department issued 766 civil penalties to travelers in 2001; in the last year of the Clinton administration, 188 fines were imposed.
But the tougher enforcement has clashed with growing pressure in Congress to lift the travel ban entirely, which in reality is a ban on spending money in Cuba. 
In a hearing in February, Senator Byron Dorgan, a North Dakota Democrat who advocates easing sanctions, presented the cases of two travelers who were fined: Marilyn Meister, a 75-year-old retired schoolteacher who went on a bike trip, and Cevin Allen, 56, who scattered his missionary parents' ashes at the Cuban church they helped found. Each was fined $7,500, which Senator Dorgan criticized as crimping Americans' freedoms while doing nothing to dislodge Mr. Castro.
"One would think when we're engaged in the war on terrorism, we would be going after terrorists, rather than tracking down little old ladies who are taking bicycle trips to Cuba," he said. "It's a terrible waste of resources."
On Wednesday a bipartisan group of House members plans to issue its own call to end travel restrictions as part of a broader effort to ease sanctions and increase cooperation with Cuba on security issues. The House has voted twice in two years to lift the travel ban, but the bills did not advance.
The so-called Cuba Working Group, which includes 17 Republicans and 17 Democrats, argues that the United States should engage Cuba at all levels just as it has worked with China and North Korea to improve conditions in those countries. 
The administration also intends to find new ways to help Cuba's dissidents. The goal is to make resources available for the disparate opposition groups -- including independent journalists, labor groups and the like -- so they can communicate better and use the United States as a conduit, according to a Congressional official who was briefed on the strategy.
"There's going to be a concerted effort to provide access to the Internet and improve communications in the island" for such people, the official said.
American diplomats will also try to raise the profile of dissidents by visiting them in their neighborhoods and native towns, rather than waiting for them to visit the American interests section in Havana, the official said.
The top American diplomat in Cuba, Vicki Huddleston, has enraged Cuban officials by distributing short-wave radios that can tune in Radio Marti, an American government broadcast. Officials also hope to find a way to beam TV Marti into Cuba; the television transmission, which costs about $10 million a year, has been jammed by Cuban censors since its inception.

Who, and What, Can Get Into Cuba
Under the Trading With the Enemy Act, Americans are forbidden to export goods to Cuba, except for publications and informational materials like CD's and works of art; donated food; and Commerce Department-licensed goods like food, medicine and medical supplies.
Cuban goods may not be imported into the United States, except for items valued at $100 or less carried by authorized travelers, and publications and artwork. Liquor and Cuban tobacco, including cigars, are forbidden.
According to Treasury Department regulations, the following categories of traveler are allowed to visit Cuba without special permission: government officials, journalists, professional researchers, certain athletes and people who visit relatives (which is allowed once a year).
The restrictions apply to students, academics and religious workers, but they can visit under licenses specifically granted to their schools or religious organizations.
Others must apply the Office of Foreign Assets Control in Washington for permission to travel to Cuba. An exception is travelers sponsored by a non-American government or organization.
Criminal penalties for violating the sanctions range up to 10 years in prison, $1 million in corporate fines and $250,000 in individual fines. Civil penalities up to $55,000 per violation may also be imposed.

HEADLINE: Senate Votes To Break Up Trade Pacts 

BYLINE:  By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 14 

 BODY:
The Senate scorned the threat of a Bush administration veto today, voting to amend trade legislation to permit separate votes on any provisions of new agreements that could weaken existing antidumping laws.
 The administration, like its predecessors, seeks a law to allow it to negotiate international trade agreements, with each house of Congress allowed just a single up-or-down vote with no amendments. The House passed such a bill by one vote in December, and until today the Senate had left that principle untouched. 
 So today three cabinet-level officials wrote the Senate to say the amendment that it was considering "would kill the bill's underlying purpose." The three, Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans, Agriculture Secretary Ann M. Veneman and Trade Representative Robert B. Zoellick, said other nations would not make trade deals if Congress could take them apart. 
President Bush's spokesman, Ari Fleischer, agreed, saying, "It would seriously undermine the cause and purpose of free trade." 
The Senate brushed off the objections. First 61 senators, including 16 Republicans, voted down an effort to kill the amendment, while 38 supported it. With an apparently filibusterproof majority facing them, the president's allies let the amendment pass on an unrecorded voice vote.
Senator Larry E. Craig of Idaho, an author of the amendment who is No. 3 in the Senate Republican leadership, said that he supported expanded trade but thought that other nations had "ganged up" to put Washington's antidumping laws on the agendas of any new trade negotiations. Mr. Craig said the amendment would help the administration fight off pressure to weaken them.
Senator Mark Dayton, the Minnesota Democrat who was a co-sponsor of the amendment, said although the administration, the House and many others thought that more trade was an unmixed blessing, "this amendment preserves Congress's ability to look out for the best interests of all Americans, especially the people who are on the losing side of the trade equation." 
"If we don't look out for them," Mr. Dayton said, "it is a near certainty that no one else will." 
The amendment approved today would allow a majority of the Senate to determine whether any provision of an agreement negotiated by the president using his enhanced authority weakens or overrides various trade laws, primarily the antidumping statute. If a majority says the provision does, that provision would be subject to separate votes that could uphold, kill or amend it. 
Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, denounced the plan, saying it would put the United States in the position of telling other countries that their policies were subject to negotiation but that "we're totally unwilling to negotiate on ours."
The sponsors said all they were doing was trying to improve a bill. But others like Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, said the legislation was necessary because "our country does not stand up for its economic interests." All administrations, Mr. Dorgan said, back trade almost automatically, reflecting "squishy-headed nonsense."
Despite the vote, it is far from clear that the veto that the cabinet officers recommended will ever be needed. Before the provision arrives on Mr. Bush's desk, the bill as a whole will have to pass the Senate, perhaps next week, and then survive a House-Senate conference. 
By not agreeing to a roll-call on the amendment, opponents built themselves an excuse for dropping it in a conference. Moreover, a majority of the Finance Committee, including two of the four highest-ranking Democrats, voted to kill the plan. The Senate conferees will be drawn from that panel, traditionally in order of seniority.
Although most of the Senate Republican leadership voted to kill the provision, the 16 who helped keep it alive included many members from states near Canada, which the administration recently ruled had been dumping lumber here. Several senators like Susan Collins of Maine, Robert C. Smith of New Hampshire and Gordon H. Smith of Oregon face serious re-election contests in the fall.
Mr. Dayton said of the vote: "This was about the people back in our states. It wasn't about the administration." 
The cabinet officers' letter insisted that the provision was unnecessary, because the bill specifically instructed the president to "preserve the ability of the United States to enforce rigorously its trade laws" and to "avoid agreements that lessen the effectiveness of domestic and international disciplines on unfair trade."
The officials said moves like the Canadian lumber declaration and tariffs on most imported steel showed its commitment.

HEADLINE: Mayor Sees Bigger Public-Private Partnerships 

BYLINE:  By TERRY PRISTIN 

 BODY:
In a sharp departure from the policies of his predecessor, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced several initiatives yesterday that are intended to encourage business improvement districts to play a bigger role in the city's economic growth.
 The mayor's warm embrace of the city's 44 business improvement districts, the public-private partnerships known as BID's, will end limits imposed during Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's final years in office, when the groups were subjected to a budget freeze. 
 Mr. Bloomberg said the city would support requests for increases in the groups' annual assessments -- charges the property owners in the improvement district agree to impose on themselves. The money, collected by the city as part of the tax bill, is used to supplement city services like street maintenance and security and to promote local businesses. Budget increases also have to be approved by the City Council. 
Since taking office in January, the mayor has said that business improvement districts can make a big difference in improving neighborhoods, particularly at a time when the city is strapped for money. Mr. Giuliani, initially a supporter of BID's, began clamping down on them when he feared that some were becoming too independent and powerful.
Speaking with reporters yesterday, Mr. Bloomberg sought to play down these differences with his predecessor, saying that Mr. Giuliani, operating under healthier economic conditions, had raised valid concerns about BID's. Ideally, Mr. Bloomberg said, the city would not need help from a handful of people who are not elected by the voters but would be able to provide all the services the public needs.
"In a perfect world," the mayor said, "that is a perfectly rational thing to try to do. But the economic climate that I've got is very different from the economic climate that Rudy had, and we just don't have that option. So I think we're going to have to depend on public-private partnerships more."
The mayor's strong statement of support was greeted with giddy enthusiasm by the many business improvement district leaders who applauded at several points during yesterday's announcement. "This is a great first step for us," said Barbara Askins, the president of the 125th Street BID in Harlem. Her group is asking the city for an increase of $250,000 over its current budget of $275,000. The extra money is needed to hire private security guards, mainly at night, she said.
Nineteen other BID's are also asking for increases, according to the Department of Business Services, the city agency that oversees the business groups. 
David Weprin of Queens, who is chairman of the Council's Finance Committee, said the Council would review each request independently. But he said that given the budget crisis, the BID's were likely to get a good reception. "We think the BID's do good things," he said.
Several of the policy changes unveiled yesterday are aimed at speeding the process of forming a BID. Under the Giuliani administration, it could have taken as long as two years before a local group could qualify for the formal application process, said Dawn Schneider, a spokeswoman for the Department of Business Services. The mayor said that the city would provide small amounts of seed money to finance the improvement-district-planning process in poor and middle-income neighborhoods.
Several neighborhoods are currently working on developing BID's, including 23rd Street in Manhattan, the Queens neighborhoods of Forest Hills and West Maspeth, and St. George in Staten Island, the only borough that does not have any BID's. 
Other Bloomberg initiatives would provide technical assistance and training for the improvement districts and showcase the groups' most creative and successful efforts.
Another would enable BID's to issue long-term debt for capital improvement projects like installing lampposts, a practice the previous administration put a stop to. "Some people don't like the idea," the mayor said. But he said the amount of money involved would amount to only a negligible portion of the city's debt.

HEADLINE: Aid Meant For the Hungry 

BYLINE:  By Roberta Cohen; Roberta Cohen is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Hunger still threatens millions in North Korea, and one symptom of the harsh conditions is the desperation of North Korean refugees trying in the past few days to elude Chinese police and seek asylum at American and Japanese consulates in China. As the Bush administration prepares to restart talks with North Korea, food, as well as weapons and troops, should be on the agenda. Despite the tense relationship between the two countries, the United States is the leading donor of food to North Korea, which cannot feed its 22 million people. American negotiators should insist on assurances that this aid is reaching those most in need.
 Since 1995, the United States has provided more than $500 million in food and other commodities to North Korea -- up to 350,000 metric tons of food each year. This year this aid is down to 155,000 metric tons because of demands for aid in Afghanistan; other countries are also sending less to North Korea. But American deliveries of food and fuel remain critical to Pyongyang. 
 Sending food aid has helped the United States persuade the North Koreans to engage in talks on military-strategic issues. The aid also shores up the Pyongyang regime, which Washington would rather see improve than collapse, since sudden disintegration could overwhelm South Korea with refugees and create political and economic turmoil. But there is also an overriding humanitarian imperative. More than 2 million North Koreans are reported to have died from starvation and related diseases between 1994 and 1998, and large pockets of hunger and starvation remain. At least 40 percent of children under 5 are malnourished, according to the World Food Program, a United Nations agency.
No one really knows, however, how much donated food is diverted to the North Korean military, police, Communist Party officials, essential workers and those loyal to the regime. The World Food Program argues that food aid is not going to the military because the military has the first cut from national harvests. But the agency has no evidence because there is no independent monitoring of donated food. As the main conduit of American aid, the World Food Program has managed to increase the number of North Korean counties it can visit to 163, but its staff is barred from more than 40, and its visits everywhere are supervised. It cannot make random spot checks or bring its own Korean-language interpreters or visit farmers' markets where it could find out whether its food aid is being sold on the black market.
At a Congressional hearing this month, the World Food Program claimed to have a "reasonable degree of assurance" that the food was getting to those who need it. But others at the hearing strongly disagreed. "Anyone who has sat and talked to the North Korean refugees would find it really difficult to believe the assurances of the W.F.P.," Sophie Delaunay, North Korean project representative for Doctors Without Borders, told Congress. In interviews by humanitarian groups and journalists in the past few years, refugees among the 100,000 to 200,000 who fled to China in search of food have said that they never got any donated food in North Korea and that the regime has denied food aid to those whose loyalty it questions.
It is time for the United States to set some standards. America must not be complicit in food distribution that favors some and discriminates against others. In the coming negotiations, the United States should insist upon unrestricted access to all areas of the country where food is delivered. It should require lists of the actual institutions to which food and medicines are going and uncontrolled access for the World Food Program. It should press the North Korean government to allow international aid groups to set up feeding stations of their own that are accessible to all hungry North Koreans.
The precarious situation of the North Koreans who have crossed into China should also be on the table. These desperate people foraging for food are treated as illegal immigrants and hunted down. When forcibly returned to North Korea, they may face imprisonment. 
North Korea wants economic aid and investment, and it desperately needs machinery, fertilizer and technical assistance to improve its agriculture and reform its inefficient collective farms. Equitable distribution of food aid should be a prime condition for such assistance.

HEADLINE: $350 Million Is Approved To Retain Businesses 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation approved a $350 million expansion of grant programs yesterday to encourage businesses to stay in downtown Manhattan or move there, raising the total available for those programs to more than $1 billion. 
 The approval was less than half what city and state economic development officials had requested, however. 
 The deliberations illustrated the relationships among the agencies working to rebuild the World Trade Center site. The decisions also suggest that those agencies are not cooperating as well as officials have repeatedly said. 
Most curiously, yesterday's events produced the odd equivalent of a parent asking a child for allowance money, only to be turned down. 
The Empire State Development Corporation, the state's economic development agency, had asked for a total of $828 million for retention programs from the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, the agency charged with rebuilding downtown after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11. Legally, Empire State Development is the governmental parent of the Lower Manhattan group.
The grant request was made jointly with the city's Economic Development Corporation, a mayoral agency whose boss, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, appointed half the development corporation's board members.
The city and state went to Lower Manhattan Development to ask for the money because the two economic development groups have already allocated, if not spent, the $700 million that Congress provided to Empire State Development in the down payment on President Bush's promise of $20 billion for the recovery of New York City.
John C. Whitehead, chairman of Lower Manhattan Development, did not rule out the agency's eventually approving all the request for money from the city and state. He and other directors said, however, that they wanted to grant the $350 million first, and then see how the programs attract and retain businesses before handing over more money. 
Some of the money in the expanded program will go to help very small businesses, which were excluded from previously approved grant programs, the agencies said in their request. Under the new program, downtown businesses with one to nine employees will be eligible for up to $5,000 per employee in recovery grants.
Mr. Whitehead and Frank Zarb, the head of the board's audit committee, said they would like to see a report on the use of the initial allocation and any results of the programs it pays for. Of the $1.5 billion in business retention programs that the city and state hope to provide, about two-thirds of the money is to go to companies with fewer than 200 employees.
After Empire State Development received the first federal payment of $700 million, Congress approved the allocation of another $2 billion, but that money was specifically allocated to Lower Manhattan Development. Officials in Washington say that New York's two Democratic senators made certain that the legislation specified that the money go to the Lower Manhattan group, headed by Mr. Whitehead, rather than to Empire State Development, which is headed by Charles A. Gargano, an appointee of Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican.
There has also been some grumbling among Lower Manhattan Development board members about public remarks by city and state officials that seemed to assume that they would have access to the $2 billion allocated to the Lower Manhattan group.
The development corporation said it would hold a public hearing next week on its principles and its blueprint for rebuilding.
The hearing is scheduled for 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. Thursday at Pace University's Michael Schimmel Center for the Arts, across Park Row from City Hall.
The public hearing is the second announced by the development corporation in recent weeks. Unlike the previously announced event, scheduled for late July, next week's hearing will allow for public comment on redevelopment issues before the corporation begins to narrow options being developed by its own planners and others outside the corporation. Rebuilding officials said an outside planner would be chosen by the end of next week to assist in drawing up development plans.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
The muscle-bound dollar, a pillar of the strong American expansion during the last decade, may have turned into an Achilles' heel.

BYLINE:  By Jeff Madrick; Jeff Madrick is the editor of Challenge Magazine and of a new journal of social health, Indicators. Both publications are based in Armonk, N.Y. He is an adjunct professor of humanities at Cooper Union. E-mail: challenge@mesharpe.com.

 BODY:
THE dollar has long been the wild card in the economic outlook. Its surprising strength in the 1990's helped keep inflation in check by reducing import prices. A high dollar also attracted hundreds of billions of dollars in investment to compensate for the low savings rate among Americans. And while the dollar rose more than 40 percent since 1995, the gross domestic product kept growing strongly, anyway. The high dollar greatly raised world prices for the nation's manufacturing exports, but record trade deficits only partly offset other fast-growing components of G.D.P.
 This pattern, however, has long been too good to stay true. As the expansion shows signs of weakness, it is time to encourage a modest decline in the dollar to stoke manufacturing sales, which have been hit hard by the high dollar. 
 It is also time to recognize the serious imbalances the strong dollar has created. The United States owes trillions of dollars of debt it took on to finance current account deficits. As important, the high dollar has done longer-term damage to some industries by discouraging investment in globally competitive goods. 
Those most hurt are lining up in Washington to demand relief. Jerry Jasinowski, head of the National Association of Manufacturers, testified before Congress recently that the high dollar cost manufacturers $140 billion and 500,000 jobs the last 18 months. Thomas Palley, assistant director of policy at the A.F.L.-C.I.O., points out that more than 90 percent of lost jobs in the current recession were manufacturing jobs, though such jobs account for only 14 percent of total employment.
But although vested interests may be clouding the debate, the arguments for a lower dollar are persuasive. The first is that a high dollar is going to restrain the expansion. America's rapid growth began in the mid-1990's, let us remember, when the dollar was 40 percent lower. Moreover, the last time the dollar was as high as it is now, in the early 1980's, manufacturing profits were at a low point. Profit rates did not begin to rise until the late 1980's, a couple of years after the Reagan administration arranged the Plaza Accord to bring the dollar down sharply -- by some 50 percent, as it turned out.
When the dollar took off in the mid-1990's, manufacturing profit rates declined again. Capital investment remained high only because of the inflow of capital from abroad and high stock prices. But now, Mr. Jasinowki's member companies report that their exports are on average 25 percent more expensive than rival products from other nations. Investment is way down.
A second argument in favor of a lower dollar is that its level is unsustainable. As J. Fred Bergsten of the Institute of International Economics points out, the nation must import $4 billion in capital a day to compensate for its current account deficit and capital outflows. Moreover, stocks are unlikely to attract as much capital as they did in the 1990's.
Mr. Bergsten is concerned that if the nation does not act now, a sharper fall is decidedly possible. The trade deficit has reached 4 percent of G.D.P. -- not merely unprecedented in recent times but a point at which it has almost always become unsustainable in other nations. If the dollar falls too far too fast, it could ignite inflation and influence the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates so high as to weaken the economy. 
A third argument, too often ignored, is that over an extended period, a high dollar misallocates capital resources. Some export industries are neglected, while those that import low-price supplies, often services, attract more investment than is optimal. The 1990's boom disguised this impact, but it is harder to reduce a trade deficit when companies do not develop new export products because those products will be chronically overpriced in the world market. Technology-intensive industries have long run a substantial trade surplus, for example, but Mr. Jasinowski calculates they are now importing $20 billion more in goods than they are exporting.
If the nation continues to grow much more rapidly than its trading partners do, there is an argument that the high dollar can be maintained. But almost certainly the gap in growth rates will narrow, if not turn in favor of other countries, in coming years. By traditional measures, Mr. Jasinowski, Mr. Palley and Mr. Bergsten argue that the dollar is overvalued 20 to 25 percent. Mr. Bergsten would like to see the Treasury "lean against the wind" and even buy undervalued currencies, like the euro or yen.
Dollar policies usually make economists nervous. Some say intervention usually does not work, in part because it is offset by shifts in the money supply. But Mr. Bergsten notes that intervention did indeed work during the Plaza Accord and several times during the Clinton administration, including a coordinated action to lower the yen in 1995. 
The greater danger is that a change in dollar policy could precipitate a run on the dollar and the very collapse we fear most. Again, Mr. Bergsten says such routs have been stemmed in the past. In 1987, for example, central banks bought dollars after a two-year slide. 
There is no way to avoid risks when it comes to influencing currency levels. The question is whether the risk of dollar neglect is greater than the risk of pushing it down. Given questions about the strength of this expansion, the rapidly growing trade deficit and enormous levels of foreign debt, ignoring the high dollar will only make matters worse in a year or two.
A lower dollar might even help the Europeans. While it would make their exports less competitive, it would enable the European Central Bank to reduce Europe's high interest rates because inflation would be less a threat.
It is time to face forthrightly the imbalances created in the late 1990's rather than resort to outworn shibboleths about how the markets must set currency rates.

HEADLINE: Consumer Prices Rose in April; Factories Busier for a 4th Month 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 15 

 BODY:
Factories were busier in April and consumer prices posted their sharpest rise in nearly a year, according to reports released today, a sign the recovery was gaining traction.
 The Federal Reserve said today that industrial production rose 0.4 percent in April, a fourth consecutive monthly gain that partly reflected a pickup in car production. 
 Separately, the Labor Department reported that consumer prices increased 0.5 percent in April, the biggest gain since a matching rise in May of last year. Analysts had expected a 0.4 percent gain. 
A hefty 10 percent rise in gasoline costs helped push the Consumer Price Index up, but even excluding volatile food and energy prices, the price index advanced 0.3 percent.
Analysts said the reports did not signal an outbreak of inflation and that the Fed would probably wait until August to raise interest rates.
Paul Cherney, an analyst at S.& P. Marketscope, said that the Fed would hold off until it was sure that the recovery was in place and solid.
With industrial output rising, the amount of production capacity in use also rose, to 75.5 percent in April from a revised 75.3 percent in March.
A third report showed businesses trimmed inventories for the 14th consecutive month in March, suggesting there might be a need to increase production to keep pace with demand. The Commerce Department said business inventories declined 0.3 percent in March as sales rose 0.3 percent.
The sharp rise in the cost of gasoline in April, which built on an 8.0 percent increase in March, was one factor behind a 4.5 percent gain in energy prices and helped push transportation costs up 1.7 percent.
Food prices in April rose 0.1 percent, weighed down by a 1.8 percent plunge in fruit and vegetable prices, which had risen sharply in the first three months.
The 0.3 percent rise in prices excluding food and energy was an acceleration from the 0.1 percent gain in March -- a pickup the Labor Department attributed to a larger increase in housing costs and an upturn in tobacco prices.

HEADLINE: In Newark, Newcomer's Allure Can't Topple Local Favorite 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW JACOBS 

DATELINE: NEWARK, May 15 

 BODY:
He was outspent by half a million dollars. He lagged in the latest polls by as many six percentage points. And perhaps most galling of all, Sharpe James -- for 32 years a fixture in politics here -- was cast by his opponent as a machine-backed dinosaur who had failed the city by ignoring the common folk as he brought better times to the downtown area.
 But with his solid victory over Councilman Cory Booker on Tuesday, Mr. James once again proved the power of incumbency and showed that while Mr. Booker was charming donors and celebrities across the nation, the mayor was still viewed as the hometown favorite. Mr. James, who overcame the most forceful and expensive challenge of his life, won with 53 percent of the vote to Mr. Booker's 47 percent. 
 Rather than bask in the victory of a historic fifth term, Mr. James spent most of today out of the public eye. He canceled an afternoon news conference but made an unexpected visit to the steps of City Hall, where he was surrounded by cameras and an adoring citizenry. "I'm going to keep building on the progress," he said when asked about his plans for the next four years. "We've got a lot more work to do." 
That work, he said, includes a war on drugs and street crime, and improving an ailing school system. When asked about the downtown arena that his patron, Gov. James E. McGreevey, had promised to deliver as an inducement to would-be defectors, the showman in Mr. James took over.
"Everyone's going to get a job," he shouted to the crowd, which exploded with whoops. "I might even be selling hot dogs at the arena."
With that, he dashed onto a passing bus to shake some hands and then sped away in a waiting car. But if Mr. James did not spend much time analyzing his hard-fought victory, there were plenty of pundits, both professional and unpaid, eager to dissect the reasons Mr. Booker's candidacy fell short. In the end, the experts agreed, Mr. Booker simply could not wear away the popularity and loyalty that Mr. James had earned during a lifetime in local politics.
"Cory needed to pop the bubble of James's invincibility," said Jeff Plaut, a pollster for Mr. Booker. "It was really an uphill battle, especially because so many voters had a favorable view of their mayor." 
Yet popularity, incumbency and the backing of the Democratic Party establishment alone did not carry Mr. James to victory. For the first time in his political career, Mr. James was compelled to hire campaign strategists who worked hard to turn his opponent's suburban origins into a curse, convincing many African-American voters that Mr. Booker would somehow betray the city on his way to higher office. Many residents cited Mr. James's claim that Mr. Booker, backed by out-of-town money and lauded by some conservative opinion writers, was a Republican interloper disguised as a selfless public servant.
"This race wasn't about Sharpe James," said Carolyn Wallace, 67, a lifelong resident who runs a youth center. "This was about Cory Booker versus us. You can't bring in a bunch of out-of-towners and white lawyers and tell me how to vote."
Indeed, an analysis of the 54,000 votes cast in the nonpartisan election showed that Mr. James did exceedingly well in the South, West and Central Wards, neighborhoods dominated by African Americans, who make up more than half of the city's population. Mr. Booker fared better among the whites and Hispanics who in the East and North Wards.
Ronald L. Lester, a Washington-based pollster who worked for Mr. James, said the campaign decided to focus on black voters rather than the other groups in the electoral pie. In the race's final days, the campaign had the voices of the Rev. Al Sharpton, Jesse L. Jackson Jr., and Representative Donald Payne, Newark's congressman, in its calls to voters.
In the Central Ward, the district that Mr. Booker has represented since 1998, the final tally favored the incumbent by more than 900 votes.
Michelle Hopkins, a tenant of Garden Spires, the Central Ward complex where Mr. Booker once based a hunger strike aimed at drawing more police protection, said little had changed since Mr. Booker and the television cameras left three years ago. "I supported him once but he promised more than he delivered," she said. "He used us in his ads. He used us for his career."
So when Ms. Hopkins, an unemployed administrative assistant, was offered $200 to work for Mr. James throughout Election Day, she gladly accepted. Today, however, she was not in a celebratory mood. Standing in front of City Hall, she said campaign officials had reneged on the arrangement and were now offering just $100 for 20 hours of work. A few yards away at Mayor James's headquarters, dozens of other workers were voicing similar complaints.
"I was used the last time, and I'm not going to get used again," she said, scanning the sidewalk for a glimpse of the mayor. "Right now, I'm not happy with any politician."

HEADLINE: Town Rallies to Save Its Grocery and Its Vitality 

BYLINE:  By JOHN W. FOUNTAIN 

DATELINE: BLUE HILL, Neb., May 15 

 BODY:
The brick arches outside Price's Supermarket are still charred at the edges. But the glow of fluorescent light inside this town's only grocery store, which burned more than a year ago, and the flow of traffic on Gage Street said the store that this community of 800 rallied to rebuild was again open for business.
 For its owners, Marvin and Peggy Price, rebuilding seemed impossible after the fire 16 months ago. But the town raised $94,000 to help reconstruct the 1887 building, and that, coupled with grants and loans, led to the groundbreaking for a new store last August. 
 The shelves are now stocked, the doors open and the hopes of this farming town restored.
This afternoon, the local high school jazz band played at a celebration to mark the reopening, and Gov. Mike Johanns praised the efforts of residents here, about 130 miles west-southwest of Lincoln. Nearly 200 people turned out for the official grand opening, although the store opened for business on March 26.
"It means a whole lot," Mayor Russ Willems said. "You can tell just in the last month since it opened up, the difference in the traffic on main street. It's just a central point. People come for groceries, and then they'll stop at the drugstore, they'll stop at the bank, they stop at the lumberyard."
Mr. Willems, like many others here, had believed that without a grocery store Blue Hill would wither and die.
There was life here today. The smell of free popcorn and pizza, the Prices' way of showing appreciation to their town, hung in the air. Throngs of residents sat outside the store in the middle of the street for the hourlong ceremony. 
"When the supermarket burned down, this community faced an important decision that might just have been the turning point in the history of the community," Governor Johanns told the crowd. "There was an opportunity there that day to throw in the towel and watch a vital, main-street business fade into history. You folks rolled up your sleeves and you went to work and you impressed people at all levels of government."
Earlier this afternoon, inside the store, there was the ring of the register, the clang of shopping carts and the chatter of shoppers. Mr. Price strolled through the store, pointing to the new freezers, to the new deli, to the butcher's stand and the 60-foot-long aisles.
"We've got a beautiful building here," he said. "It just makes the town whole now." It seemed hard for him not to smile.
Under a plan developed by residents and officials, a local nonprofit organization called the Blue Hill Community Foundation financed the new building with the help of federal and state grants and low-interest loans. The building is leased to the Prices for 1 percent of gross sales, or $8,000 to $10,000 a year. Replacing the building cost $649,000, with the Prices paying an additional $300,000 to restock and equip the store. 
Mr. Price had predicted that the additional space and the deli would bring a 15 percent increase in sales, but he said sales had already risen 25 percent. The store employs 12 full-time or part-time workers, including Mr. and Mrs. Price.
With Price's closed, residents had to shop in Hastings or Red Cloud, each nearly a half-hour drive away. The absence of grocery shoppers reduced traffic in town. Already, many here say, there are signs of economic revival.
"It's great for our business, too," said Ronald J. Karmazin, who runs the pharmacy across the street from Price's. "It brings a lot of people back into the community from the surrounding areas to shop in Blue Hill."
That is already evident.
"When I'm short on things, when I'm low on items, it's wonderful. I can come up here. I don't have to make a trip so far away to get stuff," said Mary Pohlmeier, a cook at Blue Hill Community School, who stopped at Price's this afternoon for eggs, flour and paper plates. "It's kind of an older community, and the convenience is just wonderful." 
The Prices, who have three sons, admit to some selfish reasons for wanting to rebuild. Mrs. Price, 43, is the fourth generation in her family to run a supermarket in Blue Hill. Her great-grandfather built the store, though all that remains of the original building are the landmark arches. In saving the store, Mrs. Price has hopes of a fifth generation running the family business.
For Mr. Price, the motivation was even simpler.
"I wanted to raise my family in Blue Hill," he said.

HEADLINE: Study Finds an Oversupply of Neonatal Doctors 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: BOSTON, May 15 

 BODY:
A study of death rates among newborns finds strikingly few differences from region to region and suggests that far too many doctors and hospital units specialize in intensive care of premature or sickly babies.
 Only newborns in areas with the very fewest specialists die at a higher rate than elsewhere. But once a certain threshold of care is reached, having more doctors offers no advantage, the study says. 
 The researchers said this oversupply was not only a waste of medical resources but might even be harmful, because it might subject babies to unnecessary tests and treatments.
The findings "raise disturbing issues regarding the nation's unquestioning acceptance that more is always better with respect to the supply of specialist physicians and hospital technology," said Dr. Kevin Grumbach, a public health researcher at the University of California at San Francisco, who wrote an editorial to accompany the findings, to be published Thursday in The New England Journal of Medicine.
The researchers, at Dartmouth Medical School in Hanover, N.H., found that areas where the supply of neonatal specialists ranged widely -- from 4.3 to 11.6 per 10,000 births -- all had about the same newborn death rates. Even the most premature babies were found to die at roughly the same rate in these areas. The supply of neonatal intensive-care hospital beds made no difference in death rates around the country.
"Enough may be enough," said Dr. David Goodman, the pediatrician who led the study.
The neonatal-care specialty has boomed since the 1970's, thanks to new technology and therapies, including ventilators designed for premature newborns and prenatal drugs that help fetuses' lungs develop. But the researchers suggested that social and economic factors had expanded the field beyond pure medical need. For doctors, the specialty can be gratifying, exciting and well-paying. For hospitals, it is a lucrative and prestigious business.
Because of the oversupply, the researchers said, some relatively healthy newborns may be subjected to unneeded tests and treatments that could prove harmful.
"If I have a healthy full-term baby, I actually don't want anyone messing around with that baby," Dr. Grumbach said. "There's a downside where we meddle too much."

HEADLINE: ADMITTING ERRORS, ARAFAT PROMISES WAVE OF REFORM 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: RAMALLAH, West Bank, May 15 

 BODY:
Yasir Arafat responded today to growing Palestinian and international pressure for reform by acknowledging mistakes and promising changes to his administration and new elections, though he presented scant details.
 But his pledges to move ahead with reforms were unlikely to sway an Israeli government and army convinced that no promises from Mr. Arafat are credible. 
 A senior Israeli military official said today in Washington that the Bush administration's plans to send George J. Tenet, the director of central intelligence, to the region were pointless because Israel would never trust any Palestinian security force controlled by Mr. Arafat, even one that Mr. Tenet helped build. Page A12. 
The Palestinian leader spoke a day after Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel demanded reform as a condition for negotiations. But Mr. Arafat appeared to be responding more to American pressure and to a rising clamor among Palestinians for change, including elections and improvements in fighting corruption, in separation of powers and in civil freedoms. Many long-simmering frustrations are suddenly boiling over.
"This is the right time for change and reform, despite all the attempts to undermine our efforts," Mr. Arafat said in a speech here to the Palestinian Legislative Council. "This is the time for work, for building."
The speech fell on the annual Palestinian commemoration of the Nakba, or catastrophe, as they call the 1948 declaration of Israeli independence in what they consider their homeland. A year ago, thousands of Palestinians demonstrated in downtown Ramallah. Today, perhaps 200 people showed up, and Mr. Arafat made only passing reference to it in his speech, which pivoted from a grim account of the recent struggle with Israel to his proposals for the future, blending promises of change with appeals for patience.
The developing change in Palestinian politics, which is seen as no immediate threat to Mr. Arafat's hold on power, was reflected in legislators' pleased but skeptical reception of the speech. Applause for his call for elections turned to gentle laughter when he suggested there was no hurry, adding, "We should be responsible -- we should implement what we can."
"This is great," Ahmad al-Deek, a longtime member of Mr. Arafat's Fatah movement, said afterward. But, he added, "We don't want programs. We want practical steps."
Some advocates of governmental reform fear that the sudden interest at the top may be less a reflection of desire for change than of hope that it can be shaped to benefit the current leadership.
Nader Said, a sociologist at Bir Zeit University, said that some potential beneficiaries of reform were "the people who are behind the corruption. So how can we trust them again to lead the society on a democratic basis?"
Nabil Amr, who resigned last week as Mr. Arafat's minister of parliamentary affairs, citing a lack of reform, said, "We must see what he will do on the ground. We need a new government." Mr. Amr, long viewed as a member of Mr. Arafat's circle, is suspected by other Palestinian politicians and political analysts of trying to leap to the head of the parade -- evidence, in any event, of the political dynamic at work.
Abdul Jawad Saleh, a leader of the legislative opposition, waved a copy of a speech that he said Mr. Arafat gave more than a year ago. "It's the same," he said, "only now it's more detailed." He added, "Nothing he said last year he has implemented."
Mr. Saleh said of Mr. Arafat: "He's not serious. He's serious when there is pressure against him." He called for demonstrations and civil disobedience by Palestinians to express what he called their desire for "real and substantive reforms and freedoms," noting a lack of freedom of the press.
But Mr. Saleh warned that Israeli and American demands "make it harder" for advocates of reform by making them appear to serve foreign interests. 
Some Palestinian politicians, including members of Fatah, have called for years for civic reform. Hussam Khader, a Palestinian legislator from Nablus, has derided Mr. Arafat's intimates as "the Oslo Economic Party," a reference to corruption he believes was fostered by the Oslo peace process.
In his speech, Mr. Arafat repeated his stated opposition to attacks on Israeli civilians, saying that "they do not serve our interests."
Some of the men prompting calls for reform may be among those who gain from it. Many Palestinians are angry with Muhammad Rashid, a financial adviser to Mr. Arafat who has served as a conduit to Israel by meeting with Mr. Sharon's son, Omri. Mr. Rashid is linked to Muhammad Dahlan, the chief of Palestinian security in Gaza, who has emerged as a favorite of Mr. Arafat. 
Mr. Dahlan has been chafing at the lack of promotion within the Palestinian Authority as aging ministers cling to their portfolios.
Another ally of those officials, Hanan Asfour, a Palestinian minister, was badly beaten outside his home here by five masked men on Sunday, in a sign of the intensity of the jockeying for power.
Mr. Arafat has been sharply criticized by many Palestinians for permitting 13 Palestinians accused by Israel of terrorism to be sent into exile to resolve the 39-day standoff at the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem. Mr. Rashid was involved in striking that deal. Obliquely referring to such criticism today, Mr. Arafat said that only he should be blamed for any mistakes. 
"I am telling you, if there is a mistake, I am responsible," he said, in a highly unusual acknowledgment. But, he added, "There is no movement without mistakes in the whole world."
Israel's president, Moshe Katsav, said after Mr. Arafat's speech: "Leaders are allowed to make mistakes -- it's only human. But the problem with Arafat is that he consciously and deliberately makes these mistakes."
Palestinians are dispirited by the overwhelming Israeli military offensive and by their dwindling economy, some Palestinian leaders said. "What's frustrating is the political situation and the leadership, which did not achieve what it is calling for," said Jamal Barghouti, a Fatah activist.
In his speech, Mr. Arafat called on the legislators to make "a review that touches all our aspects of life." After ignoring the bill for 18 months, Mr. Arafat on Tuesday signed into a law a measure granting judicial independence.
After Mr. Sharon made his demand for Palestinian reform on Tuesday, some Israeli politicians suggested that he was asking too much of the Palestinian Authority, which has been crippled by the conflict with Israel. But Palestinian politicians said today that real reform would speed their pursuit of a state.
They may lack a state, but the Palestinians have established a formidable bureaucracy. Mr. Arafat oversees 28 ministries, from agriculture to youth and athletics. Many Palestinians complain that they get little help from the administration, but they also blame the Israeli incursions and their blockades of Palestinian areas.
Palestinians have not held elections since January 1996, when they voted for the president, Mr. Arafat, and 88 members of the legislative council. Israel would have to ease its restrictions for elections to be held.
The Bush administration has been urging reform of the Palestinian Authority, with particular attention to the multiple security agencies. But it recently balked at a French proposal for prompt elections, fearing that extremists would gain. 
Mr. Said, the sociologist, said of the prospect of elections, "What is missing is the more liberal, secular, democratic faction, which is not very organized."
He said that the United States views Arab states only as corrupt clients or fundamentalist dictatorships. "They can't see that there is a potentially vibrant democratic movement in the Arab world," he said.

HEADLINE: ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: THE ENERGY MARKET; 
Power Giants Have Trouble Raising Cash For Plants

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
Accused of accounting chicanery and illegally inflating power prices, companies that generate much of the nation's electricity have lost the confidence of investors. For the moment, they are finding it nearly impossible to raise money for new plants, raising the risk of future power shortages, industry experts say.
 The stock prices and credit ratings of independent power producers, the companies that are building most new power plants nationwide, have plunged since the collapse of Enron. The crisis has worsened in the last week, amid new disclosures about aggressive business and accounting practices in the sector. 
 In the short run, the effect on the nation's power supply will be limited. Scores of new plants have been built since 1999, and supply exceeds electricity demand by a comfortable margin nationally. 
But if the companies cannot regain the trust of Wall Street and Washington, plant construction may stall for years, leaving some regions short of power later this decade, experts say.
"There is a serious question in my mind about financing the next cycle of power plants," said Paul Joskow, an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and an expert on electricity deregulation. "You're crippling a sector that was supposed to be an engine of investment for these plants."
The turbulence worsened last week when three companies -- Dynegy, Reliant Resources and CMS Energy -- said they had misled Wall Street by exaggerating the size of their electricity trading divisions. Federal regulators, meanwhile, released documents that appear to show that Enron tried to force up prices in California at the height of the power crisis.
Yesterday, CMS Energy said that it had overstated its revenue by $3.4 billion, or 35 percent, last year as a result of sham electricity trades. An additional $1 billion in phantom trades were made in 2000, the company said. 
Standard & Poor's said yesterday that many power producers might face a cash squeeze if their credit ratings dropped further. The bad news knocked shares in several companies -- including CMS, Reliant, Aquila and Dynegy -- to 52-week lows.
"We need to have a healthy environment between the companies and the regulators and the consumers," said Steven Fleishman, a utility analyst at Merrill Lynch. "There needs to be some basis of trust. And there's obviously been tremendous damage done on that trust."
Wall Street's skepticism about the sector is a sudden change from its attitude only a few months ago, when investors flooded power producers with cash. Last year alone, Calpine raised $5.7 billion from investors to support a $15 billion plan to become the nation's largest power company. Calpine, based in San Jose, Calif., said it planned to build plants with a total capacity of 70,000 megawatts, almost 10 percent of United States production. Mirant, Reliant, Dynegy, and other producers raised tens of billions of dollars more.
But the collapse of Enron caused investors to take a hard look at the accounting practices and heavy debt loads carried by other big power producers. They discovered that the companies had used a variety of accounting gimmicks to make their balance sheets look healthier and their sales and profits seem larger than was really the case.
In some cases, the companies had created special partnerships that enabled them to reduce the debt they had to disclose to investors. In others, they had announced energy trades that did not really exist, increasing their reported sales.
The practices appear to have stemmed from the companies' desire to report fast growth in sales and earnings as a way of persuading investors to finance new plants.
Now, short on cash and under heavy political pressure, the independent producers are postponing or canceling those plants. In March, Calpine canceled 35 orders for natural gas turbines from General Electric and delayed the delivery of 81 other turbines. Calpine said the cuts would lower its capital spending by $3 billion over the next two years. Over all, General Electric plans to build 150 turbines for the United States market next year, down from 284 last year, a spokesman said. The number will shrink again in 2004.
Investment in new power lines, which are badly needed to bring power to several major cities, including New York and San Francisco, has also lagged.
By the middle of this decade, spot power shortages are possible on hot days, Mr. Fleishman said. He added that he was less concerned about generating capacity than about building new transmission lines to get power where it is needed. Paying for those lines is a complex issue that has been pushed off regulators' agendas by the crisis in the independent producers' sector, he said.
"The focus on replaying issues in California and such is taking away attention from the biggest near-term issue in terms of infrastructure need in the sector, which is transmission," Mr. Fleishman said. "We don't have enough transmission in some areas, including downstate New York," or New York City and Long Island.
The long-term risk of power shortages may vary widely by region, Mr. Fleishman said. In states like Texas, where new plants can be built more quickly, the recent cancellations and deferrals will probably not result in problems because they can quickly be reversed if the power market tightens. But in states like New York, where building plants is difficult, deferrals could have a bigger impact.
"Longer term, this is a hugely capital-intensive industry that is going to need access to capital, and that access is now being cut off, and that's not good," he said.
The North American Electric Reliability Council, an umbrella group that works with the industry and federal government to supervise the power grid, is now assessing the impact of the cancellations. It expects to have a report out within a month.
Because of the recent construction boom, most of the United States should meet demand until 2006, said Douglas M. Logan, principal at Platt's Research and Consulting. But if the independent power sector remains weak, after that "we may see high prices or even shortages before construction kicks in again," he said. New York City, the mid-Atlantic region, the upper Midwest and California could see problems sooner, he added.
Eric Hirst, a Tennessee consultant who has worked with dozens of power producers and state regulators, said the slowdown in plant construction was not unexpected. The boom in building that began in 1999 was unsustainable, he said.
"My sense is that six months ago the announced megawatts planned was way more than we needed, and was going to lead to a glut in the market," he said. "The cancellations are necessary."
In addition, the industry can extend the lives of older plants, and the economic slowdown and Internet slump has caused demand for power to flatten, Mr. Hirst said. Moreover, if prices begin to rise in anticipation of shortages, companies will scramble to put new plants in place, he said.
"If we're serious about competition on the generation end, we're going to have to accept that it's investors who are going to make the decision whether plants are built," he said. "I still am a believer in competition, although it gets harder and harder to say that with a straight face after the California problems."
Since the early 1990's, the United States has gradually deregulated its electricity industry, which was once a strictly regulated group of local monopolies. Under the old system, utilities like Con Edison were responsible for making sure they owned enough generating plants to supply power to all their customers. In return, the utilities had a monopoly on selling power in their service area, and state regulators set rates at a price high enough to cover their costs and leave a profit.
But as electric rates soared in the 1980's, especially in the Northeast and California, industry experts and some big users of power complained that the regulated system had failed and demanded the right to pick their own electric suppliers.
In response to the criticism, many states forced utilities to sell most of their generating plants. Now, instead of generating their own power, the utilities buy it for consumers on newly created wholesale markets. And instead of being fixed, the price of electricity rises and falls with demand. This change has been largely invisible to consumers, since in most states retail rates are still fixed.
But over the next few years, retail rates in several states will be deregulated, and consumers will pay prices that rise and fall along with the wholesale market -- as ratepayers in New York City, which is served by Con Edison, already do.
If deregulation is to move forward, the independent producers need to rebuild trust among regulators and investors, Mr. Logan said. "These companies need to show that they're managed well, they have good assets, their assets are competitive in the market, and they're not playing financial games."

HEADLINE: A Race to Vote On a Budget In Albany 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 15 

 BODY:
Operating in closed meetings, state lawmakers today began absorbing details of the gargantuan budget bills negotiated by their leaders. The legislators, juggling dozens of dollar figures largely in their heads, were to begin voting on the bills Thursday morning. 
 Late tonight, the administration released some details of the $89.6 billion plan that has been hammered out in secret meetings between the legislative leaders and the governor over the last two weeks. The talks have not included rank-and-file legislators, who tonight still had yet to be given details on paper. Nor had they seen the bills, although the leaders had briefed them extensively. 
 State aid to local schools will increase about $440 million above what Gov. George E. Pataki proposed in January, with $4 of every $10 going to New York City. All told, spending will rise about 6 percent, but the portion paid for with state revenues will rise only 3 percent.
The budget depends heavily on spending about $1.2 billion of the state's savings, borrowing hundreds of millions and using about $1 billion in other one-time revenues. These pools of money will let the state avert deep cuts in services and proceed with planned tax cuts at a time when income tax revenues have dropped because of last year's recession and the terrorist attack.
"I believe we have done a very good job under circumstances that were less than ideal,"said the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat.
Some lawmakers said they feared that the government would face a huge shortfall next year because the budget includes at least $2 billion in revenues that will not recur.
"It's a lousy budget," said Assemblyman William L. Parment, a Jamestown Democrat. "It's a budget that relies too heavily on borrowing and one-shot revenues, very similar to the bad budgets that we did back in the late 1980's and early 1990's."
But Governor Pataki defended the use of state reserves and other one-time revenues to get through hard times. "All in all, in an extraordinarily difficult year, this is a great budget," he said.
Some of the nine bills detailing that budget went to the printers today, though some fine print on other bills had yet to be worked out late tonight.
The budget does not raise income or business taxes, but it does raise about $86 million by increasing fees or imposing surcharges on everything from hunting licenses to cellphones. It also expands the state cigarette tax to include cigars and chewing tobacco. 
Late Tuesday night, the leaders agreed on an early retirement program that had eluded them. The state would offer early retirement to most civil servants who are 55 and have served 25 years, excluding the police and other workers the governor deems essential. The governor would also be able to offer incentives to other workers at his discretion. The buyouts should save the state $55 million and remove 5,000 workers from the payroll, officials said. The retirement program is also available to local governments.
Negotiators failed to agree on a number of issues but agreed to pass the budget anyway in the hope of working out those sticking points later. The budget will not give Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg control over the New York City school system as some city lawmakers had hoped. Neither will it force the city to devote a greater share of its annual revenues to the schools.
"There is no agreement at this point on school governance," Assemblyman Steven Sanders of Manhattan said. "There are still some nettlesome issues that have to be discussed." 
Another impasse was over the Superfund, a state program that cleans up toxic waste sites. The governor wanted to provide $90 million for the fund and change the cleanup standards in some cases. The Democrats in control of the Assembly argued for a $200 million program with no change to the standards. 
In the end, the budget includes only $11 million to keep paying the Superfund staff for another year. This is the second year in a row the fund has not been replenished, and environmental officials have been unable to start cleaning up 800 hazardous waste sites.
"It's terrible," said Michael Livermore, a lobbyist for the New York Public Interest Research Group. "It's just stranding thousands of families."
So confused was the state of affairs late last night that aides to the governor and legislative leaders could not agree on the language for a news release outlining the basic details of the final agreement.
The Democrats who control the Assembly won a significant increase at the negotiating table for the New York City schools. Mr. Pataki's January proposal would have cut $40 million in state aid for the city schools. The city now will not only receive about $200 million in additional operating aid, but it will also get an additional one-time infusion of $200 million from the state to reimburse the city for old claims it failed to file on time.
"This is the best news New York City's schools have had in many months," Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy said in a statement.
The talks over the final budget took place against a dismal economic backdrop; tax revenues in April were about $1.2 billion lower than the Pataki administration had expected.
To make up for that shortfall and pay for about $700 million in new spending, the administration and lawmakers are increasing taxes on cigarettes and cellphones, and raiding every pool of money the state has. They plan to take more than $560 million out of various state funds for special purposes and spend it on general purposes. They are also taking $200 million from the Environmental Protection Fund and $200 million from a fund set up to pay for health insurance for the poor.
In addition, the state intends to sell off abandoned property the state takes over, like bank accounts, car insurance refunds and security deposits, to gain about $300 million.
"I think we are scraping the bottom of a lot of barrels for money here, and unless the state's revenues improve significantly, next year's budget will be even more difficult," said Assemblyman Richard N. Gottfried, a Manhattan Democrat.

HEADLINE: States' Vast Budget Gaps Bring Higher Fees and Emergency Cuts 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: INDIANAPOLIS, May 15 

 BODY:
Faced with a large, unexpected drop in income-tax revenue, states across the country are trying desperately to plug wide budget gaps in ways voters can abide in an election year.
 Some are raising cigarette taxes and various fees. Some are cutting spending on the edges or using bookkeeping devices to make the deficits go away. A few have taken drastic measures to avoid raising sales or income taxes or cutting popular programs like education. 
 Missouri, for example, is so short of cash that it has stopped sending out income-tax refunds. More than 400,000 taxpayers who filed returns on their 2001 income are owed nearly $170 million. Officials promise that the refunds will be mailed when the state's cash flow improves. 
Wisconsin is considering issuing bonds secured by the 30 years of annual payments from the national settlement with tobacco companies. The effect would be to spend all 30 years of the state's share of the tobacco money this year and next.
The National Conference of State Legislatures reported last month that at least 40 states and the District of Columbia were being forced this year to make emergency cuts in their budgets totaling $27 billion. 
Like other states, New York has had a serious shortfall in revenue -- $1.2 billion less in April tax receipts than had been expected -- largely because weakness in the stock market has resulted in smaller receipts from the capital gains tax. 
But New York is in better shape than most others because during the fat years, Gov. George E. Pataki squirreled away as much as $4 billion. He can now draw on that as he begins his race for re-election. In his latest budget, he sought increased spending on popular programs and avoided proposing a repeal of tax cuts set to take effect this year.
Still, the final budget on which New York legislative leaders wrapped up negotiations today does include increased fees or new surcharges on a variety of products and state services, and an expansion of the state cigarette tax to include cigars and chewing tobacco. Page B1. 
Circumstances here in Indiana are more severe, and more typical. Just three years ago, the state was sitting on a $2 billion surplus, about 10 percent of the whole state budget. Feeling flush, Gov. Frank L. O'Bannon and the legislature approved deep tax cuts and undertook an ambitious plan to raise school standards.
But times changed almost overnight. Indiana's deficit is now more than $1 billion, and the figure seems to grow with each recalculation. So this week, irritable at having to leave their jobs and families, and pessimistic about being able to resolve the crisis, legislators began meeting here in a rare special session.
Nowhere is the situation more dire than in California. On Tuesday, Gov. Gray Davis proposed closing a shortfall of $23.6 billion, one-third of the entire budget, by raising vehicle license fees and cigarette taxes and making steep reductions in health programs and aid to local governments.
The details of the problem and the solutions that officeholders are considering vary by state, but the basics are the same.
In the prosperity of the late 1990's, the states acted as if good times would always roll, slashing taxes for individuals and businesses and spending with abandon.
When the economy turned sour, revenue fell sharply, higher spending was locked into place, and the states, most of them required by their constitutions to run balanced budgets, found themselves in deep holes.
The problem is complicated by the elections this fall. Budget-cutting invariably requires bitter medicine, and few politicians are willing to risk re-election to administer it.
"In an election year," said Governor O'Bannon, who called the special session here, "you always get political policy mixed up with public policy."
New Jersey has one of the worst deficits of any state in percentage terms, 12 percent of the total budget, according to calculations by the conference of state legislatures. But New Jersey holds its elections for state offices in odd-numbered years, and that has eased the pressure on the new governor, James E. McGreevey. He is reducing the budgets of state agencies by 5 percent and cutting back on construction and maintenance projects.
Connecticut has managed to control its deficit with a 61-cent-a-pack increase in cigarette taxes, to $1.11 from 50 cents.
North Carolina raised income and sales taxes last year, but it is an exception. Few states are using general tax increases to try to recoup the $35 billion in tax cuts that were enacted in the eight years ended in 2000.
Spending reductions have been imposed almost everywhere. The conference of state legislatures reported that 17 states had cut aid to elementary and secondary education, or might do so. That aid is a big part of the budget in all states but usually one of the last places politicians look to save money.
Twenty-nine states are considering cuts in higher education, 25 in prisons and 22 in Medicaid, the conference found. At least 10 may lay off state employees.
But to a large extent, said Don Boyd, director of the Fiscal Studies Program at the Rockefeller Institute in Albany, states are resorting to gimmicks and procrastination, trying to sweep as much dust as possible under the rug and hoping that good times will return quickly and close the budget gap painlessly.
That is certainly the tendency here in Indiana. The only revenue increases even under consideration involve more gambling receipts and higher cigarette taxes. Governor O'Bannon has set aside some of his most ambitious plans, like state aid for preschool programs, but most of the cuts so far have involved bookkeeping devices like transfers from trust funds to the general fund and a reduction in emergency reserves. 
"The political will is not there to do what is necessary," said William J. Sheldrake, president of the Indiana Fiscal Policy Institute, a nonpartisan research center. 
Most authorities doubt that Indiana or other states will return soon to a time of plenty, given two serious structural problems. 
The first is that services, the dominant element of the economy in most states, are not taxed. For years, Florida, among other states, has considered taxing services, from haircuts to golf lessons, but those proposals have never gone far and are not likely to now.
The other structural problem is the huge rise in health expenditures, in large part a result of ever higher drug costs. Health care now accounts for 27 percent of all state spending, said Ray Scheppach, executive director of the National Governors' Association.
As the legislature convened here in Indianapolis on Tuesday, lobbyists were out in force, but the lawmakers' mood was grim. Governor O'Bannon, a Democrat, has said that if the legislature does not act in the special session, he will be forced to cut spending for education and other popular programs on his own and seek new sources of revenue. But he is not the kind of governor who strikes fear in his opponents, said Brian Howey, who publishes a nonpartisan political newsletter.
The Indiana House is controlled by Democrats, but the Senate by Republicans, and the chances of reaching a bipartisan agreement are remote, most lawmakers say.
"No question we're going to have a tough time getting anything worked out," said Representative William C. Cochran, a Democrat from the southeastern part of the state.
Representative Daniel A. Dumezich, a Republican from a suburb of Chicago and a tax lawyer, agreed. Like many others, he said the special session was "a major inconvenience" for the part-time lawmakers, who are paid $112 a day when they are in session and whose regular session ended for the year in March.
"I have a real job I have to attend to," he said.

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New York: Manhattan: City Economy Shrinks 

BYLINE:  By Leslie Eaton (NYT) (Compiled by Yilu Zhao) 

 BODY:
 New York City's economy continued to shrink in the first quarter of 2002, and personal income tax payments plunged, according to data released yesterday by William C. Thompson Jr., the city comptroller. 
The gross city product, a measure of the overall economy, dropped by 2.6 percent, even as a similar measure of the national economy, the gross domestic product, grew by 5.8 percent. Personal income tax payments, which the comptroller's office uses as a guideline to measure New Yorkers' income, fell by 20 percent from last year. Included was a 12 percent drop in withholding taxes and a 38.9 percent drop in estimated tax payments. Leslie Eaton (NYT)

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Drug Shares and Hewlett Drag Down S.& P. and Dow

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell yesterday, led by drug shares, after Abbott Laboratories said that a plant failed inspection and Schering-Plough said that it was being investigated by the Food and Drug Administration.
 Hewlett-Packard helped drag down the Dow Jones industrial average after it said corporate customers were not spending enough to revive sales this year. 
 "You have to get the earnings to push the market higher," said David Fowler, president of Lincoln Capital Management, which oversees $35 billion in Chicago. 
The S.& P. 500 fell 6.21 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,091.07, with health care stocks accounting for half the loss. The Dow lost 54.46 points, or 0.5 percent, to 10,243.68.
The Nasdaq composite index climbed for a third day, gaining 6.51 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,725.56. The index had not risen in three straight sessions since April 1.
Since stocks peaked in March 2000, "every rally has been a great selling opportunity," Mr. Fowler said.
"There is nothing in the market that I have seen that is giving me a tremendous amount of conviction about the sustainability" of any advance, said Matthew Johnson, head of cash trading at Lehman Brothers. Stocks fell last week even after a rally on Wednesday that was the biggest one-day gain in eight months.
Almost 1.4 billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, 5.8 percent more than the three-month daily average. Rising and falling stocks were about even on the Big Board and the Nasdaq.
Abbott Labs fell $4.84, to $46.90, after saying one of its plants failed an inspection in January. Three years ago, Abbott was fined $100 million and ordered to fix flaws at the same site, which makes medical tests.
Schering-Plough declined $3.49, to $25. The company, the maker of the top-selling allergy drug Claritin, disclosed in a filing that the F.D.A. was conducting a criminal investigation in Puerto Rico.
Pfizer, meanwhile, which acquired Warner-Lambert, is being investigated by the United States attorney's office in Boston. Warner-Lambert sales representatives met with patients and recommended drugs for unapproved uses, The New York Times said, citing court documents. Pfizer lost 75 cents, to $36.49.
Eli Lilly fell $2.19, to $63.51, and Merck lost 60 cents, to $56.90.
Hewlett-Packard retreated $1.15, to $19.35. The company, which merged with Compaq Computer earlier this month, said fiscal second-quarter sales slipped, missing the $11.1 billion estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call. Hewlett-Packard does not expect a "meaningful" improvement in demand until next year.
Oracle, the software maker, rose 38 cents, to $9.19, and Dell Computer, the biggest direct seller of personal computers, added 80 cents, to $27.70.
Bond prices rose as stocks fell. By late in the day, the price of the 10-year note climbed 11/32 , to 97 6/32 . The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.25 percent from 5.29 percent.
The 30-year bond rose 8/32 , to 95 1/32 . Its yield dropped to 5.73 percent from 5.75 percent.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Faults Pace of Downtown Recovery 

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
Andrew M. Cuomo criticized the pace and management of the effort to rebuild Lower Manhattan yesterday, and said the governor should take control to end bickering among rival state agencies. 
 And Mr. Cuomo said New York officials should play an aggressive role in determining precisely what type of development takes place at the World Trade Center site, rather than leaving it to the private market. 
 "This is the job of the governor," Mr. Cuomo, a Democratic candidate for governor, said at Cooper Union. "You cannot delegate this to a number of agencies and then have them compete with one another. There is no greater challenge to New York. And as governor, I would take responsibility." 
In a speech that jumped from the subject of rebuilding Lower Manhattan to ensuring the security of New York, Mr. Cuomo also expressed alarm about recent intelligence reports that terrorists may be planning an attack on a Northeast nuclear plant around July 4. Mr. Cuomo said the Indian Point power plant, in Westchester, should be closed immediately, asserting that safety outweighed any potential problems created by the loss of energy.
"This is a nuclear power plant which is in the closest proximity to the most densely populated area in the globe," Mr. Cuomo said. "No one can tell you to this day as we are seated here what would happen if a plane hit Indian Point."
He added: "That's enough for me. Shut down the plant." 
Mr. Cuomo's remarks seemed an attempt to reframe his criticism of Gov. George E. Pataki's performance in the weeks after the attack on the trade center. Mr. Cuomo had belittled Mr. Pataki, saying he had "held the coat" of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. 
Mr. Cuomo was widely criticized for his remarks, even by Democrats, and yesterday, he took pains to avoid criticizing the governor directly as he returned to what his aides said would be a central theme of his campaign: his contention that Mr. Pataki is doing an ineffective job in overseeing the recovery effort downtown.
Mr. Pataki's spokesman, Michael McKeon, rejected Mr. Cuomo's criticisms, saying: "The governor is going to continue to work in a nonpartisan way with Mike Bloomberg and other interested parties to make sure that Lower Manhattan and lower New York is stronger than it was on Sept. 10. We're confident that we are going to get the job done."
In his speech, Mr. Cuomo sought to distance himself from the positions taken by some planners that the government should simply reconstruct public facilities that were destroyed at ground zero -- in particular, roads and the mass transit system -- and let the private market largely dictate the extent of construction.
Mr. Cuomo argued that New York should take an aggressive role in setting the future of downtown, by seeking to anchor the area with a major project that establishes a character for downtown and encourages economic development.
"Rather than just allowing the private sector to evolve downtown Manhattan," Mr. Cuomo said, "rather than replacing what was -- the office buildings -- let's try a different approach, where government plays a more active role, where government says, 'We have an opportunity here to bring in a large-scale economic generator that will drive the development.' " 
As examples of a large-scale economic generator, Mr. Cuomo suggested relocating the World Bank downtown, giving the City Opera a home there or setting up an international medical research center. Mr. Cuomo, a former federal housing secretary, said those were just suggestions, and he declined to endorse any one idea.
Mr. Cuomo questioned the way Mr. Pataki had set up the rebuilding effort, noting in particular the public quarreling between two key agencies: the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the 16-acre trade center site, and the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, which Mr. Pataki created to oversee its development.
He noted that the two agencies "are vying for the driver's seat." 
"Many other public agencies are competing for the role," he said. "The results? Months of public bickering."
Mr. Cuomo's rival for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, also supports the immediate closing of Indian Point. Mr. Pataki does not, though Mr. McKeon said he had asked federal agencies to study the question in light of the recent threat of terrorism.

I.B.M. Chief Says Focus Is on Gains in Productivity

BYLINE:  By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
In his first meeting with Wall Street analysts since becoming chief executive of International Business Machines, Samuel J. Palmisano declared yesterday that the company would emerge from the downturn in the computer industry stronger than ever. But he also confirmed that I.B.M. would be cutting its work force by thousands to tighten its belt during the current slump.
 Mr. Palmisano refused to detail the extent of the planned payroll trimming, but he seemed to suggest the numbers could be somewhat higher than recent reports. Last week, executives close to the company said I.B.M. would cut its work force in the first half of this year by roughly 9,000 employees, or fewer than 3 percent of its 320,000 employees worldwide. Most of the job cuts, these executives said, would be in the United States, where I.B.M. employs 160,000 people. 
 Mr. Palmisano said I.B.M. was steadily working to improve productivity and cut expenses by $1 billion or $2 billion a year. Reducing employment in some operations to mirror shifts in business, especially in the services business, has occurred even in good times, he said. That kind of attrition, he said, has typically amounted to 15,000 jobs a year.
But when the technology sector was buoyant, those cutbacks would be more than offset by additional hiring, especially in fast-growing parts of the services business, increasing I.B.M.'s total employment. Last year, I.B.M.'s revenues declined 3 percent and most analysts expect it to decline another 3 percent in 2002.
One analyst noted that if I.B.M. held steady its revenue per employee -- one measure of corporate productivity -- that would imply cutbacks of 20,000 workers. While agreeing with the overall analysis, Mr. Palmisano said the company's businesses vary, so simple head-count calculations can be misleading.
Still, he observed, "If we did not hire anybody, we'd be down 15,000."
Mr. Palmisano avoided being more specific, but hinted of an announcement soon. "You'll hear more about what we're doing to address those issues," he said. "That's pretty straightforward."
Mr. Palmisano, who became chief executive in March, replacing Louis V. Gerstner Jr., spent most of his hourlong appearance in New York discussing I.B.M.'s long-term strategy and the technology industry.
Mr. Palmisano made no specific predictions of when the industry might rebound, later this year or next year. But when it does, he said, the information technology business should grow at more than twice the rate of the economy, somewhat slower than in the late 1990's but still solid.
Mr. Palmisano compared the current period to the economic downturn at the start of the 1980's, when the personal computer industry really got under way, and to the early 1990's, when PC's linked in small networks, or client-server computing, had its start. Each time, he said, economic slowdowns forced companies to look for ways to use technology to lift productivity.
Today, Mr. Palmisano said, mainstream businesses understand that using Internet technology can help them save costs and increase productivity. I.B.M., he said, is well positioned to help companies use networked technology and is gaining market share in software, data-serving computers, storage and services.
"We don't like this economic environment, but we are seizing the opportunity it presents," Mr. Palmisano said. "I.B.M. is going to exit this downturn much stronger than we entered."

HEADLINE: Castro's Door: Both Open and Closed 

BYLINE:  By DAVID GONZALEZ 

DATELINE: HAVANA, May 15 

 BODY:
With President Fidel Castro sitting in the front row, Jimmy Carter chastised him Tuesday night about the failure of the Communist system to respect political rights. The Cuban nation watched on uncensored television. Mr. Castro said nothing.
 His reaction was as surprising as it was polite. Was the man who has ruled Cuba for 43 years, famed for proclaiming the triumphs of his revolution and the evils of his enemy to the north, about to embrace democracy? Or had Mr. Castro invited Mr. Carter for a five-day grand tour as part of yet another strategy of self-preservation that he had laid out to the last detail? 
 Mr. Castro's silence bespoke new pressures he is facing on many sides. He has alienated longtime allies in Latin America, who are increasingly frustrated with his lack of democratic reform. Mexico, perhaps the sturdiest friend of the revolution, recently voted against Cuba at the United Nations Human Rights Commission. The near-ouster in April of Hugo Chavez, the leftist president of Venezuela, showed Mr. Castro the weakness of his only other avowed supporter in the hemisphere. 
Mr. Castro is also bracing for a toughening of policy by the Bush administration, which promises to cut down even further on Cuba's income from tourism, trade and foreign investment. 
In this light, Mr. Castro has already gotten one major benefit from Mr. Carter's trip: the former American president's appeal to Washington to lift a four-decade embargo.
Allowing Mr. Carter to talk frankly about Cuba's faults may have caused Mr. Castro some embarrassment. But that was a price Mr. Castro seemed willing to pay to project an image of openness in an effort to sway opinion in the United States as some lawmakers push to ease restrictions on trade and travel.
"There are some who might be more inclined to go along with that in the wake of the Carter visit, and the fact Castro allowed him to speak to the Cuban people," said Wayne Smith, a senior fellow at the Center for International Policy and former head of the United States Interests Section here. But he added, "It's still a little difficult for me to believe that it happened."
Mr. Castro's gamble in choosing Mr. Carter to visit was carefully considered. Mr. Carter worked to improve relations with Cuba during his presidency. This week he praised the revolution's achievements in health and education and, as a bonus, disputed the Bush administration's claims that Cuba was conducting biological warfare research. 
Still, Mr. Castro would not have invited Mr. Carter had he not felt sufficiently in control; he knew that Mr. Carter, who made human rights a central issue of his presidency, would raise the topic here. 
Beyond Mr. Carter's visit, there is no sign that Mr. Castro is considering any immediate political opening. The state-run news media touted Mr. Carter's call for lifting the embargo, but made no mention of his criticism of the lack of freedom.
Mr. Castro's resistance to change may even increase if the administration proceeds with plans to clamp down on American travel and to enforce legal provisions allowing suits against foreign companies in Cuba that benefit from confiscated properties.
"He does not want to be seen as giving in to pressure," said George Vickers, Latin America director at the Open Society Institute. 
What Mr. Castro does not seem to have anticipated was Mr. Carter's extraordinary endorsement in front of the nation of a novel challenge to the Communist system. While claiming he would not interfere in Cuban politics, Mr. Carter pointedly mentioned Project Varela, a drive by rights advocates that amassed 11,000 signatures on a petition for a national referendum to obtain greater democratic freedoms. Varela's supporters see it as a peaceful attempt to change the system from within. 
The petitions were delivered to the National Assembly two days before Mr. Carter arrived. Cuban officials dismissed them as the creation of a small group backed by Washington and by Cuban exiles. Few Cubans knew anything about it until Mr. Carter's speech.
The Cuban government may still try to silence talk about Varela or find legal reasons to reject it. Cuban news accounts of Mr. Carter's speech included backhanded barbs from the handpicked audience about the project, but no mention of Mr. Carter's support.
Yet rights advocates described the mere mention of Varela in front of Mr. Castro as a transforming moment that will make it much harder to dismiss the domestic opposition.
"He is admitting that all of us need to change," said Oswaldo Paya, who led the petition drive, "that we all need to take steps: Castro, the North American government and all Cubans. He said we have all made errors and that we should put ourselves in the other's place and listen.
"But he also told us to remember there are rights that we have."
Mr. Paya said he was saddened that it took a foreign leader to bring his project to light. But he noted that of the many foreign politicians who have come here to meet with dissidents, Mr. Carter went a step further by showing a way out of the impasse between the government and its struggling opposition.
The prospects for a democratic opening could best be judged in the streets of Havana after his speech. A man watching a baseball game on a television at a food stand in the Vedado district nodded in approval when asked about the speech.
"He made proposals and spoke about freedom of expression," the man said, declining to give his name. As he spoke a police officer sidled up to him and stood silently.
"I don't know what to tell you," the man continued, changing tone. "Everything was on the surface. It did not go beyond the surface."
With the police officer still beside him, the man turned away and went back to watching the baseball game.
