HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: UPPER WEST SIDE;
Planners' Radical Traffic Idea: Close Part of Broadway

BYLINE: By JENNIFER KINGSON BLOOM 

 BODY:
With one giant tower after another rising in a concentrated area near Lincoln Square, city planners have become so concerned about the area's growing traffic problems that they are offering a radical solution: closing the southbound lanes of Broadway to vehicles from 65th to 63d Street.
In a draft report, the Planning Department calls on the Department of Transportation to consider diverting traffic in Lincoln Square from Broadway to Columbus Avenue, turning Broadway into a pedestrian mall, and changing the directions of certain crosstown streets. 
 In making the recommendation, city planners say, they have sided with neighborhood residents who have long complained about the difficulty of navigating the area by foot and by car, and who predict that the situation will grow worse.
"There are big problems out there now," said Jack Schmidt, a program coordinator in the Planning Department's transportation division. "Given the new development that's coming, we wanted to go out and solve them before they get worse."
For example, the Planning Department has acknowledged that crossing 65th Street at the Columbus Avenue and Broadway intersection takes 26 seconds, while the green light lasts only 14 seconds.
Last year, the construction frenzy near Lincoln Square prompted city planners to change zoning regulations, restricting the size of what could be built. Since, one big project has been finished -- the building on Broadway and 66th Street owned by Millennium Partners that houses the Sony movie theater -- and others are progressing -- like Donald Trump's Riverside South.
But planning commission members said they felt that transportation problems were ignored when the district was rezoned; after the laws were changed, they asked the Planning Department for solutions.
Several of the study's recommendations have already met with neighborhood approval, but support has been mixed for the idea of closing part of Broadway and for a proposal to build "neckdowns," or sidewalk extensions, at certain intersections.
"Those of us who have discussed it are very dubious about closing off any streets," said Barbara Adler, co-chairwoman of Community Board 7's Transportation Committee. Lincoln Center officials oppose the idea.
But Daniel L. Berta, manager for the Chase Manhattan Bank at Lincoln Plaza, said the idea made sense. "I have a lot of trouble crossing the street here," he said. "If they put some thought into how they're going to do it and expand the park, it could work out quite well."
City transportation officials, who would be responsible for implementing most of the proposed changes, are expected to comment on the recommendations in June.
Arlene Simon, the president of Landmark West!, and a consultant, Daniel L. Gutman, proposed the Broadway closing to the Planning Department; under their plan, street directions would be changed on parts of 64th and 63d Streets and Dante Park would more than triple in size. "What we're looking for is what would become most pedestrian-friendly," Mrs. Simon said.
Elizabeth Starkey, chairwoman of Community Board 7, said she thought the idea merited further study, but she preferred an idea that city planners rejected: a pedestrian bridge or tunnel across Columbus Avenue and Broadway at 65th Street. JENNIFER KINGSON BLOOM

New Nest for Night Owls On the Upper East Side
 The French bistro Le Taxi has been at 37 East 60th Street, between Madison and Park Avenues, for more than a year. Starting on June 6, a local party promoter, Noel Ashman, will take over the 90-seat restaurant and bar each night from 11:30 P.M. to 4 A.M. to create what he calls a "party scene," offering hors d'oeuvres, sandwiches, fruit platters, hamburgers and desserts.
Le Taxi's owner, Julian Davis, says, "This little area is becoming hot for the 30- and 40-year-olds."
 
Downtown Jamaica Looks Forward To a New Store: Toys 'R' Us
 Toys "R" Us plans to open a 45,000-square-foot-store in Queens, on Jamaica Avenue at 168th Street. Michael P. Miller, a senior vice president at Toys "R" Us, calls the neighborhood "solid working class," adding, "It's a market that we haven't tapped to its fullest."
F. Carlisle Towery, the president of the Greater Jamaica Development Corporation, agrees. "We're happy Toys 'R' Us is moving into the heart of the Jamaica retail area, attracting additional customers and creating new jobs," he said.
The company, in Paramus, N.J., plans to open the store by early November.
 
In Search of New Students, Business School Moves to New Site
 For 67 years, Drake Business School occupied part of a building on Grand Concourse and Fordham Road, in the Fordham section of the Bronx. Recently, in an effort to attract more students, it moved to a new two-story center in Bronxdale, at 2122 White Plains Road, at Pelham Parkway. The new building was specially designed for the school and includes a laboratory for courses leading to certification as a medical assistant, a new program, said Gwen Sumter, the assistant to the president of Drake.
"Enrollment had dropped off in the Bronx because of economic reasons," Ms. Sumter said.
Drake, which also has branches in Manhattan, Queens and Staten Island, specializes in teaching word processing, legal secretarial skills and accounting. The student body is 70 percent women, Ms. Sumter said. Students must be 17 or older to enroll and are not required to have a high school or college diploma.

HEADLINE: The Plots, and Subplots, of a City Garden ...

BYLINE: By ANDREA KANNAPELL 

 BODY:
HOW do you measure 16 years? At the community gardens on the Lower East Side, where existence is carved out of lulls in housing construction and time is measured in the life cycles of tomatoes, peppers and daffodils, 16 years is the stuff of legend.
That is the age of the garden at Ninth Street and Avenue C, at least as close as anyone can tell. Neighborhood and garden old-timers are quick to recollect sometimes contradictory histories. But they all agree that it was Augustin (Nin) Garcia, a crotchety maintenance worker at the housing projects along Avenue D, who, perhaps drawn by the enormous and beautiful willow tree that still guards the Ninth Street side, first cleared a small plot in 1979. 
 He was joined by his son. Then came Peter Nieves, who watched their garden blooming from the American Legion hall across the street and started bringing Nin a beer now and then. Then Mr. Nieves invited some of his neighbors from Masaryk Towers, a 21-story brick Mitchell-Lama complex near the Williamsburg Bridge. Those neighbors invited a few friends, a few passers-by wandered in, and a few buildings collapsed . . . and now the garden runs from Ninth Street almost to 10th, and a quarter of a block east from Avenue C. It is one of the city's oldest and largest, and many say one of its most beautiful.
And it is a good place to take a look at the chemistry of a community garden -- that breed of urban space that is cropping up more and more on the city's landscape, where people who might not ordinarily have anything to do with one another find themselves shoulder to shoulder, pulling weeds in a kind of public backyard. People will be people. Sometimes they argue and fight.
The location of the garden, too, is significant. There are more than 700 city-sanctioned community gardens, and untold numbers of more ad hoc affairs, scattered throughout the city. But the Lower East Side, the birthplace of the community gardening movement, stands out for the complexity and concentration of its gardens: there are about 40 operating on city-owned land under year-to-year Green Thumb leases and a smattering of others.
There is the crowded, artsy Green Thumb garden at Sixth and Avenue B, notable for its community programs and its main decoration, a giant wooden derrick hung with hundreds of stuffed animals, a kind of East Village Watts Tower. And there's the Liz Christy garden, at Bowery and Houston, named for the late visionary who wedded the activism of the antiwar movement to growing environmental concerns and founded the Green Guerrillas, and who made a campaign of lobbing "seed grenades" into vacant lots to see what would take root. There are even squatter gardens, like the Bimbo Rivas Garden on 13th Street, which doubles as a dog run. But even against such an array of horticultural diversity, the Ninth and C garden is huge and varied. It spreads across perhaps an acre of city-owned land, with nearly 40 plots, tended by a cross section of New Yorkers: retired workers from Schrafft's and May's department store, the post office, the Army; working-class people who need a hobby, and artists, mothers and professionals who aren't so upwardly mobile that they have access to Hamptons backyards. There are Puerto Ricans, black Southerners, South Africans, South Americans, an Australian, Brits, Germans, Brazilians and an Iranian.
There are differences of opinion and approach, which cut across class, ethnic and age lines. Some of the gardeners like tidy little beds of perennials and ornamentals; some festoon their plots with whimsical statuary; some are no-nonsense farmers, who dismiss tales of lead leaching into their plants and aim for a good crop of tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers and eggplants.
These are not inconsequential differences in a place where people and their plots are referred to interchangeably, so that a name evokes not only a person, but also that person's effect. "Over by Howard," someone will say, meaning Howard Nudli's rosebed.
Not surprisingly, there are conflicts. Is a fence too high? A bush untrimmed? A prominent plot untidy? And even in a garden, somebody has to take out the garbage.
"The funny thing about community gardening, and it's no secret, is that the hardest part is not growing the plants -- it's getting along with other people," says Kim Mulcahy, a Liz Christy gardener who has been keeping tabs on Ninth and C.
"Everybody has different ideas of what beautiful is," he continues. "You think there's some base level you can agree on, like weeds don't look nice. But in fact some people think weeds are wonderful. There's often a lot of fighting going on. No one truly likes everybody. So you find ways to tolerate each other. You decide: what should we cooperate on, and what should we leave each other alone on? And that's pretty good, really."
Negotiating the sometimes surprisingly bitter eddies of conflicts has become a way of life for the gardeners. It is the price they pay, along with $12 in annual dues, for the daily joy of seeing a new flower burst into being, or dining on the vegetables they started from seed months earlier, or having access to a quiet green space -- or for a deeper kind of contentment that for some, verges on the religious.
 
THE MARCH OF TIME

On a recent Sunday, under a clear sun and vivid skies, Avenue C resembled a small town.
There was a parade: a brassy Peruvian marching band and a compact crowd of perhaps 100 marched down Seventh Street, carrying a life-size statue of a saint. Mothers, surrounded by skipping children, rolled their carts past aging, low-rise, brick and stone apartment buildings to the grocery. The Pedro Bakery at Eighth, where the gardeners often stoke up on cafe con leche, was crowded, the video games in the corner bleeping enticingly. Every so often, an M21 bus roared by, obliterating the strains from boomboxes at the new vendors market across the way. Inside the garden, quieter sounds prevailed: the chirp of sparrows, the rustle of wind through willow fronds, the dribble of water leaking from a hose and the smack of a mallet on wood.
Kitty Sheppard was building a new fence around her plot. She says: "George Washington Carver used to talk to his plants. For inspiration. They told him what to do next."
The garden is old enough to have witnessed the rise and fall of distinct social and botanical eras. Back in '79, the garden was a junkyard frontier, a forgotten piece of land graced by the giant willow and a sturdy cover of weeds.
Like homesteaders, the earliest gardeners sweated to make it arable. They sifted the dirt for chunks of brick, they carted away loads of trash. They became a club: new people who applied for plots, which at most gardens requires a few months of showing up and weeding, were ignored. They celebrated, with barbecues that lasted deep into summer nights. And they warred over plot sizes: the old tales evoke a kind of Wild West era, complete with land grabs, screaming fights and border disputes.
Ninette Kiddon, a feisty 63-year-old former City Ballet dancer and Avenue D resident, recalled the early years: "Nin was afraid to open it up to everyone. He worried they'd have different gardening practices, that they'd be on top of his stuff. He was a farmer -- he had an intense commitment. And as time went on, in this group, which was never homogeneous to begin with, rifts developed socially." It appears that the Masaryk people, Mr. Nieves's group, grew to be a powerful network, out-elbowing Nin's Alphabet City crew by the mid-80's.
"Nin and his son had the larger expanse," Mrs. Kiddon said. "And he was a grumpy man. So he was targeted as one who would be asked to leave." Others, she says, who tried to insist that the garden operate by its bylaws, rather than by whim, were also asked to leave.
Still, the garden was lush and beautiful, and it became part of the fabric of Avenue C. Vito DiBiasi, whose 79-year-old father lives directly across the avenue from the garden, watched it grow from Nin's tiny patch to its current, organized glory. "It's a pleasure to come out," he said. "You know what would have been here? Abandoned cars and garbage." Mr. DiBiasi keeps an eye on the garden at odd hours. "You get the 13-year-olds going over the fence. I open the window up and yell."
And some more unexpected neighborhood denizens were supporters. Norma Gahegan, a Masaryk resident, found that out a few years ago, when she couldn't get the lock on the garden gate to work. Drug dealers working the avenue told her they'd watch it for her overnight. "I guess they liked to look at it, too," she said.
On the other hand, Avenue C sometimes infringed on the garden. Paul Francois, a serious rock gardener, remembers the morning he came to the garden to discover a bullet hole through his prize Opuntia (a kind of cactus).
Low rents and the area's frontier mystique brought an influx of young people and artists into its aging tenements. By the end of the 80's the Green Thumb gardens began to fear that their long reprieve from housing construction was coming to an end, and Ninth and C opened up a crack, letting in a few new members to expand its community base of support.
Of the gardeners of this generation, some reveled in the garden's raw energy, like Mari-Claire Charba, an artist who staged annual "Dream Events" there -- performance pieces like a re-enactment of the garden's history. Some were serious botanists, like Mr. Francois, absolutely focused on their collections of peculiar plants and just as resolutely uninterested in community.
And some, like Tom Versella were another breed: the landscape types, who envisioned the garden as a coordinated statement of classical beauty.
Mr. Versella, a freelance landscaper, joined two years ago, with his friend Xavier Rodriguez, a cabinetmaker, both 38. They turned their corner plot into a showpiece, and began throwing themselves into the garden as a whole. "Tom and Xavier have energy beyond what some people comprehend as being normal," said Carol Kissling, a 36-year-old mother of two. "They have connections with nurseries. They can get plants. They get donations. They have a lot of drive; they're both youthful, strong; they can do a lot of heavy lifting. And they're single: they don't have any commitments keeping them at home."
That won them friends -- so many that last summer, Mr. Versella was elected the garden's president by private ballot, and Mr. Rodriguez became the head of the membership committee.
By all accounts, they have transformed the garden. They put in stone and brick pathways, linked plots with lush communal areas, installed new plots, had truckloads of soil brought in, cleared away the rubble from a building collapse in 1992 that expanded the garden nearly by half, lent their hands to help the other gardeners upgrade their plots, enlisted about 10 new members and tried to make it more of a neighborhood resource.
Their way, they say, can help protect the garden's Green Thumb lease. For if the economy improved enough to start another construction boom, the garden's only protection would be Community Board 3, which can decline to approve a city development plan or the sale of the property to a private developer. The fear of extinction is a constant theme in community gardens.
That fear, occasionally inflamed by a chance encounter with a city agent, or another garden's demise, is sometimes a stick Mr. Versella uses to win approval for some changes, like pulling down the ivy that covered the garden's outer fence in order to open it up visually to the public.
Mr. Versella, a native of Staten Island, describes his philosophy like this: "My involvement past my own plot is my own little stab at urban renewal. My parents don't have lots of money, and most people around here don't have lots of money. But even though you're poor it's not like you have to be dirty, or you can't be creative.
"Words like 'urban renewal' can be construed as gentrification. But I think this neighborhood can use a better quality of life."
But quality of life, it appears, is also in the eye of the beholder. He has lost support from some gardeners who don't share his vision; some don't like his authoritarian streak. Some have left; some are thinking of leaving.
Mrs. Kiddon confesses: "What I'm really worried about is that we're becoming suburbanized. A lot of the plots look nicely manicured, with lovely little paths. It'll get to be just like a walk in Secaucus! If everybody wants a little walk!" She shudders.
 
FENCE POLITICS

Even an issue as simple as a fence can trigger deep conflicts. For Mrs. Sheppard -- a neighborhood resident for 33 years -- a good plot fence is one her beans can climb up and that fence is tall. Mr. Versella says tall fences, which are impenetrable when covered with mature beans and such, are not wise: they block views of the main gate, and gardeners might not know if an unwelcome visitor is intruding, or worse.
But his objections, privately, are deeper. He says the fences are symbolic of the divisiveness that used to characterize the garden, when a few people tended to do things to suit themselves.
"With any group, there's politics," says Mr. Versella, his face lean and garden-tanned. "But in all the greening institutions around, I've heard over and over, this garden had a reputation of being a little private club. They wanted barbed wire around the fence! And most of the people in that past ruling junta, the ones that wanted the fence, they also have fences around their plots. It just ripples all the way through."
At the first meeting of the season, at the end of March, Mr. Versella and Mr. Rodriguez had introduced the idea of making fences around any central plots low and uniform. But Mrs. Sheppard said sternly, "My beans run up that fence," and the issue was dropped.
A few weeks later, as the Peruvians marched, she was putting up a new, solid fence, which reached over six feet high at one side. Helping her was Mr. Rodriguez, who seems to alternate between carrying out Mr. Versella's wishes and making peace by subverting them.
At the garden's next meeting, which overflowed the porch and the barbecue area in front of it, Mr. Versella sat with his back to Mrs. Sheppard's fence, at the head of a sun-dappled circle of about 30 gardeners. In deliberate tones, Mr. Versella spoke of his concerns for safety.
Mrs. Sheppard responded sharply: "I've been in this garden 15 years, and we've had breaches of security before. But I don't think you can blame it on those beans!"
Various members weighed in, for and against Mrs. Sheppard's right to her fence. Mrs. Sheppard offered to move to a less central plot, where the fence wouldn't be a problem. But the gardeners seemed almost embarrassed by the offer. When it came down to brass tacks, they wanted her to have her plot, and her beans, too. Finally, Mr. Rodriguez suggested reconstructing the fence to make it tall only where it runs perpendicular to the gate.
"Can we leave it that something that is satisfactory to everybody will be done?" Mr. Versella asked. Nods all around. A breath of relief passed over the group.
 
THE PRICE OF LEADERSHIP
 It's not just older members, who remember a freer time, who find Mr. Versella's constant scrutiny unpleasant.
Ms. Charba, the artist, drops by her plot, under the willow tree. Amid the flourishing ground cover punctuated with salvaged details from the collapsed buildings, she finds a note in a plastic Ziploc bag, secured by a rock. "Work party Saturday," it says, adding pointedly: "Sweeping under the willow is nice. But can you help with other things?"
Mr. Versella walks by. "Oh, did you get my note?" he says.
"Yes," she answers. "What are the other things?"
"There's a list," he says, gesturing at the bulletins he updates and posts weekly.
"Well, there's a work party on Saturday, right? I'll be there," she finishes. Mr. Versella walks away with an air of strained patience. Ms. Charba later confesses that she's thinking of giving up her plot.
"He has a spit list," says another member, who didn't want to be named criticizing Mr. Versella. "People told me, and I didn't believe it till I saw it. If he's upset with you or doesn't like you, he walks by and spits."
Mr. Versella says newer members don't realize what he's up against. "The interesting thing I found -- me coming in, trying to clarify, so there wouldn't be this chatter and animosity -- newer members don't know what it was like before and feel I'm too authoritative."
Mr. Versella says he is so tired of the difficulties of leadership that he is seeking a second plot in another garden so he can plant in peace, a place "where no one will ask me any questions." Meanwhile, he takes out his frustrations in quiet protests, like ignoring the garbage bags piling up at the garden's back gate. "I'm just going to wait till somebody does it."
Mr. Mulcahy, the Liz Christy gardener, says that the conflicts troubling Ninth and C are normal, and the payoff worthwhile. "When Tom and Xavier came, the garden was really looking for a big infusion of new energy and creativity.
"I don't know all the details," he adds, "but I know it was paralyzed, there were all these factions. And they were able to inspire people, they were able to show people what could be at the garden. I know how much energy it takes to re-energize a whole garden. It simply blows me away. I see the sweat in every brick and every bench."
And Jane Weissman, head of Operation Green Thumb, says that most Lower East Side gardens are led by "benevolent dictators." She says, matter of factly: "They're the ones that get everything going."
 
THROUGH IT ALL, VIVID LOVE
 Fraught as it may be, the garden remains vital. If tensions sometimes threaten to overwhelm the garden, the art of compromise is everywhere apparent.
"I'm a happy man," Mr. Versella said with a wide smile one sunny day. "Somebody took out the garbage."
And since their essential need to be with nature remains otherwise elusive, the gardeners will make what peace they can.
In her plot, Marie Soares, a 50ish Brazilian, grows reminders of home: "Peppers, collard greens, corn, squash -- and of course the flowers." She gets breathless, remembering. "The roses! We lived in the jungles of Brazil, and my mother grew white roses, beautiful, you could put in a salad and eat them. It was beautiful."
Mrs. Kiddon says: "You connect with the earth, go down into it, into your sub-sub-subconscious. The good thing you bring up is an element of regeneration and regrowth. And not just for you! And when you have that, you don't worry about Tom and Xavier, and who has the best kind of mulch.
"It's like the ancient Greek mysteries, in the spring and the fall," she says. "You went down into a cave, with all these anxieties and all this process. You were never supposed to talk about what you experienced. But people would come up, and just say: Seed. Grow."

HEADLINE: Japanese Put Stability Above Competition, in Life as in Business

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Although the news media have devoted much attention to the escalating trade conflict between the United States and Japan, little mention was made of differences between the two countries in fundamental values.
While both Americans and Japanese are more or less believers in the free market, the Japanese are much more ambivalent. This ambivalence is based on a more skeptical view in Japan of competition: whereas most Americans believe that vigorous competition is a good thing, most Japanese do not. Rather, the Japanese tend to place more value on stability, both in their personal lives and in business. 
 For instance, while American workers readily switch jobs to obtain higher incomes, Japanese workers prefer modest but stable incomes through lifetime employment.
Similarly, Japanese companies avoid keen competition, in part by banding together in associations known as keiretsu. Rather than striving to offer low prices, companies put much more stress on the quality of their products and services.
It is well known that competition among retailers is much less keen in Japan than America. For their part, Japanese consumers devote relatively little effort to shopping for the lowest prices.
At the most basic level, the Japanese dislike the quest for "money, money, money" because it conflicts with their traditional but still firmly held conceptions of virtue.
Thus, Japanese consumers are not different from consumers everywhere, and all else being equal, they like low prices. However, Japanese consumers understand that all else is not equal, and that low prices for goods and services entail other costs. Thus, that a Chrysler Cherokee that began in the United States with a factory price of $19,100 winds up in a Japanese showroom with a sticker price of $31,372 arouses no more than mild grumbling.
Japanese society has been structured to avoid strong competition. In this, government regulations play only a small part. In many cases, government regulation has gone too far, and the Japanese know this and are working to correct these cases. However, deregulation will take a long time, since it touches on values that to the Japanese are basic.
For my part, I regret that the traditional virtues of Japan are fading, although thus far the changes have been modest. United States negotiators would be well advised to bear firmly in mind just how sensitive these matters are for the Japanese.

HEADLINE: Don't Let Sharp Operators Near Social Security

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Senators Bob Kerrey and Alan K. Simpson (Op-Ed, May 23) exaggerate Social Security's funding problem, and their proposal to redirect one-third of the employee contribution to personal individual retirement accounts (some $50 billion a year) would obviously worsen it. 
 That money in private hands would invite every sharpster in the country to a fleecing party. Surely the Senators recently read how the Foundation for New Era Philanthropy hoodwinked some of the nation's most august institutions into turning over millions on its unsupported promise to find matching donors.
And did they not read that Prudential Securities repaid $700 million in partial settlement of Securities and Exchange Commission fraud charges? Every week, almost every day, one reads of private investment gone haywire, often because of fraud. Meanwhile, the Republican Congress seeks to cut back on investor protections against sharp practices.
Senators Kerrey and Simpson argue that their proposal will increase private investment. But economists divide on whether I.R.A.'s add to savings or simply divert savings from other less tax-favored vehicles.
For example, when people in employment-based pension plans could also make tax-deductible individual retirement account contributions, my wife and I increased our mortgage borrowing to make maximum I.R.A. contributions. We thereby got two tax breaks -- one on the I.R.A. and the second on the mortgage interest deduction -- but without increasing our savings. Many did the same.
The Kerrey-Simpson proposal sounds like the old remedy of "bleeding." That often sped the patient into the grave.

HEADLINE: THE NIGHT;
The Parties Got Rough, Arty, Chic and Tuneful

BYLINE: By BRYAN MILLER 

 BODY:
UPTOWN -- "I want to bring boxing back to Broadway," the restaurateur Arthur Cutler was saying the night of May 19 at a packed-to-the-ropes opening of Strykers Sporting Club, at 145 West 46th Street. The only contest going on in the room involved black-tie guests trying to reach the bar, but a few minutes later a bell rang and two welterweights furiously hammered at each other up in the ring.
 The crowd cheered. But not Vanessa Riker, a real estate agent from Los Angeles, who had been invited to the opening of Strykers, owned by Mr. Cutler and a group of partners. "This is my first fight experience," she said, cringing with every thud of leather against cranium. "Let me be polite and say that I might not accept the next invitation." 
 Mr. Cutler, who hopes to revive interest in Friday night fights, is also an owner of Carmine's restaurants (of the heavyweight portions), as well as of Ollie's, Docks and many more establishments around town.
 The crowd included friends and associates of Mr. Cutler, the boxing press and a fair number of stocky, tough-looking palookas right out of a Jimmy Cagney movie. Strykers is in the basement of what used to be the Romanian Club, and Mr. Cutler pointed out its perfectly preserved terrazzo floors and ornate moldings.
 "It's very exciting in here, I think," he said. "Manhattan hasn't had anything like this for a long while."
 As it got later, the boxers got bigger and meaner looking. Hard-core fans stayed to the end. Some, like Olivia Tracey, a reporter for The Irish Echo newspaper who had come to write about the social scene, made an exit halfway through. "The little guys are fun, but this is too much," she said.

DOWNTOWN -- Martin Mull, the guitar-playing, leisure-suited comedian and television pitchman, started his professional life as a painter and teacher at the Rhode Island School of Design.
 "I had a master's from RISD and thought I would teach or something, but I had no idea I would go into show business," he said on May 23 at the Rizzoli Bookstore on West Broadway in SoHo, where he was signing his new book, "Martin Mull: Paintings, Drawings and Words," published by Journey Editions, in Boston. "Back in the 60's, everybody was playing guitar, so I got a guitar and started performing."
 A fan asked if his new book was a retrospective of his work.
 "Retrospective?" he replied. "That sounds too much like 'posthumous.' "
 Rex Doane, a recent transplant from San Francisco, arrived carrying two Martin Mull humor books, "A History of White People in America" and "A Paler Shade of White."
 "Your books have had such a great influence on my life," Mr. Doane said, asking Mr. Mull to inscribe them.
 "And you're still standing?" the comedian asked.
 "Well, I am unemployed," Mr. Doane replied.

UPTOWN -- There was more blond hair than at a Stockholm soccer match on May 23 at the Fashion Cafe in Rockefeller Center during a bibulous benefit for the Dishes Project, an organization of supermodels dedicated to fighting pediatric AIDS.
 The party, complete with a Latin band, was sponsored by Bacardi-Martini U.S.A., which used the occasion to promote its new lemon-flavored rum.
 As the tropical drinks gushed and video lights glared, the crowd surged in the direction of the models, who included Hunter Reno, Yasmin, Frederique Vanderwal and Daniela Pestova, who were giving interviews and smiling into the flashbulbs.
 One of the main activities of the evening, aside from posing with models, was an auction for items like a silk blouse worn by Melissa Etheridge, a blue silk lame column dress designed by Mark Eisen and a signed T-shirt from Sharon Stone.
 Bonnie Pfeifer, the executive director of Dishes, which stands for Determined Involved Supermodels Helping to End Suffering, estimated that Barcardi's contribution to the organization had already exceeded $110,000.
 Among the organization's future fund-raising projects is a cookbook with recipes from models. Is that like asking a group of Mormons to write a guide called "Cocktail Parties for the 90's"?
 "It's a big misperception that models don't eat," Ms. Reno said. "They have to eat to stay healthy, in moderation, but they do eat."
 Dutch-born Ms. Vanderwal added that she not only likes to eat, but also likes to roll up her sleeves behind the stove.
 "I make a great pasta and great steak and potatoes," she said. "But for everything else, I definitely need a recipe next to me at all times."

 
 
That's Old-Time Entertainment
 Jean-Claude Baker, an unofficially adopted son of Josephine Baker and the owner of the bistro Chez Josephine on West 42d Street, spent 20 years researching the history of black entertainers in America for his recent book, "Josephine: The Hungry Heart" (Random House).
 Along the way, Mr. Baker befriended many old-time entertainers, some of whom drop in to Chez Josephine from time to time to perform. On a recent Friday night, the dinner crowd was being entertained by Al Bundy, a pianist, and Ray Blue, who plays saxophone. At one point Mr. Baker jumped up, grabbed the microphone, and announced, "We have in the audience one of the great singers of the jazz age, Laura Watson, who is still performing at 86 years of age."
 Ms. Watson, smooth skinned, animated and playful, ran through five numbers to resounding applause. She returned to her seat, graciously acknowledged the adulation, then turned to a companion.
 "What's this 86 business?" she said. "I'm 84 all day -- unless I'm counting my beat wrong."

HEADLINE: IDEAS & TRENDS: The Gulf War Veteran;
Victorious in War, Not Yet at Peace

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
AMERICA is fickle about its wars, and how it treats the men and women who fought them.
 The Allied victory in World War II seemed to transform veterans into heroes-for-life; the nation embraced them from the moment they returned, with the G.I. Bill and a booming economy, and has feted them again 50 years later. Korea and Vietnam were messier conflicts with ambiguous endings that left returning soldiers forgotten, bitter or worse. 
 When the Persian Gulf war came along, a friendless Iraqi enemy was dispatched in a 43-day blitz of high-tech weaponry with relatively few American casualties. Troops basking in homecoming parades across the country seemed poised to recapture the respect that World War II veterans enjoyed.
 But veterans' advocates and counselors say that expectation has gone unfulfilled. And as the nation tomorrow honors those who have died in battle, they say, an emerging profile of gulf war veterans suggests they may have more in common with Vietnam-era soldiers than World War II troops.

 
 
'Disappointed'
 Thousands of gulf veterans remain in the military, many using their combat records to climb swiftly through the ranks. But thousands of others are suffering mysterious ailments. Gulf veterans are experiencing higher rates of unemployment, divorce and alcohol abuse than Vietnam-era vets, counselors say.
 "I'm disappointed the way our country has treated us," said Charles Sheehan-Miles, 24, a tank loader in the gulf who is now executive director of the Gulf War Veterans of New England. "I'm afraid we're getting closer to the public image the Vietnam veterans had."
 That image of a disillusioned and embittered soldier may make it tempting to force into the gulf profile someone like Timothy J. McVeigh, an Army sergeant in the war who is charged in the Oklahoma City bombing. But experts say there is no evidence that gulf veterans are more likely to become political extremists or violent criminals.
 The gulf war veterans have problems enough, however, and some seem all the more puzzling because the military's demographics have changed dramatically since a largely conscripted United States army fought in Southeast Asia. In the Middle East, the Pentagon fielded a better-educated and better-trained all-volunteer force, supported by tens of thousands of reservists called to active duty. Nearly 60 percent of the more than 550,000 soldiers sent to the gulf were married and had dependents, proportionally three times as many as the soldiers in Vietnam. About 35,000 women were sent to the gulf, as were 16,337 single parents and 1,231 married couples.
 Popular support for the gulf warriors soared as it never did for those who fought in Vietnam or Korea. But four years after the war's end, doctors, counselors and veterans advocates realize the ebullient, brief welcome-home was a poor augury. "Desert Storm vets got a parade, something we didn't get, but then the country looked away," said Richard Fitzpatrick, executive director of the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans.
 Within a year of returning home, many gulf veterans who joined the military for a career were handed pink slips, casualties of the Pentagon's post-cold war cuts. Unlike those returning after World War II, these new civilians faced a sinking economy -- an era of restructuring and corporate downsizing, of disorienting shifts in the demand for labor.
 More than 30,000 veterans have complained of a gulf war syndrome, whose symptoms include fatigue, muscle pain and breathing trouble. Preliminary reports say most of those examined have ordinary, diagnosable illnesses, while a small portion have symptoms that are unexplained. President Clinton signed an order on Friday creating a committee to examine the Government's efforts to cope with these baffling cases.
 Psychiatrists say that about 10 to 15 percent of gulf war veterans in several small studies suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, an anxiety disorder caused by a stressful event, like combat or a natural disaster. The rate is comparable to that found among Vietnam-era vets, and the numbers could have been higher, officials say, had military doctors not learned from Vietnam how to recognize and treat the warning signs of combat trauma more quickly.
 Many gulf veterans say their problems stem from a dissonance between what they saw and what the public saw. In August 1992, a 33-year-old Army reservist who worked as a supervisor cataloguing the Iraqi war dead came to Bill Sautner, a veterans' counseling therapist in Orlando, with photographs he and his friends had taken of burned-out tanks, bloody bunkers and charred bodies of Iraqi soldiers.
 "He and many other gulf war vets saw the full range of war's destruction -- images that he still relives today," said Mr. Sautner, whose patient requested anonymity. "But the public only saw a sanitized, impersonal view on TV."
 Haunted by such memories, veterans had mixed feelings about their homecoming. "The gulf war vets came back from a four-day ground war as heroes, but when in groups with other combatants who fought a year or more in the jungles, they'll be apologetic and feel a certain amount of guilt," said Dr. Joseph Gelsomino, who runs 28 veterans centers in the Southeast.
 The combination of a weak economy, medical problems and a lack of affordable housing have helped make gulf veterans the fastest-growing segment of the nation's 271,000 homeless veterans. Vincent Torrez, a 29-year-old former military police officer, lives at a Salvation Army shelter in Long Island City, Queens, while looking for work. "It's very competitive and there are a lot of people with degrees," said Mr. Torrez, a high-school graduate who attended Marist College for a year. "But I think the Lord will look out for me. I might not get what I want, but I'll get what I need."

HEADLINE: THE NATION: Welfare States;
Why Lump Sums Mean Some Lumps

BYLINE: By CELIA DUGGER 

 BODY:
THE Republican proposals most likely to radically revamp the nation's welfare system are not those that have gotten the greatest attention by appealing to the stern moral judgments of Americans: the denial of cash benefits to teen-age mothers and women who give birth while on welfare.
 Rather, the greatest potential to wither the welfare state lies in the Republican plan to upend the historic Federal and state partnership in providing for poor families. 
 Republicans in the House and Senate want to end the six-decade Federal guarantee of cash support to all poor women and children who qualify. Instead, Washington would send states a fixed, lump sum of money -- a block grant -- that would not grow beyond last year's level even if the number of poor people and the cost of caring for them did. States, in turn, would no longer have to put up a dime of their own money to match the Federal contribution. They could run welfare programs with almost no restrictions or minimum standards imposed by Washington.
 The Republican plan would also give states a reason to spend less on Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the main welfare program. Under the block grant, states would lose Federal dollars if they spent more of their own.
 "The block grant is the secret device for cutting welfare benefits," says Prof. Paul E. Peterson, director of the Center for American Political Studies at Harvard University. "It is a way of avoiding blame for loading deficit reduction onto the backs of the poor."
 The block grant approach, adopted by the House of Representatives in March as part of the Republican Contract With America, got a major boost Friday when the Senate Finance Committee endorsed it, while rejecting those provisions of the House bill that would forbid the use of Federal funds to provide benefits to unmarried mothers under 18 and to women who have more children while on welfare.

 
 
Scrooges and Midases
 Some proponents of the block grant say that freeing the states of Federal red tape will set off a rush of innovation in welfare policy, not a rush of spending cuts.
 "I find legislators and governors as compassionate as members of Congress and Presidents," said Senator Bob Packwood, the Oregon Republican who is chairman of the Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over welfare. "For us to presume they're Scrooges and we're Midases is wrong."
 But other Republicans readily acknowledge that the plan is likely to sharply reduce welfare spending -- and they argue that is a good thing. In their view, welfare itself is a cause of poverty.
 "In welfare, you get what you pay for," said Robert Rector, a senior policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation and an architect of the House plan. "We paid for nonwork and nonmarriage and we've gotten dramatic increases in both. The United States of America spends too much on welfare."
 Critics of the Republican plan, including many mayors, contend that it will starve the welfare system of money, stifle innovation and worsen the plight of cities, and may leave millions of women and children in free fall from the safety net.
 Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat who dominated the Senate's welfare debate until he lost his chairmanship of the Finance Committee this year, maintains that innovation costs more than many critics of the current system are prepared to spend. States that have done the best job of moving single parents off welfare have spent more on child care, health care, transportation and other work-related expenses to keep former welfare recipients employed. Mailing them a check is much cheaper.
 "A block grant advertised as an inducement to innovation could be the end of innovation if resources are cut back," Mr. Moynihan said.
 The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that under the House-approved plan, Federal spending on welfare by the year 2000 would be at least 20 percent less than if the status quo were maintained and would decline at least 10 percent over the next seven years under the Senate version. The Congressional Budget Office concluded that even if the states managed to impose the Senate bill's proposed work requirements on welfare recipients, the states would wind up spending most of their Federal welfare money on job training, child care and similar services rather than on direct payments to poor people.
 Southern congressmen, meanwhile, expressed concern that freezing Federal welfare spending would impose "severe budget and human consequences" on states with growing populations.
 The Republican plan would reverse the financial incentives for states to spend on welfare; states would lose 30 cents of Federal funds for every $1 of their own they spent because of the interrelationship between welfare and food stamps.
 Food stamp benefits, which are Federally financed, are calculated according to a family's cash income. If the state spends $1 of its own to increase a poor family's welfare benefits, that same family would then lose 30 cents worth of food stamps. In effect, states would be spending $1 for only 70 cents worth of benefits.
 Turning welfare over to the states to run as they choose could also set off what Professor Peterson called "the race to the bottom." Fueling the competition among states to slash benefits and restrict eligibility for welfare would be the common perception that generous welfare programs are a magnet for the poor.
 "When you shift the locus of decision-making down, each state wants to undercut the others' welfare benefits so as not to attract low-income people," he said.
 Even under the current system, states have allowed inflation to erode the value of cash welfare benefits by more than 40 percent since 1972. And already, some governors are asking Washington to waive current Federal welfare rules to impose time limits and other restrictions.
 For example, Massachusetts is seeking a two-year limit on welfare to employable single parents and their children; Connecticut's Governor, John G. Rowland, wants a 21-month limit. Mr. Rowland said he believes the policy, which would be the harshest in the nation, will discourage poor families from moving there.

HEADLINE: THE NATION: Past Masters;
Blowing the Dust Off the Constitution That Was

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE Supreme Court gift shop keeps stacks of pocket-sized Constitutions by the cash registers and sells them to tourists by the thousands each year. The little booklets are 35 pages long and are, of course, completely authentic. But when the Justices meet upstairs to decide a case, the written Constitution is only one of several constitutions that are, in a manner of speaking, also on the table.
 There is the body of precedent that defines the Constitution as currently understood. 
 There is the Constitution that once was, as defined by precedents that have been formally overruled or less formally placed on a shelf.
 And there is, through a continual process of challenge and change dating back to the country's earliest years, another constitution struggling to be born.

 
 
Gun and Term Limits
 Recent events at the Court have moved that struggle to a new plane. Two 5-to-4 decisions in the last month suggest that a long-discarded set of constitutional principles -- a "Constitution-in-exile," to use a phrase coined by one of its advocates, Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg of the Federal appeals court here -- is about to assume its place at the table as a reincarnation of the Constitution that was.
 One of the decisions, United States v. Lopez, invalidated a Federal law that prohibited the possession of guns near a school. In doing so, the decision limited the scope of congressional power over interstate commerce for the first time since the New Deal.
 The other decision, U.S. Term Limits v. Thornton, barely struck down state-imposed term limits for members of Congress over a startling dissent by Justice Clarence Thomas that argued not only that term limits are valid but also that the Federal Government operates in large measure at the sufferance of the states.
 In an essay in the current issue of Regulation magazine, published by the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank here, Judge Ginsburg offered an inventory of constitutional doctrines that the Court repudiated about 60 years ago when it began to endorse the exercise of national economic power at the heart of the New Deal.
 Among these were the doctrine that had viewed as illegitimate the delegation of power by Congress to the administrative agencies; the demise of that doctrine was the prerequisite for the growth of the modern regulatory state. Another was the commerce clause, which the Court had viewed until the mid-1930's as a brake on the exercise of national power over the economy, rather than a charter for it. Another was the takings clause, which requires compensation when private property is "taken for public use" and which served as a limitation on Government land use regulation.
 "The memory of these ancient exiles, banished for standing in opposition to unlimited government," Judge Ginsburg wrote, "is kept alive by a few scholars who labor on in the hope of a restoration, a second coming of the Constitution of liberty -- even if perhaps not in their own lifetimes."
 Those self-referential words, written before the Lopez decision, now sound quaint. A full restoration may not be imminent, but this agenda is hardly in exile; it is, for the first time in more than a generation, in play. For example, a year ago, in Dolan v. City of Tigard, a 5-to-4 decision written by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist took a significant step toward reinvigorating the takings clause by requiring a new degree of justification by local governments before they impose land use restrictions on property-owners.
 On another front, the 10th Amendment, which reserves to the states powers not given to the Federal Government by the Constitution, is in the ascendance, invoked most recently in a 1992 majority opinion by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. In that case, New York v. United States, the Court struck down a Federal environmental law that required states either to regulate the low-level radioactive waste generated within their borders or to "take title" to the waste and assume all legal liability for it.
 "States are not mere political subdivisions of the United States," Justice O'Connor said in concluding that the law infringed on state sovereignty.
 Even if the Court remains unwilling to go so far as to dismantle the Federal Government as administrative state, overturn the string of precedents that extended the Bill of Rights from the Federal Government to the states, or sharply curb the scope of Federal preemption of state law -- outcomes that still appear far-fetched if no longer completely inconceivable -- the polarities of the debate have shifted.
 The debate that has preoccupied modern constitutional law has been the question of rights: the right to privacy, to due process, to equal protection. Now the Court, for the first time in half a century, is engaging in a debate over power: where power resides in the Federal system and how the Constitution's grant of powers to the national Government is to be interpreted.

 
 
Marshall's Plan
 That "the Federal Government's powers are limited and enumerated," as Justice Thomas said in his dissenting opinion last week, is almost a truism. Article I, Section 8 gives Congress the power to impose taxes, regulate commerce, declare war, coin money, establish Federal courts below the Supreme Court level, protect copyrights, and so on.
 The textual list, of course, begs the questions of interpretation. Is the list meant to be exclusive? How strictly are the enumerated powers to be read? Does Congress have implied powers, or is it limited to those expressly granted? What is the meaning of Section 8's final clause, granting Congress the right "to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper" for carrying out its powers?
 These are ancient questions that Chief Justice John Marshall's opinions for the early Supreme Court had appeared to resolve in favor of a strong national government. The tone of Justice Thomas's dissent last week suggests that once again the assumptions underlying those early decisions' allocations of power are, to some members of the Court, far from self-evident truths.
 One question now is how activist the current Justices are prepared to be in overturning precedent in order to bring their constitutional vision home. The Lopez decision, striking down the Federal Gun-Free School Zones Act, did not actually overturn any of the Court's commerce clause precedents. Rather, Chief Justice Rehnquist's majority opinion adopted a narrow definition of economic activity that made a more frontal assault unnecessary. But if the Lopez majority is serious, it will not be satisfied for long with what it can accomplish through indirection and redefinition.
 A Federal Government whose authority was limited by the Constitution in exile could look dramatically different. If Congress could not delegate legislative authority to administrative agencies, a vast quantity of rules and regulations would wither along with the agencies that promulgated them. Land use and environmental regulation would be sharply curbed. The constitutional underpinning of Federal civil rights laws, based on the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce, would be called into question.
 The Constitution in exile is not the only vision competing with the status quo. Liberals have theirs, too, under which the Government would have affirmative obligations to guarantee housing and minimum subsistence; actions that have the effect of discrimination would be seen as violating the constitutional guarantee of equal protection even in the absence of an intent to discriminate; and constitutional norms that now apply only to government action would also apply in the private sector on the theory that there is no longer a meaningful distinction between the public and private spheres. Government would be seen as violating an individual's right to due process not only by actual misconduct but also by inaction, by a failure to protect citizens from foreseeable harm.
 These principles cannot really be seen as a constitution in exile, because most have never been accepted as part of the Constitution. Rather, they make up a kind of shadow constitution that liberal scholars embrace as a natural extension of their golden age, the Supreme Court under Chief Justice Earl Warren, who retired in 1969.
 Which golden age would Chief Justice Rehnquist and his allies in the Lopez majority -- Justice Thomas and Justices O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy and Antonin Scalia -- invoke if they had to select one?
 Justice Kennedy, who departed from this group and deprived Justice Thomas of a majority in the term limits case, said in a concurring opinion in the Lopez case that "the wrong turn was the Court's dramatic departure in the 1930's" from the limited view of Congress's power that had lasted 150 years.
 Was the golden age the Court of the 30's then? Or earlier than that, before the Civil War amendments brought the full meaning of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights home to the states? Or was it earlier still, before the Federalists won the ratification battle by which the Constitution became the law of the land? A question that would have sounded preposterous only weeks ago is now merely provocative.

HEADLINE: Guatemalan Ex-Dictator on Rebound

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: GUATEMALA, May 26

 BODY:
When he was Guatemala's head of state, his 16-month tenure was among the bloodiest in this country's violent history, with thousands killed and more than a million displaced. When he was ousted in a coup in 1983, many Guatemalans assumed that like other deposed dictators before him, he would fade quietly into obscurity.
But in a remarkable political comeback, Gen. Efrain Rios Montt was elected Speaker of Guatemala's Congress in December. Now, with the presidential election less than six months away, he has emerged as the leading candidate. 
 He is vowing to run in defiance of a constitutional provision that bars him from seeking that office because he previously held it as a result of a coup. The courts have repeatedly upheld the prohibition.
"For me it's the presidency or nothing," General Rios Montt, 68, said during an interview on Wednesday in his spacious office at the ornate National Congress building.
"More than a campaign, this is a question of principle, a movement," he added, to clean up crime and corruption and "let the voice of the people be heard."
The retired armed forces chief says his current electoral crusade at the head of the rightist Guatemalan Republican Front is the culmination of "a struggle of more than 20 years" that began when he ran for President in 1974 and the election was stolen out from under him.
Since he became a born-again, evangelical Protestant in the late 1970's, he has viewed himself as Guatemala's man of destiny, chosen by God to lead the country out of a wilderness of immorality and suffering.
"I have not lied and I have not deceived these people," he said. "I have made a commitment to do what I ought to do, not what I want to do."
The resurgence of General Rios Montt comes at a moment of deep crisis for Guatemala and its relations with the United States. In particular, recent disclosures of CIA payoffs to Guatemalan military officials and accusations that Guatemalan soldiers killed an American innkeeper and a guerrilla leader who was the husband of an American lawyer have shaken the political system here.
He became President the last time as a result of a coup in March 1982, and immediately began a ferocious campaign against leftist guerrillas.
Thousands of Guatemalans, most of them Indian peasants, were massacred in the violence that followed, and a million others were forcibly resettled or driven into exile before Gen. Oscar Mejia Victores seized power in another military coup late in 1983.
In 1985 Guatemala approved a new Constitution that included an article apparently intended to put an end to General Rios Montt's efforts to return to the presidency to, as he often put it, finish the divine task he had begun.
Article 186 bars "the leader or leaders of a coup d'etat, armed revolution or similar movement" and "those who as a consequence of such acts become chief of state" from running for President.
When General Rios Montt tried to run for President in 1990, the Constitutional Court ruled that he was ineligible, and he withdrew from the race. But this time, he said, "I am not just a simple citizen," but rather head of the national legislature, able to "go on the attack" and orchestrate changes to make his candidacy legal.
Earlier this year, his party introduced revised election laws that would have eliminated the authority of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal, the national elections board, to disqualify candidates. But the constitutional court quickly struck down the proposal, citing procedural irregularities.
Now General Rios Montt's supporters, the largest bloc in Congress, have introduced a measure to replace the current members of the elections board.
"Everything I have done is legal," he said. "There has never been a sentence handed down against me -- only opinions, never a judged case."
General Rios Montt's critics see his insistence on running as a blatant disregard for democracy.
"If it was illegal five years ago, it is illegal now, because nothing has changed, not the law and not history," said Mario Antonio Sandoval, a leading political columnist for the newspaper Prensa Libre.
On Thursday, Msgr. Alvaro Ramazzini, spokesman for the Guatemalan Bishops' Confrence, called General Rios Montt a man whose behavior showed "a lack of ethics." While President, he added, the general was responsible for "criminal acts that the people ought not to forget."
His candidacy is also opposed by many of his former colleagues in the military.
Col. Francisco Luis Gordillo, who helped organize the 1982 coup, recently appealed to the general's "nationalism and patriotism to desist from his presidential aspirations," saying that they were not only illegal but that they would lead to international economic sanctions that would be "fatal for Guatemala."
But citing another section of the Constitution, General Rios Montt argues that the prohibition from office cannot be applied to him retroactively. He also maintains that the restriction is unconstitutional because it deprives voters of their right to choose their leaders in a democratic process.
"I have the right to choose" whether to run for President, General Rios Montt said. "They do not have the right to withhold that decision from me."
General Rios Montt's main opponent, a former Mayor of Guatemala City, Alvaro Arzu, who is the candidate of the conservative Party for National Advancement, argues that supporters of democracy need not worry about the general's prospects.
"With or without General Rios Montt, we are in a condition to defeat politically the myth of the all-powerful dictator with his magic wand of the iron fist," Mr. Arzu told reporters here this week.
But recent opinion polls seem to indicate otherwise. In a survey of voters published earlier this month by the newspaper Siglo XXI, only 33 percent of voters polled said they planned to vote on Nov. 12, but 48 percent of those favored General Rios Montt, compared with 27 percent for Mr. Arzu.
Guatemalan and foreign political analysts say General Rios Montt's popularity stems at least partly from the disillusionment Guatemalans feel after a decade of nominal civilian rule and democracy.
Corruption flourished under Vinicio Cerezo Arevalo, who took power as an elected civilian President to succeed General Mejia Victores. Mr. Cerezo's successor, Jorge Serrano Elias, who was elected in 1990, tried to dissolve the Government and suspend constitutional rights two years ago. He failed and was replaced by a weak caretaker President, Ramiro de Leon Carpio.
"The electorate wants a military man because we represent credibility, law and order," argued Gen. Hector Gramajo, a former Defense Minister who is also a presidential candidate but so far is not doing well in the opinion polls. "That is exactly where Cerezo, Serrano and this guy who is in there now have failed."
General Gramajo predicted that General Rios Montt would not be allowed to run and said that he expected to be the main beneficiary.
General Rios Montt said that if allowed to run, he might follow the counsel of his political advisers, who have told him to "just take it easy, because I've already won."
If his effort to register as a candidate is rejected, he said, he will launch a campaign of "peaceful resistance" and campaign on the hustings exactly as if he were a recognized candidate.
Guatemalan political leaders and foreign diplomats said that could lead to a destabilizing political impasse, and referred to a recent prediction that General Rios Montt made in response to criticism of his actions.
"Anarchy will prevail if I am not permitted to run," he warned.

HEADLINE: Irish Economic Growth Lifts Hopes

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: LIMERICK, Ireland

 BODY:
When Lisa O'Dea's parents finished school 38 years ago, job opportunities were few, and like generations of Irish before them they went abroad to find work, in their case staying 15 years in economic exile in the United States before coming home.
The situation facing Miss O'Dea as a 23-year-old graduate business student at the University of Limerick could hardly be more different. Ireland, long one of Western Europe's worst economic laggards, is in the midst of a major transformation, and is now enjoying rapid growth, booming exports to the rest of Europe and high rates of new jobs in manufacturing and technology industries. 
 "I'm very optimistic about the opportunities we have," Miss O'Dea said, sitting among a group of classmates. "If we want to work in Ireland we will be able to. A lot of us may choose to go abroad, but we don't have to go abroad."
With rising prosperity, residents said, has come a growing sense of confidence among people who have always seen themselves as one of Europe's poor relations. And with Ireland no longer so shackled economically to Britain, they said, the country increasingly wants to assert itself on the European stage, lobbying, for example, to be among the first countries to enter a planned European currency union before the turn of the century.
"One of the biggest transformations of the last 10 or 15 years is that as a country we're increasingly aware that we control our own destiny," said Tom Finucane, a young engineer at Analog Devices, an American-owned computer chip company that is among the many technology companies to set up shop in western Ireland in recent years.
The Irish turnaround has its limits. Unemployment, though expected to continue declining this year, remains above 14 percent, one of the worst rates in Western Europe.
Pockets of poverty still blight cities and the countryside. Economic output per person is still only 73 percent of the average for Western Europe, although up from 62 percent in 1988.
And by many visible standards, Ireland remains far from the affluence enjoyed by most other Western European nations. The Irish, for example, own 228 cars per 1,000 inhabitants, compared with 361 in Britain and 480 in Germany.
Part of the economy's buoyancy comes from a $1.6 billion a year subsidy to Ireland by the European Union that goes to everything from road-building to job training.
But the country has succeeded in luring many foreign companies to Ireland by offering tax breaks, a relatively low-paid and well-educated work force and other incentives.
It has brought Government finances under control since the late 1980's after a decade of profligacy and mismanagement that sent inflation soaring. As a result, this nation of 3.5 million people has posted one of Europe's strongest economic records over the last few years.
While most European nations saw their economies stagnate or shrink starting in 1992 in what was the worst global recession since World War II, Ireland's output increased substantially each of the last several years and grew 6.5 percent last year. Inflation was only 2.5 percent.
Exports grew by more than 10 percent last year. The economy created 34,000 new jobs last year, helping reduce the unemployment rate from 15.8 percent in 1993. Ireland is the only country in Europe to have consistently created new manufacturing jobs since the mid-1980's. With job prospects improving within Ireland relative to other nations, net emigration has fallen from a recent peak of 44,000 in 1989 to 10,000 last year. The prospect of a permanent peace in Northern Ireland has raised hopes for further foreign investment and more tourism in both the Irish Republic and in Ulster.
And where once the economy was built on agriculture, it is increasingly driven by the computer industry, pharmaceuticals and other sophisticated, relatively high-paying manufacturing businesses.
"There's been an absolute transformation," said Terry Baker, an economist at the Economic and Social Research Institute in Dublin.
The changes are easily seen in the region around Limerick, a gritty city 120 miles southwest of Dublin. Until the 1970's the area had little industry except some grain and flour milling and meat processing, and relied heavily on nearby Shannon Airport and on small-scale farming for employment.
Since then, agricultural employment is down sharply, to 22 percent of the local work force from 45 percent, with tourism rapidly catching up with farming in economic importance.
The mills and the meatpacking plants are gone, replaced by technology companies, many from the United States, that have moved in over the last decade, attracted by the country's low taxes, low wages and relatively high educational levels. Analog Devices, for example, employs 920 people in the area and both designs and makes chips here. It is just finishing construction of a state-of-the-art chip manufacturing site.
Just outside of town is the University of Limerick, which has built itself into a center of science, technology and business training and feeds a steady stream of graduates into good jobs.
The rundown city center has been partly redeveloped, with a new shopping mall and office buildings.
"We've created an employment base that just wasn't here before," said Paul Sheane, the chief executive of Shannon Development, the regional development agency. The agency was set up in 1959 by the Government to help replace the jobs lost from Shannon Airport's declining importance as a trans-Atlantic stopover, and has gone on to play a key role in the area's transformation.
But Mr. Sheane said the region and the country still had a long way to go in creating jobs -- a reality that is only too evident in the shuttered store windows and grim housing projects in large swaths of Limerick, where unemployment in some neighborhoods runs to 50 percent. Unemployment is particularly high among older workers who lost jobs in dying industries years ago and lack the education and the skills for the region's new high-tech jobs.
"We now have a university and some very good employers in terms of multinational companies that create well-paid employment for a lot of people, and there is a sense that the economy of Limerick city and midwest region generally is healthy," said John Hannafin, vice chairman of the Paul Partnership, an organization of community groups set up to address poverty and unemployment.
"But alongside that there are a lot of people who aren't particularly benefiting, who say it hasn't really helped them and their families," Mr. Hannafin said. "There is a sense of bewilderment and hopelessness among people who feel the new Ireland is leaving them behind."

HEADLINE: New York's Quest For More Visitors

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER 

 BODY:
Maybe the oldest joke about New York City, Stephen J. Morello said, is the one about the guy who gets off the bus, puts down his bags, looks at the sky and shouts: "Look out, New York! I'm going to conquer you!" Then he looks down and his bags are gone.
It's a wryly appropriate story for Mr. Morello to tell about his job as president of the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau; in a city that sells everything, it's his task to sell the city itself, to expand the flow of strangers coming into town in order to separate them from their money, if not their belongings. 
 Mr. Morello uses the story to illustrate his own welcome to town. It was a year ago, just after Mr. Morello took over the post, that John S. Dyson, the Deputy Mayor for Economic Development, described the bureau as "asleep at the wheel." And in the intervening months, he's found himself in the tangled leadership of the city's tourist industry, where -- surprise! -- any number of people are willing to tell him how to do his job.
"If I'd said I was going to come in and conquer this thing, get everybody on the same page and moving in the same direction," said Mr. Morello, "I'd still be down at the Port Authority looking for my suitcase."
Tomorrow is a landmark in Mr. Morello's stewardship of the bureau, an occasion he has spent the year preparing for. For the next three days, 1,500 tour operators from 69 countries -- people who sent 80 percent of the 44 million foreign visitors to the United States last year -- as well as more than 1,000 American travel suppliers, are to gather at the Javits Center for the Travel Industry Association's annual convention. Known, inexplicably, as Pow Wow, it is the nation's largest convention dedicated to generating international travel to the United States.
At the convention, the delegates will purchase blocks of airline tickets, hotel rooms, rental cars and the like, which they will then divide into smaller packages to be made available to travel agencies and individual travelers in their home countries. The association estimates that more than $2.6 billion in business will be transacted, and that 10 percent of the total is directed at the host city over the following two or three years. Do the math: that's $260 million poured into the New York economy.
"It's kind of like hosting the Super Bowl," said Merrett Stierheim, president of the Greater Miami Convention and Visitors Bureau, which held Pow Wow last year.
No wonder the usually contentious components of the city's tourist industry -- the state and city governments, private business and the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau -- have put aside their squabbles to lick their collective lips.
"In all the years I've been involved I've never seen a better orchestrated, more effective effort to promote tourism," said Martin E. Segal, the chairman emeritus of Lincoln Center, who is heading the committee to involve the arts in Pow Wow.
Only last fall Mr. Segal resigned as chairman of the host committee for Pow Wow, rather than spend the year pleading for sponsorship money after the city government pledged to contribute only $100,000 of the convention's $3.2 million cost.
Now, however, he says the convention represents "a spectacular opportunity for us," a chance to show off what the city's tourist industry has learned in the last three years, since a cooperative venture between city government and business, "NY92," was formed to promote the city during the Democratic National Convention.
"I think it is accepted now, as a consequence of NY92, NY93 and NY94, that we're all in the same boat," Mr. Segal said. "The restaurants won't do well unless there are tourists; the hotels won't have occupants unless people come to town, and people won't come unless there are interesting events."
 
The Market
Signs of Health, And Lurking Perils
 Pow Wow arrives at a curious juncture in New York City's tourism history. There is much good news: Some 24.6 million people visited last year, spending more than $10 billion. Hotel occupancy was 75.2 percent, up nearly 6 percentage points from 1993, even as the average price of a room rose nearly $7, to $144.03. Overseas visitors numbered 4.1 million, a record for any American city, up 8.5 percent from 1993. Broadway attendance was up, as was the number of visitors to the Convention and Visitors Bureau Information Center at Columbus Circle.
But there are causes for concern. Even as the number of visitors increases, the city's share of the travel market, particularly the international market, is dwindling. (It is difficult to measure its share of the domestic market because different cities count visitors in different ways. In any case, though only 20 percent of the city's visitors last year were from abroad, they spent 40 percent of the tourist dollars.)
With the dollar enervated, foreign visitors are flocking to destinations all over the United States in record numbers, but of those from New York City's top international markets -- Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, France, Italy, Mexico, Spain, Switzerland, Brazil and Venezuela -- more have been going to places like Orlando, Fla., and Las Vegas since 1990. The worry is that when the dollar regains its vigor and the raw visitor numbers recede, New York will be left with a reduced slice of a smaller pie.
This is particularly troubling because tourism is a growth industry, a potential source for gains in jobs and tax revenue. The Travel Industry Association says tourism was responsible for a $22 billion trade surplus for the nation last year. Tourist spending generated $575 million in New York City tax revenue in 1993, the most recent available figures, after a steady upward climb from $513 million in 1990.
All of which points to an increased need for the city to sell itself. "We don't need capital dollars to be stronger," said Jonathan Tisch, president and chief executive of Loews Hotels. "We need promotional dollars. The demand generators are already in place. The Met is here. The Museum of Natural History is here. Broadway is here. Sixty-two thousand hotel rooms are here. The finest restaurants are here. We just have to continually find ways to let people know we're here."
 
The Financing
All Want Benefits; Few Want to Pay
 How to market New York is the subject of the current tangle in the tourist business, and that puts Mr. Morello, who for nine years was a deputy commissioner in the state's Department of Economic Development and hasn't yet moved from Albany, at the heart of the tangle. He arrived at the beginning of what John Linen, a vice-chairman of the American Express Company and chairman of NY94 called "a breakthrough summer" in the city's tourist industry, when private interests and the city government finally began cooperating. The NY94 campaign had just announced a program that tied theaters, stores, restaurants and hotels in a tour package available with a single phone call.
But the convention and visitors bureau had largely been left out of the planning, which is what led Mr. Dyson to make his disparaging "asleep at the wheel" remark.
Mr. Morello has received high marks from those who have worked with him toward unifying the various constituencies, but that does not mean the bureau's problems have disappeared.
As an indication of how fragmented the constituencies remain, two weeks ago the state unveiled its new I Love New York campaign at a breakfast for industry leaders sponsored by the Association for a Better New York. There, Charles A. Gargano, the State Commissioner for Economic Development, and Libby Pataki introduced a 12-minute promotional film, which, among other lapses, showed only a passing image of one Broadway theater. Governor George E. Pataki was featured speaking on behalf of upstate, but not the city. The audience left incensed.
"It could have been Virginia," said one person who spoke on the condition he not be identified.
The Convention and Visitors Bureau is not a city agency; it is a privately run trade organization with 1,500 dues-paying members, mostly New York hotels and restaurants and other businesses that benefit from tourism. It does, however, get the largest chunk of its $7.2 million budget from the city, which Mr. Morello refers to as the bureau's "megaclient," and it also gets about $400,000 from the state. There is the rub: Whom does the bureau serve?
Businesses want a return on their membership fees. The city wants to be assured that the bureau is working for the city as a whole, including the outer boroughs. At long last, there is agreement that the singular goal of bringing more tourists to the city will help everyone. But how to do that with limited resources?
Many industry people point out that other cities, much smaller ones, spend a lot more money supporting tourism. San Francisco's current budget for its visitors bureau is $11.5 million; in Miami it is $12.5 million. Las Vegas, which was built on tourist money, spends a whopping $86.1 million.
Among other things, the New York budget limitations keep the bureau from promoting the city through consumer advertising. For advertising to high-end tourists, said Alan Stillman, president of the New York Restaurant Group. "New York City spends zero. It is penny wise and pound foolish to the nth degree."
One frustration for Mr. Morello is emblematic. Last fall, after years of lobbying, hotel industry executives succeeded in rolling back the state and city room taxes to 13.25 percent plus $2 on rooms costing more than $100, from a national high of 19.25 percent plus $2. But lost with the rollback was the part of the city tax dedicated to the visitors' bureau, leaving the bureau to compete for city allocations in the budget process. Last year, the dedicated tax brought the bureau $4 million. This year's budget allocated $3 million, and for next year the city has proposed a cut.
"So now, with the tax gone, we have an opportunity to market ourselves more aggressively," Mr. Morello said. "But we don't have the resources."
Everyone understands the political issue -- it's tough to explain giving money to tourism when you're taking it from schools, hospitals and social services -- but the complaint is that such a view is shortsighted. Tourism money is not spent, the argument goes; it's invested.
To demonstrate this, Mr. Morello pointed out convention sales. The visitors' bureau's five sales managers booked an average of 64 conventions last year, whose delegates totaled 366,000. That's 73,000 per sales manager, which projects into $291 million in delegate spending per sales manager.
"The city got $2.9 million in tax revenues from each sales manager," Mr. Morello said, "which is a 42-to-1 return on what it costs to employ them."
 
The Strategy
Balancing Leisure And Conventions
 For now, the wrangle is over how to spend the money that is available. And as a result, one persistent criticism of the visitors bureau is that it spends too much soliciting convention business rather than leisure tourism.
"The convention business is important, and it's a wholesale way of going about bringing people here," Mr. Dyson said. "The issue is, What should the city's contribution be going toward? And to what extent are we only replacing what ought to be the business of hotels to do their own marketing?"
Mr. Dyson's attitude rankles many on the NY95 committee, who believe that he is arrogantly trying to control the tourist business from City Hall. He is seeking bids to conduct a marketing survey among travelers to determine why people come here and why they don't, which can then be used to create a new marketing effort.
For his part, Mr. Morello admits that he has concentrated his effort on conventions. Not only is that not surprising, he said, it isn't wrong. After all, leisure visitors to the city are increasing; convention visitors, because of the well-known problems at the Javits Center, because of the construction of newer convention sites in other cities and because of the hotel tax, have been dwindling for years. Now that the hotel tax is gone and there is more talk of trying to solve problems at the Javits Center, there is an opportunity to increase convention business.
Besides, he added, conventions bring in big numbers of visitors who spend, on average, more money than leisure visitors. And, finally, isn't revenue the point?
"We go after conventions because that's where the fish are," he said. "If someone gave me $4 million to go after the consumer market, we would have an effective and visible leisure market effort."
New York has not been the site of Pow Wow since its inauguration in 1969, one indication that the city's interest in selling itself to leisure travelers was, for many years, lax. The convention, virtually everyone agrees, is a crucial step after years of complacency.
"The mistake people make is that we don't pursue the leisure market," Mr. Morello said. "We're just working it at the trade level. That's what Pow Wow is."

HEADLINE: Celebration Is Disputed In Jerusalem

BYLINE: By JOEL GREENBERG 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, May 27

 BODY:
In this bitterly contested city, preparations to mark 3,000 years since King David made Jerusalem the capital of the biblical Kingdom of Israel have set off a dispute over rights to the city's heritage and its future.
The festivities, scheduled to start in September and to last for 15 months, are officially promoted as an international cultural celebration of a city holy to three faiths -- Judaism, Christianity and Islam. But the planned observances have become a political bone of contention. 
 Palestinian spokesmen and leftist critics in Israel denounce the celebration as an assertion of Israeli claims to Jerusalem during the year in which Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization are supposed to start negotiating the city's future. King David and his ancient seat of government, the critics argue, have been marshaled to support arguments that Jerusalem should remain Israel's undivided capital. As it happens, Sunday is Jerusalem Day, when Israelis commemorate the capture of East Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 war.
Wary of taking sides before the negotiations, the European Union has advised its members not to take part in the 3,000-year anniversary celebrations. The Palestinian Authority has condemned the festivities as an Israeli hijacking of Jerusalem's historical legacy.
The Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, who introduced a bill this month to move the United States Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, cited the anniversary as reason to insist on groundbreaking in 1996.
Tensions over Jerusalem were heightened in recent weeks by Israel's confiscation Arab-owned land in the city, mostly for Jewish housing. Israel suspended the move after international protests, but the dispute illustrated how the 1993 agreement in Oslo between Israel and the P.L.O. -- which says talks on Jerusalem should start no later than next May -- has increased the sensitivities surrounding the city.
The anniversary celebrations are no exception.
Conceived several years ago by Teddy Kollek, who was then Mayor of Jerusalem, they were seen as an opportunity to promote the city around the world and generate tourism, investment and development. Culture, he insisted, was his sole intent, not politics.
"I had hoped that somehow the world could identify with it, to give the world the feeling that this is theirs," he said of the anniversary. "But it became politicized."
Jerusalem's current Mayor, Ehud Olmert, and Tourism Minister Uzi Baram acknowledge that the anniversary observances have political overtones, even though they are designed as a cultural tribute.
"Of course we're interested in highlighting the fact that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel, but we say that only as Israel's capital can it be open to all faiths," Mr. Olmert said.
Planners say the celebrations are intended to highlight the city as a universal spiritual center, but they are also "likely to strengthen Jerusalem's role as the historic and political capital of the Jewish people," according to a statement by Jerusalem 3000, the agency organizing the events.
The planned activities, with a budget of $11 million, include music and theater performances, arts festivals, fairs, and conferences on Jerusalem's history. While many events focus on Jerusalem's place in Jewish history and religion, several also explore the city's role in Christianity and Islam.
But Palestinians, who regard East Jerusalem as the capital of their hoped-for state, are conspicuously absent. They say they were not asked to take part. The Israeli organizers reply that approaches were made to Palestinians, but they are staying away for political reasons.
To the Palestinian leadership, the events are "a crude attempt" to exploit Jerusalem's past to promote Israeli claims to the city's future. King David's rule, the Palestinians argue, was only one period in Jerusalem's varied history, and highlighting it in this way is distorting.
"This alleged celebration is without precedent, an act of theft in broad daylight, before the eyes and ears of the world, of the features and identity of the holiest city in the world," said a statement issued by the Palestinian Authority.
"Israel has no right to appoint itself the inheritor of the human legacy and accumulated achievements of thousands of years, and to seize them on fictitious grounds that have no proof and are refuted by historical facts."
Mr. Olmert, a member of the rightist Likud party, says he makes "no apologies" for Jerusalem 3000.
"Do we have to overlook such a historic date just because there is a debate about Jerusalem?" he said. "We can argue about the future, but why can't we celebrate the past?"

HEADLINE: Conservatives Tug at Endangered Species Act

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 27

 BODY:
As Congress reviews the Endangered Species Act, the most important debate at the moment is not between the law's defenders and its critics, but among conservatives of different stripes quarreling over how much to revise it.
One group, led by Senator Slade Gorton of Washington, has worked closely with representatives of large industries like the timber and paper companies to devise an approach that would make regulations under the law more flexible and ease the way for companies to exploit natural resources. It would leave considerable power in the hands of the Secretary of the Interior, whose agency would continue to control conservation plans for protected species using Government regulations. 
 But in the House, another approach is evolving, one that would practically do away with Federal regulations and rely instead on financial incentives to encourage landowners to preserve and enhance vanishing habitat voluntarily. The faction pressing this approach is appealing to advocates for the rights of small property owners and has gained the support of some prominent conservative natural resource economists.
Supporters of the more ambitious approach said that the law's most vociferous critics were on their side. But Senator Gorton said he believed his approach, which has been strongly condemned by liberals, will gain appeal if a more extreme alternative emerges on the right.
"The national environmental organizations exhausted their entire supply of adjectives in cussing out my bill, and they aren't going to have any left when they see a really radical proposal," he said. "Before the battle is over, mine will look pretty much middle of the road, which is what it is supposed to be."
As the struggle among conservatives plays out, one person to watch for clues to the outcome could be Speaker Newt Gingrich. Although he is likely to let Representative Don Young, an Alaska Republican who is chairman of the Resources Committee, steer the bill forward in the House, Mr. Gingrich was a sponsor of the existing law and professes a deep interest in conservation policies.
"I am very committed to bringing through the House a bill that is economically rational, biologically correct and respects the property rights of individuals," Mr. Gingrich said at a hearing on the bill this week. "That is a very tough, very high standard, and it is going to take a lot of work to get there."
Although he emphasized his sympathy for property owners who object to the law's strictures, he reminded the committee: "On the other hand, we also have to recognize that there are enormous interests that we have as human beings in maintaining biological diversity."
But Representative John Shadegg, an Arizona Republican who is helping to draft a bill that would end mandatory conservation regulations, said he believed species could be protected in new and imaginative ways, including as little regulation as possible.
"There is the typical, think inside the box, regulatory approach," he said, referring to Senator Gorton's bill. "The other school is thinking outside the box, recognizing to a slightly greater degree the interests other than the big interest groups that have already signed on to the Gorton bill."
Mr. Shadegg supports a statement of principles issued earlier this month by a coalition of small property-rights groups.
Among other things, these groups want the new law to include the following changes:
*The primary responsibility for conservation of animals and plants would be reserved to the states.
*Federal conservation efforts would rely entirely on voluntary, incentive-based programs to enlist the cooperation of America's landowners.
*Federal conservation efforts would encourage conservation through commerce, including the private propagation of animals and plants.
The Competitive Enterprise Institute, an influential conservative policy group that favors deregulation, has endorsed this approach. Calling the existing law "fundamentally flawed," Ike C. Sugg, the group's land use policy fellow, testified that "no amount of tinkering around the margins will solve its intrinsic problems."
"I don't agree with that," Senator Gorton said. "There is clearly a place for Government regulation in connection with values that are not easily reduced to dollars."
Representative Richard W. Pombo, a California Republican who is heading a task force on endangered species, said he thought that when the group presented a bill to the House Resources Committee this summer it would probably recommend "more of a fundamental change in the act," along the lines of the voluntary approach that Mr. Shadegg has proposed.
"Say that a rancher enters into a management agreement on his property, to benefit a species," said Mr. Pombo, himself a fourth-generation rancher and an ardent foe of the species protection law. "One of the incentives that could be placed out there is that the inheritance tax on passing the ranch from him to his child could be delayed as long as the property remains in a habitat conservation plan."
The advocates of a nonregulatory approach concede that it might cost a lot of money, but say they hope to pay for it by selling federally owned land to ranchers and the timber industry. And they point out that it would protect the rights of property owners without triggering another form of compensation favored by anti-regulatory conservatives -- the payment for the perceived loss of value, or "takings," of private land.
Of course, both of the two conservative camps are producing proposals that are abhorrent to environmentalists and their allies in the Clinton Administration, which has argued that the Endangered Species Act needs little change at all, beyond administrative changes to improve its use of scientific research and to encourage cooperation from private landowners.
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, said when Senator Gorton introduced his bill that it "can be summed up in seven words: it will repeal the Endangered Species Act."
Mr. Gorton, for his part, says that many of the administrative improvements that the Clinton Administration favors are compatible with the legislation he has drafted.
But with Republicans determined to change the law and with many conservative Democrats joining the effort, the voices of the Administration and the environmental groups are largely drowned out for the time being.

HEADLINE: Budget Package Stalls Over Tax Cuts

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, May 27

 BODY:
With most pieces of the state budget falling into place early this morning, the legislature found itself stymied by the one issue that has haunted Connecticut politics for the last four years: the income tax.
In an all-night session that adjourned shortly after sunrise, both houses of the General Assembly approved a budget for the next two years that would increase spending at a rate lower than inflation. But hopes for a final package today faded as lawmakers split over income tax cuts. 
 The dispute continues a legislative battle that dates from 1991, when the state first enacted an income tax after months of bitter deadlock. The clash has defined the political landscape here, pitting liberal Democrats against their more conservative party members, as well as the Republicans.
Although Speaker Thomas D. Ritter, a Democrat of Hartford, has often been credited with healing the rift in his own party, the wound was reopened with the most recent round of budget deliberations.
Gov. John G. Rowland and his fellow Republicans, with support from some Democrats, have proposed cuts in the income tax that would be phased in over the next five years. In turn, a majority of Democrats have opposed any cuts beyond the next two years.
This has left the Democratic-controlled House and the Republican-controlled Senate at odds, a situation that must be resolved by June 7, the legislature's adjournment date, if the state is to have a budget on schedule.
Leaders of both parties have agreed that there will be an income tax cut of $100 million in the fiscal year starting July 1, 1996, as well as a property tax credit of $100 million to be applied to the income tax.
The disagreement is over proposed cuts in the income tax for each of the next three fiscal years, from July 1, 1997 through June 30, 2000. Under the Republican-supported proposal, income tax revenues could be reduced about $317 million by the final year. The state expects to collect about $2.7 billion in income tax revenue in the 1996-97 fiscal year.
State Representative Annette W. Carter, a Democrat from Hartford who helped lead the fight against the future tax cuts, remarked after the session, "Some of us bled hard to get that tax in place, and to now have to remove that -- well, I just don't like it.
"It was a good idea then, and it's a good idea now."
And State Representative Moira K. Lyons, a Democrat of Stamford and the majority leader, said it was risky to make a commitment to tax cuts beyond 1997 when it was not clear how the state would pay for them. "Both sides of the aisle want to give tax reductions," she said. "The difference is in the reality of doing it. We need to know that we have the money to keep our promises."
But in the debate early this morning, Representative Robert M. Ward of North Branford, the Republican minority leader, rejected such an argument. "The budget is not done well until we further expand income tax reductions over the next four years," Mr. Ward said. "Frankly, I don't think it's deep enough."
The income tax dispute interrupted what had been a surprisingly harmonious session in the House. Although some Democrats had expressed skepticism Friday night about a plan to sell interest in the state lottery to raise money for a tax cut, no one objected to the measure when it was discussed on the floor.
Indeed, speaker after speaker rose in the House to praise the bipartisan spirit behind the budget and to say it represented sacrifice on both sides.
The budget proposes spending $9.8 billion in the 1996 fiscal year, up 2.6 percent from this year, and then $10.1 billion in 1996-97, an increase of 3.7 percent. It would be the smallest budget increase in 25 years, and would represent half the growth of the previous two years.
To do that, the budget includes some tough cuts. For instance, it proposes reducing the rate structure that reimburses nursing homes to $809 million next year, saving more than $71 million. Benefits to families on welfare would be cut by $55 million from this year's projected spending, down to $314 million.
Other areas fared better. A job placement and training program for welfare recipients had its budget doubled to $16 million from about $8.5 million. An array of programs for people who have AIDS, whose financing Mr. Rowland was going to virtually eliminate, had almost all of their money restored.
The House voted 143 to 6 in favor of the budget at 4:55 A.M., drawing support from both parties. The tax vote in the House a little more than an hour later passed 126 to 21, again with bipartisan backing.
The Senate also approved the state budget this morning, in a 19-to-17 vote that split along party lines, with Republicans supporting and Democrats opposing. The Senate has yet to take up the tax package, though the Republican leadership there has said it is committed to five years of income tax cuts.

HEADLINE: Budget Test for Mr. Clinton

 BODY:
Except for his tactically inept proposal to balance the budget in 10 years, President Clinton has played the budget game pretty cannily for a person who lacks the votes to impose his will on Congress. Debate driven by the warring ambitions of Bob Dole, Phil Gramm and Newt Gingrich has brought the brutality of the Republican plan into full view.
But voters will eventually demand more of their President than deft tactics or a clever re-election strategy. Mr. Clinton will have to present a principled reason why they should care if he wins re-election. He must answer then, definitively, whether he agrees with Speaker Gingrich et al that the budget must be balanced soon and, if so, at what pain. 
 On this score, Mr. Clinton's best campaign plan might also be the most honest approach for a Democrat. He can assure voters that he is not Republican lite and that he believes deficit reduction, though important, is not the only fiscal policy that matters. Balancing the budget by pounding working people or eviscerating public investment makes no moral or economic sense.
The purpose of eliminating deficits is to reduce Federal borrowing that siphons money from corporate investment. But it accomplishes little to pump up private investment by knocking down public investment -- in infrastructure, training, education and research. Mr. Gingrich may see little outside the military and law enforcement that the Government does well. But most Americans are not so doctrinaire. Nor do they believe the world's richest country must pound its poor to balance its books.
America can have declining deficits, compassion for the poor and public investment. It would take sizable cuts in military hardware and corporate subsidies coupled with reform of the health care industry to achieve these goals. What has been missing is Presidential leadership to show the public that the Gingrich/Gramm highway will not lead to the twin destinations of a fair, healthy economy and an effective government.
Mr. Clinton's budget raises Pentagon spending and shies away from reforming Medicare and Medicaid -- the Federal programs most responsible for escalating deficits. He protected corporate subsidies, even though his Secretary of Labor brought the wasteful giveaways to the nation's attention. Political survival forced Mr. Clinton to meet Republicans part way by proposing to cut taxes by about $70 billion, money better spent on deficit reduction or education and training programs.
The Republicans, to their credit, delivered on their campaign promise to balance the budget in seven years. But their evasions are still stunning. They propose huge cuts in Medicare, but fail to propose specific reforms of the program or of the health care system to achieve the savings. Without reform, the budget cuts would ruin health care for the elderly and saddle everyone else with steeply higher insurance premiums. With reform, the G.O.P. would achieve savings, but much too slowly to balance the budget in seven years. Here's where Mr. Clinton's brief flirtation with a longer horizon makes sense. Done correctly, entitlement reform will rack up large savings, but the deficit impact might be years away.
The Republicans sought to purchase votes by promising huge tax cuts -- $350 billion in the House plan, implicity $170 billion in the Senate plan. They are designed to do little for investment and growth but a lot to trigger consumption that the economy does not need. To pay for these benighted tax cuts, the G.O.P. would hack away at the country's science and technology infrastructure.
Mr. Clinton has identified these Republican missteps, but said nothing about how he would do better. Even with his limited political strength, he can tip the balance toward sanity and humanity. He can write a more honest budget that reflects what he believes the country truly needs. He can veto Republican excesses, especially those that threaten to do irreversible damage, for example, to welfare programs and universities. Mr. Clinton still has the chance to enter the fray on the side of sensible deficit reduction and humane spending of whatever money Congress taxes and borrows.

'Small-Market' Angels Enter the Disney Fold

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Baseball officials were delighted when the Walt Disney Company recently added 25 percent of the California Angels to a stable that already included Mickey Mouse and the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. In a time of low morale and suffering economy, the officials viewed Disney's interest and entry into their game as a highly positive development.
"With all the negative stuff, here's one of the premier companies in the world very aggressively wanting to acquire a major league club," one official said. 
 The Angels themselves reacted positively to the development. No sooner did the club announce that Disney would become one-fourth owner and the managing partner than its players reeled off a seven-game winning streak and soared to an 18-9 record, matching the franchise's best start since 1978.
Questions long have hovered over the Angels, who have never reached the World Series despite constant efforts to do so in the lifetime of their revered owner, Gene Autry. And the biggest question is how did the Angels become a low-revenue, or so-called small-market, club?
The club's economic status was signaled in Kohler, Wis., in August 1993, when owners began their debate over a new revenue-sharing plan. Jackie Autry, the Angels' functioning chief operator, attended a meeting of high-revenue clubs the first day but joined low-revenue clubs for the rest of the meetings.
How could a team in the intensely populated area just south of Los Angeles be linked economically with teams in Pittsburgh, Milwaukee and Seattle? The answer is that classification has nothing to do with the size of the team's market; it's the size of the team's income that counts.
Over the years, the Angels have made questionable decisions on free agents and other personnel matters and have managed to operate the club in a way that has resulted in a steady decline in attendance, from a record 2.8 million in the division-championship season of 1982 to barely over 2 million in each of the last two full seasons.
Still, if this year's team can continue to win, it could mark something of a turnaround in the Angels' decision making. For one thing, they kept Chili Davis instead of letting him become a free agent. For another, they traded their young center fielder, Chad Curtis, for Tony Phillips.
Davis and Phillips are now two of the team's most potent hitters. Entering last night's game, they each had hit six home runs. Davis was leading the team with 26 runs batted in and Phillips was leading with 25 runs scored. Davis was also leading the team with a .386 batting average.
The most startling development, though, has been the Angels' pitching. The staff has knocked nearly two runs off the 5.42 earned run average the team had last year. And contributing to that improvement have been three veteran starters who were available to anyone.
General Manager Bill Bavasi signed Shawn Boskie to a minor league contract during the winter, then plucked Scott Sanderson and Mike Bielecki from the Players Association's free-agent camp in Homestead, Fla., all for a total of $550,000 in base salaries.
"Maybe this is blasphemy, but the union did a great job with that camp in Florida," Bavasi said.
The Angels, however, could develop a serious problem. Boskie, Bielecki and Sanderson are not in the same class as Mark Langston and Chuck Finley. If they suddenly stop being effective, the rotation could sprout large holes.
The bullpen, though, will have no ninth-inning hole as long as Lee Smith is around. Smith was another of Bavasi's sound decisions. The career saves leader, at the age of 37, continues to save victories. He had a league-leading 11 saves heading into the weekend and had not allowed a run in 12 games.
Bavasi, the lone member of a noted baseball family now working in the major leagues, has shown enough ability in 17 months on the job to retain it under the Disney people. On the other hand, Jackie Autry will remain very much involved, an official familiar with the club's plans said, and it is she who has overseen the descent into small-market status.
In gaining a one-fourth interest in the team and the option to purchase the rest of the club six months after Gene Autry's death, Disney beat out Peter Ueberroth, the former commissioner. And Disney did so in part by agreeing to pick up some of the losses this year.
Losses the Angels will have. But the combination of an improved team and an improved operation -- the Mighty Ducks have been a losing team in two years of existence but have basically sold out -- will send the Angels back toward their rightful place on the economic map.

 
 
Stronger in the West

 
 During spring training, Bill Bavasi said, people in the American League West "knew our division would be better than last year, but that's an easy thing to say because we couldn't get any worse."
Only one-fifth of the season has been played, but it has been a revealing segment of the season. Not only is the A.L. West better than last year, but it has been better than the A.L. East, which had been purported to be baseball's strongest division.
Last weekend, for the first time since the majors went to three-division play last season, all four A.L. West teams won on the same day and all four had .500 records or better. They maintained their winning records through the week.
Even more impressively, the Western Four entered the weekend with a collective 19-12 record against the Eastern Five.

 
 
Cuban Should Go Fast in Draft

 
 Players from the Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Nicaragua, Panama, Mexico, Japan and Korea can be signed by any major league club without going through the amateur draft. But Cubans in this country, either as defectors or otherwise, are considered residents of the United States and, in the view of the commissioner's office, which is the one that counts, are subject to the draft, which will take place Thursday.
Ariel Prieto, who left Cuba with that government's blessing, will be in the draft, but the 26-year-old pitcher isn't expected to last long.
"He's the best prospect to come out of Cuba," said Omar Minaya, the Texas Rangers' director of international scouting. "He probably will be a first-round choice. He could go as high as third or fourth."
While awaiting the draft, Prieto is pitching for the Palm Springs, Calif., Suns of the independent Western League. A teammate is reliever Euclides Rojas, who defected from Cuba by raft. Scouts do not consider him as strong a prospect as Prieto.
"Prieto is as interesting as Nomo," one scout said, referring to Hideo Nomo, the Los Angeles Dodgers' corkscrew pitcher from Japan. "He might pitch this year."

 
 
Some Fast Second-Guessing

 
 The Dodgers let Brett Butler, their center fielder for four years, leave as a free agent, saying they had good young players to play the outfield. Last week they traded for Roberto Kelly, put him in center field and returned Raul Mondesi to right.
The Chicago White Sox passed up Mickey Tettleton as a free-agent designated hitter, signing Chris Sabo instead. They explained that Sabo struck out less than Tettleton. They were right. Sabo struck out once every 6 at-bats, Tettleton once every 4. But Tettleton has hit 7 home runs and driven in 18 runs to 1 and 8 for Sabo. The White Sox dropped Sabo from their roster last week when they added John Kruk.
Baseball club owners like to point to the National Football League as one of the leagues that has a salary cap. But they don't talk about the N.F.L.'s revenue-sharing practices. Long before the league had a salary cap, it was sharing a vast majority of its revenues, national and local. Last week it enhanced the sharing program, creating a pool of $18 million a year for the next four years to be shared by teams whose revenues fall below the league average. The baseball owners refuse to enhance their revenue-sharing plan until the players agree to a cap or a luxury tax on payrolls, maintaining the disparity between rich and poor clubs.

HEADLINE: At Indy 500, Parity Forges Way Into Driver's Seat

BYLINE: By JOSEPH SIANO 

DATELINE: INDIANAPOLIS, May 27

 BODY:
The 1995 Indianapolis 500 may end up belonging to the mice that roared. Among them, Scott Brayton speaks the loudest.
Brayton pushed aside the waffles he was eating at his boss's race shop one morning this weekend, and recalled when he realized he was racing in the wrong groove. 
 "I was coming off a sixth-place finish at Indy in 1993," he said, "and I was six seconds behind Emerson Fittipaldi, who won. I could feel it, taste it, sense it. But I was still a long way away. Because I knew I was trying to compete against the superpowers of racing with a little money."
So he came to John Menard's garage, a few miles north of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, a detour that led to the pole position for the 1995 Indianapolis 500, and with it perhaps his best chance ever for victory.
Brayton, who had spent most of his career in mediocre cars, struggling through season after forgettable season, decided to focus his efforts where they meant the most. "The only parity that exists in racing is money and talent," Brayton said. "I felt I would go with a team that spends a lot of money on a little bit of racing."
Without knowing it, Brayton had pretty much summarized the philosophy of his boss, John Menard, who is spending a lot of money to win just one race: the Indianapolis 500. Menard's strong showing here this month (another of his drivers, Arie Luyendyk, is right next to Brayton in the middle of the front row) is just one of the factors that has turned this Indy 500 upside down.
Thanks to the influx of new teams, a new tire company and a new engine from Honda, it's not just superpowers like Penske Racing that are getting sand kicked in their visors. Even Bobby Rahal, the 1986 race winner, and Danny Sullivan, the 1985 champion, qualified in the bottom half of the lineup.
Roger Penske's team, which dominated the race last year, came back this year with a car that had a handling problem. A few years ago, he might have been able to slip into the race anyway. But the traffic around here has gotten a lot faster this year, and Penske could never catch up.
Instead, Brayton, Luyendyk and the third front-row qualifier, Scott Goodyear, have set the race's theme as well as its pace: Indy for the unemployed.
Like Brayton, both Goodyear and Luyendyk are former full-time race drivers who have only one race on their calendar this season -- the one that pays the most and means the most.
"It really wasn't hard to make a decision to come and drive here," said Luyendyk, who won the 1990 Indy 500 but whose career didn't take off after that. "Last year, I ran all season and was struggling financially, and it makes for a very long year and a very long month of May."
Menard, who owns 105 home-improvement stores in the Midwest, probably has won the race before the green flag ever drops on Sunday. For one whole month, Menard has had pictures of his cars (which, of course, carry his store's logo on them) in newspapers and on television newscasts throughout his market area. And, as he pointed out this week, "Memorial Day is our busiest weekend."
Even Goodyear, who won the only other 500-mile race on the Indy-car schedule last year in an otherwise terrible season, has learned to like working one month a year.
"I don't know if I've minded not being racing the rest of the year because I've been focusing on this event and I'm happy to be here," he said.
Why not, when his Honda engine appears to be the only one capable of running with Brayton and Luyendyk. And most experts give the Honda V-8 a much better chance to finish the race than Menard's home-built V-6 engines, which gulp fuel too quickly and are easy to over-rev and damage.
Honda's new-found muscle is another factor contributing to the rise of the unknowns at Indy. After last year's qualifying debacle, in which Rahal had to abandon the Honda as too puny, almost no team wanted to touch the engine this season.
Steve Horne, however, was restarting an Indy team after the one that he and Rahal won the 1986 race with broke up. Horne saw the Honda as an opportunity.
"The key thing in any form of racing is making the right decisions long before you go to the race track," said Horne, who owns the cars driven by Goodyear and Andre Ribeiro, a Brazilian rookie on the outside of the fourth row. "This year we made some very smart decisions and they all fell our way. They could have fallen other people's way, but they didn't see the potential."
Among those who didn't see it is Rahal, who is starting behind both Honda-powered cars after switching to a different engine this year.
Horne is also confident in his choice of Scott Goodyear to drive this race.
"He knows how to win 500-mile races," Horne said, referring to Goodyear's two victories in the 500-mile race in Brooklyn, Mich. "And he's had a great deal of success at Indy. There's no question he has a burning desire to do well and get back with a full-time ride."
When Penske's two drivers, Al Unser Jr. and Emerson Fittipaldi, failed to make the race, it meant that the winners of four of the last six Indy races would be missing from the lineup. And, for the first time since 1962, the Unser family, which has nine Indianapolis 500 victories to its credit, will not be represented here.
That, along with Mario Andretti's retirement and Nigel Mansell's short-lived return to Formula One, has left a very unfamiliar-looking starting lineup this year.
If a new star comes out of this most-unsettled Indianapolis 500, he is more likely than not to be a non-American. Only 15 of the 33 drivers are American citizens; there are six rookies (all foreigners), and of the seven drivers making only their second Indy 500 start, only two -- Bryan Herta and Scott Sharp -- are Americans.
And if Penske -- or any other member of the Indy establishment -- thinks 1996 will be any easier, he should consider this: Dan Gurney, who built the cars that won the Indianapolis 500 in 1968, 1973 and 1975, will be back next year with his own cars, powered by yet another new corporate player at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Toyota.
The traffic will keep getting tougher on the roadway built to handle only 33 cars.
 
PIT STOPS
 Although the race Sunday is expected to be a wide-open affair, the weather may spoil the show. The forecast for Sunday called for mostly cloudy conditions with a 50 percent chance of rain, with temperatures in the 80's. The forecast for Monday, the rain date, is not much better, with scattered showers predicted.

HEADLINE: The How of the Dow (and the When and the What)

BYLINE: By DYLAN LOEB MCCLAIN 

 BODY:
In the abstract, the Dow Jones industrial average doesn't seem like a promising barometer of the stock market. It contains just 30 stocks out of the on the New York Stock Exchange, and this small sample is biased, too: The 30 Dow stocks are uniformly large, established enterprises, the bluest of the blue chips, accounting for 25 percent of the exchange's value despite their small numbers.
Nevertheless, the Dow has succeeded where it counts -- in real life. The nation's oldest continuously published stock index, the Dow has become synonymous with movements in the markets. When the radio says stocks fell 10 points, it means the Dow. 
 Ironically, part of the Dow's prestige comes from its very focus on a small, elite group of companies. Part is historical happenstance. And part is performance. Although the Dow has plenty of critics, it has proved to be a fairly accurate barometer of market direction.
How much do you know about this Wall Street fixture? Take this quiz and find out. DYLAN LOEB MCCLAIN
 
Who is this man?
 
None other than Charles H. Dow, one-half of the team that gave their names to the industrial average. The other is Edward D. Jones, and together they founded Dow Jones, the publishing company that runs the index.
 
What's odd about the Dow?
 
It is a "price weighted" index. The higher a share's price, the more it counts in the calculation. Many other indexes, such as the S.& P. 500, are "capital weighted," in which both share price and share number are taken into account. In the latter kind of index, changes in the price of a $10 stock with 6 million shares will count double that of changes in a $10 stock with just 3 million shares.
 
The Dow is at least 100 years old. True or false?
False -- by a hair. Ignoring a predecessor index composed mostly of railroads, the Dow debuted in 1896. It contained 12 companies, most of which sold commodities. The Dow was expanded to 20 stocks in 1916 and, in 1928, it reached its current complement of 30. But while these numbers are constant, the companies are not. They can be added or removed.
 
Who is the Dow's gatekeeper?
Journalists! The editors of the Wall Street Journal determine which stocks to let in or kick out. The factors include a company's size and its economic importance, but there are no ironclad criteria.
 
Which is the largest company not included in the Dow?
None other than the fifth largest company in the United States -- Wal-Mart, which has a market value of nearly $59 billion. Here are the next largest companies that haven't made the cut:
 
Are there any mutual funds that invest only in the 30 Dow stocks?
 
Just one. The tiny ASM Fund, a no-load with just $5.7 million in assets, is 4 years old and has a $1000 minimum for initial purchases (800-445-2763). Index funds themselves are fairly common -- Morningstar counts 111 equity funds that invest in the S.& P. 500, the Russell 2000 and other indexes -- but the Dow's small size probably limits its attractiveness as an index investment.
 
Riddle: How is the Dow like a mirror?
It reflects changes in the United States. Scan the Dow rosters below, and follow the country's move from a commodity, to an industrial, to a more diversified economy.
 
The Dow falls 90 points. Should an investor panic?
 
Trick question. The missing element is when. The Dow fell almost that much in the week ended May 19, but with its level at more than 4,400 these days, that drop represented just a 2 percent decline. But when the market lost just 70 points in the crash of October 1929, panic sensibly ensued. The reason: the Dow's pre-crash level was just -- so a 70-point fall meant the Dow lost more than 20 percent.
 
Are there better indexes than the Dow?
 
It depends on the user's needs. Given the Dow's sole focus on large companies, some investors may be more interested in the Russell 2000, an index of 2,000 smaller stocks, or the S.& P. 500, a mix of 500 companies of diverse size.
The Dow has fewer stocks than any of the world's major stock indexes. True or false?
 
False. Germany's DAX index also has just 30 stocks. But many other indexes have more. Japan's Nikkei has 225 stocks, for instance, and Britain's FTSE-100 has 100.
 
Why is the Dow's daily high not a high?
The Dow's daily high is calculated by using the highest price of each of its component stocks during the day. But stocks do not reach their daily highs at the same time. So the Dow never actually reaches its published high.
 
Does anyone earn money from the Dow?
 
You bet. Dow Jones charges some media organization, investment professionals and others a fee to use the Dow. The fees vary according to whether the index is supplied in real time, delayed time or at the end of the day.
 
What are the most recent additions and deletions to the index?
 
In 1991, the Dow's high priests removed USX, Avistar and Primerica from the index, and replaced them with Disney, Caterpillar and J.P. Morgan.
 
What's the significance of 0.36143882?
 
It's the number that enables you to calculate the Dow yourself. Just add up the closing prices of the 30 Dow stocks - listed above - and divide them by 0.36143882. Easy! (How the mathematicians arrived at 0.36143882 is not easy. At first, the price totals were simply divided by the number of stocks in the index. But, through the years, as companies were added and removed and stocks split, the need to maintain the index's integrity led to its keepers to adjust the divisor.)

GRAPHIC: Chart lists companies currently in the index, sometimes under different names
 
Graph shows monthly closing prices of the Dow Jones Industrial average from 1915 to 1995 (Sources: Datastream, Birinyl Associates, Fortune Magazine) $14.375 on Friday, the lowest share price in the Dow, and I.B.M. closed at $97.25, the highest price. The indifferent state is Vermont, where the government is not allowed to buy any stocks that cost more than $11.50 a share.

When Home Is a Housing Project: Two Former Residents Remember

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Going Home" captured the mixed feelings of shame, pride and hope that I experienced growing up in Brooklyn's Red Hook projects. 
 But I did find it troubling that the writer, Tony Marcano, linked the demise of the James Monroe project to an influx of welfare recipients. They brought in a "defeatist attitude," he said, and were not understood by the original tenants.
As I remember, the lines between the working poor and dependent poor were never so clearly defined. Working-class residents understood all too well that any misfortune, like a fire or a medical emergency, could force them to apply for welfare.
In fact, my father received welfare for nearly two years during the 1970's recession, after his employer left the city.
The difference between my family and those families that lived from generation to generation on welfare was this: My Dad, the son of two generations of Southern Baptist preachers and laborers, knew welfare was something to sustain the family until he found a new job. He knew there was a light at the end of the tunnel, while the welfare families had learned to live in the tunnel.
My family didn't move from Red Hook until 1989 -- a year after I graduated from college -- so I witnessed the beginning of the crack wars. Shootings and muggings became commonplace and led to the general sense that the community was being held hostage. At least two generations of working poor and welfare families co-existed, sharing the values of survival, before crack invaded the projects.

HEADLINE: Don't Let Sharp Operators Near Social Security;
Scrap the System

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I applaud Senators Bob Kerrey and Alan K. Simpson for trying to focus attention on the Social Security problem (Op-Ed, May 23). Unfortunately, their solutions don't go far enough, and they aren't being completely honest about the problem in the first place. 
 Social Security is an income transfer program, not a consumption program or a savings program. Each generation transfers a portion of its income to the previous generation. Benefits are determined by what each generation decides it will provide. Payroll taxes are levied on all workers to pay for these benefits.
The funds received by Social Security are invested in United States Government debt. United States debt instruments provide an insufficient rate of return to compensate for the demographic changes that worry the Senators. Generational warfare looms behind the demographics. Older Americans wrongly assume that Social Security is both an entitlement and a retirement-pension plan, and younger Americans believe that they will have huge future tax burdens and no benefits. It's a no-win situtation.
Even more troubling, Social Security surpluses, which resulted from the last effort to "save" the program, are being counted against the Federal deficit, thus understating the deficit dramatically.
If Senators Kerrey and Simpson worry about Social Security firestorms, they haven't seen anything like what will happen when constituents realize that the cuts being suggested by Congress are a drop in the bucket. This is the big truth about Social Security and the Federal deficit that no one in Congress seems to want to face.
As the Senators suggest, we should encourage retirement planning and savings. The best way to do so is to establish individual retirement accounts, fully invested in long-term growth stocks, and fund them with the current employee-employer contributions to Social Security.
To create a new system, we must pick a date, say, 2000. Contributions must remain mandatory. The Government should budget a percentage contribution equal to half the unemployment rate (assume investment compounding will make up the difference) to cover those who are unemployed.
The system's funds should be placed in a passively managed index fund. The accounts can be administered by the private sector (mutual fund companies and the like) through a competitive bidding process.
Finally, the Social Security system should be ended altogether in 30 years.
This new system could provide all Americans with a much better level of retirement security than Social Security does, dramatically increase the United States savings rate and eliminate an unnecessary Government bureaucracy.
If the Senators want to make Social Security a "savings" program, perhaps they could begin saving the time wasted on reforming an income transfer program and devote that time to a frank and honest debate about how to reduce the Federal deficit and our national debt. This would truly be a savings for all.

HEADLINE: Brother's Tax Problem Puts Home in Jeopardy

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
AT first glance, Maria Merlino's fight to keep her Philadelphia house seems like just another case of faulty tax and trust planning.
In a finding filed this month, Judge Edna G. Parker of Federal Tax Court recounts how the home was bought and transferred among Merlino family members, and what the flaw was in the transactions. But in truth, if Maria Merlino's brother, Joseph, had just paid taxes on his proceeds from an armored car robbery, she wouldn't be battling the Internal Revenue Service now. 
 And unmentioned anywhere by the Judge is that Joseph Merlino is the son of Salvatore (Chuckie) Merlino, the former underboss of the Scarfo crime family who is now in the witness protection program, according to the Philadelphia police. The younger Merlino is described by Federal prosecutors as engaged in an especially bloody war for control of rackets in Philadelphia and Atlantic City, a war they said included a wild rush-hour shooting on a freeway two years ago. The intended target, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, was John Stanfa, who is about to stand trial for murder and racketeering and was identified in an indictment last year as successor to Nicodemo (Little Nicky) Scarfo in the Philadelphia mob.
For all the people who think their family financial matters are messy, try following the Merlinos' tale. In 1986, Ms. Merlino and her brother agreed to buy a family home for themselves and their mother, Rita. Ms. Merlino did not qualify for a mortgage because she was unemployed and had a poor credit history, according to the judge's finding. The family paid $100,000 in cash, and arranged a $25,000 mortgage to cover the balance of the $125,000 purchase price.
The home was purchased in the name of Joseph Merlino. On the advice of a lawyer, Fred Levin, title was transferred to the mother and then to a trust with Joseph as trustee for Maria and another sister. In December 1988, Joseph Merlino gave his one-third share of the trust to his sister, Maria. The fair market value of the house was $130,000, and the title was conveyed for $1.
Here's the rub. Mr. Merlino and two associates stole $352,150 in an armored car robbery in 1987. In 1990, he was convicted, which made him liable for income tax on his share of the loot. Over the years, the amount of tax he owes has swelled because of penalties and interest to $139,964.
Judge Parker found that the title to the house was transferred fraudulently to keep the house beyond the reach of Federal authorities. Because Joseph Merlino never filed a tax return for 1987, his tax liability arose on April 15, 1988 -- before the house was transferred to his sister. And because she did not pay her brother for the house, Judge Parker concluded that the transfer was fraudulent.
In a partial victory for Ms. Merlino, however, the judge held that she was not liable for the full $139,964. Her liability is $43,000, equivalent to the value of Mr. Merlino's one-third stake in the house at the time of the transfer, plus interest.
Mark E. Cedrone, Ms. Merlino's lawyer, said he was pleased that the judge limited his client's liability but would still seek a reversal. "Her brother didn't even know he was a suspect in the armored car robbery when he transferred his interest in the house," Mr. Cedrone said, arguing that the transfer could not have been fraudulent. "And my client is no Mafia princess. She's goes to work every morning as a legal secretary at one of the most prominent law firms in Philadelphia. The finding is really unfair."

CORRECTION-DATE: June 4, 1995, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about the Internal Revenue Service's efforts to hold a Philadelphia woman liable for her brother's unpaid Federal income tax on the proceeds from a robbery misstated the whereabouts of their father, Salvatore Merlino, whom the authorities have identified as a member of organized crime. He is not in a witness protection program; he is in a state prison in Pennsylvania.

HEADLINE: Business Group Backs 3d Harlem Line Track

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER 

 BODY:
A PROPOSAL by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to construct 3.6 miles of new track between the Mount Vernon West train station and the Crestwood station has been endorsed by the board of directors of the Westchester Business Partnership.
The Westchester Business Partnership is a nonprofit joint venture of the public and private sectors with a goal of fostering a positive business climate and enhancing the county's economy. 
 "A fine mass-transit system is crucial to Westchester's economic stability and growth," said George J. Delaney, president of the Westchester Business Partnership and a vice president for Con Edison in Westchester. "A third track on a section of the Metro-North Harlem line would make train service more efficient. Without this third track, Metro-North cannot meet its projected increase in peak-hour ridership."
The plan to build a third track on the Harlem Line is the main element in a $41 million, four-year project proposed by Metro-North, the M.T.A. division that runs Westchester's commuter trains. The authority already owns the right of way for the tracks.
The 76.6-mile Harlem line extends from Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan through the Bronx and Westchester and Putnam Counties and ends in Dover Plains in Dutchess County. The line is the only Metro-North line that narrows to two tracks and eventually one track from four tracks.
According to Metro-North, the section between Mount Vernon West and Crestwood is the most densely traveled section on the system. The inbound track, for example, carries 21,070 riders on 35 trains at peak hours in the morning.
The third-track project will allow Metro-North to add trains and change its mix of local and express trains, both for commuters to Manhattan and reverse commuters to Westchester. PENNY SINGER

HEADLINE: New Jersey: Exploring the Shore

BYLINE: By BILL KENT 

 BODY:
The reviving economy, a weak dollar abroad, and millions of dollars spent on storm-ravaged coastline, beach replenishment and other improvements promise a banner year for the Jersey shore, where, despite crowds, congestion, tedious tolls and beach fees, happiness is still a bit of sand, a splash of surf, a place to park and a meal in any place that's air conditioned. 
 The traditional strengths of some better known shore towns, have been rated on a scale of 1 to 3. If your favorite place isn't listed, or if you don't agree with the rating, don't fret. Think of all the people who won't be going.
 
Long Branch
 Family Friendly 2
Thanks to benign neglect and an impressive effort by locals, the former capital of Victorian sin and degradation is shaping up into a relatively inexpensive, kid-friendly resort. The Ramada Inn and McIntosh, in West Long Branch, offer motel type accommodations--the beach is a short drive away. A night in the ocean front Hilton costs about as much as an Atlantic City casino hotel, but it's quieter. Storytelling hours in library. Great family style "meedballs and spaghet" at Tuzzio's, Westwood and Morris Ave. or Tony's, right across the street.
Beach and Boardwalk 2
As they say in the Branch, it ain't much, but it ain't bad. A good deal of the shore north of the Branch has been wiped out in storms, and the boardwalk amusements were wiped out in a fire. In place of the honky tonk is a flat, fireproof "promenade." The somewhat wider West End Beach is close to typical boardwalk junk food snackeries. Tag fees: seasonal $25 adults, $20 ages 12-17; daily $3 for adults, $2 12-17. 908-571-6545.
Sports 2
Breezy in-line skating on the promenade. Easy proximity to boating and fishing centers around Monmouth Beach and further south. Miniature golf near the Hilton. Rollerblading on promenade. Edgy bicycling on narrow Route 36 north. Turn west at Sea Bright for spectacular low-gear-only rock scarp scenery around Shrewsberry, and Rumson's "mansions of glory," one of which is owned by Bruce Springsteen.
The Essentials
One of the oldest resort towns, Long Branch blossomed in the Belle Epoque, when its racetrack and gambling casino were a brief ferry and train ride away from New York. After a long, graceless slide, the Branch, home to a large population of Italian retirees, is on the comeback trail, thanks to visible beachblock rennovations and a new generation of conservative family visitors that want everything to be just like Momma and Poppa did it. A twenty minute drive to Doris & Ed's in Highlands, or the Fromagerie in Rumson, two of the shore's best restaurants. Long Branch Chamber of Commerce: 908-222-0400.
 
Beach Haven
 Beach 2
Narrow, sloping, virtually identical to Island Beach, but dominated by large motels built right up to the crest of the dunes. Crowded but user friendly, with a barefoot bar conveniently located on the pool deck of the Engleside Inn. Beach tags: seasonal $9 to June 15, $15 thereafter; $5 weekly, $2 daily. Beach is free for senior citizens and children under 12. 609-492-0111.
Sports 3
Bicycling on astonishly crowded Long Beach Boulevard. The Barnegat Bay is the best single place on the shore for day sailing. Also, jet-skis rentals, as well as party boat, fishing and scuba charters, and an adults-only round-trip casino cruise to Atlantic City on the Black Whale. Yup--you get coins when you arrive.
Family Friendly 3
Thoroughly walkable. Summer stock and children's theater at Surflight Dinner Theater, pizza everywhere, souvenir and toy shops, VCR rentals, food markets, the Haven's small historical museum, and, most significant for families on a rainy day: a movie theater and fully stocked library with story hours. A good, but frustrating field trip is a drive north, to the Barnegat Light State Park, where the lighthouse is the most scenic on the shore.
Honky Tonk 2
Stroll to Fantasy Island, a boardwalk-style amusement area that isn't on an island. Too many dance clubs and meet-market bars for just-turned-21'ers, both in the Haven and a short drive up the Boulevard.
The Essentials
What was once a strong, blue-collar seasonal town covers just about every base imaginable. A dozen bed-and-breakfasts, such as Pierrot by the Sea and the Bayberry Barque (both on Centre Street) are less elaborate, and less expensive than Cape May's and Spring Lakes'. The motelish Engleside Inn, on Engleside Avenue is family-friendly. Expect congestion and and busy-ness. Long Beach Island Chamber of Commerce: 609-494-7211.
Events in the Bicentenial Park after June 17. House Tour, Aug. 9.
 
 Spring Lake
Quaint/Cozy 2
Short Hills meets Cape May: some of the best Victorian architecture on the shore (that fabulous stone pile on the boardwalk is the closed Essex-and-Sussex Hotel) clash with garishly modern suburban mansions on perfectly manicured lawns. Just enough bed-and-breakfasts and gingerbread hotels, not enough interesting restaurants within walking distance, but no one seems to care. Among the more expensive resort towns on the shore, it tends to give you your money's worth.
Beach and Boardwalk 2
Minimal in every sense of the word. Absolutely no honky-tonk or commercial development between two pleasant Victorian-style pavillions. The use of a plastic-wood blend to replace portions of the storm-damaged boardwalk is dubious at best. Magnificent, century-old beachfront hotels are more fun to look at than the beach. Tag fees: seasonal $55; $4.50 daily, children under 12 free. 908-449-8005.
Family Friendly 2
The rambling Chateau, across from Spring Lake city's park, is kid-friendly, very close to the train station, and across the street from the city park, which has an excellent kiddie playground, bring-your-own-canoe on the lake itself. Feed the kids at the Spring Lake Pizzaria, or Who's On Third, both on Third avenue. Eggimann's, in Spring Lake Heights, is a former stagecoach stop, for dinner time.
Sports
Walking, if only to admire the architecture. Also, bicycling and tennis in the park.
The Essentials
As narcissistic as Cape May, but not as crowded or commercial, Spring Lake feels like a dignified, affluent commuter suburb that happens to have an ocean nearby. Quiet, defiantly dull, with a pleasant Third Avenue main street shopping area and easy access to the New Jersey Transit commuter line into New York, the town can become cloying if you don't have a car. The top bed-and-breakfasts are the Normandy Inn and Sea Crest, both on Tuttle Avenue. Whispers, an eclectic restaurant in the small but tres luxe Hewitt-Wellington Hotel, is the burg's best eaterie. You're a short drive from the Old Mill Inn, in Spring Lake Heights, a dress-up surf-and-turfer. The Spring Lake Trolley links the major streets to the park and beach areas, weekends in June, daily in July and August, for $1 per person, per ride. Spring Lake Chamber of Commerce. 908-449-0577.
Events
Summer stock musical by Spring Lake Theater company, at Community House. House Tour, June 8.
 
 Seaside Heights
Honky-tonk 2
The best beachside rides north of Wildwood, and a towering water theme park at Grant Ave. and Ocean Terrace, bring an endless rush of teens and just-turned-21's. Rites of passage galore in loud dance clubs.
Beach and Boardwalk 2
Comfortably wide beach, great for body-watching, though the odor of coconut tanning oil overwhelms the salt brine. Wonderfully greasy boardwalk junkfood augmented by the transformation of boardwalk-fronting JR's into an upscale steakhouse. Fast pedaling bicycle cops keep order over, and under the boardwalk. Beach tags: seasonal, $35; daily $2 weekday, $3 weekend day. Children under 12 free. Limited number of beach wheelchairs for handicapped visitors available free with beach admission. Advance reservations for chairs required. 908-793- 9100.
Sports 2
Recently refurbished bayside tennis and basketball courts round out surfing, swimming, kayaking bicycling, jet-skii rentals and party boat and scuba charter. Close to boating and fishing in the Barnegat Bay.
The Essentials
Ocean County's premier teen party town is slowly going adult contemporary, but don't hold your breath. The dense pack of kids, and the rides and clubs that cater to them, so dominate the beach front that Seaside Heights visitors tend to ignore its quieter residential bayside, on the eastern edge of busy Route 35. The town is pushing to have motel owners upgrade their rooms, especially those around the ten block "French quarter" redevelopment area on the Boulevard, where a Cajun restaurant, Temptations, recently opened. If the town becomes too much, you can always flee to Island Beach State Park. Seaside Heights Public Relations: 908-793-9100.
Events
Seaside Heights holds a bayfront seafood festival and sports competition. June 17, 18. Clownfest--convention for professional clowns, Sept. 23,24.
 
 Point Pleasant Beach
Honky-Tonk 1
The only town on the shore with the guts to call itself The Beach is a satisfying, if overbuilt, balance of honky-tonk, junkfood emporia, obligatory seafood restaurants, kiddie arcades, and an aquarium. On Tuesdays, $10 buys unlimited rides.
Beach and Boardwalk 2
After bodywatching, the most common beachside recreation is viewing the big cabin cruisers and sportfishers chugging out from the blue-blazer-and-white-pants marinas around Brielle (prounced Breel by the natives). Healthy pig-out at the Natural Buffet, at Ocean Avenue. Tags--$5 weekend days, $4 weekdays; seasonal $60 adults, $40 children 5 to 11 and senior citizens; half seasonal $40 adults, $30 seniors and children 5 to 11. 908-892-3274.
Sports 3
The annual offshore power boat race has made The Beach the capital of the state's acquatic speed freaks. Barroom conversations are most often about RPMs, propshafts and hull designs. Great surf, charter and party-boat fishing nearby. Numerous fishing tournaments at local marinas. Professional and amateur volleyball competitions on the beach every weekend.
The Essentials
A tolerable antidote to the enforced, WASPy stuffiness of Bayhead directly to the south. The dominant blue collar culture has been edged out over the last few years, as members of the Nautica set (who want to be close to Bay Head but can't afford it), buy up, rennovate and price up what had been Point Pleasant's affordable rental housing. The newest motel, Point Pleasant Manor, on Sea Avenue, isn't beach front, but is affordable. The Ivory Seahorse is one of four new bed & breakfasts to open this year, signalling a challenge to the Cape May/Spring Lake crowd. The Beach's loud, but relatively tame pursuit of summer hedonism is still what the shore has always been about. Greater Point Pleasant Chamber of Commerce. 908-899- 2424.
Events
New Jersey Offshore Power Boat race, July 19. Seafood Festival, Sept. 16. Outdoor concerts every Wednesday night on the beach near Jenkinson's; boardwalk fireworks every Thursday night; Boardwalk laser light show every Sunday night.
 
Atlantic City
Sports 3
Sure, you can find party-boats, surf fishing and boardwalk bicycling, racquet sports (inside Merv Griffin's Resorts) and bowling (inside Showboat) but there's only one activity anyone cares about, and that's casino gambling. The casinos have fully equipped resort spas, with indoor swimming pools, saunas and other luxuries for rainy days.
Beach and Boardwalk 2
This is the world's first Boardwalk (named for Alexander Boardman, it's visionary inventor) but that isn't saying much. Some portions need a facelift. Others, near the casinos, are no fun at all, with the exception of the delightfully cheesy facade of the Taj Mahal. Atlantic City's is also one of the last free beaches on the shore now boasts dunes that are supposed to protect the city from storms. Take a load off your feet in a rolling chairs, another local invention. Mall-type shopping and food court at Ocean One pier, opposite Caesars at Arkansas Avenue. Few visit the beach, though there's surfing around States Avenue. Beyond the grim public bathrooms, there's no place to change and shower off unless you get a room in hotel or motel.
Honky-Tonk 2
The casino's gaudy interiors are adult honky-tonk at its most lavish. This is the only town in New Jersey where the bars stay open 24 hours. New York Avenue is the city's traditional party-club street, though most party-heartiers go to the clubs on the mainland in Somers Point, or to Margate clubs along Washington and Amherst Avenues, a five minute drive south.
Family Friendly 1
You CAN bring the kids here. TropWorld has an indoor theme park. Steel Pier (opposite the Trump Taj Mahal) and Central Pier (between the Sands and Resorts) have outdoor amusements. These pale compared to Wildwood, but at least there's something better than the video arcades. Casinos will, for a charge, provide babysitting. On rainy days, the Atlantic City Historical Museum on Garden Pier offers glimpses of the city's past. The city's public library is the best on the shore.
The Essentials
Legalized gambling has turned what was once the shore's premier convention resort and entertainment capital into a gambling town that also has conventions. Though casinos have reduced the number of headline entertainers and revue shows, this is still the only place at the shore to see everyone from Engelbert to Penn & Teller. Bally's Grand, at Boston and Pacific Avenues, is erecting an outdoor amphitheater for major headlining acts. There and elsewhere, the best seats are reserved for gamblers (buy tickets as far in advance as possible from Ticketmaster). At casino restaurants--gamblers are seated before paying customers. Restaurants at Trump Plaza and Merv Griffin's Resorts have earned consistently high reviews, and the new, all-you-can-guzzle Bacchanal at Caesars, where actors impersonate Caesar and Cleopatra, is a hoot. Gambling has given the city the highest crime rate along the shore, so park in casino garages, be careful of personal belongings and stay away from forbidding areas. Jitneys ($1.50 per person) provide fast transportation along Pacific Avenue, and link the Boardwalk casinos with those in the marina district. Visitors Information: 1-800-BOARDWK.
Events
Seafood Festival June 10-11; Beach Fest, June 16-18, July Fourth (fireworks on Boardwalk and in marina district); Kentucky Avenue Rennaissance, July 8-9; Harborfest, Aug. 5-6; Latin American Festival, Sept. 9, 10; Miss America Scholarship Pageant, Sept. 16.
 
 Wildwood
Honky-tonk 3
The best. Well over 250 outdoor amusement rides and a water theme park on six amusement piers (more than Disney World!). Carnival "barker" games and party-hearty bars like Cheers have given the island a reputation for teenage hellraising and rites of passage.
Beach and Boardwalk 3
The biggest beach on the shore--a rolling stretch of powdery white sand that is fully a half a mile wide. Admission is still free. The boardwalk is a odd, meandering combination of wood and concrete that supports trams. The new Great Nor'easter Roller Coaster, on Morey's Pier, aims to be the town's top lunch-looser: you ride it suspended over the ground. Bicycling and jogging is possible only in the early morning. Incredible crowds on weekends last well into the night. Nightly concerts at boardwalk bandshell at Montgomery Avenue.
Sports 2
Surfing, fishing (on piers, inlets and party boats. Thermals off the beach are great for kiteflying. Tennis in Wildwood Crest at Wisteria and Atlantic Aves. Baseball, basketball and tennis at fox park athletic field, Montgomery and Atlantic. Volley ball on the beach at Lincoln Avenue. Serious miniature golf at Shipwreck Island, 5000 Park Blvd.
The Essentials
Wildwood gets a bum rap for its teenage, rites-of-passage crowd and, in the frenetic areas around the party bars, the reputation is deserved. Elsewhere on the island, North Wildwood is lower keyed, family oriented, and Wildwood Crest, to the south, has row after row of moderately priced resort motels, also catering to a family crowd. A large Italian population blessed the island with superb mom-and-pop spaghetti joints, like the Ravioli House, on Bennett Avenue. Each year another old guesthouse becomes a bed and breakfast. Grown-ups can pretend they're kids, only to become adults again, at the Candlelight Inn in North Wildwood. Concerts and artsy activities throughout the season at the Hereford Inlet Lighthouse in North Wildwood. Wildwood Information Center: 609-522-1407.
Events
72nd Annual National Marbles Tournament June 19-22, Ultimate Frisbee Tournament and First-Ever National Pro Roller Hockey Tournament July 22-23. Aug. 31, Boardwalk Baby Parade.
 
Cape May
Quaint/Cozy 3
An occasionally unsettling, but generally pleasing mix of restored, gaily painted bed & breakfast inns and monotonous motels that have donned "Victorian" trim. Some among a dozen bistro-style restaurants are the best in the state. Expect odd fogs and other peculiar weather at the southernmost city on the shore.
Beach and Boardwalk 1
A flat, narrow, somewhat dull stretch of sand around the lower portion of Beach Drive, crowned by a barren, stone "Promenade" in the process of being repaved. Wonderful pounding surf, but no swimming permitted, just a few blocks north along the Drive, or south in Cape May Point State Park. Tolerable honkytonk near Convention Hall, made pleasing by the addition of an old-fashioned solarium, with retail shops and a new eclectic-style restaurant, Tish's Fine Dining. Beach tags: $15 seasonal, weekly $9, daily $4. Children 11 and under free 609-884-9525.
Outdoors 3
Fanatical birdwatching in Cape May Point State Park; good nature walks, too. 609-884-2159. Horseback riding a brief car trip (or bicycle ride, Hidden Valley Ranch in West Cape May, 609- 884-8205.
Sports 3
Fabulous angling--sign on the small partyboats departing from Fisherman's Wharf, or get a charter out of the nearby marinas. Great bicycling down incomparably quaint streets and country roads in West Cape May. New this year: jet skis around Fisherman's Wharf.
The Essentials
Only in Cape May is narcissim a major passtime: Mid-Atlantic Center for the Arts guided tours of the shady streest and their restored inns and mansions, either on foot or by trolley, are among the primary diversions. Some inns have apartment type dwellings for families; best to stay in a motel. Make sure, wherever you stay, that parking is included. Breezy, restaurants such as 410 Bank Street, Frescoes and the Water's Edge, are worth the long waits for tables. Nightly theater at the Cape May Stage (above the Welcome Center on Lafayette Street), and dinner theater at Elaine's, just down the road. Jazz nights at Shire Tavern, on Washington Mall. Cape May Chamber of Commerce: 609-884-5508. Mid-Atlantic Center for the Arts: 609-884-5404.
Events
Music Festival now through June 25. International Clam Shell Pitching Tournament Aug. 25
 
 Ocean City
Family Friendly 3
Plentiful scheduled and on-going activities for kids, both on the boardwalk and elsewhere. You're never far from a playground, though the "Miracle on 34th Street" Sand Castle Park, at 34th and West Avenue, is worth a trip. The city's library, arts center (where kids can take summer courses) and historical museum are in one building at 17th and Simpson Street. Sailing lessons for kids are available at bayside boat rentals. The boardwalk itself has a collection of tame, but enjoyable outdoor amusements, and that all-important water theme park, at 9th Street, and daily, free 5 p.m. children's concerts in the boardwalk Music Pier might just wean the kids off the television set.
Beach and Boardwalk 2
Surprisingly narrow as you head south, and attempts at widening it have failed. When magazines need a picture to dramatize a crowded beach, they take one here. You'll can depend on a place in the sun around the volleyball courts at 6th Street, and in the lumpy dunes at the south end. Go-cart tracks have sprouted on the boardwalk, at 9th street and at Plymouth Street. Every Thursday in July and August is family night on the boardwalk, with parades, performances and other activities planned. Tags--seasonal $12 until June 1, $15 thereafter, $6 weekly, $3 daily. Children 12 and under free. 609-399-6111
Sports 3
Tennis, surfing, golf (both miniature and full size, at the municipal course), shuffleboard, fishing by charter, pier or party boat, bayside boardsailing and day sailing, bicycling on and off the boardwalk.
The Essentials
Nobody does families better than at this former Methodist retreat, which, despite its preposterously overbuilt neighborhoods, is only becoming more popular among its mix of Irish, Italian and Jewish seasonal renters. For them, and a growing number of year 'round residents employed in Atlantic City's casinos, Ocean City's ban on the sale and public consumption of alcoholic beverages promises peace and safety. Rentals, starting at $1,000 a week, are the way to go--the grand Flanders Hotel, once the island's most luxurious accommodation, closed. Many motels have gone condo. Ten bed-and- breakfasts add variety to the mix, with the Northwood, at 401 Wesleyan, and the Scarborough, at 720 Ocean Avenue, among the newer properties. Breakfast on pancakes at the Chatterbox, fill up on the vaguely Italian surf-and-turf entrees at Cousin's or the Culinary Garden. Jitneys and trolleys ply the major streets. If the wholesomeness becomes too intense, you're only fifteen minutes from Atlantic City. Ocean City Public Relations: 609-525-9300.
Events
Night in Venice Boat Parade (bayside inlets), July 22, Hermit Crab Day and Miss Crustacean Pageant, Aug 2, Baby Parade, Aug. 10.
 
 Ocean Grove
Quaint/Cozy 2
Who could have thought that this crowded, stuffy little reserve of middle American wholesomeness could become chic and trendy? The small, old-time shore town mood still prevades as, each year more wood frame Victorians along Main Street sprout gingerbread flourishes and bright, multi-colored trim, as what was once a sleepy, neglected warren of bargain basement housing and monotonous eateries blossoms into a plainer, quieter version of Cape May.
Beach and Boardwalk 1
In order that the faithful may attend services, ocean swimming is forbidden on Sunday mornings until 12:30 p.m. The beach is a thin, unremarkable stretch of sand, ruled by a boardwalk that is a narrower extension of Asbury Park's great wooden way. What gives it a special appeal is the lack of motels, bloated summer homes and other seashore tack-ola. If life gets dull, you're a short walk from struggling nightclubs and the somber ruins of Asbury Park. Tags: daily $4.50, weekend special $8, weekly $22.50, seasonal adult $55, senior citizen $49.50, youth (ages 12-17) $30. Children 11 and under, free. 908-531- WAVE.
Family Friendly 3
The mix of Irish retirees and true believers and the Grove's fussy grid of claustrophobic streets, promise the shore's safest, and quietest get-away, except for Sunday morning, when the equivalent of a religious air raid siren calls the faithful to services in the Great Auditorium. Methodist oriented youth activities daily. Morning aerobics, planned to begin in July in Auditorium Park, should be sufficiently non-sectarian. No coin operated arcades, no junky souvenir stands, no junkfood. ground, there isn't much for kids to spend their allowance on. If you
Sports
Boardwalk bicycling is forbidden at all times, though a bicycling rental concession may open later in the season for city pedaling. An ocean kayak rental may also come along eventually, but never on Sunday mornings.
The Essentials
The oldest Methodist retreat town on the shore, Ocean Grove is a short taxi ride from the Asbury Park train station. Over the last decade, the Grove has been cautiously welcoming Yup-scale family visitors while struggling to maintain its appeal to the sincerely religious who see this a sacred retreat. For those who don't need alcohol, have little taste for honky tonk, this can be more an advantage than not. The town is tiny and easily walkable. Chose from a handful of clean, plain older hotels, like the moderately priced Quaker Inn, or the newly rennovated Ocean Plaza. Coyly quaint bed-and-breakfasts like The Carol-inn, the Pine Tree and the Mustard Seed or Pine Tree inns aim for the couples crowd. Obdurately ordinary, but well-prepared repasts at the Ocean View on the boardwalk, or on Main Avenue's Sampler Cafeteria, one of the last put-it-on-your-tray places anywhere. Great waffles at the Raspberry Cafe, whose owners are now serving dinner at the dreamy Moonstruck restaurant. The Four Trees, on Ocean Pathway (inside the Manchester Hotel), serves eclectic, bistro-style stuff. Not one, but two coffee houses are open to midnight on Saturday. One of them, the Daily Grind, plans folksy entertainment, a signal, perhaps, that the Grove is growing up. Ocean Grove Chamber of Commerce: 908-774-1391.
Main Events
Attend a Saturday night concerts in the Great Auditorium, a vast wooden assembly hall unlike any you've ever seen. Also, flea market, June 3, Sept. 9. Summer house tour, July 14. Choir festival (1,500 voices) July 9, Lobster bake, Aug. 20.
 
 Island Beach State Park
Outdoors 3
As good as it gets: a state park whose relatively pristine condition, bramble-choked dunes, ample parking, convenient changing facilities and uninterrupted views will make you proud to be a taxpayer.
Beach 3
Dramatic waves roll into narrow, steep stretches of sand, sculpted by tides and storms into densely planted grottos and hollows where you can find the rarest of beach pleasures: the illusion of privacy. And you can have a picnic anywhere on the beach, though include insect repellent, especially if a greenhead fly warning is posted at the gate. Sadly, what appear to be seasonal tides of illegally dumped flotsam have marred the Island Beach's incomparable natural splendor. Park rangers and volunteers do what they can to pick up what the tides won't wash away. You'll want to do the same.
Family Friendly 3
Daily guided nature walks and educational displays at nature center. Bring your kids here so they know what the shore used to look like.
Sports 3
Anything you can do in the water is better here. Surf fishing is permitted away from bathing beaches. No horseback riding in summer. No boat ramps, but a small access area will allow a kayak or canoe on the bayside.
The Essentials
Island Beach's main gate is supposed to be open from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. for bicyclers and foot traffic, but it closes to automobiles when the parking areas fill up. Current capacity is about 2300 cars. If you're driving, arrive before 10 a.m. on weekends; 11 on weekdays. Admission is $6 per car weekdays, $7 weekends and holidays; free all day Tuesday. Immaculate changing facilities, with showers and lockers. Snack bars sell burgers, cold drinks and other seashore grease. Consumption of alcoholic beverages prohibited at all times. No overnight camping. 908-793- 0506

HEADLINE: Other Countries Thrive On Unbalanced Budgets

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The drive to balance the budget seems driven not by economics but by a radical social philosophy. Budgets are not balanced in any countries comparable to ours. As a percentage of gross domestic product, the 1994 imbalance in the United States was 2.7 percent. 
 The comparable percentages in other countries are: Japan, 2; Britain, 4.6; Germany, 2.7; France, 5.8; Italy, 9.4.; Netherlands, 3.1; Canada, 6.2, and Switzerland, 3.7 (data from Union Bank of Switzerland).
Except for Japan, none of these countries have been in balance in five years. All these countries provide more than we do in social services to their citizens, and in all of them there is less disparity between the rich and the poor.
Budget imbalance is not the major problem facing any of these countries, nor should it be for the United States, although it is important that savings be found wherever possible without damage to our society.

HEADLINE: Rummage Sale of Land: One Way G.O.P. Will Try to Balance the Budget?

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 26

 BODY:
The Republican budget proposals moving through Congress include a subtle change in accounting rules that for the first time in a decade would invite Congressional committees to pay for their spending by selling land and other publicly owned assets.
Nobody is seriously considering selling any major parks. But because of the change, committees seeking ways to balance parts of the budget that come under their jurisdiction may well be tempted to go for a kind of Federal rummage sale. 
 "Asset sales are short-term and short-sighted," said Senator Bill Bradley, a New Jersey Democrat. "I doubt that any business accountant or economist would agree with the underlying budgetary premise that liquidating public assets adds to public wealth. If I sell my stock portfolio and put the returns in my checking account, do I become wealthier?"
The change in accounting rules to allow asset sales to raise cash will take effect only after House and Senate versions of the budget are reconciled and the bill is signed by President Clinton.
The Clinton Administration does not oppose counting asset sales as budget savings, although it differs with Congressional Republicans on many of the assets to be sold.
While nothing has prohibited the Government from selling its property to the private sector, Federal budget law has minimized the financial incentive for Congress by prohibiting the counting of these payments as a contribution toward a balanced budget.
But now, as Congress directs the committees that write spending bills to meet budgetary targets aimed at eliminating the deficit, the rule change could be especially important for committees that are reluctant to cut spending or raise taxes. For the first time since the 1986 Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget law tried to infuse more discipline into the budget process, the committees will be free to use income from selling assets to offset spending.
For example, the budget outline that passed the Senate on Thursday assumes that from 2000 through 2002 the Government will receive $550 million by selling the Presidio, a spectacular section of waterfront next to the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. Once a military post, the Presidio is now owned by the National Park Service.
"It is one of the most remarkable pieces of property left in the United States, and certainly the most remarkable piece of property left in an urban area," said Senator Dale Bumpers, an Arkansas Democrat, who fought the notion of counting revenue from asset sales in arriving at a balanced budget. "Here we have already put it up for sale. Who knows where we go after that?"
Environmental advocacy groups predicted that the pressure year after year to come up with new sources of revenue could lead to extensive sales of public lands.
"Under the guise of deficit reduction, industry allies in the Senate are using budget gimmickry to set up a fire sale of our national parks, forests, refuges and other public lands," said Robbie Cox, the president of the Sierra Club. "Whenever a senator's pet pork-barrel project is threatened they will rush to sell off another piece of our children's heritage."
But Senator Ted Stevens, a Republican of Alaska, called such suggestions "stupid."
"Have we suggested selling Mount Rushmore?" he said during the debate. "My God, I really cannot believe the depth of this argument, when it comes down to just say anything to scare people throughout the country."
The environmental groups were especially upset about the rule change because the budget resolutions specifically recommend raising cash by leasing the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil exploration and drilling. Protecting the area, a breeding ground for wildlife, has long been a priority of the environmental groups.
Although the budget is only an outline of where the Congress will actually spend and raise money, the votes on how income is accounted for are important because they provide a clear sense of sentiment and because procedural rules will make it hard later this year to stop initiatives like opening the Arctic refuge to oil drilling.
Under budget rules, committees that write spending bills must meet dollar targets included in the budget resolution, but they are not bound to raise or spend money on specific projects.
The change in accounting rules could lead committees to offer for sale assets under their jurisdiction to pay for spending programs that they are unwilling to cut or that they want to expand.
Already, a House committee has approved legislation to create a commission for recommending which parks ought to be sold or transferred to the states. The commission would operate in the same way as one that has identified military bases for closing, subject to Congressional approval. The bill would exempt 54 major parks.
And a House task force studying the deficit has endorsed a proposal by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research organization, to help balance the budget by selling Federal land that is now used for grazing, wildlife refuges and parks or preserved as wilderness.

 BODY:

U.S. Is Isolated, Both East and West
 The Clinton Administration is finding itself isolated and outmaneuvered around the world on its threatened auto-trade sanctions against Japan, with Asian governments joining their counterparts in Europe in condemning Washington's move to impose $6 billion in punitive tariffs against Japanese luxury cars. 
 Japanese trade officials have been warning their Asian neighbors that their economies will be the next targets if Tokyo is forced to set aside a part of its market for American goods. The message is sinking in: Asian leaders have told the Clinton Administration that they share its frustration in opening Japan's markets, but cannot abide its tactics. [Page 1.]
 The United States will announce a major effort to strengthen ties with Europe, a move that would start with more cooperation on helping poor nations and removing trade barriers, and could ultimately lead to a free-trade area spanning North America and Europe. [3.]
 
In Asia, the Internet Could Cut Two Ways
 The cyberspace revolution's impact will be felt most intensely in authoritarian nations of Asia, the continent that is home to the world's fastest-growing economies. The Internet holds the promise of bolstering regional economies by connecting them to the information highway, but also means the countries will be flooded with the sort of information that some of their governments have been trying to restrict. [1.]
 
New Round of Britain vs. Murdoch
 Britain plans to revise its rules for control of newspapers, television and radio. One effect will be to block Rupert Murdoch, a towering figure in British publishing and broadcasting, from expanding in television unless he scales back his newspaper holdings. Mr. Murdoch has made it clear that he will fight the proposals. [41.]
 
A Glut of Computer Screens
 Japan's manufacturers of advanced screens for notebook computers, a bright spot for the country's electronics industry, have become victims of their own success. With far more small screens available than computer makers need, prices for notebook computers are dropping, pulling profit for their manufacturers down with them. [39.]
 Small, underfinanced American companies are struggling to make their mark in the display-panel business, but they are finding the going tough. [39.]
 
International Paper Revises Bid
 International Paper, which has offered to pay $320 million for Holvis Holzstoff, a Swiss fibers and paper concern, said it was willing to top a competing $372 million bid. [38.]
 
New Packages for Network News
 Confident of finding new ways to turn news into cash, executives at the three major broadcast networks say network news has a vibrant future despite slips in the ratings and in revenue. Bill Carter: Television. [41.]
 
More Women on the Net
 A demographic survey of the Internet has confirmed that the global computer network is mostly a men's club, with male users outnumbering women 2 to 1. But the numbers are still surprising; earlier surveys had put the margin closer to 9 to 1. Peter H. Lewis: On the Net. [39.]
 
New Ground for a Ghost
 "Jurassic Park" wowed audiences with its dinosaurs, though, it turns out, only six minutes of the film involved computer animation. So what impressions will moviegoers take away from "Casper the Ghost," which has 43 minutes, more time than any film has devoted to computer animation? [41.]
 
20's Classics Up for Grabs
 Many literary classics of the 1920's are entering the public domain -- bad news for publishers like Scribner, Harcourt Brace and Houghton Mifflin, which have enjoyed the prestige and, often, the substantial profit that has come with owning publishing rights to much of the rich literature of the 1920's. [41.]

HEADLINE: In Search of Nielsens for the Internet

BYLINE: By LAURIE FLYNN 

 BODY:
Like many companies still unsure whether the Internet is a business fad or the face of the future, the Chrysler Corporation recently took a leap of faith into on-line advertising.
The auto maker purchased ads at several locations on the World Wide Web, the Internet's multimedia service. Chrysler has also created a kind of electronic brochure on the Web, including a virtual showroom of hot-concept cars, a look at safety systems and the standard lineup of Dodges and Jeeps. 
 The challenge now is to figure out if anyone cares out there in Modem Land.
Chrysler's predicament is shared by the tens of thousands of businesses that have begun running interactive ads on the Web, including Coors Brewing, MCA Records, a unit of the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company and MCI Communications. Right now, there is no reliable way of knowing how many people are interacting with these ads.
Television has its A. C. Nielsen ratings, which tell advertisers how many sets are tuned in when their ads run. Radio has the Arbitron ratings. And magazines and newspapers have independent auditing agencies that verify circulation.
Such audience measurements are the basis for the ad rates set by broadcasters and publishers. And the same data, in turn, enable marketers to gauge how well their ad dollars are being spent.
For advertisers pumping their money into cyberspace, however, there are no Nielsens -- not yet, at least. That may soon change.
In the last few months, a handful of ambitious software start-up companies have announced techniques for measuring the audience for Internet ads. Earlier this month, A. C. Nielsen, a subsidiary of Dun & Bradstreet, said it planned to enter the game, probably in a venture with one of these software start-up concerns. Arbitron, a unit of the Ceridian Corporation, has also expressed interest.
Some of the start-ups, including Digital Planet and the Internet Profiles Corporation -- I/Pro, for short -- recently started performing their monitoring services for a few Internet advertisers. And while it is too early to predict whether either of these, or any other services, might become the industry standard, advertisers are eager for some sort of standard to emerge. Otherwise they must continue to rely on guesswork and trust.
"Today, you come up with a number that seems reasonable and then keep raising the price as long as people are willing to pay it," said David Carlick, senior vice president of Poppy Tyson Advertising, one of two agencies enlisted by Chrysler to create its on-line campaign.
More advertisers appear ready to start spending at least part of their budgets on interactive ads. Jupiter Communications, a market-research company in New York, said the target audience was the nearly 4.6 million people with the Internet access and software allowing them to visit the World Wide Web, an area of the Internet where text can be mingled with photographs, film clips and sound. The Web allows browsers to move easily between sites by selecting highlighted elements. Jupiter forecasts that the number of Web users will more than double by 1997.
John A. Dimling, president of Nielsen Media Research, predicts that the Web will be generating "hundreds of millions" a year in advertising sales by the end of the decade -- still tiny compared with the $125 billion a year now being spent for all media in the United States, but money worth keeping tabs on.
Chrysler, which so far is restricting its Web site to pictures and text (the address is http://www.chryslercorp.com), is also paying undisclosed amounts for ads in two other electronic sites on the Web. One is Time Warner's Pathfinder site (http://www.pathfinder.com); the other is Wired magazine's HotWired (http:www.hotwired.com).
Internet advertisers are eager for data that would show the most effective sites on the Web.
What is ultimately needed, said J. R. Julow, director of marketing operations at Chrysler, is a system that measures not only the effectiveness of one Internet ad over another, but one that can compare the effectiveness of Internet advertising with that of ads placed on television or in newspapers.
Besides I/Pro, which is based in San Francisco, and Digital Data of Los Angeles, analysts say the companies that may provide the answer include Logical Design Solutions of Murray Hill, N.J., and a joint venture of the Delahaye Group of Portsmouth, N.H., and Internet Media Services of Palo Alto, Calif.
Monitoring overall use of the World Wide Web is easy, since the network servers automatically create a log of network activity. But in most cases, this data is limited to tracking the number of times a single file on a Web site is called up.
The big task for the new Web-monitoring services is analyzing the raw traffic statistics and turning them into useful marketing data, like determining how many times the same people viewed an ad, how long they lingered and what route they took to get there. Advertisers might also want to know what Web site they visited next, to determine where else it might pay to advertise to reach similar types of people.
Initially, these emerging systems will provide only basic data, most often just the name of network servers, the universities, companies or commercial Internet providers who connect an individual computer to the Internet.
Even in cases where more individual information can be ascertained through users' electronic registration forms, Internet publishers say their concern for consumer privacy would prevent them from disclosing the users' identities or other personal information. But as people routinely make purchases over the network, more specific consumer information is likely to be collected -- just as credit-card companies compile huge data bases on the spending habits of those who use their cards.
That might make the I/Pro's and Digital Planets serve more as data-base builders than census takers, Adam Schoenfeld, a vice president at Jupiter Communications, says. "There's better tracking of new media than traditional media already, because everybody leaves fingerprints, showing where they were and where they went next," he said.


GRAPHIC: The Chrysler Corporation has placed ads at World Wide Web sites run by Wired magazine, top, and Time Warner, middle. By clicking on either ad, a computer user is transferred to Chrysler's onw site, bottom, where information about new cars and trucks can be found.

HEADLINE: U.S. to Seek Stronger Trade and Political Ties With Europe

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, MAY 28

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration will announce a major effort this week to strengthen ties with Europe, a move that would start with more cooperation on helping poor nations and removing trade barriers and could ultimately lead to a free trade area encompassing North America and Europe.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher is scheduled to unveil this effort in Madrid on Friday in response to fears, voiced on both sides of the Atlantic, that the once-seamless alliance between European nations and the United States has deteriorated because of the end of the cold war, trade disputes and differences over Bosnia, Iran and Japan. 
 According to aides to Mr. Christopher, he will say that the trans-Atlantic relationship focuses too much on security and must be broadened by setting up new channels for political and economic cooperation. In his Madrid speech, he will endorse the goal -- still 10 to 20 years away -- of establishing a trans-Atlantic free-trade area of 700 million people.
Mr. Christopher will also propose numerous steps to strengthen links in the near future between the United States and the 15-nation European Union, including coordinating the fight against crime and drugs and opening talks on reducing restrictions on bidding for public contracts.
These steps will be the beginning of a long-term effort to breathe new life into the European-American relationship, American officials say. Some officials acknowledge that these efforts are as much public relations as substance, but they say that some highly visible steps are needed to reaffirm that the United States and Europe have a shared heritage and that they can lead the world on crucial issues.
The Administration's new effort comes after American and European leaders have worried aloud that the other side was looking too much to the east. American officials say Western Europe is preoccupied with such issues as admitting Poland, Hungary and other Eastern European countries into NATO and into the European Union and on improving ties with Russia and Turkey.
European leaders -- most recently Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel of Germany in a speech here last week -- said they were concerned that America's attention was drifting toward the fast-growing markets of Asia and Latin America.
"There is definitely a sense in Europe that a vacuum has developed between Europe and the U.S.," Jeffrey E. Garten, Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, said in an interview. "This is partly a result of a European sense that we have spent most of our time and energy on other areas. And with the end of the cold war, the reduction of American forces in Europe and no widespread security threat, there is a fear that the essential glue that held the relationship together seems to be coming apart."
Mr. Christopher will be in the Netherlands Monday through Wednesday for NATO meetings focusing on the crisis in Bosnia. On Friday, he will give his policy address in Madrid and meet with Spanish officials before they assume the European Union's rotating six-month presidency in July.
"His speech will be very reassuring to Europeans as to U.S. intentions," said a senior State Department official.
To strengthen political ties, Mr. Christopher will propose stepped-up cooperation on halting the spread of nuclear weapons, seeking peace in the Middle East, helping political reform in the former Soviet bloc and providing aid to the third world, Eastern Europe and Russia. While trans-Atlantic coordination is often done haphazardly through occasional meetings, Mr. Christopher will call for setting up more formal mechanisms, like regular meetings of top American and European antinarcotics officials.
The way British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd described it in a speech on May 22 in Chicago, increased cooperation is vital so that the United States and Europe can be "pathfinders" that lead world efforts toward peace, stability, free trade and prosperity.
As for economic cooperation, American and European diplomats say that while setting up a trans-Atlantic free trade area is a decade or two off, opening talks to establish such an area can inject new energy into the relationship.
During a visit last Thursday to Washington, Mr. Kinkel, who is a leading advocate of a free-trade area, said, "Now that economic and financial issues have come more to the foreground, next to NATO another pillar ought to be built -- an economic bridge -- although it won't be built overnight."
Mr. Kinkel said that in a meeting on Capitol Hill, this idea was backed enthusiastically by Representative Newt Gingrich, the Speaker of the House, who has said trans-Atlantic ties cannot be sustained by "nostalgia" alone.
American officials acknowledge that Mr. Christopher's talk of a free-trade area may help alleviate European anger about Washington's high-pressure tactics to pry open Japan's automobile market.
Among the topics on the economic agenda are developing joint product standards, harmonizing environmental regulations and eliminating barriers that make it hard for American companies to bid for public procurement contracts in Europe and vice versa. Commerce Secretary Ron Brown and top European Union officials are organizing talks between European and American business executives to discuss these topics and others, especially how to avoid destructive competition, through, for instance, bribes or heavy government subsidies, to win contracts in huge Asian markets like India or China.
"We need a new economic architecture across the Atlantic," said Mr. Garten. "Unless there is some idea that holds us together in the absence of a common, overriding security threat, natural economic juices may force us much further apart than anyone conceives of right now."
Some Administration officials are said to be pushing for a go-slow approach to free trade with Europe because they remember how an important Democratic constituency, labor unions, soured on President Clinton when he pushed for the North American Free Trade Agreement.
But some policy makers predict that labor will hardly object to pursuing a free-trade accord since many European nations, unlike Mexico, have a higher minimum wage and tougher safety and environmental standards than the United States.
European and American officials say movement toward a free trade zone will be hampered by the three politically charged issues that the two sides wrestled over in the so-called Uruguay Round of trade talks: subsidies to farmers, subsidies to aircraft manufacturers, and European quotas on imported movies and television programs.
The idea of a trans-Atlantic free trade area has caused some Asian leaders to warn that the United States is turning its attention away from them because of frustrations with Asian trade restrictions.

HEADLINE: FRANCE DEMANDS REINFORCEMENTS

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, May 28

 BODY:
Prime Minister Alain Juppe said tonight that France would press for withdrawal of the United Nations peacekeeping forces from Bosnia unless NATO and the United Nations agreed in the next few days to send them reinforcements.
He also repeated a call by President Jacques Chirac on Saturday for the United Nations to revise its mandate and intensify its peacemaking efforts if France is to keep its 3,800 soldiers in Bosnia, which both men say is what they really want. 
 As Bosnian Serb forces took more peacekeepers hostage today, including 33 British troops, Mr. Juppe said both the mission of the United Nations force and its deployment at scattered and poorly defensible sites around the country urgently needed to be changed.
The British Government issued a statement saying that it "utterly condemned" the seizure of its soldiers and said it was increasing its deployment of troops to Bosnia as soon as possible.
"The Ministry of Defense will be sending two artillery batteries and an armored engineer squadron to Bosnia as soon as possible," the Government said in a statement after an emergency Cabinet meeting.
In Washington, Clinton Administration officials said the United States is prepared to support a French plan to redeploy United Nations troops into more secure positions, and emphasized the need to bolster the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia. [Page 5.]
In France, Mr. Juppe said in an interview on national television, "We have to end the taking of hostages, restart the diplomatic process, and if all that fails, then agree to withdraw."
"I can't tell you whether that will be today or the day after," he said, addressing a public he knew was gravely concerned about the fate of French hostages, whose treatment he described tonight as "barbarity."
"We cannot live with the situation as it is," he said.
He spoke after a weekend of intensive telephone contacts on the Bosnian crisis between Mr. Chirac and President Clinton, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, Prime Minister John Major of Britain, President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia and other leaders. Most of the European allies that have troops in Bosnia appear to support France's calls for pulling back from exposed positions. Diplomats said Canada is also deeply concerned about the possible additional dangers that its troops could face as a result of NATO threats to repel attacks with air strikes.
Mr. Juppe said that at meetings set to be held in the Netherlands on Monday night and Tuesday, France would ask its allies to agree to send a NATO air-mobile reaction force to Bosnia equipped with helicopters and gunships that peacekeepers could call on for protection.
"These decisions should be taken within the next few days," he said.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Foreign Ministers of the so-called contact group seeking a diplomatic settlement in Bosnia -- the United States, Britain, France, Germany and Russia -- are to meet in the Hague on Monday night to consider ways of restarting diplomatic efforts, French officials said.
They are to go to the coastal resort of Nordwijk on Tuesday and Wednesday for a regular NATO ministerial meeting and for consultations between the allies and former Warsaw Pact countries.
The French proposal for a NATO reaction force would require agreement by both the United Nations and NATO -- an arrangement that United States officials say has proved highly unsatisfactory in launching air strikes so far.
The French Prime Minister was also critical of the United Nations decision to call in NATO bombers against the Serbs last week, though France supported the decision at the time to force the Serbs to stop bombarding Sarajevo and to return heavy weapons they had illegally seized from United Nations weapons-collection depots.
"That ultimatum and those air strikes were not carefully planned," Mr. Juppe said tonight. "They submitted our troops to ill-considered risks. We have no right to expose our soldiers to ill-considered risks."
Mr. Juppe, who was Foreign Minister until Mr. Chirac, France's newly elected conservative President, put him at the head of a new Government 11 days ago, said that France would ask the contact group to name a single negotiator to try more effectively for a settlement. So far, its officials have usually traveled together in groups, but the Bosnian Serbs have sometimes refused to let all of them pass its checkpoints.
The Prime Minister did not say how he expected diplomacy suddenly to work after years of futility, but he did say that President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia could use his influence on the Bosnian Serbs more effectively to pressure them into accepting a settlement.
"Milosevic could do something tomorrow," Mr. Juppe said. "He could recognize Bosnia and Herzegovina within its present frontiers." The contact group tried unsuccessfully this spring to get Mr. Milosevic to agree to that as a condition for lifting United Nations economic sanctions against Serbia, but Mr. Milosevic insisted that the the sanctions be lifted unconditionally first.
"The moment that is accomplished, I believe the international community should recognize the situation and lift the sanctions -- with a clause permitting reimposition if necessary," Mr. Juppe said.
Mr. Chirac on Saturday gave French troops in Bosnia full authority to resist attack with force and despatched a French air and naval force, including the aircraft carrier Foch and a helicopter carrier, to the Adriatic. The force is to arrive there on Tuesday and join NATO naval operations that already include an American aircraft carrier, the Theodore Roosevelt.
The NATO forces could be used to aid peacekeepers and, if necessary, to take them to safety if France, Britain, Spain and the other countries involved decide that their mission cannot be carried out and that their position is untenable.

HEADLINE: U.S. FINDS ITSELF VIRTUALLY ALONE ON JAPAN TRADE

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: SINGAPORE, May 27

 BODY:
Japanese trade officials have spread through Asia in recent days, warning government officials that their booming economies will be the next targets if Japan is forced by the United States to set aside a certain portion of its market for American goods.
The message is sinking in. Nearly two weeks after declaring that it would impose harsh trade sanctions on Japan, the Clinton Administration is finding itself isolated and outmaneuvered around the world, with Asian governments joining their counterparts in Europe in condemning Washington's move to impose $6 billion in punitive tariffs against Japanese-made luxury cars. 
 In a stream of newspaper columns, public speeches and private meetings with American officials, Asian leaders have told the Clinton Administration that they share its frustration in opening Japanese markets, but cannot abide its tactics.
"We are quite sympathetic with America's goals," Sarasin Viraphol, director general for American affairs in the Foreign Ministry of Thailand, said here today during a break in a meeting of senior American and Asian business leaders, government officials and academics that was dominated by the trade confrontation. "We understand why America feels it must go eyeball to eyeball. But if it is successful using this weapon on Japan, soon it will use it on all of us."
The sharp rejection of President Clinton's initiative in both Asia and Europe has come as a pleasant surprise to Japanese officials, and it seems to be emboldening them to face down the United States. In private, several senior Japanese officials say they believe that Mr. Clinton's top trade advisers are already having second thoughts and will seek a face-saving compromise rather than let the newly formed World Trade Organization issue a ruling on the legality of the American sanctions. The Clinton Administration, however, appears dug in.
"Both countries have walked themselves into positions that are hard to get out of," said Gerald Curtis, a professor of political science at Columbia University and a longtime expert on Japanese politics. "That is why everyone is so nervous that this time there could be a real collision."
[On Sunday, the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, continued weeklong sparring with the Japanese over when to resume trade talks. Washington proposed a meeting on June 20, which Tokyo said was too close to the sanctions deadline. It asked instead for a meeting early in June. But Mr. Kantor, appearing on the ABC television program "This Week," said June 20 was the "correct date."]
Most trade experts say they expect that Japan would win a legal challenge to the 100 percent tariffs that are to be imposed on 13 Japanese-made luxury car models if an agreement is not reached by June 28. Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown seemed to acknowledge that possibility earlier this week in Paris, when he said that American Government lawyers had mixed opinions on whether the punitive tariffs violated the world trade agreement approved last year.
"He was putting the best possible face on things," a senior American official said of Mr. Brown's comments. "I think there is a clear apprehension that we are going to court with a losing case."
Indeed, American officials are making little effort to defend the legality of the sanctions. Instead, they have begun to send direct and indirect messages to Tokyo that something much more important than auto parts is at stake.
Japanese leaders, they now argue, have an essential decision to make: whether it is worth winning points in front of the World Trade Organization if the long-term cost is harm to their overall relationship with the United States. Winning the case in front of the trade organization, they have warned, would be an empty victory if it jeopardized American public support for the security alliance that Japan depends upon.
The warning seems at odds with the Administration's public position -- stated several times in the last two weeks by White House officials -- that they would never use American security guarantees for Japan as a weapon in trade disputes. But in subtle ways, the two are already linked.
This morning, for example, The Straits Times, Singapore's Government-influenced newspaper, carried an interview with Winston Lord, the American Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and the Pacific, that used unusually blunt language in warning Japan of the risks of its stance.
Mr. Lord said the United States was not linking its security presence with trade agreements. But he added that the public might make that linkage.
"Over time," he said, "if the U.S. domestic perception is that the U.S. was being shut out of Asian markets, they might well begin to question the maintenance of forces in the region." There are nearly 100,000 American troops in Japan, South Korea and other parts of East Asia.
Yet in a two-week tour of Asia, Mr. Lord was unable to whip up much support for Washington's hardball approach. He received his strongest backing from Singapore's patriarch and now senior minister, Lee Kuan Yew, who delivered a fiery speech in Tokyo last week urging the Japanese to deregulate and open their economy.
Mr. Lee warned Japan that it "risks serious deterioration in bilateral relations with the U.S. if it persists with its current practices." He added that Japan "must weigh its trading interests against its needs for an indispensable U.S. counterweight to a China growing in weight and influence, and a Russia which is still well armed but unstable."
But Mr. Lee reserved some strong criticism for the Administration, ending his speech by declaring that American demands that Japan enter a "voluntary plan" to purchase a minimum number of autos and auto parts "amount to managed trade" that would "damage the interests of other countries."
The reasons for Asian governments' refusal to back the United States are complex, Asian officials say -- as intertwined as the trading relationships that link some of the world's fastest-growing economies.
The first fear here is that Asian countries without Japan's wealth or political influence would not stand a chance against similar American demands that they, too, quickly open their markets or face strong sanctions. Thus, countries from Taiwan to Indonesia have a strong interest in forcing the United States to go to the World Trade Organization in the hope that big and small economies might be treated as equals.
Japan is also calling in its chips after a decade-long spending spree around the region. It has provided billions of dollars in foreign aid to Indonesia, China and other Asian nations -- compared with a tiny trickle of American spending -- and has built a huge network of Japanese-owned factories around the region. That network has made many Asian countries part of the Japanese economic family. Thus, air-conditioners and refrigerators produced by the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company's subsidiary in Kuala Lumpur have no problem getting onto Japanese store shelves. And Japan is a huge employer. David D. Hale, an economist for the Kemper Financial Companies, estimated recently that one in seven manufacturing workers in Thailand is now employed by a Japanese concern.
Thirdly, there is a fear that any concessions won by the United States could come at the expense of other Asian nations. In South Korea, a newspaper cartoon recently showed the United States shooting an arrow at Japan, and the Japanese deftly ducking out of the way. South Korea was standing just behind, right in the arrow's path.
Under this theory, Japanese companies reserve a certain part of their purchases for foreigners, and Asians and Europeans are left with whatever the United States does not claim. Similar fears of being cut out led European countries to warn Japan and the United States last week that they would sue both countries if Japan agreed to numerical targets for increased sales of American cars and car parts. American officials say that worry is misplaced, and that if the United States succeeds in opening the Japanese market, all of Japan's trading partners will benefit.
Thus, many Asian officials say they want to make sure that the United States and Japan are neither too adversarial or too close, both conditions that could pinch Japan's neighbors.
"When the elephants fight, the grass is trampled," Mr. Sarasin said, quoting an oft-heard saying in Asia. "But when they make love, it's even worse."

HEADLINE: In the Hamptons, the Gridlock Season Begins

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR 

DATELINE: EAST HAMPTON, L.I., May 28

 BODY:
Twelve hours before this year's bistros-of-the-moment served their first calamari appetizers, in fact well before many of their clients had even lifted an eyelid, Danny King was on the bay, straining under nets laden with just plain squid.
Even as he lifted, Mr. King, his face framed by a white-flecked, rounded beard of the type his ancestors might have worn 200 years ago, kept watch for the cigarette boats stinging across Gardiners Bay. 
 "You used to go fishing and you didn't see half a dozen boats all day," he said, his long iron hook bringing up a trap net swarming with squid, skate, rockfish, striped bass, fluke, blowfish, sea robin and horseshoe crabs -- a living, frothing bouillabaisse. Now on foggy days, he said, he hesitates to venture even the 100 yards offshore to check his nets. "I keep my head going around in circles," he said. "A lot of these people don't know where they are and just keep going full throttle."
Memorial Day weekend marks summer moving to full throttle in the Hamptons, the annual onslaught of the chic, both welcomed and dreaded by the locals. The transformation from ordinary to constantly crowded and vaguely exotic makes the natives feel like strangers in their own land, even though it is almost the sole support of their economy. Each summer they feel a little more besieged in this string of quaint, highly groomed villages that thrive on the annual tide of summer trade, a tide that never recedes as far as the year before.
"This is going to be the summer when we forget who the locals are," said Helen S. Rattray, the editor and publisher of The East Hampton Star, who some natives barely consider local, even though she has lived here for more than three decades. "They are disappearing."
It has been years since those rooted on eastern Long Island got a September break from the crowds. Faxes, computers and multimillion-dollar houses have made the Hamptons a virtual extension of Manhattan. A recent state study estimated that $10 billion has been invested in second homes, and there is no great urge to shutter them come Labor Day.
"In October we now have the Hamptons Film Festival, just to extend the misery," said Bill Henderson, a publisher who took refuge from New York 15 years ago and now escapes from East Hampton to Maine until Thanksgiving. Not even that date may be safe; a just-opened Hamptons branch of a SoHo eatery is planning a New Year's Eve party.
Still, the crowds reach a crescendo in the summer, when traffic along much of the 30 miles between Southampton and Montauk all but stops, and the only positive thing anybody can say about the gridlock and the difficulty making a left turn across the Montauk Highway is that it keeps accidents to a minimum.
It is little wonder, then, that the vehicle of choice for the standing still has become the British Range Rover, which is somewhat akin to driving a turbo-charged living room couch. David Yurman, a jewelry designer, and his wife, Sybil, paused on the way from Manhattan to plunk down $55,000 for a silvery blue version.
"Before we got to the house, we stopped here to buy," Mrs. Yurman said. "It's a very cushy ride. It's a status car out here." The couple appeared a little unsettled when someone mentioned that dealers in Brooklyn or New Jersey might sell it $4,000 cheaper, but protested the idea of venturing into Brooklyn to buy a car.
Since most customers barely get to drive their cars on the road, much less off, Bob Dauman, a salesman on the lot, said that the dealership rents out the Bridgehampton race track every Labor Day, filling it with mud puddles, gravel slides and hillocks so the vehicle owners can splash around in four-wheel drive. "It's a fantasy," Mr. Dauman said. "They love it."
Although more and more people stay put in eastern Long Island come September, Tony Bullock, the supervisor in the town of East Hampton, estimates the area population surges to 225,000 from 100,000 over the summer. "I know from our garbage flow," he said. "It's 18 to 20 tons a day in winter, while peak weekends generate over 120 tons a day."
That 50-day influx generates between 60 and 70 percent of the year's economic activity, he said, a number likely to grow as major employers like Drummond Aircraft leave and are not replaced. The business of building or buying second homes keeps an army of lawyers, architects, carpenters, house painters and gardeners busy almost year-round. Local shops have to pay more than minimum wage to keep workers. And about 80 percent of the $260,000 collected for parking tickets last year in East Hampton came over the summer.
This year the price of tickets went to $40 from $20, setting the scene for tempers erupting like overheated radiators. "I am delighted that you are such a genius," sneered a man in a blue shirt and yellow silk bow tie, flinging onto the pavement a ticket that Officer Greg J. Brown wrote him for parking in a bus stop.
The natives develop summer survival skills. They stop going to restaurants. They boycott the three-hour lines for movies. They rarely stop by the post office and scurry into supermarkets on prime beach days. With shop rents on some streets now at $4,500 a month, most of the other stores they once frequented have been driven out by boutiques, antique dealers and real estate agents.
"How many people are going to buy a $600 or $700 sweater, no matter how nice it looks on the mannequin?" said Jonathon Dayton, a farmer who said he soured on second-home owners after one moved next door and began a protracted legal battle to shut down his produce wagon. "There is no place to go anymore that hasn't been taken over. There really are no local people left."
Snatches of sidewalk conversations are rather distant from fisherman or farmers discussing the rarity of the east wind this year. A sampling:
"The trendiest person I know? I'm like the trendiest person I know."
"My therapist told me just to look at my job like working for a bunch of monkeys."
"Don't go to the estate auctions. You should fly over to England to buy the antiques and bring back a container. It will be cheaper in the long run."
The accents are often French, German and Italian, as the weak dollar attracts Europeans, who real estate agents say like the low crime rate.
"People who have rented in someplace like Cap-Ferrat in the south of France have been robbed at gunpoint," said Harald Grant, a transplanted Norwegian working at one of the gold-plated real estate agencies. "Here you don't have that."
But from the prices, it's sometimes hard to tell. A studio within driving distance of the beach goes for $5,000 for the summer. For ocean-front property with a pool, tennis court (the local shortage is viewed as a major scourge) and a five-car garage, expect to pay more than $200,000. A basic three-bedroom house within walking distance of the beach is $25,000 to $40,000.
The days when summer meant a slower pace and getting away from it all seem lost forever. The East Hampton Star is probably one of the few small-town newspapers in America with its own 14-page arts supplement and an editor who worries that chasing Steven Spielberg, an area resident, for a profile might duplicate an article in Vanity Fair.
Dan's Papers, the grandfather of the local giveaway weeklies, splashed things like U.F.O. sightings across its pages in the 1960's. Now Catherine J. Squires, the editor's assistant, calls the artsy front covers "collectible," and hands out a list of three fetes for its 35th anniversary. "Our gala party on June 17 has an A-list that would just knock your socks off, people like Donald Trump and Mort Zuckerman," she said.
Irene Silverman, a Manhattan refugee, shakes her head at what started as a few writers and painters mixed in among the potato farmers. "Now's the time that life gets closest to the life in New York City," she said. "We tried to get away from each other, but we just followed each other. We are all here now."

HEADLINE: What Goes On?;
Call of the Modem, to Some, Is a Sweet Nothing

 BODY:
It is the white noise of the electronic age, the signature tune of computers, faxes and just about all things that interconnect over phone lines. It is to the office what the blue jay's screech is to the garden.
It is the call of the modem in search of a mate. 
 But what, exactly, are they saying?
As in all intital encounters in the animal kingdom, two strangers in the digital kingdom need to check each other out. Nicholas Negroponte, professor of media technology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, wrote in his book, "Being Digital" (Alfred A. Knopf, 1995), that "these mating calls are the negotiations to find the highest terrain from which they can trade bits, with the greatest common denominator of all variables."
Roughly translated, the introductions go like this:
Modem A: Hi, I'm a modem.
Modem B: So am I.
Modem A: Wanttotalkfast?
Modem B: I o n l y t a l k v e r y s l o w l y.
Modem A: F i n e.
And why, in this age of technological advancement, does all this still sound like Donald Duck gargling? Given the harshness of the sound and the effort many software and hardware companies devote to esthetics, why have no manufacturers masked the guttural cacophony with a few bars of Beethoven or the blues?
Because there's a limit to what modems can do. Some software companies offer options to turn the sound off. Those who are comfortable with computer technology sometimes do so. But the commands are too cumbersome and intricate for most novice computer users, involving such non-household acronyms as ATDT and X-MODEM, Y-MODEM and Z-MODEM.
The alternative -- making pleasing sounds -- is not yet economically feasible. Modem manufacturers note their products have a finite amount of computing power and cannot add bells and whistles without sacrificing basic communications performance. To add the bells and whistles would probably create a product priced completely out of a very competitive market.
Moreover, those who say they understand the technology find meaning, even beauty, in the sounds. An engineer said he liked to go to sleep listening to the sound.
"Some people place great importance on the tones," said Dale Walsh, vice president for advanced development for U.S. Robotics Inc. in Skokie, Ill. "They can identify the signals, recognizing each sound combination.
"Actually," he added, "I find the sound extremely pleasing."

HEADLINE: MEDIA: ON TELEVISION;
The issue is not the future of Connie Chung, but the future of evening newscasts as we know them.

BYLINE: By Bill Carter

 BODY:
BEYOND the overheated debate last week about whether Connie Chung has a future now that CBS has dropped her from its nightly newscast is a larger question likely to be asked more and more frequently in the coming months: Is there a future for anybody on the networks' nightly newscasts?
Despite declines in the newscasts' ratings and revenue, executives at the three broadcast networks insist the answer is an enthusiastic yes. The enthusiasm is based not on the prospect that the newscasts will stage a ratings comeback, but on the prospect of finding new ways to turn news into cash. 
 Among the potential revenue sources cited by executives are international distribution, video-on-demand programming and -- when someone figures out how to make money from it -- delivery of news and information on the Internet.
Purely on the basis of the number of people tuning in every night, the evening newscast appears to be a business of diminishing returns for all three networks. ABC's "World News Tonight" has fallen from an average rating of 10.7 a year ago to a 10.2 this year. "NBC Nightly News" is down to an 8.6 rating from a 9.6, while "CBS Evening News" has dropped the most, to an 8.5 from a 9.6. (Each rating point represents 954,000 homes.)
A good part of the reason for the falloff has been the O. J. Simpson trial, which has drawn many news viewers to CNN at newscast time, when court is still in session in Los Angeles. And even before the Simpson trial, there had been evidence of a slow erosion in the newscasts' ratings.
Whatever the reason, the declines have been costly. Andrew Lack, president of NBC News, said "NBC Nightly News" had lost "several million dollars" this year. NBC has reacted to the drain by quietly adding an extra 30-second commercial inside the newscast.
That hasn't helped answer questions about the content, however. "These shows haven't changed much in 20 or 30 years," Mr. Lack said. Evening newscasts on local television stations, meanwhile, have expanded to 90 minutes or longer, during which many of the same stories that now appear on the networks' newscasts are covered, at least in passing. The traditional evening recitation of the big stories of the day is increasingly open to criticism for being outmoded -- and even irrelevant.
Still, none of the networks have even dropped a hint that their evening newscasts are about to be eliminated or radically changed. Instead, they apparently intend to reinforce the institution, at least for now. The reason, said David F. Poltrack, executive vice president of research for CBS, is that the programs still represent "the image, the identity of the network."
That was never clearer than it was last week, when the decision by CBS to drop Ms. Chung from her job as co-anchor with Dan Rather of "CBS Evening News" prompted a frenzy of attention. The reaction to the decision did not seem consistent with the program's declining ratings and uninterested audience.
But, as Mr. Poltrack put it: "The anchors are still the face of the network. When people think of CBS they think of Dan Rather."
For that reason alone, he said, "The newscasts are a very important economic component of the network." And the possibilities offered by emerging forms of media hungry for news programming make those economics more promising in the future, Mr. Poltrack added.
Both CBS and ABC have appointed former news executives to head their efforts to expand into new media services: Mark Harrington at CBS and Steven Weiswasser at ABC.
The reason is simple: news programming is an asset that the networks own outright. The networks produce it themselves and whatever uses they can come up with to repackage it means additional revenue. In fact, the networks increasingly refer to the result of their news gathering as their "news product."
"News can be catalogued and retrieved and sold," Mr. Poltrack said. He said that in the course of a day the network's news division collected an enormous amount of material, some of which is sent out to the affiliated stations for use on their local newscasts and some of which is used by the network itself.
"But two-thirds of what we collect ends up nowhere," Mr. Poltrack said. At least some of that material may be able to generate revenue for the network in the future, he said.
Mr. Lack of NBC is not so sure. "I'm less sanguine about putting news on a computer service and trying to find a way to make money," he said. Instead, he said he was considering a different way to find new profits from the newscasts: the network is trying to create the first international evening newscast.
In the short term, the economic prospects for the networks' evening newscasts are actually improving, even without international expansion or new media. The Simpson trial has to end sometime. More important, the bullish advertising market for all of network television is driving up the prices for commercials on the newscasts, even with their diminished ratings.
"There is a flood of money in the marketplace that will probably mean the prices the networks get for their news programs will be up by 20 to 25 percent," said Bill Croasdale, president of national broadcasting for Western International Media.
Mr. Lack suggested that despite the positive short-term gains, the newscasts would have to change substantially in the next three to five years. He said it might be possible to combine local and network newscasts, perhaps creating an hourlong or even longer news program similar to NBC's "Today" show.
The drawback to such a drastic change, he said, goes back to the strength of the network newscast: its lingering reputation as the Front Page that provides coverage of the most important news of the day.

HEADLINE: Garment Shop With a Grand Vision;
In Queens Factory, Workers Are as Important as the Product

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON 

 BODY:
The women come to the squat brick factory in Queens from apartments in Jackson Heights and Corona, arriving by city bus before morning has fully broken. Their backs and legs aching, but willing, they come wearing saris or carrying merengue tapes.
 Among them, Luz Lopez treks through the half-light to Sequins International in Woodside. She came to New York with her father from Colombia in 1969, and she has spent much of her life since working in one factory or another. 
 "I have been in factories in this city that were dark and awful, places where there were bosses everywhere staring, places where they timed how long you were in the bathroom," Ms. Lopez said. "Now, my daughter asks why her mom is smiling at 6 in the morning as she goes to work."
 Indeed, the stereotypical scenes of garment factory life do not exist inside the front doors of Sequins International, a third-generation textile shop that makes novelty apparel and employs roughly 350 workers.
 A classroom for English courses has been constructed next to the lunchroom on the second floor of the 85,000-square-foot plant, and instruction goes on during work hours. Committees of workers are present at most major management meetings. Many of the machines that produce the tiny plastic sequins have been redesigned to ease the threat of physical injury. A social worker provided by the union has been called in to help many of the women confront the problem of domestic violence. Instead of endlessly performing one task, the women work in teams, alternating assignments, expanding their skills and limiting isolation.
 And mixing with the dominant tongues of English, Spanish and Hindi is the sometimes awkwardly ornate language of management theory. Amid the thump and whir of decades-old machinery, the talk is not of oppression or strikes, but of "worker empowerment," "investment in human resources" and a "self-directed workplace."
 "It doesn't feel like a factory," said Ms. Lopez, a former shop floor worker at Sequins who is now a middle-level manager. "It feels good. It feels like the future."
 The familiar portrait of garment and textile manufacturing in the city is one of a dying or scandal-plagued industry: companies departing to pursue cheap labor in other states or overseas; sweatshops exploiting workers, some of them children. The gospel for survival is to cut costs -- in any way, at every turn.
 But there are exceptions -- factory shops that have concluded that operating a legal, efficient and humane workplace does not mean economic suicide. In these shops, unions can be partners, the city and its assets of brainpower and governmental economic development funds can be resources, and the immigrant workers can be treated as valuable components in any equation for success.
 The president of Sequins International, Lawrence Gladstone, said his shop is one of those exceptions. Mr. Gladstone, whose grandfather founded the business on 36th Street and Eighth Avenue in Manhattan in 1941, said his strategy derived more from economic sense than an abundance of altruism.
 Facing competition from China and India -- "In China, there are 500,000 women and children with needle and thread and sequins," he likes to say -- Mr. Gladstone said that product quality, not inexpensive labor, was critical to enduring profitability.
 Indeed, Mr. Gladstone, 31, has bet the future of his $30 million-a-year business, one that produces roughly 1 million yards of sequins annually, on the following formula: Educated, healthy workers who are not limited to single-task, assembly-line routines will produce better goods with less waste, allowing him to both cut costs and charge more. He thinks the workers will return his trust and civility with greater commitment, and he projects that he will be able to run a shop soon in which each worker accounts for $100,000 in annual sales. In the year since he began his initiatives, production efficiency, he said, has improved by 80 percent.
 "The typical picture of small-scale American manufacturing will make you cry," said Moreno Tagliapietra, a consultant from the Center for Economic Development at La Guardia Community College who has advised management at Sequins. "The people at Sequins have chosen a completely different alternative to traditional management. They don't follow the rules."
 Mr. Gladstone, who said he read more than 100 books on management theory before taking over from his father in 1993, has taken advantage of financial grants from the garment workers union and money from the state and city economic development corporations. He has hired Mr. Tagliapietra, part of whose fee is paid by the state, to help with his organization. He has allowed Mount Sinai Hospital to use his workers for a study on repetitive strain injuries.
 "This was never an abusive shop where workers were exploited," Mr. Gladstone said. "But it operated with a whip-and-stick approach, with supervisors and bean counters. The human beings were broken down. We decided to work on the social system of the factory."
 The project has had its moments of both epiphany and profound hurt. Workers who had suffered the embarrassment of having their own children correct their grammar have been thrilled by the chance at learning English, and shocked that they would be allowed to do it during their work shifts. Others who had their shoulders and wrists wrecked by years of operating the same machinery -- one woman who turned a spooling crank for years fantasized that she suffered from bone cancer -- wept when they were offered medical help and assured that their repetitive strain injuries were treatable.
 "It was death," said Ana Valencia, a mother of two who spent half a dozen years operating a spooling machine at Sequins. "It was like grinding coffee all day long. I wanted to throw parts of my body away."
 But a reduction in staffing also resulted from the reconfiguring of the factory and its operation. About 80 workers were let go last year, leading to a certain level of suspicion among the remaining workers about the eventual impact of all the grand management talk. As well, many of the women -- most are from Colombia or the Dominican Republic and some are from India and Bangladesh -- found themselves strangely intimidated by the demand that they become more involved in the strategies and conditions of the factory.
 "I thought I couldn't do it, the different techniques, the different jobs," said Cassandra Vassell, a native of Jamaica who has worked at Sequins for 25 years. "But I did. I feel responsible. The atmosphere is good. But I know some of the girls are worried that they will not be able to do everything they want us to."
 Jean Robert Paul, a Haitian immigrant who has been at Sequins for 18 years, is less reserved.
 "You get hooked on it," he said of the added responsibility and sense of power. "This is, like, colossal. There are not enough words."
 The scene inside Sequins is a mix of noisy productivity and conviviality, with senior management officials walking the shop floor, consulting with union-provided teachers and talking on a first-name basis with the women who chop sequins from strips of plastic or who operate the giant crocheting machines that attach the sequins onto fabric. Pete Meyer, a supervisor at the factory for 28 years, wears a patch on his shirt that reads: "Cultural Champion."
 Workers, whose single-task focus almost never required them to speak with anyone during the course of their day, now have to read orders, resolve problems and coordinate work, and they sometimes manage the skill and courage to do it while speaking their imperfect but precious English. In the classroom, a carpeted room that will soon be equipped with a computer, Dominican women who might not have ever shared a lunch table with their Indian co-workers, share tables and laughter.
 In fact, for the more advanced English students, the first assignment was to begin to write their personal work stories, and thus compiling a history of the factory itself. They interviewed Mr. Gladstone's father, questioned their colleagues and put pen to paper. Some of the modest, abbreviated personal histories hang on the walls of the classroom.
 One begins: "I came to this country in 1967. Six months later I came to work for Sequins. Everything for me was new and hard because everything in my country, Puerto Rico, was different. I don't have responsibility, just go to school and help my grandmother in the house. One year after I got married with a wonderful man, my husband until today. We have three children. Two girls and one boy. Two of them got married. And I have four grandsons. All of my family is here in New York. I now have to learn more English. I am not satisfied."
 Officials with the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, while reserving final judgment on just how much power Mr. Gladstone is willing to turn over to his workers, said they were impressed by the scope of management's investment. "Have I heard of this being done elsewhere?" asked Tracy Gross, the union's educational director. "Yeah, at G.M. or some other giant outfits with great resources. In the garment industry? No."
 Mae Ngai, an official with the Consortium for Worker Education, a nonprofit organization involving 31 labor unions, has helped put together the management plan at Sequins. Ms. Ngai noted with a smile that the workers who find themselves at meetings with company executives are often too shy to say much.
 "Look, we have been in places where we had to fight for the money to get chalk," Ms. Ngai said. "The workers at Sequins probably don't know what it all means. But they are going down a road and are happy with it."
 That happiness surfaces five mornings a week in the smile that so bewilders Luz Lopez's daughter. Ms. Lopez, who acts as confidante and representative and mediator for the workers, has taken on a lot. She has listened as the women have opened up and told her of being abused by husbands and boyfriends.
 "I ask myself sometimes how am I going to be able to do this, and I wish I could take some of their pain from them," she said. "In a way, it is too much. But I feel like I was born to do it."

IN THE HAMPTONS, THE GRIDLOCK SEASON
Memorial Day weekend marks summer moving to full throttle in the Hamptons, the annual onslaught of the chic, both welcomed and dreaded by the locals. The transformation from ordinary to constantly crowded and vaguely exotic makes the natives feel like strangers in their own land, even though it is almost the sole support of their economy. Each summer they feel a little more besieged in this string of quaint, highly groomed villages that thrive on the annual tide of summer trade, a tide that never recedes as far as the year before. It has been years since those rooted on eastern Long Island got a September break from the crowds. Faxes, computers and multimillion-dollar houses have made the Hamptons a virtual extension of Manhattan. A state study estimated that $10 billion has been invested in second homes, and there is no great urge to shutter them come Labor Day. [Page 1.]

POLICE OFFICERS AND ALCOHOL
The troublesome mix of police officers and alcohol, combining elements both ridiculous and tragic, has plagued the Police Department. Incidents of drunken officers mistreating prisoners, mishandling firearms and driving recklessly have provoked police commissioners, especially in the last two decades, to crack down repeatedly on drinking. The strictest policies, including a ban on alcohol in police buildings and vehicles, were enacted in the 1980's after two alcohol-related killings by officers. But a police bacchanal in Washington and the high correlation between alcohol abuse and a recent spate of police suicides show that drinking is a problem that will not go away, even if, as police officials assert, it has now been effectively relegated to off-duty hours. [25.]
 
SCHOOL SAFETY OFFICER CHARGED IN RAPE
A New York City school safety officer was charged with rape and assault in an early morning attack on a 28-year-old woman in Hollis, Queens, the police said. Two police officers who had stopped a car for a traffic violation near 204th Street and Jamaica Avenue heard screams and found the woman in a nearby vacant lot, said Sgt. Sean Crowley, a spokesman for the Police Department. They discovered the suspect, Wayne Grant, 33, hiding in tall weeds in the lot, Sergeant Crowley said. [25.]
 
SIX INJURED IN FIRE TRUCK ACCIDENT
Six people were injured when a fire truck responding to a false alarm in the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn struck their car, officials said. The victims, who were not identified, were taken to Kings County Hospital, said an Emergency Medical Service spokesman, who said that two children had suffered back and neck injuries. No firefighters were injured in the accident. [25.]
 
A PLAN FOR PRIVATE POLICING FIZZLES
Leave it to New York. One of the city's richest, most elegant neighborhoods comes up with the brash and unprecedented idea of hiring a private security force. And who shoots down the idea but leaders of the same neighborhood. The Upper East Side of Manhattan is saying no to the ultimate in privatization, a police force by and for the wealthiest people in town. At a crowded public forum at the Lenox Hill Neighborhood House on East 70th Street, speaker after speaker voiced opposition to creating a private security district between 59th and 96th Streets, from the East River to Fifth Avenue. They called the proposal elitist, worried that it would break New York into "mini city states," said that with crime down in the area it was unnecessary, and predicted that City Hall would cut the number of officers in the local precinct.

MONK GIVES UP ON RESTAURANT
In the last year, Brother Denys Cormier and his restaurant, the Wandering Monk's Guild and Bakery, had become something of a landmark in New Haven. The restaurant, which was featured on national television and in People magazine, drew a mix of Yale students, business executives and street people with its hearty food, simple decor and unusual pricing policy. Diners were asked to donate whatever they could, with all profits going to a soup kitchen that fed 1,300 children a day. But despite his successful charity work and his growing fame, Brother Cormier has closed up shop. The reasons are not entirely clear. [27.]

HEADLINE: Engineering Students Turn Their Theories Into Prototypes

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: PRINCETON, N.J.

 BODY:
Professor Enoch J. Durbin has long been nagged by the belief that engineering schools, particularly the one here, at which he teaches, have lost sight of their own students.
"Most of us have the notion that students want to be like us," Professor Durbin said, "that they either want to be college professors or work for big corporations. Getting a job with a good monthly salary -- that's not their dominant drive. They want to be the masters of their own creativity." 
 And so Professor Durbin began a program that lets some undergraduates at Princeton University's Engineering School pursue inventions of their own making while they are being schooled in licensing, marketing and other such subjects.
The basic idea behind the Princeton Entrepreneurial Program is to allow students studying mechanical and aerospace engineering to fulfill their independent-work requirement by pursuing their own ideas rather than helping professors in their research.
Judy Chen, 21, has been working for two years to design a wheelchair that would ease three common difficulties of wheelchair users: getting up on a curb without using a ramp; grasping an out-of-reach object, such as a public telephone, and using a public restroom.
The idea for the wheelchair came from Teri Norris, a Princeton graduate who worked on the project while in the entrepreneurial program last year. Her inspiration was her father, who uses a wheelchair.
"The motivation has to come from personal experience," Professor Durbin said. "Young people today are more noble than most people recognize."
Ms. Chen and Ms. Norris have developed a prototype chair that includes pie-shaped retractable ramps around the wheels that can be activated with a lever mechanism to deal with the curb problem. The chair also has nitrogen gas cylinders that boost the seat when weight is put on the armrest, so the user can get closer to a pay phone or some other needed object. The prototype fits over both standard and handicapped toilets and includes a removable seat panel.
As Ms. Chen explained, the prototype uses simple mechanisms that do not require batteries so the user will not be stranded and the chair can be produced economically.
"It meets a real social need," Ms. Chen said, "and that's a good thing -- to use your engineering skills to help people."
Mr. Durbin sees commercial possibilities in the wheelchair. He said he would help the students apply for a patent soon.
He argued that most of his students pursue engineering degrees because they are interested in making life easier for people.
One student from Puerto Rico, for example, wanted to help people in remote villages there whose greatest need was for cheap electricity. The student eventually developed a fuel cell that runs on animal waste. Other students are working on more efficient engines and fuel systems as well as an interactive video that will teach children about space flight.
Students in the entrepreneurial program also attend seminars conducted by business people on such topics as raising venture capital, marketing and securing a patent.
In fact, the patent issue was a major hurdle to starting the program. The university at first said that it had patent and commercial rights over all research done at Princeton. Eventually the way was cleared for Ms. Chen and a handful of other students to pursue patents on a case-by-case basis.
Professor Durbin sees another obstacle to expanding his program both here and at other schools: resistance from faculty who prefer to get help on their research from students. In fact, he sees that resistance as the reason for the drop in the program's enrollment this year, from 13 students to 8 -- a small fraction of the 80 or so juniors and seniors in the mechanical and aerospace engineering department.
He may get help from the department chairman, Garry Brown, who said he wanted to encourage more student-initiated research.
"It is true that faculty prefer student work that is closer to their own interest," Mr. Brown said. "We're going to have to change the way we are organized to support student projects."

Japan's Central Bank Intervenes to Support Dollar

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Japan's central bank intervened in the currency market again early today to keep the dollar from falling against the Japanese yen.
Japanese stocks, meanwhile, rose today in early trading. The Nikkei index of 225 issues ended the morning trading session up 189.74 points, or 1.2 percent, at 15,763.77. Yesterday, the Nikkei fell 120.22 points, closing at 15,574.03. 
 Traders said the Bank of Japan stepped into the currency market today after the dollar fell below 82.50 yen. This appears to be the second consecutive session the central bank has intervened to support the dollar, which hit yesterday its lowest level against the yen in nearly a month.
Currency trading yesterday was thin, however, because of holidays in the United States and Britain.
By midday in Tokyo today, the dollar was quoted at 83.10 yen, up somewhat. It also rose to 1.3874 German marks.
The dollar has come under sharp pressure since Thursday, when it plunged from the 87-yen level on concerns that the weakening American economy might encourage the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. Lower rates would make investments denominated in dollars less attractive to international investors.
In late trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted at 82.79 yen, rebounding from its early low in Tokyo of 81.85 yen. Still, the dollar ended the day down slightly from the 82.94 yen quoted in New York late on Friday.
The dollar was also quoted yesterday at 1.3840 German marks, up from 1.3787 marks on Friday. The British pound was quoted at $1.602, down from $1.604.
In Tokyo yesterday, speculators bearish about the dollar assaulted it in early trading. But traders said the central bank stepped in to buy dollars when the currency fell to around the 82-yen level. That set off some stop-loss dollar-buying by traders who had sold the dollar short.
The financial newspaper Nihon Keizai estimated the Bank of Japan's purchases yesterday at $300 million to $400 million. The bank customarily does not comment on its market activities.
Analysts said traders' sentiment toward the dollar was likely to remain bearish in the short term.

Paris Markets Wary on Plan For Economy

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, May 29

 BODY:
Less than two weeks after Jacques Chirac took office as President of France, the markets in Europe are sending an unmistakable message to Elysee Palace -- they are nervous about his new economic plans for stimulating growth to reduce the country's 12.2 percent unemployment.
Last Tuesday, after Mr. Chirac's Prime Minister, Alain Juppe, offered an economic plan that included tax breaks for businesses that hire idle workers, a big increase in the minimum wage and a higher value-added tax, the French franc plunged and interest rates soared, in a sobering one-day move. 
 Economists and traders now warn that enough negative sentiment is building against the franc that the currency could be in for a roller-coaster ride over the next few weeks. They fear that the aggressive spending plans will both stimulate inflation and increase the budget deficit.
"The market is in a very risky position," said Jonathan Davis, a bond analyst in Paris for the Union Bank of Switzerland. "The line being repeated by politicians is that unemployment is the absolute priority, apparently even if the deficit goes higher. I think this puts the French financial markets in a vulnerable position."
Because markets in the United States and Britain were closed today, analysts said, trading in the franc was thin and it was hard to gauge sentiment. The franc traded late in the day at 4.8984 to the dollar, compared with 4.8553 in New York on Friday.
But starting Tuesday, the markets may begin to show the extent of their concern, especially after statements by Mr. Juppe on French television Sunday that he was prepared to let the budget deficit rise, even if this had repercussions for the franc, to reduce unemployment.
"Whatever the importance I attach to the stability of the franc, I will not renounce my No. 1 preoccupation -- that's employment," the Prime Minister said.
Traders today were also nervous about the first meeting since the election between President Chirac and Jean-Claude Trichet, head of the French central bank. Since January 1994, the bank has formally been an independent agency, relatively free of Government influence, and has pursued a tough policy to keep the franc in line with the value of the German mark. Economic linkage between France and Germany has been a cornerstone for both nations under successive governments.
Traders now fear that Mr. Trichet could come under pressure from Mr. Chirac to permit a weaker currency to promote growth and jobs.
To be sure, markets are not the final arbiters of sound economic policy. And one would think that after 14 years of Socialist leadership under the former President, Francois Mitterrand, under which industries were nationalized and then partly privatized, the traders would be cheered to have Mr. Chirac and Mr. Juppe, both Gaullists, on board.
With conservatives controlling both the executive and the Parliament, analysts see an opportunity for France to deal with entrenched problems and to position itself for greater leadership in Europe.
Many of the country's economic fundamentals are good -- the lowest inflation rate in Europe, a current-account surplus in trade and services and a fairly competitive and modern economy.
But its problems are deep, and they reflect what is hardest to remedy in many European economies as they approach the 21st century.
Government spending and deficits have soared, mainly from social programs like a national health system, a generous pension system and laws that permit six weeks of vacation a year and forbid factories to operate on weekends, in order to protect workers' leisure time.
Analysts say the country is still burdened by huge state enterprises that are losing money, like Air France, or that need new management to compete in the global economy, like France Telecom.
Several of the business elite, with long ties to political power, are enmeshed in corruption scandals and face trial on criminal charges.
Worst, despite economic growth in recent years, France cannot bring down its painfully high unemployment rate, which at 12.2 percent is the highest in northern Europe.
This poses potential problems for European integration. The European Union's 15 nations are fast approaching deadlines set under the Maastricht treaty, approved in 1992, for meeting certain economic conditions that allow them to join in a single European currency and to merge their central banks. The French are regarded as vital in balancing Germany's dominant role in any new European central bank. But it is a role that France would not be able to play if its budget deficits got out of control and the franc plunged.
The Maastricht treaty set three criteria for a country to join a common currency: inflation levels effectively under 3 percent, budget deficits no higher than 3 percent of economic output and accumulated debt no more than 60 percent of the gross domestic product. France now qualifies under the inflation and debt criteria, but its deficits have been running close to 6 percent a year.
In the last two years under President Mitterrand, the deficit was shrinking, with many analysts predicting that France would achieve the 3 percent level by 1999 -- the first year a monetary union is now considered remotely possible.
Policies proposed by Mr. Chirac have traders predicting that France will fall short. Many of them say that the tax breaks he is offering to companies to hire the unemployed will be too costly and will ultimately not create many jobs. Others fear that his proposed increase in the minimum wage -- as much as 5 percent from the current $1,200 a month -- would be inflationary. And though he proposes to make up for the lost revenue with a rise in the value-added tax, to 20 percent from 18.6 percent now, higher taxes could become an economic drag.
The markets now await a so-called mini-budget, to be offered early in July, in which the Government will describe how it will pay for its new programs.
Behind investors' fears is the question whether Mr. Chirac's officials will abandon the policy of a strong currency that President Mitterrand maintained for more than eight years and that has been pursued by the central bank. Such uncertainty has led to a drop in the value of the franc against the German mark of almost 4 percent since late last year.
To keep the value of the franc high and discourage speculation, the French central bank substantially raised interest rates in March. The rates are now three percentage points higher than similar ones in Germany. Such higher rates could restrict economic growth and investment, making it even harder to reduce unemployment.
France also stands to lose much of the confidence its central bank has built up if Mr. Trichet, a staunch advocate of an independent and restrictive monetary policy, is pressed into accommodating a weaker franc.
"It seems that the market likes to test to see if the franc fort policy is still there," said Nathalie Fillet, an economist at Bank Paribas in Paris, referring in market shorthand to the strong-franc approach. "The main problem is whether the Bank of France will go along with it."
Economists are not stressing the possibility that rather than a strong franc, the Government will embrace a devaluation of the currency and then pursue a stable franc.
"I think the Government has set itself goals that are quite difficult to achieve and reconcile, so it will not be clear quickly whether they will succeed or not," said Jean-Francois Mercier of Salomon Brothers in London. "I think they are realizing that their measures could prove costly. But at the same time, giving the impression that they would accept a higher deficit would be very dangerous in market terms."

HEADLINE: Khomeini's Legacy -- A special report.;
Fear, Inflation and Graft Feed Disillusion Among Iranians

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: TEHERAN, Iran

 BODY:
Nearly a generation after turbaned clerics occupied the palaces of kings, Iran is a country of broken promises, a place of unnerving unpredictability and fitful repression intended to keep the Government in power and the population at bay.
There is no serious challenge to the theocracy that has ruled for more than 16 years; even an intelligence analysis prepared by the Clinton Administration last December concludes that Iran's Government is durable, and that neither isolation nor embrace by the outside world is likely to overturn it. 
 But in periodic visits to Iran since Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini overthrew the monarchy in 1979, and in dozens of interviews during a recent trip, it became evident to this reporter that the religious oratory that once drove a nation into the streets no longer has the power to inspire. The masses, in whose name the revolution was made, now long for better days.
Just three years ago, a newly elected Parliament seemed ready to ratify President Hashemi Rafsanjani's bold program of economic reform; today, that movement, and the hopes it aroused, have been abandoned.
It is not that Iranians are concerned about whether their Government is building nuclear weapons or committing terrorist acts around the world. Those are American preoccupations that bear little relationship to day-to-day life for the 65 million people in Iran. But in a country where many still admire America, the Clinton Administration's trade embargo contributes to a general sense that things can only get worse.
In the effort to hold on to power, Iran's leaders have moved in contradictory directions. To keep the system strong enough to govern but supple enough to survive, they have simultaneously imposed strict limits and permitted a surprising degree of room to maneuver -- allowing the elected Parliament to override the preferences of the President and permitting scholarly journals to criticize the country's one-party system.
Just as there are rigid rules, there are endless ways around them. It is, for example, official Government policy to allow young men to buy their way out of compulsory military service and to sell at high costs permits that allow motorists to violate Teheran's traffic restrictions.
The result is a steady degradation of the ideals that brought the revolutionary leaders to power, an inefficiency that has strangled the economy, a cynicism that has fueled corruption and an unpredictability about everyday life.
"There has been nothing dramatic, just continual deterioration," said Ibrahim Yazdi, the leader of the Freedom Movement, Iran's leading secular liberal party, which has been banned. "We have a political crisis. We have an economic crisis. We have a social crisis. That creates uncertainty and unpredictability, so no one is making any long-term plans. People feel they've been betrayed, that the revolution has been kidnapped."
Dr. Yazdi, a former professor of medicine at Baylor University in Texas who served as Foreign Minister during the revolution's first year, typifies the tension between the permissible and the forbidden. He is dismissed as a man of the past and allowed to criticize the Government, although only to outsiders. The Government considers him so harmless that the Ministry of Islamic Guidance now offers to arrange visits to his comfortable apartment in central Teheran.
But his party newspaper and headquarters have been closed for a decade, and the party itself has been prevented from holding meetings, publishing documents and fielding candidates in elections. The Government has harassed shopkeepers and expelled university students who support the movement.
"We have set limits on ourselves because we are in a vulnerable situation," Dr. Yazdi said. "It is very difficult for us in this twilight zone."
 
Restrictions
Arbitrary Curbs On Everyday Life
 Iran is not like Syria, where terror of the Government runs so deep that ordinary people avoid political discussions. It is not even like Saudi Arabia, where any criticism of the rulers goes on only behind closed doors. Even in the early days of Iran's revolution, political protest was widespread, although largely anonymous, as people felt that the chaos that came with the end of the monarchy somehow offered them a layer of protection.
Indeed, the last few years have witnessed an explosion of public criticism. The two favorite recent topics are inflation, which has driven up the prices of many goods by 100 percent in the last year, and Parliament's ban last month on the satellite dishes that for two years had enabled Iranians to receive programs like "Baywatch" and BBC News.
"Taking away the satellites is taking away the individual's freedom," one reader wrote in a public opinion column of Salam, a newspaper influenced by clerics that is nevertheless highly critical of the Government. "This is nothing but a ploy to distract people's attention from the country's economic problems."
Another reader wrote, "How come the Government is capable of rounding up all the satellite dishes but is incapable of stopping inflation?"
The satellite dish was one of the most hotly debated issues in Parliament last winter. "We have no right to search people's homes," said Abbas Abbasi, a deputy from Bandar Abbas during the floor debate. "Even with a search warrant, do we have the right to follow everyone to the grave?"
People have responded to the ban by hiding the dishes in trees and under leaves and plastic sheeting, and by dismantling them every morning. That sort of circumvention of the rules is both deceptive and dangerous, because the Government can shift signals suddenly and without warning. The tone of the newspaper Salam, for example, has become much milder after its editor, Abbas Abdi, spent three months in prison in 1993. No charges were ever filed against him.
In February, Jahan-e Islam, which is published by the brother of the spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was shut down. The official explanation was that the paper "created doubts, printed untrue stories and insulted the religious beliefs of the Muslim nation."
In recent months, the Government has demanded that Iranians working in nearly every embassy in Teheran report on diplomatic activities, several ambassadors said. Other Iranians working with foreigners have been summoned to the Ministry of Islamic Guidance and offered an unappealing choice: either spy on your employers or sign a statement swearing never to have contact again with foreigners.
A number of the 134 writers who signed a petition last year protesting Government censorship have been interrogated and pressed to withdraw their signatures. By contrast, since last year the Government has allowed the publication of such scholarly opinion journals as Goftegu, or Dialogue, which advocates a more participatory democracy.
"You have to create your own way of saying things," said Ramin Jahanbegloo, a French-educated political philosopher who helped start Goftegu.
For the last few years, it has been official Government policy to ignore what people do in their homes. But carrying it out often depends on the whim of the neighborhood.
At a wedding reception for about 400 people in the garden of a northern Teheran home this month, the family of the groom paid the official neighborhood committees thousands of dollars to ignore the party.
Homemade -- and illegal -- vodka was pouring from pitchers and dinner was being served when a handful of stern men burst in. Members of the band threw their instruments onto a nearby roof and escaped. Women in party dresses rushed inside to find their floor-length coats and head scarves.
"They ruined the party," one guest said as she threw a trench coat over her strapless black dress. Other guests sniped that the family did not pay a big enough bribe, most of them leaving even before the cake was cut. The father of the groom spent the night in jail.
Only the most fervent perpetuate the fiction that all is right with the revolution.
"Our life is fine and we have no problem with inflation," said Akram Omrani, a trusted Government watchdog who searched visitors before Friday prayers at Teheran University, confiscating the lipstick and mascara of women guests. "We eat three meals a day -- not like my cousin who manages a hotel in Los Angeles. She can afford only one meal a day. In fact, tonight we are slaughtering two sheep to have a big party."
But that assessment was too much for a second official, who ran after the visitors to apologize for the cosmetics confiscation and to explain. "We let a woman take a lipstick inside and she got arrested," the woman said. "We can't really afford to live. Tell that to America, please."

 There is an air of fear in Akbarabad, a dusty, unexceptional shantytown like dozens of others that sprang up outside Teheran after the revolution, when building codes were abandoned in the name of building cheap housing for the people. Water is scarce, electricity is sporadic and social services are nonexistent.
Those inhabitants lucky enough to have jobs in Teheran commute by minibus every day; the unemployed sit on the stoops in front of shops drinking Zamzan, an Iranian version of cola. All suffer from the crippling inflation.
When independent bus drivers doubled their prices early one morning in April, the commuters rebelled. Witnesses said they blocked the minibuses from leaving the village. The rioters moved on to Islamshahr, a much larger town on the way to Teheran, smashing windows and setting fire to banks, gas stations and government buildings along the way.
By late morning, the Government rushed in elite anti-riot police officers, who opened fire in hit-and-run battles with villagers throughout the day. Plainclothes intelligence officials patrolled the streets in search of informants. By the time the riots were put down at nightfall, a number of people had died -- fewer than "the fingers of the hands" according to Ayatollah Mohammed Yazdi, chief of the judiciary; 15 to 30, according to diplomats in Teheran.
The next day, hundreds of police officers lined the streets as the local authorities bused thousands of people into Islamshahr to march in pro-Government demonstrations. The streets were strewn with broken windows, burned tires, bricks and ruble. Dozens of people were arrested or questioned.
The families of the dead were made to repay the police for the bullets they had fired; public mourning was prohibited. But the bus fares came down again.
The disturbance was not as serious as one in Qazvin last August, when the local commander refused to fire on the crowds. That prompted the Government to expand special rapid-reaction units that did not hesitate to move against the rioters in Akbarabad and Islamshahr.
But people in both places are still afraid to speak. "I heard the shooting," said one owner of a dry goods store. "Of course, it terrified people. The families of the dead don't wear black for mourning for fear of retaliation. But people are not going to talk about the deaths, so don't ask about it."
At Bank Tejarat in nearby Islamshahr, the rioters set fire to the building. "Don't ask political questions," said one of the managers. "We are ordered not to talk."
 
Economics
Runaway Inflation And Corruption
 Ayatollah Khomeini used to say that the people did not rise up against the monarchy over the price of watermelons and that economics was for the donkeys. But the discontent throughout the country today seems to have little to do with politics and everything to do with money.
"It's the person with money, not the martyr, who gets the respect," said Nasser Hadian, a political science professor at Teheran University.
Just a year ago, President Rafsanjani was talking about the need to have only one rate of exchange, to privatize the economy and to eliminate all subsidies. But in recent months, he has abandoned his economic reform program.
Last year, the inflation rate was unofficially pegged at 50 to 100 percent, while the salaries of public officials have remained constant. Per capita oil income in real terms is about one-fourth of what it was in the two years before the revolution.
Public disgust with the economy is so intense that a reader of Salam wrote to the newspaper recently to suggest that since Iran's money is now so worthless, the Central Bank should remove Khomeini's image from all Iranian rials.
Prices of most consumer goods fluctuate with the value of the dollar. In fact, the dollar so dominates the Iranian economy that another reader of Salam wrote: "All the Government's business is done with dollars. Let's just make the dollar our official currency."
The inability of Iranians to make ends meet has contributed to rampant corruption. During the monarchy, aides to Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi got rich on Government contracts with foreigners. Today, the amounts paid may be smaller, but the corruption extends to every level of the Government -- from the heads of foundations who import goods and hand out contracts to the traffic police and garbage collectors.
"If you want a form signed, a visa stamped, a court case decided, a piece of furniture cleared through customs, someone has to be paid," said one diplomat with longer experience in Iran. "In the Shah's time, it was only the top echelon. Now everyone has to be paid."
Ayatollah Khomeini built his revolution on promises to lift Iran's "oppressed" out of grinding poverty. And when Mehdi Bazargan was named his first Prime Minister in 1979, he was so self-effacing that he refused to use the Government's chauffeur-driven Mercedes, preferring his Iranian-made Peykan.
But in an interview with the German newspaper Frankfurter Rundschau just before his death last January, Mr. Bazargan revealed a sense of betrayal. "The scale of corruption is breathtaking," he said. Asserting that the Government enjoys the support of not even 5 percent of the people, he still asked, "Who would take over this Government? The painful question is this: Do we want another Afghanistan?"
 
Politics
Leaders Jockeying For Succession
 President Rafsanjani has more than two years left before he steps down, but as his dream of economic reform has failed miserably, his political standing has steadily declined.
In an interview with ABC News two weeks ago, Mr. Rafsanjani asserted that the United States missed a chance to improve relations when it canceled a $1 billion deal with an American oil company in April, and said that he opposed the decision by Parliament to ban satellite dishes.
But such politically sensitive statements would have portrayed Mr. Rafsanjani as soft on the United States and Western culture, and when Iranian television broadcast the interview, they both were deleted.
Mr. Rafsanjani has said he has no intention of trying to amend the Constitution to allow himself to run for a third term in 1997, and the talk of Teheran these days is about who will replace him.
One long-shot candidate is Gholam Hussein Karbaschi, Teheran's Mayor, who was trained as a cleric but wears layman's clothes. In six years as Mayor, he has bulldozed apartment and office buildings constructed without city approval, removed revolutionary graffiti from walls, planted thousands of trees and opened more than 100 new parks -- all in the name of transforming Teheran into a city that works.
To pay for this, Mr. Karbaschi, who is 42, raised taxes and extorted huge sums of money from shopkeepers and traders. If a shopkeeper refused to pay up, he dug up his driveway and planted a tree; when traffic in Teheran paralyzed the city and destroyed the air, he banned all traffic -- except by motorists who paid the city a hefty fee; when some small factories refused to move out of the city, he cut off their water supply.
This sort of behavior has made Mr. Karbaschi,, the most loved and the most reviled man in Teheran.
"Great people in history are like that," he said in an interview.
But even Mr. Karbaschi's powers are limited. He was unable to stop a move by the Revolutionary Guards last year to fence off the 14th, 15th and 16th holes of the only private golf course in Teheran. An official building went up quickly; it was called a mosque and now it cannot be torn down. There are plans to use the 11th and 12th holes for a hotel.
"The work of the disciplinary forces is much more important than golf," Mr. Karbaschi said. "Maybe we can build a quieter place for the golfers."
Asked whether he would run for higher office, Mr. Karbaschi said: "This is not the United States where everyone tries to be President. Here there are no advantages to being President, just headaches."
The front- runner for President, at the moment at least, is Ali Akbar Natiq-Noori, the speaker of Parliament, the position Mr. Rafsanjani himself held before running for President the first time in 1987.
Mr. Natiq-Noori is a hojatolislam, one rank lower than an ayatollah. But unlike most clerics in Iran, he wears well-tailored robes, looks women straight in the eye and smiles a lot, a plus for any politician, even in Iran.
"It's a hereditary characteristic," Mr. Natiq-Noori explained in an interview. "My father smiled a lot. But the real factor that gives me a very pleasant character is that I'm a sportsman. Why just today, I got up at 4 A.M. to climb mountains for two hours."
Mr. Natiq-Noori is an expert horseman as well. He was shown on Iranian television two weeks ago riding with tribesmen during a visit to Luristan province, which is the Iranian equivalent of kissing babies in an American campaign.
A close associate of Ayatollah Khamenei, the Iranian spiritual leader, Mr. Natiq-Noori is particularly interested in explaining that Iran has been misunderstood in the West. His description of the status of the author Salman Rushdie captures the complexity of decision-making in Iran today.
In a religious decree before his death, Ayatollah Khomeini ordered the assassination of Mr. Rushdie, author of "The Satanic Verses," which the Iranian leader considered blasphemous.
Mr. Natiq-Noori repeated the Government's official position that it has no intention of assassinating Mr. Rushdie, but that it cannot rescind a religious decree. "We will never undertake the responsibility of killing him now," he said. "It's a religious verdict, not a political verdict."
In recent weeks, the European Union has tried to persuade Iran's Government to pledge in writing not to send death squads to kill Mr. Rushdie, to renounce terrorism in all forms and to confirming that its relations with other countries are based on international law. Iran has yet to do so.
Asked whether or not Mr. Rushdie should die, Mr. Natiq-Noori replied, "If he were to die by himself that would be a good solution."

HEADLINE: Hospital Research Falling Victim to Lean Budgets

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
Biomedical research, long considered a cornerstone of American medicine, threatens to become a silent casualty of the reorganization of the country's health care system, caught between the nation's relentless search for cheaper medical care and budget-cutting fervor among politicians.
American research has produced myriad discoveries -- from new treatments for strokes to drugs for premature babies with damaged lungs. But in today's lean times, nobody seems able or willing to pay for it: not legislators intent on balancing budgets; not hospitals whose revenues are shrinking in an age of managed care; not the new breed of for-profit health maintenance organizations that will pay hospitals to treat their clients, but not a penny more. 
 Most research takes place at medical schools and hospitals, where it is paid for by a crazy quilt of sources. Billions of dollars each year from the National Institutes of Health are supplemented by millions more from medical schools, hospitals, insurers, corporations and foundations. And today, all these sources are declining.
"What is happening now is a nightmare," said Dr. Herbert Pardes, dean of Columbia University's medical school. "Every funding stream we have used to pay for research is being hacked apart."
The drying up of research money will hit particularly hard in New York City, with its half-dozen huge medical centers, each chock-full of laboratories. Each plays host to an army of research physicians and other scientists who received more than $600 million from the National Institutes of Health last year.
In the corridors of New York's medical centers, the signs of trouble are everywhere: longtime researchers quitting their labs to enter private practice, discouraged young doctors unable to find research money or jobs, prestigious medical schools unable to afford to hire the researchers that they welcomed just three years ago. More and more, the hospitals are requiring the researchers who are also physicians to pay their own way, seeing patients in clinics part time to bring in money.
Health economists say the repercussions will be felt outside the lab as well, as technicians are dismissed from shrinking projects, successful scientists move out of state and the city's medical centers become unable to pay their bills. Part of each researcher's grant goes to the medical center to subsidize the more mundane aspects of maintaining its infrastructure, like covering heating bills and paying janitors.
A 1993 report by the New York Academy of Medicine estimated that more than 32,000 jobs in New York City were related to biomedical research, and many experts had predicted that growth in this industry would help New York out of the economic doldrums. "Research was expected to be one of the engines for long-term job growth in this area," said Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, an industry group.
 
'Being Squeezed From All Sides'
 In 25 years as a scientist at Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons, Dr. Eric Hall has seen research money ebb and flow, but this year he has watched his financing vanish as if carried out on a riptide.
With the National Institutes of Health financing a smaller percentage of applications than ever before, he lost two longstanding Federal grants, together worth more than a million dollars a year. Columbia's medical school, which used to support researchers through such hard times, is tightfisted these days, since its hospital, Columbia-Presbyterian, could well lose more than $30 million in payments from Medicaid and Medicare. And Dr. Hall's department, radiation oncology, is not likely to bail him out either, with revenues threatened by managed care.
As a result, Dr. Hall's respected Center for Radiological Research, which had a staff of 45 just a few years ago, is down to 30 and "shrinking fast." The scientists who are left, he said, spend much of their time searching for grant money.
"We are being squeezed from all sides," said Dr. Hall, the director of the center, which studies the effects of radon exposure and radiation treatments for cancer. "It's not always been beer and skittles. There have been times in the past where we've lost a big grant and had to retool. But this is a much longer and leaner dry period than ever before."
The National Institutes of Health -- the single largest source of research money in the country -- is able to pay for only 25 percent of the research proposals it receives, down from more than 33 percent seven years ago. And proposals in Congress would cut its $11.3 billion budget up to 10 percent. Although spending for medical research is among the most politically popular items for most members of Congress, the overall budget cuts for which both houses have voted will make it very difficult to stave off serious reductions for N.I.H.
For the most part, New York's hospitals and medical schools are also less able than ever before to lend their own support to research. Already financially troubled from the discounted fees they have had to accept from powerful and growing H.M.O.'s in the New York area, they are now facing multimillion-dollar cuts in the payments from Medicaid and Medicare as well.
 
Grubbing for Grants Turns Off Students
 "We see a more treacherous, riskier environment ahead, so we have become more cautious about supporting research, because we know the payoff is way down the line," said Dr. John W. Rowe, president of Mount Sinai Medical Center and the Mount Sinai School of Medicine.
Medical educators say that the research gantlet is now so arduous that promising students are turning away from science; the teachers worry that a whole generation of researchers is being lost. Dr. Veronica Catanese, a New York University researcher who is president of the American Federation of Clinical Research, says that for the last few years she has hired foreign doctors to help in her experiments, unable to coax American medical graduates into her lab.
Some young doctors say the extreme financial uncertainty of research precludes a career in science, particularly when they emerge from training $60,000 in debt.
"During your training, you're told that research is the way to go, but starting out can be very discouraging because of the funding situation," said Dr. Nancy Mills, a young cancer specialist trying to begin a research career. In the last two years, she has had to fill out grant applications that were more than 100 pages long, and is now waiting to hear if she is the 1 young scientist in 10 who will receive Federal money. And she is far luckier than most: she has received a rare interim grant from her medical center that sustains her for now.
"I like research, but I've certainly thought at times about going into private practice," she said. "I could take care of patients, make more money and not have all this worry."
Health economists say that if the medical centers place too much pressure on researchers to see patients, or offer too little support for scientific work, successful scientists could rebel and leave the state, taking thousands of dollars in grant money with them. The New York State Psychiatric Institute is facing tens of millions of dollars in state budget cuts and at least three scientists there, sensing hard times ahead, have found jobs elsewhere.
"The value of the research enterprise to New York is enormous," Dr. Pardes said. "We have research that has produced Nobel Prize winners in droves, great medicine for patients, jobs and various products from drugs to biomedical devices that are an economic force in this country."
 
Advances in Science Slice the Pie Thinner
 A crisis in biomedical research has been building for almost a decade. Success rates for grant proposals submitted to the National Institutes of Health have fallen steadily for the last seven years. In fields like cancer research, they are below 20 percent, from a high of about 35 percent in 1987.
Although the health institutes' budget, adjusted for inflation, has grown slightly over the last decade, advances in genetics and molecular biology have opened up vast new areas of research. So the N.I.H. pie has been overwhelmed by a boom in the number of medical researchers and proposals.
Today, a new proposal for cancer research has about a 13 percent chance of being financed, and even a research grant previously made by the institutes has only about a 40 percent chance of being renewed.
"Already more than half the projects that are up and running are unable to continue," said Dr. Wendy Baldwin, deputy director of extramural research at the health institutes. "This is an era of scientific opportunity -- we have a lot of leads to follow -- but there hasn't been the financial expansion to match that."
Dr. Baldwin added that research involving patients -- the type in which hospitals excel -- is particularly hard to have approved with today's budget constraints, since clinical trials are very expensive and involve very long commitments of money.
New York's medical centers have previously had mutually fruitful relationships with their laboratories. They receive tens of millions of dollars from Medicare, the Federal insurance program for the elderly, to support their education and research efforts, and typically plow back 5 to 10 percent of revenues from all patient care to pay for research. But that will change when income falls.
 
A Physician's Salary Means Patients' Fees
 Mount Sinai used $10 million that it made from patient care to pay for a variety of research last year, from supporting young researchers to paying the salaries of scientists in between Federal grants.
Dr. Robert Mellins, head of the pediatric pulmonary division at Columbia-Presbyterian, said that as H.M.O.'s steamrollered into New York in the last year, the department's income dropped 25 percent. "It's become very hard to give people interested in academic careers the support they need," he said. As a result, he will hire three new doctors for advanced training in pulmonary medicine and research next year, instead of the usual six.
Hospitals today are far less likely than before to pay doctors a physician's salary for research. Instead, they expect their physicians to "earn" their paychecks from other pursuits, generally a combination of money from research grants or billings from patient care.
Many young researchers say they now see so many patients that it is a struggle to complete experiments.
"It's a vicious cycle," said Dr. Daniel Bloomfield, a cardiologist who is about to finish his training and is interested in a research career. "You spend more time seeing patients, and your research lags and then it's harder to establish yourself and you can't get grants. But the hospital can't afford to have anyone around who doesn't raise money."
Columbia-Presbyterian asked Dr. John T. Krolewski, a pathologist whose main pursuit is cancer research, to run one of its blood-testing labs in exchange for paying part of his salary. The arrangement has been a lifesaver for Dr. Krolewski, since his three-year N.I.H. grant was not renewed in April.
"People are semihysterical," he said. "Every day, you write grants and talk to people about what other grants you can apply for."
"Being a biomedical scientist is not a very viable career at the moment," he said. "But it could be worse. I still have it easier than my wife, who's a violinist."

HEADLINE: Family Decay Global, Study Says

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN 

 BODY:
Around the world, in rich and poor countries alike, the structure of family life is undergoing profound changes, a new analysis of research from numerous countries has concluded.
"The idea that the family is a stable and cohesive unit in which father serves as economic provider and mother serves as emotional care giver is a myth," said Judith Bruce, an author of the study. "The reality is that trends like unwed motherhood, rising divorce rates, smaller households and the feminization of poverty are not unique to America, but are occurring worldwide." 
 The report, "Families in Focus," was issued today by the Population Council, an international nonprofit group based in New York that studies reproductive health. It analyzed a variety of existing demographic and household studies from dozens of countries worldwide.
These are among the major findings:
*Whether because of abandonment, separation, divorce or death of a spouse, marriages are dissolving with increasing frequency. In many developed countries, divorce rates doubled between 1970 and 1990, and in less developed countries, about a quarter of first marriages end by the time women are in their 40's.
*Parents in their prime working years face growing burdens caring for children, who need to be supported through more years of education, and for their own parents, who are living longer into old age.
*Unwed motherhood is increasingly common virtually everywhere, reaching as many as a third of all births in Northern Europe, for example.
*Children in single-parent households -- usually families with only a mother present -- are much more likely to be poor than those who live with two parents, largely because of the loss of support from the absent fathers.
*Even in households where fathers are present, mothers are carrying increasing economic responsibility for children.
The idea that families are changing in similar ways, even in very different cultures, should bring about new thinking on social policy, experts say, and in particular on the role government should play in supporting families.
"Most of the changes in the family that we think are home-grown are occurring everywhere," said Frank Furstenberg, a sociology professor at the University of Pennsylvania, a specialist in family demographics. "The mainspring of the worldwide change probably has to do with the economic status of women and changes in the gender-based division of labor."
Douglas Besharov, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, agrees that working woman are the moving force behind many of the changes in the family.
"We are dealing here with the liberation of women," he said. "In the post-industrial age, when the earning power of men and women becomes quite equal, that creates a very different relationship between men and women and makes it easier for women to leave unhappy relationships."
The Population Council report says women tend to work longer hours than men, at home and on the job. In studies of 17 less developed countries, women's work hours exceeded men's by 30 percent. Data from 12 industrialized countries found that formally employed women worked about 20 percent longer hours than employed men.
Women's economic contributions also are becoming increasingly important. In Ghana, the report said, a third of households with children are maintained primarily by women. In the Philippines, women contribute about a third of households' cash income, but 55 percent of household support if the economic value of the women's activities at home, like gathering wood or growing food, is included.
In the United States, a Louis Harris survey released earlier this month found that nearly half of employed married women contribute half or more of their family's income.
"In most parts of the world, women have always been important providers," Ms. Bruce said. But now, she added, "the form of their providing is more easily measurable, and more visible."
While the reason for entering the work force may vary from country to country, women everywhere are finding that to give their children an adequate life they must earn more money, she said.
"In traditional Bangladesh, it may be because the husband was much older, and died while the children were still young," she said. "In sub-Saharan Africa, a woman might have a baby premaritally and have no strong connection with the father, or she might have a husband who goes on to another polygamous marriage and supports the children of that union.
"In Asia the husband may have migrated for better economic opportunities and stopped sending money after a year or two. And everywhere, parents are finding that there are fewer jobs that pay enough to support a family."
Even among rural people in less developed countries, she said, the need for a cash income is becoming more pressing.
"Parents all over the world have an increasing awareness that their children will need literacy and numeracy," Ms. Bruce said. "That means that instead of having their 6-year-old working with them in the fields, they have to pay for school fees, uniforms, transportation and supplies. And while they can farm for food, they can't farm for school fees."
The fact that many developing countries have cut their spending on public education as part of their debt reduction plans creates further pressure on families, she said.
One apparent exception to the general trends is Japan, where single-parent households and unwed motherhood have remained relatively rare.
The Population Council report, written by Ms. Bruce, Cynthia B. Lloyd and Ann Leonard, found that while most countries have extensive data on women as mothers, there has been little research on men as fathers. But studies of parent-child interactions found no society in which fathers provided as much child care as mothers, and very few in which fathers had regular, close relationships with their young children.
And although fathers' income usually exceeds mothers' income, women usually contribute a larger proportion of their income to their household, while men keep more for their personal use.
Collecting child support is also difficult. The report says that among divorced fathers, three-quarters in Japan, almost two-thirds in Argentina, half in Malaysia and two-fifths in the United States do not pay child support.
The report emphasizes a need for new policies and programs to strengthen the father-child link -- for example by allowing new fathers time off from their jobs, encouraging fathers to become involved in prenatal classes and familiarizing school-age boys with the demands of child care.
"I think the conservative fear may be that all human beings are selfish at their core and that the pull of the market is so strong that women are going to become more like men, and invest less in their children," Professor Furstenberg said.
"But I think it's possible that we're moving into a world where men will behave more like women with regard to their children," he said. "The underlying question for the 21st century is how to create a system that allows all parents to invest in their children, both emotionally and financially."

HEADLINE: Survey Indicates Hiring to Slow in Summer

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The pace of new hiring should slacken in the summer, while remaining generally strong, according to a new survey.
The survey, to be released today by Manpower Inc. of Milwaukee, found that 28 percent of the 15,000 companies polled in its quarterly survey said they planned to increase hiring in the July-to-August quarter; 7 percent said that they expected to decrease their payrolls. 
 The net total of 21 percent that plan to increase hiring is down from 22 percent in the same quarter last year and 23 percent for the previous three months.
"While a note of caution is discernible in the results, confirming other indications of a pause in economic growth, opportunities will be there for job seekers this summer," Mitchell S. Fromstein, Manpower's chief executive, said.
The survey of public and private employers found that 62 percent planned no changes in hiring and 3 percent were uncertain of their plans. No margin of error was given for the survey.
The expected decline in the rate of hiring in the summer underlines other data that show the United States economy is slowing and the job market weakening.

Don't Sell City Short, Newark's Entrepreneurs Say

BYLINE: By Evelyn Nieves 

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
"UGLY day for the beach," Keith Williams said cheerfully. He scanned the clouds rolling over Broad Street and chuckled in a "Ha-ha, suckers!" way.
He was selling folding umbrellas for $5 on an afternoon they were created for. Business was great. "I guess all those people who spent hours on the highway wasted their time," he went on, with that chuckle again. 
 If it's Memorial Day, then Keith Williams is on Newark's main drag, selling something. Likewise on the Fourth of July and Labor Day. At 33, he can't remember the last time he walked on sand. ("When I was a kid?") And he knows that in a city where many residents can't afford to escape, there are plenty of people like him.
Mr. Williams, a security guard for an electronics business, hawks merchandise on holidays because downtown Newark doesn't empty out, it gets busy. He can make money. He also likes the atmosphere, the bustle. "You see the kids waving to me?" he said. "This is a nice city. Don't believe all you hear."
HE is a Newark native, a proud son. Unfortunately, the bad news in New Jersey's largest, most-maligned city keeps piling up. Things can't get much worse now that the Federal Bureau of Investigation has labeled Newark the most violent city in the country.
"No way!" Mr. Williams said. "We may be poor, but it's not that bad here."
But Newark's crime rate was the worst among 200 cities ranked in the F.B.I.'s Uniform Crime Report. Newark had more than 38 violent crimes per 1,000 residents in 1994, the report said, with the national average at 12 per 1,000 residents. The city had 96 murders, 207 rapes, 5,775 robberies and 4,331 aggravated assaults among 271,025 residents. That was fewer reported rapes and the same number of murders as the year before, but hundreds more aggravated assaults.
Mayor Sharpe James, predictably, disputes the figures. He says the city actually has 325,000 residents, which gives it a rate of 32 violent crimes per 1,000 (which would make it the fifth worst). He also contends that Newark does a better job than other cities of reporting incidents that drive up the crime rate. But no one outside Newark has lifted an eyebrow. This, after all, is the city that made headlines a few years ago for having the worst car-theft rate in the country.
Add to that its other problems. The state has been charging the school system with gross mismanagement for years and is on the verge of taking it over. The Mayor is under investigation by the United States Attorney for allegedly misusing campaign funds and taking bribes, the police director is under investigation for holding a fund-raising party and, a couple of months ago, a former member and an active member of the City Council were convicted of taking bribes. The state's big-wig politicians don't even bother to come courting anymore.
But for those who know Newark from the inside, this newest label is hard to take. The commuters who rush in and out on weekdays have no doubt had their worst fears confirmed. But unless you count the convicted politicians, crime here doesn't seem worse than in many other places.
There are obvious bright spots. The strip of stores in the Muslim shopping district keeps getting bigger, the Ironbound neighborhood remains stable, and even some of the poorer neighborhoods look more forlorn than forbidding.
"I get really tired of people getting down on Newark," said Herb Williams, downtown shopping for sneakers for his 12-year-old son (and no relation to Keith Williams). "It's nothing to brag about, but decent people live here."
YES, it is a poor city. It took forever for a supermarket to open. There are blighted neighborhoods. Unemployment hovers around 25 percent.
"I blame the politicians for throwing this city away," Herb Williams said. "The schools are bad, there are no jobs, so what do you expect kids to do but get in trouble?"
Keith Williams, sharing a corner with a man who kept yelling "Sheesh kebabs!" and another selling short sets for $10, had a bright idea. "Tourism," he said. "Tell people to come on holidays."
He made sense. The commuters who clog the streets on business days are nowhere around, so the streets breathe. People seem relaxed.
But since Macy's folded up shop three years ago, Woolworth's is the biggest game downtown, followed, arguably, by Modell's.
"If there were bigger stores, there would be more people, but big stores won't come," Mr. Williams said. "They underestimate people in Newark."
He had been planning to sell American flags for Memorial Day, but he opted for the practical. It seemed to work, but who knows? He may have underestimated his buying public. Before the rains came, an elderly woman came up to him. "Don't you got any flags?" she snapped.

Both Japan and U.S. Get Some Support in Dispute on Trade

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: GENEVA, May 29

 BODY:
Japan picked up support in the World Trade Organization today for its contention that Washington's trade sanctions against it violated the rules of the organization.
But trade diplomats said there was also support for the American counterclaim that Japanese regulations and the sales practices of Japanese car makers made it difficult for foreign manufacturers to compete on equal terms in the Japanese market. 
 The two nations indicated today that they were still far apart on how and when to move toward resolving the dispute over American demands that Japan open its market for American cars and automotive parts. Two weeks ago, Washington declared it would impose 100 percent tariffs on imported Japanese luxury cars unless the two sides could reach agreement by June 28.
Today, the Japanese rejected an American proposal for negotiations in Washington late next month, urging instead that negotiations be held sooner, preferably in Geneva, where the World Trade Organization is based.
At a meeting today of the trade organization's Council on Trade in Goods, the European Union's Ambassador, Jean-Pierre Leng, said that even an advance announcement of sanctions in a dispute could not be accepted under the organization's rules if it affected trade.
Trade officials said envoys from Australia, India and Indonesia also condemned "unilateral actions" -- a reference to the American imposition of the tariffs.
Mr. Leng said that while the European Union disapproved of the methods used by the United States to try to resolve the dispute, "we approve of the aim in view." Despite some changes, he said, Japan had not yet done enough to change its domestic practices.
The council's session was the first time the dispute, widely seen as a major test of the big powers' readiness to work through the new rules, had come before a W.T.O. gathering.
"If they can bully the Japanese and still claim they are going through the W.T.O., how much easier will it be for them to lean on us?" an Asian trade diplomat asked.
But Andrew Stoler, deputy chief of the United States mission to the W.T.O., told the council that since the sanctions had not yet gone into effect, there was no violation of the group's rules. Imposition of the tariffs "can be avoided if our two Governments can reach a mutually satisfactory solution of the matter," he said, according to an official text.
On Friday, Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, proposed that the two countries hold talks in Washington on June 20 and 21. Hisashi Hosokawa, the Director General of the Japanese Government's International Trade Policy Bureau, said after the council meeting today that Japan could not accept Mr. Kantor's dates since they fell outside the timetable of the trade organization's dispute-settlement process. Japan began that process on May 17 by asking the United States for urgent consultations on the legality of sanctions.
Mr. Kantor refused to accept urgent treatment of the dispute while sanctions were pending. Under the normal W.T.O. procedure, consultations would begin by June 15.

Subic Bay Rises as an Industrial Hotbed

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN 

DATELINE: SUBIC BAY, the Philippines

 BODY:
When the United States left its largest military base in Asia in 1992 -- with the pointed encouragement of the Philippine Government -- some here thought the future of the area was departing, too.
With the memory still fresh of the looting that followed the American abandonment in 1991 of nearby Clark Air Base, there seemed little hope that much would be made of Subic Bay Naval Station. A total of 42,000 Filipinos lost their jobs at the base with the American departure, and the region's surrounding economy was deprived of hundreds of millions of dollars in spending by American sailors and marines. 
 But Richard J. Gordon, the mayor of the neighboring town of Olongapo, was determined to make use of the substantial resources left behind: thousands of acres of dockyards, housing, an airfield, beaches and jungle. He wanted to create a zone for economic growth and development that could serve as a model for the rest of the country.
And, apparently, he has succeeded. Today, investors are pouring into Subic Bay, lured by the infrastructure of roads, buildings and other facilities left behind by the Americans; by the skilled English-speaking work force and by the absence of duties. Taxes, while not the lowest in Southeast Asia, are a flat 5 percent of gross revenues. So far, nearly 19,000 jobs have been created in the free-trade zone that Mr. Gordon oversees as chairman of the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority.
Duty- or trade-free zones exist elsewhere in Asia, most commonly in China, where the country's overall economy is substantially regulated. Some of the Chinese zones, like the one in Shenzhen across the border from Hong Kong, have proved wildly successful locales for foreign and domestic investment, while the zone in Xiamen in Fujian province has floundered.
Vietnam, too, has created several economic zones, including an export-processing zone in the north, but has not yet attracted much foreign investment. Sri Lanka, by contrast, has seen its export-processing zone near the airport in Colombo thrive with substantial investment from Asian garment manufacturers.
But, as Annabel Betz, an economist at Baring Securities (Hong Kong) Ltd., noted, "Nothing is as high-profile as Subic."
The Federal Express Corporation will begin using Subic as its Asian hub in July, and the Enron Corporation, an American energy company, has built a power plant here that sells electricity to Manila. The Coastal Corporation has chosen Subic as an Asian transshipment point and has taken a 35-year lease on the oil storage tanks here.
Asian companies, though, are making up the bulk of investors here, from Sheng Guard Company Ltd., a small Taiwan cookware company, to Acer, Taiwan's largest manufacturer of computers. A Malaysian hotel group has established a hotel and casino complex and a young Australian has started a bungee-jumping business from an old naval crane.
Wong Wen Chieh oversees the manufacture of telephones for Thomson Audio Philippines, a division of the French multinational Thomson S.A. "We started operations in November," he said. "Initially we had 150 people, now we have 640. We hope to get up to 3,000."
Mr. Wong said Thomson was drawn by the supply of highly trained technicians and engineers in the Philippines but came with a memory of the country's past instability. Skepticism was quickly overcome, though, he said, and "now, we're talking about phase 2, to build a new high-end facility here."
One measure of the economic zone's appeal is the speed with which tenants gobbled up space in its first of three light industrial parks.
"We opened to the public last October," said Cheng Hsien-jung, president of the local development office that manages the three parks. "By the end of March we were fullly booked, 52 companies. The first few investors we gave some incentives, but after that no.
"I would say there's no comparison with any other industrial park in Asia," added Mr. Cheng, a Taiwanese investment banker. "Here there is a first-quality airport, a first-quality port. You have roads, power. In mainland China, you have to start from scratch. Here you have everything."
Ultimately, Mr. Cheng said, $181 million in investments should pour into the park, creating an estimated 20,000 jobs on space that American servicemen once used as a skeet-shooting range.
One of the largest investors here is Federal Express, which will use Subic's airfield at Cubi Point as its Asian hub beginning in July.
"Subic offers us a number of things," said Cliff Deeds, the managing director for market development and communications. "Geographically, it's centrally located within Asia, which allows us to hook up North America to our Asia network. It has a substantial infrastructure. It has not only a deep water bay, it has 24-hour airport capability. It has its own power generator plant, which insures an uninterrupted power supply. It has a free-trade zone. The operating costs there are competitive with other ports in the region."
Subic also draws local start-ups attracted by the benefits or simply fleeing the crime and poor business conditions prevalent elsewhere in the country. "We haven't had a mugging, certainly no rapes, no shootings," said Leo H. Larkin, who opened a leather-goods factory with his wife, Leila. "We just don't have that here.
"We were experiencing 4-, 6-, 8-hour brownouts in Manila," he added. "We decided this was the place -- a good source of labor, power, everything. We came with 38 people and in 19 months we have 276 people."
Mr. Gordon, the Mayor of Olongapo, is neither shy about his accomplishments nor his ambitions. He was appointed by the Philippine President, Fidel V. Ramos, to a six-year term as chairman of the Subic authority. But Mr. Gordon, a member of an opposition party, has never denied his intention to use Subic's success as a platform for a higher political office, even a run for the presidency.
In an office filled with the products of Subic's factories, Mr. Gordon spoke of his plans for Subic Bay. "Basically, what people want in terms of this country is speed," he said. "I'm going to improve the ports, build a new terminal at the airport and we're going to build a new road to Manila.
"There are a lot of competitive countries in Asia," he said. "But in a fair contest, the Philippines will beat anyone."

HEADLINE: Drug Prices Overstated, G.A.O. Says

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
The Labor Department overstated inflation rates in prescription drugs in some parts of the market by 23 percent to 36 percent from 1984 to 1991, the General Accounting Office said in a report released today.
The G.A.O. said the Bureau of Labor Statistics had used a "market basket" of drug prices that did not give enough weight to new and recently introduced drugs during that period. Government statistics showed drug prices rising, on average, at triple the rate of general inflation during the 1980's and early 1990's. 
 But Senator William S. Cohen, Republican of Maine, who requested the G.A.O. study, said Congress should still be concerned about "high drug prices, which still represent one of the highest out-of-pocket health care costs to consumers."
Some corrective changes have already been made in the bureau's Producer Price Index, the study noted. Early last year, the Government's statisticians began more frequent and comprehensive samplings of drugs.
But the drug index still does not account for the savings or the higher costs that consumers face when they switch to lower-priced generic copies of brand-name drugs or to new higher-priced drugs, the G.A.O. said. It said the bureau disagreed with researchers' proposals for identifying low-priced generic drug substitutes.
The price index also does not reflect improved products like drugs with fewer side effects. On that point, the Government statisticians and outside researchers agreed that they lacked sufficiently refined methods to adjust the index to reflect the improvements.
Senator Cohen said that although competition has reduced prices for big employers and health maintenance organizations that can get discounts from drug makers, this has hardly helped people who have to pay for their drugs. "Tragically, it is often senior citizens and low-income families who must pay the highest prices for their drugs," he said.
Mr. Cohen, chairman of the Senate Committee on Aging, said that a new treatment for multiple sclerosis, for example, was "priced at more than $10,000 a year."
During the 1980's and early 1990's, there were loud complaints about drug prices from the elderly, who are the main buyers of drugs, and President Clinton singled out drug pricing for criticism in an unsuccessful campaign to change the nation's health care system. Most big drug companies promised to hold down price increases and keep them within overall inflation rates. And some economists attacked the Government statistics, saying they were faulty.
Stephen W. Shondelmeyer, a professor of pharmaceutical management at the University of Minnesota, said that "a number of pharmaceutical companies had slowed their price increases, although prices have rarely decreased."
"Two or three of the companies are still raising prices by 6 to 8 percent," well above the current inflation rate, he said.

HEADLINE: Steel Mini-Mills Could Bring Boon or Blood Bath

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
The American steel industry, transformed by the mini-mill movement in the 1980's, is again undergoing a wrenching change.
This time two forces are at work. A second generation of mini-mills -- small, highly efficient factories that use scrap instead of iron ore -- is springing up to produce sheet steel, one of the last bastions of traditional steelmaking. And companies of all sizes are experimenting with new technologies to simplify the manufacturing process. 
 The result is likely to be good news for consumers as cheaper steel reins in price increases on products from automobiles to home appliances. The American trade balance should benefit, too, as imports become less competitive.
But the industry faces a potential blood bath. The rush of competition might force not only the shutdown of aging mills but also threaten some of the more thinly capitalized new entrants.
"Some of these guys will be coming in with limited product lines and a raw materials shortage," said Richard Wardrop, president of AK Steel, a traditional company. "Within a few years, some of them are going belly up."
The mini-mills, pioneered by the Nucor Corporation of Charlotte, N.C., drove established companies like the USX Corporation's subsidiary, U.S. Steel, and Bethlehem Steel mostly out of the business of making construction bars and beams in the 1980's.
Then, in 1989, Nucor burst into sheet steel with a new mill in Crawfordsville, Ind. The company, which has grown into America's fourth-biggest steel producer, has since expanded production at that site, built a second sheet steel mill and announced plans for a third.
Its success has prompted a wave of imitators. Eight companies or groups, including start-ups like Steel Dynamics and established giants like LTV, British Steel and BHP of Australia, have announced plans for sheet steel mini-mills in the South and Midwest. Industry analysts say most of the new mills will be nonunion, allowing them to hire cheaper labor and keep production costs low.
As new competitors enter the market, some mini-mills are experimenting with steelmaking processes that could revolutionize the $30 billion American steel industry. Fearing a shortage of high-quality scrap, they are developing substitutes made from iron ore, but without the hugely expensive blast furnaces, coke ovens and treatment furnaces used at traditional mills.
Nucor, for example, has built a pilot plant in Trinidad to convert iron ore, which is iron oxide, into iron carbide. The iron carbide can be added to an electric furnace as a substitute for scrap. Once the first plant -- designed to produce 1,200 tons of iron carbide a day -- is in operation, Nucor plans to build four more of equal size to supply its own plants and to sell to other companies.
The company has also formed a venture with U.S. Steel and Praxair Inc. to convert the iron carbide directly into steel, saving large amounts of energy and bypassing intermediate steps. F. Kenneth Iverson, the chairman of Nucor, estimates the process could cut costs by $30 to $50 a ton for a product that sells for $270 a ton in economic downturns.
Other companies are experimenting with casting steel directly from liquid steel into thin strips, which would eliminate the need for the huge rolling machines that squeeze and elongate slabs of steel into coils of thin sheet steel.
Steel analysts say all the recent activity is building to an inevitable outcome: overproduction, leading to an industry shakeout. If all the new mills announced are built, they would add at least 15 million tons of steel by the year 2000 to a market that consumes about 60 million tons of sheet steel a year in good times, but which shrinks to about 50 million tons in downturns.
"It seems as though a light bulb turned on over everybody's head at once," said Keith E. Busse, president of Steel Dynamics Inc. in Butler, Ind., which is set to start operation later this year. He said supply is likely to overwhelm demand in a few years, with the result that some projects would be scrapped and some older mills closed.
Mr. Busse was the manager of Nucor's Crawfordsville plant during its start-up. The success of that operation gave him the standing to raise money for a mill of his own.
According to Michael Gambardella, an analyst with J. P. Morgan, the Crawfordsville plant "redefined" the sheet steel business, cutting the capital costs of building and equipping a mill by 85 percent, to $250 a ton of annual production from $1,700 a ton in a traditional mill.
The end of this century could be a rerun of the late 1970's and the 1980's, when competition from mini-mills and imports forced the traditional steelmakers to close aging mills with a capacity to make 65 million tons of steel, or 35 percent of total American capacity. Employment in the industry had plummeted to 171,000 last year from 512,000 in 1980.
The rush to build more sheet steel mills has already discouraged some companies from taking the plunge. A year ago, officials of Birmingham Steel were talking eagerly about expanding into sheet steel to broaden their existing bar and wire businesses. Now Birmingham says it will delay making any investment until the situation clears.
"We read about something like 18 new mills in the United States and decided to stay in long products," James A. Todd Jr., Birmingham's chairman, said in a recent meeting with analysts.
But not all the news is bleak for American producers, who have made a remarkable comeback in the last decade. That is because the new low-cost mills, aided by the weak dollar, should help displace imports. Peter F. Marcus, a metals analyst at Paine Webber Inc., estimated that the price of a metric ton (about 2,200 pounds) of a basic grade of steel is about $500 in Germany and $600 in Japan, compared with $400 in the United States. He estimated that imports would drop to 24 million short tons (of 2,000 pounds) this year and to 17 million tons by 1997 from 30 million last year.
The mini-mills, however, are not likely to escape unscathed. As Nucor continues to expand from a base of economic strength, analysts say, some thinly financed mini-mills might be squeezed between low prices and higher raw materials costs.
"I use 10 percent scrap; the mini-mills use 100 percent scrap," said Paul J. Wilhelm, president of the U.S. Steel Group of USX. "Who is going to be more affected by the price of scrap, which looks like it is going to stay very high?"
Others point out that steel made from scrap tends to have more impurities than sheet made from iron ore. They say that Nucor has not yet demonstrated that it can supply the big markets in automobiles and appliances, which demand the highest quality steels with an unmarred surface.
But the dollar could grow stronger and the mini-mills could hone their skills to produce the kind of sheet steel suitable for the hood of a luxury car. If demand slackens, the integrated mills would be stuck with their high fixed costs while the variable costs of the mini-mills, notably scrap, would tend to decline.
Mr. Iverson of Nucor, who made his reputation and built a $3 billion company on taking markets away from traditional integrated steelmakers, sees them declining further. "There is going to be more shrinkage," he said. "There are still inefficient facilities left."

HEADLINE: Primark to Buy VNU Unit In Financial Information

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: HAARLEM, the Netherlands, May 29

 BODY:
The Dutch media company VNU N.V. said today that it would withdraw from the United States financial data business by selling the financial information company Disclosure to the Primark Corporation for $200 million.
The sale includes VNU's entire financial information services division. The Dutch company will retain its American trade magazines and nonfinancial data bases. 
 The transaction "means we're pulling out of the financial data business," said Lout Schoelvinck, a VNU director.
Primark will become owner of Institutional Brokers Estimate System Inc. and get a 50 percent stake in Worldscope/Disclosure International Partners.
Primark, based in Waltham, Mass., is already active in the financial information business with its Datastream and Vestek units. Data-stream offers on-line historical economic and financial information in 40 countries worldwide.
"Disclosure is a profitable company, but when you look at the entire field, it only plays a small role, next to bigger players like Reuters, Bloomberg and Datastream," Mr. Schoelvinck said.
"If VNU wants to be a serious player in financial data, it means substantial investments are needed," he said. "We have chosen not to do this, also because we were able to get a nice price for Disclosure."
Disclosure, which is based in Bethesda, Md., has annual sales of about $88 million and employs about 950 people. VNU added I.B.E.S. to the Disclosure group last June, when it bought the earnings estimates service from Citicorp.
The sale will result in a "significant" one-time gain, VNU said. Those proceeds, estimated by analysts at about $100 million, will be used to expand other United States publishing activities concentrated on nonfinancial services.
The three other United States divisions of VNU are VNU Marketing Information Services, Bill Communications and BPI Communications. BPI publishes leading music and film industry trade magazines. The Dutch company bought BPI last year for $220 million. VNU bought Bill Communications, which publishes 11 magazines, last October.
In the Netherlands, VNU is the largest publisher of consumer magazines. It also publishes newspapers and trade magazines and is involved in commercial television.
The Disclosure unit provides financial data to analysts, researchers and law firms. Its data base holds information on more than 11,000 listed American companies.

HEADLINE: Orders for U.S. Machine Tools Fell 42% in April

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Orders for American-built machine tools tumbled 42 percent in April from a record showing in March, but year-to-date demand remained strong and is deriving strength from healthier markets abroad, a trade group reported yesterday.
Machine tool industry orders fell to $335.05 million in April, down from a revised record total of $577.45 million in March and $413.50 million in April 1994, according to the Association for Manufacturing Technology. 
 Nonetheless, for the first four months of 1995, orders totaled $1.67 billion, 17.6 percent ahead of the $1.42 billion in the corresponding 1994 period. Export orders received through the end of April totaled $198.95 million, more than triple the $60.25 million in the period last year.
"This month's order data clearly signal that our overseas markets are recovering," said Albert W. Moore, president of the association, which is based in McLean, Va..
The overseas strength is partly a result of the lower value of the dollar, which has made a broad range of American exports more affordable to foreign buyers. Economic improvements in Europe and Asia also have generated more demand for machine tools and other manufacturing equipment.
Machine tools are used in industries ranging from consumer electronics to airplane assembly. They are an important gauge of future economic activity because they reflect projections for sales by manufacturers.
Higher orders suggest factory managers are optimistic and want to refurbish their equipment to satisfy growing demand. Lower orders suggest factory managers see little need to expand or improve their capabilities.
Orders can fluctuate sharply from month to month, making it more useful to look at a trend over several months. Still, the April decline occurred against a backdrop of growing economic weakness within the United States.
Last week, for example, unexpected sharp drops were reported in domestic factory orders for long-lasting goods and sales of existing homes, while weekly claims for unemployment compensation shot up.

HEADLINE: Virgin Air to Raise Agents' Commissions

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Virgin Atlantic Airways said last week that it would give travel agents 15 percent commissions on economy-priced flights from Boston, Milwaukee and Newark to London and on connecting flights to Athens.
The move by Virgin, the British carrier that is part of Richard Branson's Voyager Group, is good through Sept. 30 and undermines the efforts of big airlines in the United States to cap commissions. 
 On Feb. 9, Delta Air Lines said it would do away with the standard commission of 10 percent by capping payments at $50 for a domestic round-trip ticket and $25 on a one-way ticket. The other big carriers followed.
Earlier this month, Trans World Airlines moved to grab some market share from its rivals by discarding the cap on its commissions to travel agents.
Travel agencies contend that the reduced commissions may force some of them out of business. Some agencies have vowed to direct their business away from carriers imposing the caps.

HEADLINE: Democrats Hid Their Lobbyists

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Authors of the Law" (Op-Ed, May 24):
Representative George Miller takes umbrage with the way Congress is going about its business. He is upset about the involvement of industry in writing legislation and maintains this is not what the last election was all about. It is exactly what the last election was all about. 
 For 40 years, Democrats held sway in Congress and ruled consistently with their party philosophy. The "lobbyists" used to write legislation were put on the Government payroll and called Congressional staff. When individuals and corporations would not act as they would have them act, laws were passed and regulations promulgated to make the country conform to their view of the world order. Thus, in the cloistered environment of Congress, developed the concept of Truth.
Republicans, without opportunity to oppose the Democratic steamroller, sought personal gratification in the private sector. In self-defense, some were even employed to interact with the Government. They are derisively referred to by Representative Miller as "lobbyists."
Now that the Republicans exercise power, they are consistent with their party's philosophy. Congressional staff is reduced and government power de-emphasized. Private-sector expertise is sought, rather than opinions of Government bureaucrats.
The private sector is concerned with efficiency and global competition: keeping the wheels of industry turning, employing people and generating wealth for the nation. Regulations in this spirit will be forthcoming. Representative Miller, on the other hand, would regulate industry with little respect to economic impact.

HEADLINE: Don't Cut Scant Foreign Aid More

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In your May 23 report on Secretary of State Warren Christopher's statement that he was urging President Clinton to veto a House bill that cuts foreign aid, you say polls show this aid to be the least popular item in the Federal budget, and that's why Congress has targeted it for cuts. 
Polls can, of course, be used to "show" anything. If you take Jesse Helms's approach and ask people if they want to pour money down foreign ratholes, they say no. If you ask them if they want to help feed starving children in Africa, they say yes.
One issue that comes through on several polls is that Americans think over 15 percent of the Federal budget is spent on foreign aid. When they discover that the true figure is less than 1 percent and that we are the most miserly nation in the industrialized world, they may change their tune and say aid should be increased. The Republican attempt to trim the minuscule foreign aid budget even further is unconscionable.
Also unconscionable, the cuts are being made to the poorest nations. The proposals would cut aid to Africa by more than 30 percent, while the relatively well-off countries of Israel and Egypt would still get a massive $5.2 billion (far more than all 48 countries of sub-Saharan Africa combined).
What about the Republican proposal to merge the Agency for International Development into the State Department? General Accounting Office studies found no evidence that it would bring significant savings.
Furthermore, such a merger would only exacerbate the problem that has plagued A.I.D. since its inception: that of being too closely tied to United States geopolitical concerns. During the cold war, A.I.D. was infamous for supporting dictators who were United States allies.
Billions of dollars were spent shoring up some of this century's most shameful rulers: Ferdinand E. Marcos in the Philippines, Mobutu Sese Seko in Zaire, Anastasio Somoza in Nicaragua.
A.I.D., under its present director, J. Brian Atwood, is finally getting depoliticized and focusing more on community development. Merging it with the State Department, which emphasizes government-to-government ties and short-term crises, would be a step backward.
Contrary to Republican neo-isolationist views, we live in a truly global world, The fall in the Mexican peso wipes out tens of thousands of United States jobs. Destruction of the rain forest in Brazil affects the air we breathe. The AIDS epidemic does not respect borders.
Turning our backs on our neighbors through this penurious costcutting imperils our own future as well. If the Republican bill passes, President Clinton should take Warren Christopher's advice and veto it.

HEADLINE: BBC's World Service: A Cultural Lifeline To Educated People

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES 

DATELINE: CAIRO

 BODY:
The streets in Algiers had cleared two hours before the nightly curfew. The guests at the El Djazair Hotel, who would not go out until morning, settled into their rooms, and many -- out of either boredom or devotion -- switched on their short-wave radios to the BBC World Service. Minutes after an unsettling ripple of automatic fire echoed from one of the side streets, the service began to broadcast William Shakespeare's poem "Venus and Adonis."
Even as the sun with purple-color'd face
Had ta'en his last leave of the weeping morn,
Rose-cheek'd Adonis hied him to the chase;
Hunting he lov'd, but love he laugh'd to scorn. . . . 
 For many people, the World Service is a lifeline, especially in remote parts of the world, offering a variety of cultural programming that ranges from last year's three-month series of Shakespeare plays to programs on Homer or 20th-century books, to "Composer of the Month," a regular feature on the life and work of such artists as Emmanuel Chabrier and Frederick Delius. There are short-story readings and documentary series, including one that studied the daily lives of ancient Egyptian villagers. One special program celebrated the 300th birthday of Voltaire, who called liberty of thought "the life of the soul."
Every month the World Service broadcasts short stories written by listeners from around the world. There is an annual play-writing competition, which last year drew 3,000 aspiring writers living outside the British Isles, as well as a program called "Poems by Post," where listeners can write in to request their favorite pieces of poetry.
"Culture can inform all sorts of debates, certainly political debates," said Alastair Lack, the head of English programs at the British Broadcasting Corporation, in a telephone interview from London. "Who can understand Bosnia unless you understand the history and culture of that area? You can't understand it just by looking at a daily news bulletin. When you dig beneath the surface of how people live, you find that people are an amalgam of all sorts of memories, desires, interests, all of which go into the making of culture."
Among the World Service's listeners are government officials, intellectuals, artists, students, diplomats and foreign correspondents in the Middle East, Asia, Africa and Latin America. The BBC says it has an audience of 37 million for the English-language service and 130 million over all. (The service is broadcast in 41 languages.) The typical World Service listener is also someone who has gone out of his or her way to find it. (In the United States, it can be found at 7325 KHz on a shortwave or worldband radio.)
"He or she is usually of an inquiring mind and has an interest in a society beyond his or her own, and obviously has a certain level of education," Mr. Lack said. "When you think of the enormously high standards of education in a country like India, we are not talking about a narrow elite but a well-educated group of people who increasingly speak better English."
The service has also become one of Britain's most effective instruments for maintaining both its prestige and reach as its political and economic power have diminished. "It is important for any country to do this," said Mr. Lack. "There is an enormous desire to learn more about life, to explore life and to contribute to it culturally. It is something we ignore at our peril, if we want a fair and interesting society."
"If we forget our history we lose perspective," he said. "We lose the belief that individuals have something to contribute, that the great painters, musicians and writers of the past are continuing into the present and provide riches."
Extensive as it is, the World Service's cultural programming does not take up as much air time as its news programming, which is the most comprehensive in the English language. It includes the "Newshour" three times a day and a variety of current affairs programs, among them Alistair Cooke's "Letter From America." News and current affairs constitute about 55 percent of the BBC World Service's programming, with 35 to 40 percent devoted to the arts. The rest of the programming is turned over to sports, religion, education, science and other topics.
But its emphasis on the arts is what makes the World Service special. "One of the reasons for doing this is that there is a market for it," said Penny Tuerk, the service's commissioning editor for English programs, in a telephone interview from London. "Other people aren't doing it."
Terry Anderson, the former chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, who spent nearly seven years in captivity in Beirut, was a regular listener to the World Service before his kidnapping and during his last year and a half of captivity. Now living outside New York City, he said in a telephone interview that he still listens to the World Service.
"There is nothing like it offered in the U.S.," he said. "Around the world the BBC has enormous influence because it reaches an audience that is important, an educated elite that often does not have access to the kind of things the BBC brings. It is unique."

HEADLINE: CONFLICT IN THE BALKANS: THE OVERVIEW;
ALLIES RESOLVE TO BOLSTER U.N PEACEKEEPING IN BOSNIA; U.S. WEIGHS A GROUND ROLE

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: THE HAGUE, Tuesday, May 30

 BODY:
The United States, Britain, France, Germany and Russia resolved this morning to expand the size of the United Nations force in Bosnia and give it heavier equipment to deter any repetition of raids that have left more than 325 peacekeepers as hostages of the Bosnian Serbs.
And for the first time, a senior Clinton Administration official said on Monday that the United States was not ruling out contributing American troops in a combat role, specifically a commando action to free the hostages. 
 Asserting that they would not let the hostage-taking blackmail the United Nations into withdrawing its 22,500 peacekeepers, the United States, Russia and the European powers endorsed a plan drafted by France that would regroup the United Nations force into larger, easier-to-defend contingents and give it more aggressive rules of engagement to ward off attacks.
To that end, Britain announced that it would send at least another 5,000 troops to Bosnia. France said it was sending the aircraft carrier Foch and helicopter gunships to support its contingent. The United States, which has sent the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt to the Adriatic Sea, is also sending 2,000 marines there.
Anthony Lake, President Clinton's national security adviser, said in Washington that the deployment of the marines, who are trained in commando operations, was "a precautionary measure," adding, "No decision has been made yet to send them into combat."
But another senior Administration official insisted that a commando role could not be "excluded."
The foreign ministers of United States, Britain, France and Germany made their call for strengthening the United Nations Protection Force at an emergency four-hour meeting held here late Monday night with Russia's Foreign Minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev. The five countries form the so-called contact group delegated to lead international efforts to end the fighting in the Balkans.
The United States and the European nations went into the meeting hoping to win Russia's endorsement of the plan to strengthen and reconfigure the United Nations force.
The officials called on the Bosnian Serbs to free the peacekeepers immediately but gave few clues about how they would persuade the Serbs to release the hostages.
Peacekeepers from Britain, France, Canada and other countries were seized after the United Nations, with strong American urging, called in NATO planes to bomb a Serb ammunition depot on Thursday and Friday.
In a communique the foreign ministers issued at 2:30 this morning, they gave a stern warning to the Bosnian Serbs, saying they would "hold Pale leaders personally accountable for the security of U.N. personnel taken hostage."
Referring to the United Nations force, a senior United States official said, "The taking of hostages underscores the need for Unprofor to be beefed up and for measures to be taken to reduce the vulnerability of the troops so the risk of hostage-taking and retaliatory actions is reduced, if not eliminated."
The official, who is traveling with Secretary of State Warren Christopher, said the Administration might also lend unspecified logistical support to reconfigure the United Nations force. Such a move is expected to involve reducing the functions of the peacekeepers, while concentrating them into larger, more defensible groupings that can better carry out their remaining functions.
"We believe the U.N. needs to be regrouped so it's less vulnerable," said Britain's Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd.
France's new Prime Minister, Alain Juppe, has threatened to withdraw France's peacekeepers unless the United Nations force is strengthened and its mission redefined so it can be more effective.
While focusing on military options, the foreign ministers also said they hoped to pursue diplomatic avenues to end the conflict, by redoubling efforts to persuade President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia to recognize Bosnia's territorial integrity. Such an action would further isolate the Bosnian Serbs, who control about 70 percent of Bosnia's territory.
The ministers convened their emergency meeting here to discuss the hostage crisis and the future of the United Nations mission in Bosnia. Those talks will continue today and on Wednesday in a different forum: a NATO foreign ministers meeting in Noordwijk, a Dutch seaside resort just north of The Hague.
In Brussels Monday, the 15 nations of the European Union backed France's and Britain's call to strengthen the United Nations force.
The ministers said there was a need to secure the peacekeepers' right of freedom of movement and especially their right of access to the six zones declared "safe areas" by the United Nations. The ministers also said there was a need to provide a rapid reaction force to protect peacekeepers in emergencies.
A senior American official said that because the United States has no troops in Bosnia, the Administration was deferring to Britain and France, which have the largest contingents of peacekeepers, about what should be done with the United Nations force and how the hostage crisis should be resolved.
"I don't think you are going to a see a change in our position that American ground forces are not going to be introduced into the conflict," the official said. "So that, as a result, means we have to work with our partners rather than tell them what to do."
An American official said there seemed to be little alternative but to negotiate with the Bosnian Serbs since Britain, France and other countries with troops being held hostage fear that new air strikes or other tough action could lead to the death of those hostages. Some American officials say they want to make sure that further air strikes are not ruled out as an option, adding that the Bosnian Serbs must not be allowed to get away with what the Administration has called "terrorist" behavior.
At a news conference this morning, Mr. Christopher said, "The use of air power must remain an option." Administration officials acknowledged that this was left out of the communique because of Russian objections.
American diplomats said the contact group was leaning against having the peacekeepers pull out of hard-to-defend Muslim safe-areas in eastern Bosnia, including Srebrenica and Gorazde. These officials said France opposed it because those safe areas were already so vulnerable to a Serbian takeover.
But the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, has suggested withdrawing from those enclaves because the United Nations forces there could be overwhelmed by Serbian troops and because he wants to the peacekeepers to do fewer jobs, but better.
Officials traveling with Mr. Christopher said they were dismayed that United Nations leaders did not do a better job of insuring that the peacekeepers were in defensible positions before last week's air strikes.
At their meeting, the United States, Russia and the European powers discussed what should be done next to persuade Mr. Milosevic of Serbia to recognize Bosnia.
An American diplomat said a deal with Mr. Milosovic "was probably 80 to 85 percent complete" when talks between the Serbian President and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Robert Frasure fell apart last week. The diplomat said the United States and Mr. Milosevic had agreed to the terms of recognition of Bosnia, the step-by-step process of lifting economic sanctions and the expansion of patrols along Serbia's border to stop smuggling to the Bosnian Serbs.
But the talks fell apart over Mr. Milosevic's insistence that he would recognize Bosnia only in return for an irreversible lifting of the sanctions against his country. The United States insists that Mr. Milosevic should be offered no more than suspension of the sanctions so they could be reimposed if Serbia stopped contributing to peace efforts.
 
Balkan Update
 At THE HAGUE, Secretary of State Warren Christopher and the foreign ministers of Britain, France, Germany and Russia resolved to bolster the United Nations force in Bosnia to deter the Bosnian Serbs from making new raids on peacekeepers and taking hostages.
In BRUSSELS, the 15 nations of the European Union backed France's and Britain's call to strengthen the United Nations force.
Britain dispatched two gun batteries to the Croatian port of SPLIT, from where they were to move into Bosnia. These British units would be under United Nations command and provide the peacekeeping force with artillery for the first time.
The Bosnian Army said Serbs unleashed heavy artillery attacks near MOSTAR, on the main road connecting Split with Sarajevo.
British officials said they would send at least 5,000 more ground troops to Bosnia, while France dispatched the aircraft carrier Foch to the ADRIATIC SEA, where the American aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt and 2,000 marines were also headed.

HEADLINE: A Conservative Sure His Time Has Come

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: TAMPA, Fla., May 27

 BODY:
When Patrick J. Buchanan appeared here at the Hillsborough County Republican Party dinner three years ago, several audience members shouted him down and stormed out of the ballroom to protest his drive to deny President George Bush his party's nomination.
But when Mr. Buchanan stood before the same group this week, there were shouts of "Go, Pat, Go!" and a foot-stomping standing ovation. "The time and the man have come together," Mr. Buchanan said triumphantly in an interview. 
 This was to be the year Mr. Buchanan disappeared in a crowded field of conservative look-alikes. The man who embarrassed Mr. Bush in 1992 -- winning 37 percent of the New Hampshire primary vote as the sole voice on the party's right -- was given little chance of making similar waves when he entered the 1996 race this March. After all, candidates with five times his $1.5 million war chest, bigger organizations and far more endorsements, like Senators Bob Dole of Kansas and Phil Gramm of Texas, were already scrambling for the turf he had staked out.
Yet the 56-year-old Mr. Buchanan is hardly disappearing. While he is still viewed as an unlikely nominee, the former television commentator and conservative columnist is a lot closer to driving the race than to being driven out. Unhindered by the need to moderate his positions with an eye to the general electorate, he is pulling the primary campaign farther to the right with a blend of full-throated social conservatism and economic nationalism in which he advocates "a New World Order to restore our sovereignty."
While Mr. Buchanan's beliefs are too harsh for some Republicans, those who dominate the party's primaries are the hard-core conservatives who may not flinch at his message.
Although his influence could be dismissed nine months before the first primary election, Mr. Buchanan has also frustrated his better-financed rivals by placing second to Mr. Dole in some national polls. And he is no novice to the national stage: He and Mr. Dole are the only candidates who have sought the White House before.
Some Republicans contend that Mr. Buchanan is not running because of any realistic hope that he can win, but to pull the party to the right.
"When Republicans talk about the possible threat of a Buchanan candidacy," said former Representative Vin Weber of Minnesota, who is backing Mr. Dole, "the question that comes up again and again and again is: Does he mind if it does great damage to the Republican Party? Some people think he'd like to punish the party for ideological transgressions."
Mr. Buchanan rejected the notion that he was on a crusade to bring the party around to his point of view. "I've won that battle," he said. "Jack Kemp's talking about shutting down HUD. Richard Lugar is talking about abolishing the I.R.S. Pete Wilson is talking about illegal immigration. And Bob Dole is talking about a cultural war for the soul of America. Pat Buchanan has won the battle for the heart and soul of the Republican Party. It is not a Bush party any more; it is a Buchanan party."
Still, Mr. Buchanan sounds like a man ready to abandon his party should he not become its nominee. He warned that he might establish a third party if spurned by the Republicans, particularly if an anti-abortion plank is not in the Republican platform. "To turn your back and walk away from right to life," he said, "I think you would bring into being an instant third party which would gradually become a socially conservative party."
Mr. Buchanan is a natural campaigner, and he is drawing crowds who seem entertained, if not won over, by his punchy delivery that was honed over the years on programs like CNN's "Crossfire" and from writing speeches for Presidents Ronald Reagan and Richard M. Nixon.
As the others try to finesse their stands against abortion, the party's most internally divisive issue, Mr. Buchanan is demanding that it be front and center in the battle for the nomination. He vows that his first act in office will be to rescind executive orders by President Clinton that ease abortions. In the last week or so, Mr. Buchanan further set himself apart by calling on Congress to defy the Supreme Court's ruling denying states the right to impose term limits on Federal legislators. And he was the only candidate who asserted that the Christian Coalition's Contract With the American Family was too timid and should have called for a Constitutional amendment on abortion and total elimination of money for fetal tissue research.
More than anyone else, Mr. Buchanan has disrupted the long-plotted effort of Senator Gramm of Texas to emerge as the leading conservative alternative to Mr. Dole. Mr. Buchanan's relentless attacks on Mr. Gramm have helped cost the Senator the crucial support of prominent religious conservatives. Last month, Mr. Gramm had another setback after he and Mr. Buchanan addressed a conservative group in Tucson, Ariz., and Mr. Buchanan came away with 76 percent support in a popularity poll.
"I'm Phil Gramm's problem and Phil Gramm is my problem," Mr. Buchanan said. "But I think I've run a far better campaign in the last two months than my old friend Phil Gramm has. It's too much emphasis on money and endorsements. Too much old politics."
Then he recited a list of reasons Mr. Gramm is a "leap-year conservative," from the Senator's vote to confirm Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg to his support of the Americans With Disabilities Act to his support for foreign aid.
Such talk rankles the Gramm camp, though the Senator's loyalists dismiss Mr. Buchanan as an extremist given to the kind of inflammatory remarks that can destroy a campaign. For example, he has attacked the Israeli Defense Ministry's "amen corner" in the Senate; declared that AIDS is nature's "awful retribution" against homosexuals, and said that women were "less equipped psychologically" to perform in some professions.
"I don't view Buchanan as a threat," said Senator John McCain of Arizona, chairman of the Gramm campaign. "He doesn't have the kind of credibility that you need. And he preaches a dangerous isolationism. He even opposed the Persian Gulf war, vociferously, but he doesn't mention it."
Beyond the sniping between Mr. Buchanan and Mr. Gramm, the lingering question among hard-line conservatives is not whether Mr. Buchanan is to the right of Mr. Gramm but whether he is electable.
"He says everything I want to hear," John Williams, 65, a retired telephone company official said after Mr. Buchanan's dinner speech here. "But I don't think he has a chance of winning. I think Phil Gramm will be elected because he has the organization, the money."
Mr. Buchanan, who traveled to Florida mainly to raise cash, faces such doubters again and again, not just from rank-and-file conservatives, but also from prominent figures like Ralph Reed, executive director of the Christian Coalition.
"They want to go with a winner," Mr. Reed said. "The concern about Buchanan is: Can he win?"
By concentrating his limited resources on states with early contests like New Hampshire, Iowa and Arizona, Mr. Buchanan believes a strong early showing can catapult him to become the leading alternative to Mr. Dole. He lays out a game plan of how he can ride to victory with a coalition of religious conservatives and populist-minded Perot voters who applaud his opposition to free trade and feel threatened by immigrants.
Mr. Buchanan lacks the usual resume of a Presidential candidate. He has neither held elective office nor run a Government agency. Indeed, his Government experience had more to do with politics than policy; he was a communications director in the Reagan White House and before that an aide to Presidents Nixon and Gerald R. Ford.
That does not stop Mr. Buchanan from emphasizing that he has far more White House experience than the other candidates. In addition, he said his role as a commentator forced him to form opinions on numerous issues. He stretches to say that as a native of Washington, D.C., he understands bureaucrats: "They're nice people, but they aren't that bright."
Perhaps it is because he has had a platform to speak out on -- without the responsibilities that come with elective office -- that Mr. Buchanan has earned a reputation as a provocateur, and a polarizing one at that. Some leading Republicans will never forgive him for his speech at the Republican National Convention in 1992 about "a religious war" for the cultural soul of America.
On the stump, Mr. Buchanan's positions are anything but muddled.
*On abortion: "I will be the most pro-life President in the history of the United States of America."
*On schools: "We don't need some guy in the Department of Education in sandals and beads telling you how to educate your children."
*On his plan for a five-year moratorium on legal immigration and a fence along 200 miles of the United-States-Mexico border: "If we can send an Army halfway around the world to defend the borders of Kuwait, can't we defend the national borders of the United States of America?"
*On the Clinton White House: "It's a day care center -- children's hour. It's a chaotic White House that's probably in part reflective of the mind of the President of the United States."
*On trade: "If we conducted our arms negotiations as we're conducting our trade negotiations, we'd all be speaking Russian now."
Lyn Nofziger, who first met Mr. Buchanan when the two worked in the Nixon White House, said his old friend's brand of conservatism might be authentic, but might also be uncomfortable for most voters.
"The problem for Pat is that he's too far out in front," Mr. Nofziger said. "Obviously, Pat believes. But he is more of a true believer than most people out there."

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Tuesday about Patrick J. Buchanan's campaign for President misattributed a quotation about conservatives like Ralph Reed of the Christian Coalition who have not endorsed his candidacy. The comment -- "They want to go with a winner. The concern about Buchanan is: Can he win?" -- was made by Mr. Buchanan, not Mr. Reed.

HEADLINE: Invader From Asia Increases Gypsy Moth Threat

BYLINE: By JANE E. BRODY 

 BODY:
WHERE have all the gypsy moths gone? Six years ago, millions of trees throughout the Northeast were eerily leafless in midsummer, thanks to the voracious appetite of this European import. Foresters frantically tried to contain the damage by spraying huge tracts with bacteria that infect the leaf-gobbling larvae, while homeowners girdled trees with sticky tape to impede their leaf-bound trek. Hundreds of hairy caterpillars spoiled summer outings by crawling or falling onto walks, decks and picnic tables.
The good news is that probably for the next two or three summers, the oaks, alders, aspens, birches and many other popular shade and forest trees in the Northeast will continue to, as Joyce Kilmer put it, lift their leafy arms to pray and wear nests of robins in their hair. After that, however, swarms of gypsy moths will almost certainly be back with a vengeance, and this time they may be joined by a new and potentially far more aggressive relative: the Asian gypsy moth. 
 The North American gypsy moth, introduced from France to Medford, Mass, in 1869, has spread slowly but inexorably northward, southward and westward, advancing into Quebec, Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Indiana, Virginia, West Virginia and North Carolina. Progress has been slow, partly because of multibillion-dollar containment efforts and partly because the females of the North American gypsy moth cannot fly. Neither do they feed on leaves. About all they do is mate in mid- to late summer, perhaps walk a few inches and then lay their eggs. The eggs remain dormant all winter, hatching into larvae with huge appetites for about 250 different species of trees and shrubs just as they leaf out in spring.
The Asian gypsy moth represents a speedier threat, experts say. It was transported by freighters from Russia, probably in 1991, to the coasts of Oregon, Washington and British Columbia, and it arrived a few years ago with troop shipments from Germany to the Carolinas.
The Asian gypsy moth female, unlike her European relative, does fly, which is how pregnant females got to the ships headed this way. Females may travel up to 62 miles before laying their eggs. Furthermore, their larvae, which are believed to have blown from ships to American shores, have even more eclectic appetites than their North American relatives.
While the latter attack conifers only after eating themselves out of deciduous trees and shrubs, the Asian gypsy moth has a penchant for Douglas firs, pines and spruces, as well as deciduous hardwoods like apples, oaks, alders, willows and poplars -- some 600 species of trees. And after stripping the trees bare, Asian gypsy moths have been known to attack nearby field crops. Two years ago, $25 million was spent to wipe Asian gypsy moths out of the Northwest and another $9 million was spent last year to eradicate them from the Carolinas.
The Asian and native gypsy moths readily interbreed and, as many entomologists feared, it is now clear that some of their female descendants can fly. Although first-generation hybrids can only glide a few yards, Dr. Melody Keena, a research entomologist, has shown that half the females born of a mating between these hybrids and the Asian moth are capable of full flight.
"We don't want flighted females," said Dr. Keena, who works at the United States Forest Service research center in Hamden, Conn. "They will spread the gypsy moth faster."
Her colleague, Dr. William E. Wallner, envisions a further disaster in the making with the relocation of American military personnel now in European countries. "By the end of 1995, 150,000 troops, 190,000 family members, 55,000 automobiles, 45,000 pets and 600,000 tons of personal property will be shipped back to the U.S., not to mention military equipment and munitions," he said. "Even with the accelerated inspection and detection efforts now under way, the sheer amount of material makes the risk of inadvertent introduction of Asian gypsy moths distressingly high."
Dr. Wallner has recently concluded studies in the Russian Far East that suggest a rather simple way to keep ships free of flying female gypsy moths, not only the Asian variety but two destructive relatives, the nun moth and pink gypsy moth.
Dr. Wallner demonstrated that the female Asian moths were highly attracted to the mercury vapor and incandescent lights now used on docks and ships, but if ultraviolet and blue filters were added, few if any moths would fly toward the lights.
To better monitor the arrival and spread of Asian gypsy moths, Dr. Richard G. Harrison, an ecologist at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y., has been studying DNA sequences to isolate reliable genetic markers for the moth. At the Hamden laboratory, Dr. Wallner has devised a technique that he says is faster and simpler than DNA analysis. He says he can tell where a moth is from by using an automated and computerized color analysis of the striped larval head capsule.
Dr. Andrew Liebhold, a Forest Service entomologist in Morgantown, W.Va., said DNA tests suggest that Asian genes may already have been introduced into some populations of the North American gypsy moth. Gypsy moths that may have Asian ancestry have so far been found in California, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia.
Dr. Liebhold has tracked the progress of the North American variety, showing that from 1900 to 1912 the moth extended its range by about five miles a year; from 1912 to 1965, by just a little more than a mile a year, but then from 1965 to the present, by 12 miles a year, practically a gallop for an insect that barely moves.
In the 1950's, he noted, millions of acres were sprayed with DDT. This suppressed but did not stop the gypsy moth, and inspired Rachel Carson's landmark work, "Silent Spring," damning the environmental damage caused by persistent pesticides. By the mid-1960's, having failed to stop the moth, Dr. Liebhold said foresters "essentially gave up" and the moth stepped up its spread. Recently, he said, the Forest Service began a new effort -- the Slow Spread Project -- to delay the inevitable with tools such as slow-release pheromones to disrupt mating and bacterial sprays that are relatively environmentally benign.
Other researchers, meanwhile, are investigating viral and fungal weapons that attack the larvae. Dr. Ann E. Hajek, an insect pathologist at the New York State College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at Cornell University, isolated and cultured a fungus, Entomophaga maimaiga, which was responsible for the collapse of the last major gypsy moth outbreak in 1989. Though this fungus was first introduced here from Japan in 1911 to fight the moth, it was thought to have failed in field tests and had not been seen since. It reappeared in 1989 in the carcasses of dead gypsy moth larvae in Connecticut, and Dr. Hajek later found it throughout Massachusetts and in other Northeastern states.
Entomophaga (insect eater) maimaiga (the Japanese name for gypsy moth) secretes enzymes that digest the skin of the gypsy moth caterpillar. The fungus then invades the larval body and eats it from the inside out. This fungus, which preferentially attacks gypsy moths, has produced major epidemics in the caterpillars and caused the large-scale destruction gypsy moth populations. It may be largely responsible for the current lull in gypsy moth damage.
Thanks to this fungus, Dr. Hajek says, there may never be another season like 1981, when gypsy moths defoliated a record 13 million acres in the Northeast. Still, the effectiveness of the fungus in suppressing the gypsy moth may depend on something beyond human control: the local weather. A wet, warm spring favors fungal growth; dry, cool weather does not.
Also promising as a biological control weapon is a nuclear polyhedrosis virus, or N.P.V., that is specific for gypsy moths. Dr. Martin Shapiro, a research entomologist at the Agricultural Research Service's Insect Biocontrol Laboratory in Beltsville, Md., is trying to produce the deadliest possible virus with the longest staying power. To this end, he has devised a sunscreen to protect it; this virus, as well as other biological- control agents, is inactivated by sunlight. Dr. Shapiro has shown that stilbenes, chemicals that are used as whiteners, or "optical brighteners," in laundry detergents, can shield the virus from ultraviolet destruction and at the same time make it more virulent. After a bath in stilbenes, the virus lives longer and kills gypsy moth larvae faster, before they have a chance to eat many leaves. Normally, by the end of its eight-week life, one three-inch-long caterpillar has eaten more than a square yard of foliage.
"This approach potentially has an enormous payoff," Dr. Shapiro said. "Many economically important insects are attacked by viruses that could be enhanced by brighteners. Even viruses that would not naturally kill gypsy moths will do so after a treatment by brighteners."
While DDT, Sevin and other potent insecticides have been banned, diflubenzuron (sold as Dimilin by the Uniroyal Chemical Corp.) is still being sprayed on hundreds of acres each year to kill gypsy moths. According to entomologists at the Nature Conservancy, a private environmental group based in Arlington, Va., this persistent chemical not only kills immature insects that feed on trees, it also migrates into the leaf litter on the forest floor and into streams where other insects and nontarget animals feed.
A general wariness toward sprays among conservationists is not surprising. Dr. Dale Schweitzer, an entomologist with the conservancy, maintains that in northern New Jersey, spraying for gypsy moths was responsible for the disappearance of about two dozen species of moths and butterflies in the late 1950's and early 1960's.
Many kinds of trees do not succumb to insect invasions without fighting back. One major weapon is the production of tannins, which in some species can rise to toxic levels when a tree is besieged by leaf eaters like gypsy moth larvae. The noxious tannins suppress the growth of the larvae and, as a result, adult females lay fewer and smaller eggs. But Dr. Jack C. Schultz, an entomologist at Pennsylvania State University, said this natural defensive action by the tree may ultimately be self-defeating. He reports that high levels of tannins also act as antiviral agents and thus may protect the gypsy moth larvae from the nucleopolyhedrosis virus.
Dr. Schultz is now in the midst of a decadelong study of a 120-acre wood that is highly susceptible to gypsy moth devastation to see what role the interaction of tannins and viruses may play in determining the size of the gypsy moth population.
Dr. Joseph Elkinton, an entomologist at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, meanwhile, has linked the rise and fall of gypsy moths to fluctuations in populations of white-footed mice, which dine heavily on gypsy moth larvae and pupae. Why do the mice populations fluctuate? "That may have to do with the acorn crop," another favorite mouse food, Dr. Elkinton said. And why do acorn crops fluctuate? "No one knows," he said. "They may vary with the weather."
And so one mystery leads to another, and the saga of the gypsy moth continues, perhaps for another century. After all, in 126 years, Dr. Elkinton said, "no one yet has got a good handle on the causes of gypsy moth outbreaks or why they remain suppressed for long periods of time."

No Sign of Compromise In Japan Over Trade
 The senior politician managing Japan's contentious trade dispute with the United States said that he had already made "the maximum possible concession" to Washington and that American sanctions against luxury-car imports would worsen job losses in Japan.
The official, Trade Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, also accused Washington of reneging on understandings about how the two countries would handle the negotiations over automobiles and auto parts. Mr. Hashimoto now appears resigned to seeing the Administration's punitive trade tariffs go into effect on June 28. [Page A1.] 
 Japan's unemployment rate rose to 3.2 percent in April, its highest level since 1953. [D6.]
 
Technology Stocks Fall Sharply
After leading the market's 1995 rally, technology stocks were shaken by the prospect of slowing sales and by profit taking. The Nasdaq composite index fell 13.17 points, to 858.70. The broader market was mixed. [D8.]
 
Treasury Yields Hit 15-Month Low
 The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 6.66 percent, down from 6.75 percent on Friday, the lowest in 15 months, on signs that the economy is continuing to slow. [D18.]

HEADLINE: CONFLICT IN THE BALKANS: IN EUROPE;
U.S. and NATO Demand Quick Release of the Hostages

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: NOORDWIJK, The Netherlands, May 30

 BODY:
The United States and NATO, in their strongest terms yet, warned the Bosnian Serbs to release more than 320 detained United Nations peacekeepers immediately or suffer serious consequences.
The warnings were issued a day after the United States, Britain, France, Germany and Russia called for the 22,500-member peacekeeping force in Bosnia to be strengthened, partly to show the Bosnian Serbs that taking hostages would not intimidate the United Nations into withdrawing. 
 At a meeting of NATO foreign ministers, Secretary of State Warren Christopher addressed himself to the Bosnian Serbs in harsh words.
"We've made known to the leadership of the Bosnian Serbs that we hold them responsible for the welfare and well-being of those who have been taken and detained," he told reporters. "It's a barbaric act. It's uncivilized. It's really not part of any reasonable struggle that might be going on there."
Willy Claes, the NATO Secretary General, was equally tough. "We condemn in the very strongest terms the utterly despicable behavior of the Bosnian Serbs," he said. "We will not be intimidated. We demand that the Bosnian Serbs release unconditionally the U.N. peacekeepers."
Mr. Claes threatened serious consequences if the hostages were not released unharmed, but said it would be unwise to discuss in public what actions NATO might take.
Several American diplomats said that in the interest of protecting the hostages, diplomacy should be given a chance and they sought to avoid discussing any heroic military measures to free the hostages. The hostages were taken after NATO air strikes on a Bosnian Serb ammunition depot last week.
Mr. Christopher announced today that he was sending a senior diplomat to Belgrade on Friday to urge President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia to use whatever sway he has over the Bosnian Serbs to free the peacekeepers.
American officials said that Lieut. Gen. Rupert Smith, the United Nations commander in Bosnia, has been holding talks with Gen. Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb commander, in an effort to win the hostages' release.
At the meeting today in this Dutch resort town on the North Sea, Mr. Christopher and the foreign ministers of 15 other NATO nations held lengthy talks on two subjects other than Bosnia: the expansion of NATO and the alliance's future relationship with Russia.
At a news conference this morning in The Hague, Russia's Foreign Minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev, announced that his country would reverse its stance on the so-called Partnership for Peace, a group of 26 former Soviet bloc countries that cooperates with NATO on security matters. Last December, Mr. Kozyrev suspended Russia's membership in the partnership plan to protest American-led moves to expand NATO.
Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Robert Frasure is to travel to Belgrade to resume efforts, broken off last week, to persuade Mr. Milosevic to recognize Bosnia. The United States and the European powers say such a move will reduce tensions in the Balkans and isolate Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader who is seen as responsible for taking the peacekeepers hostage.
"What we want to do here is divide Milosevic from Karadzic," Mr. Christopher said. "We want to further isolate Karadzic. It perhaps will occur to him that it might be a rather lonely world out there."
Mr. Milosevic wants the economic sanctions against Serbia lifted irreversibly if he recognizes Bosnia, but the United States insists that the sanctions be suspended only temporarily, reserving the right to reimpose them if Serbia interferes with progress toward peace.
American officials said Mr. Milosevic and Mr. Frasure have agreed on stages for easing sanctions and on increasing patrols to prevent smuggling from Serbia to Bosnia's Serbs.
The NATO ministers discussed ideas for strengthening the role of the United Nations force, among them reconfiguring the peacekeepers into larger groups that would be easier to defend; withdrawing tiny teams of military observers in far-flung parts of Bosnia, and providing the peacekeepers with a rapid reaction force to deal with emergencies.
On Wednesday, NATO is to open, for the first time, an official dialogue with Russia in which the foreign ministers will share their views on European security and cooperation with Russia with Mr. Kozyrev.
NATO officials said they were delighted and relieved that Russia had decided to proceed with full membership in the partnership plan because that might signal less Russian resistance to expanding NATO.
"Russia is crossing a new threshold in its relationship with NATO," Mr. Christopher said. "Russia will be moving toward integration with Europe and away from isolation. That's a choice that I feel sure will greatly benefit Russia and Europe and the world as a whole."
NATO official say they will spend much of Wednesday seeking to assure Mr. Kozyrev that NATO is no longer an anti-Russian alliance. They fear, nonetheless, that Moscow remains as firmly opposed as ever to extending NATO eastward.
"The new order of European security, founded on cooperation, must be built with Russia, and not against it," Mr. Claes said.

HEADLINE: REPORT TO CLINTON HAS A MIXED VIEW ON MINORITY PLANS

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 30

 BODY:
In a sweeping review of the Government's affirmative-action programs, Clinton Administration officials have concluded that most hiring and other preferences based on race or sex are justified in employment and education. But they found problems with some purchasing programs that reserve Federal contracts for companies owned by blacks or women.
A confidential report prepared for the President by Administration officials catalogues numerous forms of affirmative action and analyzes the reasons for "white male resentment" of those practices. 
 The report, prompted by Republican criticism of such programs, lays out standards for acceptable affirmative action: race or sex can be considered as "one among several factors." If numbers are used, they should be "genuine goals rather than straitjackets or quotas." Affirmative-action plans should be reviewed periodically to see if they are still needed. And the rights of "bystanders," including white men, must be respected.
Administration officials said Mr. Clinton would probably announce his conclusions in a broad thematic speech not yet scheduled, leaving agencies to disclose details of any changes in their programs. If Mr. Clinton proposes changes, they are likely to become a starting point for Republicans in Congress who want to go much further, possibly repealing programs that they say discriminate against white men.
When Mr. Clinton ordered the review in February, he evidently hoped to assuage the concerns of white men. But he and his advisers quickly concluded that they would alienate many blacks, Hispanic Americans and women if they pulled back too far in their support for affirmative action.
A senior Administration official involved in the review said, "We concluded early on that the politics were a wash" for the Administration because the political costs would offset any political gains from curtailing affirmative action.
But the official denied that the review was part of a Presidential re-election strategy. "From the beginning," he said, "we have viewed this as a moral and policy exercise unmoored from political calculations -- an attempt by the President to discover and define what he believes. We spend more time talking about constitutional doctrine than the politics of affirmative action."
George Stephanopoulos, senior adviser to the President, said tonight that the review was not complete and had taken somewhat longer than expected because "it's complicated." He refused to discuss any preliminary conclusions. The President's ultimate decision on this issue, he said, "is not a political decision, but will be based on policy and principle."
A third Administration official said that Mr. Clinton would offer "sympathy and understanding" to white men who resent affirmative action. Mr. Clinton indicated his strategy in a speech to the California Democratic Party in April, declaring, "This is psychologically a difficult time for a lot of white males, the so-called angry white males," who feel they have been treated unfairly.
The report upholds most types of affirmative action, saying they increase productivity by reducing discrimination and finding the best candidates for particular jobs. But it expresses concern about programs that establish "hard set-asides," or rigid quotas, for blacks, Hispanic Americans and women.
As an example, the report cites Commerce Department rules for certain local public works programs financed by the Federal Government. The rules say that no grant may be made for any project unless "at least 10 percent of the amount of the grant will be expended for contracts with or supplies from minority business enterprises."
A similar preference is found in the Diplomatic Security Act of 1986. At least 10 percent of the money for construction to improve security at American embassies is earmarked for minority contractors.
Administration officials said such preferences, while legally defensible, might be seen as unfair because they suggested that for certain Government contracts, whites need not apply. President Clinton will be on firm ground if he can say he opposes anything that looks like a hard quota, the officials explained.
In March, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader, denounced "Government-sanctioned quotas, timetables, set-asides and other racial preferences." He and several other Republican candidates for President, including Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, have vowed to repeal or restrict such preferences. On Thursday, Gov. Pete Wilson of California, a possible candidate for the Republican Presidential nomination, plans to sign an executive order eliminating some preferences based on race or sex that the state adopted.
Many Republicans say such preferences discriminate against white men and undermine the goal of a color-blind society. But the report to President Clinton says, "The Supreme Court has consistently rejected the argument that the Constitution is color-blind."
The report says "consideration of race or sex is permissible" sometimes, if it is narrowly tailored to overcome the effects of discrimination, to cure "a manifest imbalance" in the workplace or to promote diversity at a college.
The report for Mr. Clinton says white male resentment of affirmative action "seems to be rising" because of "a static or shrinking economy," corporate layoffs and increasing nonwhite immigration, which "may fuel ugly racial sentiments, particularly in tight or transitional economic times."
The Administration says there may be a statistical basis for some white male resentment, because set-asides can "account for more than half of all procurements" in some industries and areas.
Numerical goals, preferences and set-asides have been "very successful in expanding procurement opportunities" for businesses owned by blacks, Hispanic Americans and women, the report says. But "given the shrinking size of the procurement pie, such increases may mean real decreases" for other companies, including small businesses owned by white men, it says.
In addition, the Administration found "a tendency for agencies to concentrate their minority contracting in certain fields such as construction, where there are a significant number of minority firms."
Thus, it said, an agency may set an overall goal of buying 10 percent of its goods and services from companies owned by blacks or women. But, it said, the "goals, set-asides and preferences in some fields can be several times the overall goal," and "it seems likely that resentment of these programs is particularly high" in those industries.
In Congressional elections last fall, 60 percent of white men voted for Republican candidates, according to a national survey of voters leaving the polls conducted by Mitofsky International. Some Republicans say that by challenging affirmative action, they can drive a wedge into the traditional Democratic coalition next year.
But the report quotes President Clinton as saying that affirmative action must not be a "cheap political wedge issue to divide the American electorate."
About two dozen officials took part in the first phase of the affirmative-action review. They examined dozens of preferences based on race or sex, asking, "What works and what doesn't?" A smaller group, composed mainly of White House aides, is trying to define a policy and vision for the President. This group includes Mr. Stephanopoulos and Christopher F. Edley Jr., a Harvard Law School professor who worked at the Office of Management and Budget for the last two years.
Black business executives have lobbied the White House to preserve set-asides and other forms of affirmative action. But an Administration official said there might be some political benefit if such executives criticized the Administration's eventual proposals.
"We want black businessmen to scream enough to let angry white males understand that we've done something for them," said the official, who spoke on the condition that he not be named.
The official said Mr. Clinton, while supporting most forms of affirmative action, had concluded that "making distinctions or judgments using race or sex as a factor has a moral cost." In this, he said, Mr. Clinton differs from some liberals. "The strongest traditional proponents of affirmative action say we shouldn't be worried about the white male bystander or innocent victim," the official said.
But Administration officials said Mr. Clinton agreed with liberals who assert that affirmative action is not meant just to remedy the effects of discrimination. It is also a legitimate tool to promote diversity, they said, and for this reason, colleges may consider race along with other factors in awarding financial aid.

HEADLINE: Harvard Officials Stress the Positive Despite the Most Recent Events in a Year of Trials

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN 

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass., May 30

 BODY:
When Neil L. Rudenstine, the president of Harvard University, took an unscheduled leave of absence last winter, suffering from the stresses of his job, he received 1,500 get-well cards from faculty and students.
"A lot of them said, 'I need a break too,' " Mr. Rudenstine recalled during an interview in his office today. " 'Can I join you in the Caribbean?' " 
 Mr. Rudenstine could be jovial until Sunday, when Sinedu Tadesse, a 20-year-old junior from Ethiopia, fatally stabbed her roommate and fellow pre-med major, Trang Phuong Ho, in their dormitory room and then hanged herself.
The deaths have prompted not only horror but also wonder at what could have led to the worst act of violence in memory at the nation's premier university. All the worse, the murder-suicide follows several unwelcome episodes in what has proved to be a remarkably rocky school year: two earlier student suicides, the university's decision not to admit Gina Grant once it found that years earlier she had killed her mother in South Carolina, and embarrassment brought to the campus by an incident involving a Harvard medical school professor.
In his office today, a trim and tanned Mr. Rudenstine, who returned to his post in February, called Sunday's fatal violence "a terrible human thing" but said it should not diminish Harvard's "positive and dynamic" accomplishments during the academic year, which ends with graduation next week.
"This has been one of our best years in who gets in and who comes out," he said, citing a sharp rise in applicants, including almost twice the number of high school valedictorians as five years ago.
The president also noted that Harvard raised $300 million this year -- more, he said, than any university has ever raised before in a single year. "We couldn't raise that kind of money if Harvard were in trouble," he said.
Dr. Robert Coles, a Harvard professor of psychiatry, also urged that the recent troubles be seen in isolation, not as a reflection of some broad difficulty.
"I put in a plea for the way great novelists like Dickens or Tolstoy would see this tragedy: as a matter of fate and chance," he said. "I would not connect them to a larger story about Harvard."
As for the effect of the murder-suicide, Professor Coles said: "It does shock the students. But these students are achievers, and they go on. There's no panic, no evidence of group despair, no mass hysteria."
Albert Carnesale, provost of the university, said of the incident: "That says more about what makes the news than this university. It's clear that this university is doing quite well, although this tragedy is not part of the 'doing quite well.' "
Turning to earlier difficulties, Mr. Carnesale said: "In the Gina Grant case, people have been saying, 'What a wise decision that was!' My guess is that more people would be saying that today than a week ago."
"The same with Neil's leave," he continued. "Many people said what a courageous thing it was for him to do."
And referring to the case of John Mack, the Harvard psychiatrist who wrote a best seller on abductions by space creatures and whose professional ethics have now been questioned by a committee of his peers, Mr. Carnesale said, "Not one person has raised that with me as having anything to do with Harvard."
In the aftermath of Sunday's deaths, the university's crisis intervention teams were called in and have been concentrating on the students who knew the two dead young women, said Fred Jewett, dean of Harvard College, who, like the other officials, cautioned against drawing broad inferences from the university's unsettling year.
He observed that Harvard's graduation rate of 97 percent was, according to the National Collegiate Athletic Association, the highest in the nation. "That speaks to the kinds of success students are having here," he said.
As for the student stress that is legend at Harvard, Bill Fitzsimmons, dean of admissions and financial aid, said much of it was myth.
"They used to say, 'Look to your right and look to your left, and by the end of the year two of you will be gone,' " he said. "But Harvard is the exact opposite of that. The fact that we have the highest graduation rate in the nation proves it."
Mr. Rudenstine agreed. "Stress was a much more common problem in the 60's," he said, "when we had much less support for students."
Suzi Naiburg, senior tutor at Dunster House, where Sunday's events unfolded, is one of many who point out that Harvard's student-support programs, like those at other major colleges and universities, have increased enormously in recent years.
"At Dunster House," she said, "there are 16 resident and 31 non-resident tutors. They are predominantly graduate students. They create study breaks where the students meet socially, they eat their meals with the students, play intramural games with the students and hold 'study buddy' meetings."
Still, a Harvard professor who spoke on the condition of anonymity said students on the pre-medical track had become "hugely competitive," with corruptive results.
"Simultaneous with the recession," he said, "students and their parents came to believe that neither business nor even engineering offered financial security. And so they decided on a career in medicine. Immediately the pre-med courses became jammed, and some students began to cheat" -- for instance, by stealing graded exams that had been posted so that only they, and not other students, would know the correct answers, an advantage that might benefit them in subsequent tests.
Mr. Jewett acknowledged that there had been some suspensions for "academic dishonesty" this year. And even Mr. Rudenstine said stress on pre-med students had been a problem for as long as he could remember.
Particularly "if you have a parent who is a doctor," he said, "you get an awful lot of pressure to have a career in medicine."

HEADLINE: NO SIGN IN JAPAN OF DEAL ON TRADE

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 30

 BODY:
The senior Japanese politician managing the country's increasingly contentious trade dispute with the United States said today that he had already made "the maximum possible concession" to Washington, contending that the planned American sanctions would add to job losses in Japan.
The official, Ryutaro Hashimoto, is the Minister of International Trade and Industry and is widely viewed as a leading candidate to become the next prime minister. In a lengthy interview in his office today, Mr. Hashimoto also contended that the Clinton Administration had reneged on previous understandings regarding how the two countries would handle negotiations over automobiles and auto parts. 
 At the same time, other senior Japanese officials interviewed here indicated that they were all but resigned to seeing the Administrations's punitive trade tariffs against $5.9 billion in luxury car imports go into effect as scheduled on June 28. Officials say they expect little or no progress on the issue when President Clinton meets Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama in mid-June in Canada at the meeting of the seven leading industrial countries. They also say they are pessimistic that talks planned for late June will resolve the dispute before the sanctions bite.
In contrast to past trade disputes with Washington, this time Tokyo appears determined to press its case to the limits. And Mr. Hashimoto has a good deal to gain from standing up to the United States, with his political advisers saying he now stands out from a crowd of politicians who seem confused and directionless after the breakup two years ago of the traditional party structure that commanded Japan for 40 years.
"He is in tune with the present assertive mood," said Yukio Okamoto, a consultant and political analyst, "to push back against American bullying."
Sitting near a desk where he has propped up a sign reading, "Our policy: Rigid flexibility," Mr. Hashimoto clearly personifies that newly toughened stance. Pointedly, he keeps his equipment for kendo, a Japanese form of fencing, propped up in the corner of his office.
Like politicians elsewhere, he made it clear today that his first concern was jobs. That is usually not a big issue in a country with an unemployment rate that generally is well under 3 percent, but Japan's full-employment system is under increasing strain from a three-year period of economic weakness.
Mr. Hashimoto said that "employment will be affected" by the sanctions, which would price nearly all Japanese luxury-car imports out of the American market. But he would not predict by how much joblessness might rise.
In fact, Japan's unemployment rate, while still low by Western standards, rose to a record 3.2 percent in April, adding to fears that the nation is slipping back into recession.
Mr. Hashimoto stands out from the typically bland Japanese official as a flamboyant and frequently fiery figure. And so far at least, he appears to have attracted nearly universal support here for his willingness to face down the United States, even from opposition politicians and bureaucrats who have often clashed with him.
Indeed, several Japanese officials and industry executives said that enduring the sanctions would be worth the cost if the long-term effect was to teach the United States that high-pressure tactics no longer work against Japan.
"In the past Japan has always bent down and yielded at the last moment," Yoshikazu Kawana, the executive vice president of the Nissan Motor Corporation and chairman of the trade committee of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association. But "not this time," he said, adding: "We are just trying to survive. The American requests are just too much to accept."
During the last week, Mr. Hashimoto has rather deftly turned the debate over cars from a discussion of whether the Japanese automotive market is closed to imports to one of whether the American sanctions are consistent with world trading rules. Many countries in Asia and Europe have condemned Washington's tactics, largely because they fear they might be the next targets. That chorus of complaint is music to Japan's leaders, and at a news conference with Japanese reporters today Mr. Hashimoto said that the United States should "lend an ear to global opposition."
Mr. Hashimoto argued that as recently as last November, when he met Ronald H. Brown, the Commerce Secretary, and Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, he had been led to believe that the United States would not insist on new "voluntary plans." Those plans, termed "voluntary" to avoid running afoul of international trade law, commit Japanese auto makers to buying more American parts. They were begun in 1991, when President George Bush visited here, accompanied by American automobile executives.
But Japanese officials have never been comfortable with the arrangement and "Mickey Kantor said that he agreed that voluntary plans were outside the framework of the talks and outside the Government's reach," Mr. Hashimoto said. But Mr. Brown argued, Mr. Hashimoto said, that such "voluntary plans" should be included, and Mr. Kantor quickly changed his position.
Mr. Kantor, interviewed by telephone today, said he had a different memory of those events. Although the "framework accord" signed two years ago by President Clinton and Kiichi Miyazwa, who was then the Prime Minister, made no mention of voluntary plans, Mr. Kantor said, such plans "are part of the overall discussion of autos" and have been for years.
"I'm afraid he either misunderstood or that he heard only what he wanted to hear," Mr. Kantor said.
Mr. Hashimoto's oral sparring came as Japanese auto manufacturers began to assess the potential cost of the sanctions, which will be retroactive to May 20 if they are imposed at the end of June. The Honda Motor Company said today that it estimated that the sanctions would cost it $211 million this year, assuming it was forced to stop production of the luxury cars it sends to the United States, the Acura Legend and the new Acura 3.2 TL.
The Toyota Motor Company and the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation both said today that they would essentially stop production of luxury cars headed for the United States. The Mazda Motor Corporation, which is in extreme financial distress, has already stopped its export of a car covered by the tariffs.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;
To reach entrepreneurs and growing companies, many marketers count on Inc. magazine.

BYLINE: By Leonard Sloane 

 BODY:
AT a White House briefing this month, the leaders of the businesses on the Inc. magazine list of the 500 fastest-growing privately owned companies were greeted by top Federal officials. Then they left for Norfolk, Va., for an annual three-day conference for executives from the current Inc. 500, as well as heads of previous companies on the list.
All this is grist for the mill for Inc. as it strives to maintain its role as idea generator and advocate for the nation's small to medium-sized growing companies. Since its founding by Bernard Goldhirsh in 1979, the magazine has seen the members of its audience become the recipients of more than half of the corporate revenues in the United States. And Inc. has benefited financially by providing a forum for advertisers seeking to sell to this market. 
 "There has been a radical shift in the economy, in which small growth companies have become huge engines for job creation," said James J. Spanfeller, Inc.'s publisher.
"Competition has moved large companies toward downsizing," he added, "while many smaller companies, by contrast, are growing rapidly and investing in their infrastructure. If this swing continues, we'll become more widely recognized."
To reach the readers of Inc., owned by Goldhirsh Group Inc., marketers bought 644 advertising pages during the first six months of 1995, a gain of 23 percent from the corresponding period in 1994. That increase comes atop an 8 percent gain last year, when advertisers bought 1,221 ad pages.
The largest advertising category for Inc. is technology, followed by automotive. Other advertising mainstays include travel, insurance and financial services.
"We have to work on a number of consumer categories," Mr. Spanfeller said. "That includes apparel, jewelry, watches and upscale distilled spirits."
Many current advertisers describe themselves as enthusiastic about how Inc. has carved out a niche in the competitive field of business magazines as a title for growing companies.
"The one neat thing about Inc. is that it is not a trade magazine per se," said Kerry Dyer, a vice president of the Young & Rubicam New York unit of Young & Rubicam Inc., whose clients include AT& T, Digital Equipment personal computers and Xerox.
"It is a magazine that was about the new economy long before there was a new economy," he added. "It definitely has a unique focus."
Peter Levin, advertising director of the Cadillac division of General Motors in Warren, Mich., said: "Entrepreneurs are extremely key to our buyer prospects. Those people are looking for a car that represents a statement for them. And we can reach entrepreneurs through Inc. magazine."
Inc.'s audited paid circulation for the last half of 1994 was about 646,000 copies, maintaining the relatively flat pattern of recent years. At the beginning of 1995, though, the magazine raised its rate base, the circulation guaranteed to advertisers, by 10,000, or 1.6 percent, to 650,000.
"On the outside, we'll get up to 750,000 between now and the end of the decade," Mr. Spanfeller predicted.
Frequency has also advanced this year, from 12 to 18 issues a year, as Inc. increased its coverage of computer systems and other new technology. An additional two issues are being considered for 1996.
And along with other magazines, Inc. is stepping up what the trade calls multitiered marketing programs. In an effort to bring its readers in closer touch with the magazine, Inc. sponsors four to five conferences annually, operates a series of expositions in different cities and produces books, software and video and audio tapes.
"There are a variety of ways of talking to our marketplace," Mr. Spanfeller said. "It's all part of the economic continuum."

HEADLINE: China Said to Triple Oil Imports From Iran

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: NICOSIA, Cyprus, May 30

 BODY:
Iran will earn more than $400 million a year after winning an agreement to triple its oil exports to China, the official Iranian press agency IRNA said today.
An agreement for Iran to increase its oil sales to China to 60,000 barrels a day from the current 20,000 barrels was reached at a meeting of the eighth Iran-China joint economic commission held in Beijing, the agency reported from the Chinese capital. 
 The deal with China comes just weeks after President Clinton issued an executive order that stopped United States oil companies from buying Iranian oil. United States companies had until recently bought nearly a quarter of Iran's total crude oil exports of 2.6 million barrels. But the White House, citing Iran's support of international terrorism, has now severed this oil trade.
The new Iran-China oil export deal covers crude oil and refined petroleum products. Iran is the world's second-largest exporter of oil.
Iran's vice president for executive affairs, Hamid Mirzadeh, told the agency that Iran would also invest more than $25 million in China's oil refining business because of growing demand in the Chinese domestic energy market.

HEADLINE: M.T.A. Seeks To Call Off Mediation

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

 BODY:
For the first time in its history, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority has decided to forgo extended mediation with its railway unions, which could mean a strike against the Metro-North commuter railroad as early as June 23.
Historically, the railroad has taken full advantage of provisions in the Federal Railway Labor Act to put off a strike for as long as several years. But the M.T.A.'s chief negotiator told the unions yesterday that extended mediation has not been effective and that having a firm deadline would force serious bargaining. 
 "The dispute that we have with our work force is not going to be resolved by continued nonbinding mediation," Gary J. Dellaverson, director of labor relations, said in an interview. "It can be resolved with collective bargaining. It can be resolved without a strike, and it should be resolved without a strike."
For their part, union leaders said that if there is no agreement by the June 23 deadline, they will walk out, halting rail service for 95,000 commuters, primarily in Connecticut and Westchester County.
"There will absolutely be a strike" if there's no contract, said James T. Joyce, chairman of the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen, Local 160.
Anthony J. Bottalico, general chairman of the United Transportation Union, which represents Metro-North conductors, said the railroad "is trying to force a job action, so that they can run down to Congress and ask Congress to impose a settlement that they like." He added, "I'm not saying that the unions are going to walk off the property, but right now, I don't see what would stop them."
Just as the M.T.A.'s change in strategy would allow the unions to strike, it would allow the M.T.A., Metro-North's parent agency, to impose a wage freeze and work-rule changes that the unions have rejected.
Under Federal law, either side could extend mediation until October. The governors of New York and Connecticut, George E. Pataki and John G. Rowland, can also trigger extended mediation, but they are backing the M.T.A. position. Last year, while campaigning for re-election, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo directed the M.T.A. to back down on work-rule demands to end a strike on the Long Island Rail Road.
The time is unusually ripe for the M.T.A. to confront the unions, with newly elected Republican governors in both states who have pledged to reduce the size of government, who owe little to organized labor and who do not face re-election campaigns for another three years.
"Our unions have to understand, as have other public employee unions, that they have a role to play in insuring the continued stability of the region's economy by helping us to control costs," said E. Virgil Conway, the M.T.A. chairman.
But union officials note with satisfaction that a Metro-North strike would hit hardest at the core constituency of Governor Pataki, who appointed Mr. Conway, in the suburban and Hudson Valley counties north of the city. And they question how long either governor would stomach an extended walkout at Metro-North.
The decision not to prolong mediation applies to talks with 14 unions for contracts for 1995 through 1997, with wages and work rules at the core of the dispute, and it comes on the heels of a bitter struggle over contracts for 1992 through 1994.
The move demonstrates M.T.A. officials' deep frustration with the Railway Labor Act, whose delaying provisions are generally seen as favoring the railroads rather than their workers. But the officials said the act serves only to extend and worsen contract disputes while still permitting strikes, unlike New York State law, which forbids strikes and does not provide for lengthy mediation.
"If delay had any likelihood of enhancing chances of settlement or avoiding a strike, we would do it," Mr. Dellaverson said. But, he added, "the longer a dispute simmers, the harder it is to solve it."
The M.T.A move comes while memories of previous failures in mediation, like the one that led to last summer's L.I.R.R. strike, are still fresh. On Friday, engineers on the Long Island Rail Road, another M.T.A. agency, staged a one-day wildcat walkout, in part out of frustration with years of fruitless mediation.
Union leaders say that the M.T.A. has calculated that by forcing a strike, it can build favor in Congress for exempting Metro-North and the L.I.R.R., the nation's two largest commuter railroads, from the Railway Labor Act.
"They figure the Republican Congress is going to step in and be on management's side," Mr. Joyce, of the signalmen's union, said.
If Congress exempted the commuter railroads from the Federal law, the L.I.R.R. would come under New York's Taylor law, which forbids strikes. For Metro-North, which operates in two states, New York and Connecticut would have to adopt a new, joint labor law.
Some union leaders said the M.T.A. was acting now because it would rather have a strike in the summer, when there are fewer passengers and more idle school buses available for back-up service, than in October. Mr. Dellaverson agreed that a summer strike would be easier to cope with, but he said that was not a major factor in the decision.
A Federal mediation board recently recommended wage increases for all Metro-North unions of 3 percent beginning July 1, another 3 percent next Jan. 1 and 4 percent on Jan. 1, 1997, which labor leaders say most of the unions would readily accept. The M.T.A. will not discuss its salary proposals, but union leaders say the agency has offered no increase in 1995 or 1996, and a 3.5 percent increase in 1997, which the unions dismiss as unacceptable.
The Metro-North unions have long insisted on parity with the Long Island Rail Road, whose workers earn an average of 5 to 6 percent more than Metro-North employees. The railroad's offer would widen that gap.
The two sides are similarly far apart on work rules. In a prime example, the M.T.A. objects to a contract rule that says all track workers' regular shifts must be scheduled for weekdays during the day, when repairs are often limited by heavy train traffic. M.T.A. officials say this means workers are idle much of the time, and must be paid overtime to work nights and weekends.
"What the board and the unions fail to recognize is we're just not another railroad, we're a government agency," Mr. Dellaverson said. "We, like the rest of government, are constrained to do more with less."

HEADLINE: ABOUT NEW YORK;
When Times Were Slower And Crime Was Lower

BYLINE: By Michael T. Kaufman 

 BODY:
ARE things worse, crimewise, than they were in the old days? Was your grandmother right when she remembered that you could once walk anywhere at any time without worrying, or has nostalgia put a mellow gloss on years when she was young enough to skip easily out of harm's way. Weren't there people at the Five Points who would bite anyone's ear off for a quarter? What about the Plug Uglies, the Dead Rabbits, Murder Inc. and the hatchet men of the Chinese tongs who menaced the citizenry?
A group of students from John Jay College have just completed a research project that addresses this issue. Realizing that there is no index of lawlessness, no available Dow of mayhem that averages out crimes and misdemeanors on a day-to-day basis, the students spent last semester poring over court records and came up with a criminal profile of the residents of one Lower East Side building over decades of teeming immigration, overcrowding and poverty. 
 The five-story building in question is 97 Orchard Street, which now happens to be the Lower East Side Tenement Museum. It was built at the start of the Civil War and became a densely settled home for waves of immigrants from Germany, Ireland, Eastern Europe and Italy. Teams of historians and genealogists, commissioned by the museum, had earlier identified more than 1,300 people, or about half of those who passed through the building, sharing first privies, and then toilets, in the hall, as they chased their American dreams.
FOR much of its existence, 97 Orchard Street was a place of small, sometimes windowless rooms, where on occasion mattresses were rented out to people sleeping in shifts. There was much poverty and unemployment. Hygienic conditions were often dismal, and child mortality was high. In 1890, close to 100 people were living in the place. Surely crime must have been as common as grime. Surely, as former Mayor Ed Koch liked to say, "The good old days weren't so good."
"Before we looked into it, I just assumed that with such crowded conditions, crime must have been a serious problem," said Christopher Martinez, a sophomore at John Jay who worked on the project. "I know how crazy I get sometimes sharing a bathroom with just one person, so I could imagine how aggressive people must have felt to share with 20 or 30 neighbors."
As part of a course called "Immigration, People and Politics," the students checked through docket books of the old Magistrates Court for each year from 1899 to 1930, looking for defendants who were residents of 97 Orchard. These records are on microfilm at the New York City Municipal Archives, whose director, Kenneth Cobb, boasts of having the most complete annals of crime in the English-speaking world. "We've got records of every offense, misdemeanor and crime in the city from 1684 to 1966," he said.
So what did the students find? Pretty much, bubkes.
In 1903, Julia Hennesy, who was 60, was sentenced to six months in the workhouse for intoxication. In 1927, William Sher, another resident, was imprisoned for three days for obstructing the sidewalk, presumably with a pushcart. In all, 45 residents of the building had been hauled into Magistrates Court, the so-called Tribune of the People, in a three-decade period to face charges that included disorderly conduct and violation of corporate ordinance, which usually meant doing some kind of business without a license.
One man was charged with violation of the cigarette tax. A few paid fines of $1, $2 or $3 for obstruction, and one man was charged with loitering. Two people were fined for alcohol offenses during Prohibition, and one man was charged with larceny, but like almost all the other cases, the charges were dismissed.
IT turns out that even though gangsters like Monk Eastman and Big Jack Zelig were organizing gangs and shaking down businesses in the neighborhood, there were no signs that the people at 97 Orchard had guns or were involved in gunplay. They were not linked to prostitution or gambling or drug activity. One possibility, of course, is that they were very good at getting away with more serious crimes. Another is that they were overwhelmingly law-abiding and your grandmother was right.
Police Officer Ralph Torres of the Seventh Precinct, who went to the museum to look at the student's findings, which were turned over to the museum, thought they were significant in their pettiness. He thought it strange that police had the time and will to press such cases.
"It's very different what we contend with nowadays," he said. "Our most common arrests are robbery, burglary and drug offenses. I do not remember any arrests or citations for obstruction or cigarette tax violations."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bonds Surge As Weakness In Economy Feeds a Rally

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The bulls showed the credit markets yesterday that they were still in charge as Treasury securities continued their rally amid recent signs that the economy was slowing with inflation in check.
The rally was helped by optimism that statistics this week, especially the May employment report on Friday, would show further evidence of weakness. Traders said the signs were leading some investors to speculate that the Federal Reserve's next move, after pushing rates up seven times, would be to shift to easier credit to keep the economy from stalling. 
 The 30-year bond surged 17/32 , to a price of 11212/32 for a yield of 6.66 percent, down from 6.75 percent on Friday and the lowest in 15 months; the yield was 6.64 percent on Feb. 23, 1994.
Traders said the cash market outperformed the futures market in early trading yesterday, typically a bullish sign. Talk that the Fed may come into the market to buy $4 billion to $4.5 billion of bills of various maturities for its own account also buoyed the market. The Fed move would be a way of adding reserves to the banking system.
Often dealers use the Fed purchases as an opportunity to clear some of their excess inventory. They will even mark up prices in anticipation.
Another event that seemed to accelerate buying interest in the afternoon was an interview by the Market News Service with a Fed governor, Lawrence B. Lindsey, who indicated that wage gains could not be expected to fuel a reacceleration of the economy. One trader said he was surprised since comments from Fed officials were usually measured and neutral.
Much of yesterday's gains came from overnight trading as market participants said that central banks that have been buying dollars might step up purchases of Treasury securities as well.
"It's a fuzzy relationship," said James Hale, a fixed-income analyst with MMS International in San Francisco, of the connection between dollar buying and Treasury purchases. He said foreign central banks were "massive" buyers of dollars since the beginning of the year and recently of Treasuries as well.
Elsewhere in the Treasury market, the sale of new three- and six-month bills went without a hitch. But the surprising part of the auction, dealers said, was the presence of strong foreign demand, presumably from central banks and specifically the Bank of Japan.
The average rate for the three-month bill was 5.64 percent, down from 5.72 percent and the lowest since May 8, when it was 5.63 percent. For a six-month maturity, the average rate was 5.61 percent, down from 5.72 percent last week, and the lowest since Oct. 31, 1994, when it was 5.51 percent.
In the latest measure of consumer confidence, the Conference Board's May index fell to 101.6, compared with 104.6 in April. Despite the three-point drop, confidence remains at a fairly high level. While there have been signs of a slowing economy, consumers still continue to feel secure about their jobs, family income and the immediate future of the economy, the survey showed. But that does not mean they are ready to spend, according to Ray Worseck, chief economist and manager at A. G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis.
Mr. Worseck said he suspected that the reason the economy was softer than expected in the last month or so was connected with what has been happening in Washington. Discussions on spending and radical tax changes are contributing to uncertainty, and that is becoming a drag on the economy, as people delay making major spending decisions, he said. Mr. Worseck predicted that the economy's underlying fundamentals would eventually reassert themselves, however.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	98.574	97.164	Discounted Rate	5.64%	5.61%	Coupon Yield	5.82%	5.87%	High Price	98.579	97.179	Discounted Rate	5.62%	5.58%	Coupon Yield	5.80%	5.84%	Low Price	98.572	97.164	Discounted Rate	5.65%	5.61%	Coupon Yield	5.83%	5.87%	Accepted at low price	34%	30%	Total applied for	$46,398,632	$51,050,103	Accepted	$14,250,702	$14,371,624	Noncompetitive	$1,345,324	$1,173,415	
 
Both issues are dated June 1, 1995. The three-month bills mature on Aug. 31, 1995, and the six-month bills mature on Nov. 30, 1995.

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence Slips a Bit, Yet Remains Relatively Strong

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Americans' optimism in the economy's future performance weakened in May, the Conference Board said yesterday, though confidence levels remained relatively high.
The board, a business-sponsored research organization, conducts a monthly survey based on a sample of 5,000 households. 
 It said results of its latest survey showed consumer confidence fell 3 points, to 101.6 in May, from a revised 104.6 in April. The April reading was originally reported at 105.5.
"Although the latest confidence readings are somewhat less optimistic than in April, the current level remains strong," said Fabian Linden, executive director of the board's Consumer Research Center.
"While there have been recent signs of a slowing in economic growth, consumers still continue to feel secure about their jobs, their family income and the immediate future of the economy," he added.
The economy has cooled recently from the strong growth of last year, and some economists are concerned that it could slip into recession. Home sales fell a steep 6.4 percent last month, even though mortgage rates are at the lowest levels in a year. Orders for durable goods had their largest drop in more than three years, falling by 4 percent in April.
And unemployment is up, with the number of Americans filing for new state jobless benefits at the highest level in more than two and a half years.
The Conference Board said its survey showed about 24 percent of all consumers said that business conditions were "good," while a moderate 17 percent said they were "bad." Both figures are little changed from April.
Slightly more than 22 percent said that jobs were plentiful, while 24 percent said they were hard to find. The board said both figures were only marginally less positive than a month earlier.
Concerning the future, the board said optimists continued to outnumber pessimists by a margin of almost two to one. Nearly 17 percent expect business conditions will be better in six months, while less than 9 percent fear they will worsen.
Slightly more than one in five consumers surveyed expect their family incomes will rise in coming months, the board said, while only 8 percent foresee a drop in incomes.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Steady as Traders Await Friday's Report on Employment

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar was steady against most leading currencies yesterday, supported by expectations that the United States employment report on Friday would show enough strength to dissuade the Federal Reserve from cutting interest rates.
"Everyone is gearing up for Friday's nonfarm payrolls numbers," said Joe Francomano, a currency dealer at Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank in New York. "If the number is up, hopefully this dollar slide will end. My opinion is that there's no way the Fed will ease rates." 
 Lower interest rates in the United States would hurt the dollar by making dollar-denominated bank deposits less attractive.
The dollar was also bolstered by comments from a Bundesbank official hinting at the possibility of lower German interest rates, which would weaken the mark.
"We cannot rule out another reduction in interest rates," the official, Reimut Jochimsen, said. The central bank last cut German lending rates on March 30, when it lowered the benchmark discount rate by half a point, to a six-year low of 4 percent. The Bundesbank's policy-setting council meets tomorrow.
Trading was thin yesterday, with many dealers inactive ahead of this week's economic reports. On Monday, American markets were closed for Memorial Day, and markets in London, the world's biggest center for foreign-exchange trading, were closed for a bank holiday.
In New York late yesterday, the dollar rose to 1.3905 German marks from 1.3787 on Friday. The dollar slipped to 82.86 yen from 82.94.
Talk that the Federal Reserve might cut rates gained momentum last week after a report on Thursday showed a steeper-than-expected fall in orders for durable goods. The report suggested that the economy might be weakening to a point where the Fed would have to cut rates to stave off a recession. The combined Thursday and Friday losses for the dollar were 5 percent against the yen and 4 percent against the mark.
"The big surprise last week was that the economic news was so bad, and the market reacted sharply," said Bob Gruber, senior currency salesman at Chemical Bank.
Currency dealers said yesterday that they would scrutinize the jobs report and other economic reports this week to see whether the durable- goods report gave an accurate picture of the strength of the economy and the outlook for interest rates.
"The market needs confirmation of the durable-goods numbers," said Paul Farrell, manager of strategic currency trading at Chase Manhattan Bank. "I want to see what the employment numbers are."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Japan's Jobless Rate at Highest Level Ever

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 30

 BODY:
Japan's unemployment rate rose to its highest level ever in April, adding to fears that the world's second-largest economy was slipping back into recession and entering an era of higher joblessness.
The 3.2 percent unemployment rate was up from 3 percent in March and was the highest level since current record-keeping began in 1953. The previous high was 3.1 percent, recorded in May 1987 during an economic slowdown caused by the sharp appreciation of the yen after the 1985 Plaza Accord. 
 Economists said the jobless rate was likely to increase further in the coming months because the recent surge of the yen had once again weakened an economy that a few months ago seemed on the verge of recovering from a three-year slump.
"This is the beginning of a new era, of a new cycle," said Jesper Koll, chief economist for J. P. Morgan in Tokyo. He predicted unemployment would reach 4.3 percent in about a year.
To be sure, Japan's jobless rate is minuscule compared with the 5.8 percent recorded in the United States in April and European rates that range from 8 to 12 percent or even higher. And a rise from 3 percent to 4 percent is not likely to tear apart Japan's strong social fabric.
Still, an increase would be a psychological blow to a country that has prided itself on providing near full employment. Japan's Government and its leading companies have "sort of been committing ourselves to defending the 3 percent unemployment rate with honor," Hiroshi Okuda, an executive vice president of the Toyota Motor Corporation, said recently.
Rising joblessness could bring added pressure on Japan's already unpopular and fragile coalition Government, which is hobbled by internal fighting and a lack of strong leadership from Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama.
Economists say Japan's unemployment figures are understated. Anyone who works an hour in the final week of a month is considered fully employed that month. The figures do not count jobless women who return to being housewives rather than looking for new employment. Women, who are often restricted to clerical work and serving tea anyway, are usually not entitled to lifetime employment.
The jobless situation is hitting young workers the hardest. Among people aged 15 to 24, the unemployment rate is 6.4 percent for men and 6.8 percent among women.
That is because Japan's lifetime employment system preserves jobs for those who already have them, forcing companies to cut costs by curtailing hiring of graduating students. April is the time when graduating students enter the work force, but this year, about 160,000 could not find jobs.
Some commentators have suggested that the trouble young people have been having finding jobs might have contributed to the spread of religious cults like Aum Shinrikyo, which the police say is responsible for the poison gas attack in the Tokyo subways in March.
The fear of spreading unemployment is one factor behind Japan's hard-line stance in automobile trade talks with the United States. Japanese auto companies are reluctant to buy more American parts because that could hurt the already struggling Japanese parts suppliers. (On the other hand, if Washington places 100 percent tariffs on imports of Japanese luxury cars, that too will lead to job losses in Japan.)
A big question is whether the need for new cost cutting to cope with the strong yen will mean the end of the lifetime employment system, in which major companies go out of their way to avoid dismissing full-time male employees. Some analysts say lifetime employment may fray but will probably not break, in that there will not be huge dismissals of employees.
"There has consistently been erosion of lifetime employment," said Mineko Sasaki-Smith, senior economist for Morgan Stanley & Company in Tokyo. "I don't think there will be a big bang and it will suddenly be ended."
The rise in unemployment has been caused by a decline in manufacturing jobs, as the high yen reduces production in Japan or forces Japanese companies to relocate overseas. In April, manufacturing employment was down 3.6 percent, or 550,000 jobs, from a year earlier.
Until now, the workers who left manufacturing have been finding jobs in the service sector. But the service companies can no longer absorb so many workers, said Robert Alan Feldman, director of Asian economic research for Salomon Brothers in Tokyo. Increased discounting is causing a slimming down of Japan's bloated distribution system.
Japan's Management and Coordination Agency, which released today's unemployment figures, said that the number of jobless people in April totaled 2.14 million, up 10.3 percent from a year earlier. The number of people with jobs decreased by three-tenths of a percent, to 64.75 million.
The Labor Ministry said today that there were only 65 jobs for every 100 job seekers in April, down from 66 jobs in March.

Soybean Prices Decline Sharply As Fears of a Poor Harvest Ease

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Soybean prices fell sharply yesterday as forecasts for sunny skies and drier weather eased concern that rain-delayed planting would reduce this year's harvest. Corn and wheat prices also fell.
"We're slaves to the weather," said Victor Lespinasse, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds in Chicago. "And the weather looks drier." 
 On other markets, silver prices slipped while crude oil steadied. The Commodity Research Bureau index dropped 2.72 points, to 232.75.
On Monday, the National Weather Service forecast below-normal rainfall for the next 6 to 10 days in crop areas in Minnesota, North Dakota, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, and normal precipitation for South Dakota, Oklahoma, and Missouri.
Clear weather ahead will allow soybean farmers ample time to plant, analysts said, with no loss of yield because of a shortened season.
Soybeans for July delivery at the Chicago Board of Trade fell 26 cents, to $5.7975 a bushel, the biggest one-day decline since last July 5.
Corn and wheat prices also fell, as the drier weather let farmers resume work following three weeks of excessive rain that left fields too wet to plant.
Soft red winter wheat for July delivery fell 12 cents to settle at $3.735 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. July corn fell 4.25 cents to settle at $2.6675 a bushel.
Silver led prices for precious metals lower amid perceptions that a weakening economy offers little chance for accelerating inflation.
Consumer confidence fell during May for the first time in three months, according to the Conference Board, as economic growth cooled. The report helped to send bond prices soaring, pushing the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond to 6.66 percent, its lowest in 15 months.
"The economy is slowing down; interest rates are lower; there'll be less chance of inflation," Leonard Kaplan, chief trader at Imperial Bank in Los Angeles, said.
Silver for July delivery fell 16.5 cents, to $5.295 an ounce on the Commodity Exchange of New York, its lowest since April 10. June gold fell $1.40, to $385.20 an ounce.
Crude oil futures steadied after a 3 percent drop on Friday. Yesterday, crude oil for July delivery rose 9 cents, to $18.78 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

HEADLINE: Tariff Won't Help American Car Makers

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The proposal by President Clinton and Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, to increase tariffs on Japanese luxury imports is a classic example of one step forward, two steps back. 
 The Clinton Administration is like a quarterback in the closing minutes of a tight game who breaks free up the middle but, harried, confused and pumped up with adrenalin, scores a winning touchdown for the wrong team. Dampening sales of Japanese cars to fight unfair trading practices is a long-awaited move, a step forward, breaking free up the middle.
Unfortunately, Mr. Kantor's economic advisers decided to put the tariff on upscale Japanese performance sedans, a subcategory of the United States car market in which we have no viable entries.
As a result, if the tariff goes into effect, Lexus, Infinity and Acura sales will plummet, but American car makers won't benefit. German car makers -- BMW, Mercedes -- will enjoy the fruits of our crack strategists' labors.

HEADLINE: Vidalia-Onion Rivals Seek Use of the Name

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
BUDDY TALLEY takes pride in growing sweet onions that rival Georgia's renowned Vidalia onions, but he can't sell his Tifton Sweets at Vidalia prices.
He is among a small group of Georgia farmers who cultivate the same varieties as Vidalia growers do but are prohibited by law from using the famous name because they are outside the official growing area. 
 Under the state's 1986 Vidalia Onion Act, misuse of the Vidalia name can carry a fine of up to $20,000.
Mr. Talley, who lives in Tifton, 55 miles from the closest part of Vidalia country, and others are pushing to have the growing area expanded. It encompasses 13 counties and parts of seven others in southeastern and south-central Georgia.
Georgia's 200 certified Vidalia growers benefit from a marketing program that has made the onions famous. The promotion has helped to more than double the value of the Vidalia onion crop in 10 years.
Gary Fairchild, a professor of food and resource economics at the University of Florida, said Washington apples, Idaho potatoes and Michigan cherries benefited from similar programs. "The key is trying to restrict it to a certain area," he said. "If you can find an area that has the climatic and soil conditions that you can differentiate with the consumer, then you're limiting the supply and enhancing the price."
Vidalia, a town 80 miles west of Savannah, is where the onions were introduced. Growers claim they are the sweetest in the world because of mild winters and low-sulfur soil.
But Willie Chance, a University of Georgia onion specialist, said the soil throughout south Georgia is basically the same well-drained sandy loam, ideal for growing sweet onions.
Five of the official growers don't even live in the growing area, but they were included because they were growing before the Vidalia law was passed.
Researchers at the University of Georgia's Coastal Plain Experiment Station, near Tifton, have grown Vidalia-type onions for years for pungency and sweetness tests. When the university opened a new Vidalia onion laboratory earlier this year, it was in Tifton, not Vidalia.
Mr. Talley has been growing onions for 10 years, but his Tifton Sweets are still relatively unknown.
He said five years of tests show his onions are not only sweeter but also milder than some Vidalias. But because they do not carry the famous name, Tifton Sweets sell for 25 percent to 50 percent less than Vidalias.
Mr. Talley says he believes sweetness, not geography, should make a Vidalia a Vidalia. And the industry appears to be leaning his way.
"I think there will come a time when we will have a pungency level as a requirement," said Shirley Manchester, the manager of the Vidalia Onion Committee, an industry group.

HEADLINE: LOOKING FOR LUNCH WITH: Alix Kates Shulman;
A Feminist at Walden Pond

BYLINE: By MOLLY O'NEILL 

 BODY:
AS she strolled through Central Park, Alix Kates Shulman, the feminist novelist and social advocate, looked like any number of well-seasoned New Yorkers. The acceptance of a certain age seemed to soften the web of concern in the corners of her eyes. Her pace was still purposeful, even though these days Ms. Shulman tends to pursue the wild and the edible with the passion she once reserved for tossing off sexual conventions and gender stereotypes.
She kept pointing to and expounding on the park's edible greens. 
 "Dock! Yellow dock!" she cried out. "The leaves can be steamed with garlic, like spinach, but it has a delicious, citric taste. And it produces millions of little brown, wonderful seeds that I use baking muffins or banana bread. And dandelions! If you pick the buds before they flower and pan-fry them, they're delicious, almost as sweet as zucchini flowers."
To hear the voice that has for three decades provided a lyrical narrative of the changing position of women in American society sounding like Euell Gibbons is to worry the fate of feminism. At least initially.
But ambling along in sensible black sneakers, Ms. Shulman, who is 62, tread this troubling notion as carefully as she did the grass around clumps of dandelion greens, patches of purslane and miniature forests of wild chives in the park.
Ms. Shulman said that in 1982, feminism was stagnating on the national agenda. Her first novel, "Memoirs of an Ex-Prom Queen" (1972), sounded a clarion call for feminism, but the politics of the 1980's, along with a tepid marriage and an empty nest, she said, "were making me feel irrelevant, on the road to obsolete." And so in 1982 she went to the family's vacation shack for six months. Alone on a rocky jut of a Maine island, she tested the mettle of her tightly wrapped city soul against the vicissitudes of nature and embarked on a 10-year odyssey that she describes in "Drinking the Rain," a memoir that Farrar, Straus & Giroux published last month. Without benefit of electricity or indoor plumbing -- to say nothing of a deli -- the cause-after-cause, deadline-after-deadline, die-hard feminist eked out meals from the woods and bay, lived by the tides rather than the clock, looking for dinner, she wrote, as well as for "who I am when the tide runs out."
On the island, slogging through slippery seaweed and prodding mud for mussels, snails and clams, she stopped analyzing the world long enough to understand it as she experienced it: a complicated collage whose components are as interdependent as they are paradoxical -- male and female, rich and poor, privileged and oppressed, wild and tame, cooked and raw. Dinner is never far from Ms. Shulman's conversation.
She is not ashamed to say that she cooks every day. "It's true that cooking became a symbol of women's oppression, so there's a certain paradox in glorifying it, a certain danger politically," she said.
Besides, the cooking she talked about -- sweating dandelion greens in garlic over a low, slow flame; chopping wild apples with a Zenlike precision to make chutney; joining land and sea by seasoning steamed clams with minced wild lovage -- recalled spiritual practice more than home economy.
On one level, Ms. Shulman's book could be read as "the feminist goes to Walden Pond." Her retreat to nature, after all, occurred at a time when ecological concerns were becoming more intertwined with feminism and when reaction to technology was, among the middle class, making nature seem romantic again.
"I used to see how everything is connected through the pervasiveness of the gender system," Ms. Shulman said. "After the island, I saw even deeper levels of connection: politics, taste, environment, waste, dinner."
"Drinking the Rain" also echoes books from other leaders of the second wave of feminism. Gloria Steinem's "Revolution Within" (Little, Brown, 1993) and Betty Friedan's "The Fountain of Age" (Simon & Schuster, 1993) address the personal and political issues of aging.
"I thought I was writing of my own unique experience," said Ms. Shulman, who studied history and philosophy as a graduate student. "But when you interact with nature, one of the first things you learn is that no experience is unique, no event is isolated, nothing happens by accident."
Nature, she said, constantly weighs its own paradoxes. And so does she.
For the former full-time advocate, there is a paradox in the fact that she now lives as much of the year as possible in the crude shack in Maine, isolated from politics and ferment.
When the weather makes it impossible to live without heat, she returns to the loft in Chelsea that, for the last decade, she has shared with the high school sweetheart whom she met again after her second marriage dissolved. In New York, she remains active in the pro-choice movement as well as in a number of feminist organizations.
A modern Persephone, she is at ease shuttling between contemplativeness and advocacy. Still, she said, there are political dangers in writing a book about returning to nature and the return to self, particularly at a time when right-wing survivalists are championing nature.
AS she strolled through Central Park, Ms. Shulman identified the paradoxes of her current world view as nimbly as she catalogued her island larder: Scotch lovage, goosetongue, sea rocket, rose hips, goldenrod, sheep sorrel, charlock, bay leaves, wild lettuce and spinach, a panoply of edible seaweed. She takes a certain philosophic pleasure in the abiding, the renewing, the constantly changing.
Her prickly protectiveness of "the natural," "the environment" and the "old fashioned" are the only hints that Ms. Shulman, the contemplative one at one with the world, might tug at Ms. Shulman, the advocate.
"I think of how James Baldwin described the paradoxes of reality," she said, paraphrasing the writer: "One has to hold in mind two ideas that seemed to be in opposition. Accepting life totally without rancor, accepting people as they are, but never, in one's own life accepting reality and injustices as commonplace."
As she walked through the park, she pursed her unglossed lips at the sight of litter scuttling in the spring breeze. Considering the wastefulness of automatic dishwashers and disposable contact lenses, she yanked her short dark hair firmly behind her ear, as if readying for battle. During her walk, she championed the "virtue of frugality."
A breeze, carrying hints of pine and wet grass along with car fumes, sent litter scuttling across Central Park. And her train of thought that seemed destined for the dogma of the virtue of self-control and thrift took a spiritual turn.
"When you strip your life to essentials, you find how little you need and how much you have," she said. "You stop going to the grocery with a shopping list. You go and you look and you smell and you imagine. You interact with what's available. You live in the present tense, confronting real needs, real limits. Maybe I'm not saying this right.
"On the island I realized that corporations and advertising have created this whole consumer culture in which people are always hungry for something they don't have. Buy and dispose, buy and dispose."
The appetite to consume and dispose, she said, pollutes and distorts. "On the island I became free of the power of advertising and corporations," she said. "If you can somehow get to a place where you are not subject to those pressures, you are no longer a passive consumer -- you are a participant in life."
And robust participation breeds a certain sort of skepticism, she said, "about novelty, health fads, food fads, gadgets."
The author, whose early novels let nice girls laugh at sexual conventions, sounds convinced that sexual liberation was a mild-mannered precursor to the liberation of the senses. Particularly the sense of taste.
"Our society tends to channel all sensuality into sex," she said. "It's so limiting. You eat every day, all day. Who has sex that often?"
She's not planning to revise the sexual escapades of her ex-prom queen, or to minimize the role that the sensual played when the heroine of "Burning Questions," first published in 1978, shrugged off her Midwestern background and embraced radical feminism. She wouldn't underplay the tyranny of sex in the life of a young runaway in "On the Stroll" (1981) or the pull of passion in her book about marriage, "In Every Woman's Life . . . " (1987).
Ms. Shulman still calls herself a sexual libertarian. When asked how many times she had married she replied: "Why don't you ask me how many lovers I've had, instead?" Still, literally drinking the rain convinced her that sex was just the beginning of what the body and mind could do.
"The body was a matter of sex in my earlier books, and sex was at the center of women's predicament," she said. "Sex, if you include motherhood, is still close to the heart of women's predicament, which is quite an oppressive fact. The body is capable of all sorts of miracles: the miracle of the mind, of touch, smell, taste, sight."
Unfettering the senses seems to pull appetite squarely into the present tense, into a city whose spirit is defined not by its herbaceousness but by its ethnic varieties.
Even so, she considered a clump of tight dandelion buds in the park. And she evidenced the same thwarted desire she has for the plump orange mussels she's seen, steadily pulling streams of polluted water through the slits of their narrow shells.
"I bought all the books about wild food in the city. I can identify it, but I'd never eat it," she said, suggesting lunch in a cafe along Columbus Avenue. "Let's be in New York!"

HEADLINE: Two in Chile Get Jail Terms In U.S. Killing

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS 

DATELINE: SANTIAGO, Chile, May 30

 BODY:
The former head of the Chilean military's secret police and his deputy were sentenced to prison tonight when the Supreme Court upheld a lower court's ruling that they had ordered the assassination of the opposition leader Orlando Letelier in Washington in 1976.
The decision means that for the first time senior army officers will go to prison for human rights abuses committed under the military dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet. 
 In its ruling, the Supreme Court said the evidence against the two officers was clear: they had orchestrated the car-bombing that killed Mr. Letelier and his colleague Ronni Moffitt on Embassy Row in Washington. An American who worked for the Chilean agency and a former Chilean Army officer confessed their involvement and implicated the two officers.
The high court sentenced Gen. Manuel Contreras Sepulveda, who headed the military's National Intelligence Agency and has retired, to seven years in prison and his deputy, Brig. Gen. Pedro Espinoza Bravo, who is still in active service, to six years.
"This sentence has been given because the officers have been convicted of being authors of the premeditated murder of Orlando Letelier," said Carlos Meneses, secretary of the Supreme Court, whose reading of the decision was carried live on television.
The two officers, who have denied responsibility for the killings, saying they were the work of the United States Central Intelligence Agency, had appealed their 1993 convictions to the Supreme Court.
The ruling was a major victory for the Letelier family, left-wing politicians and human rights groups, who had declared the case a test of democratic freedoms in Chile, six years after General Pinochet gave up power to an elected Government.
Francisco Leon, an economic sociologist for the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, said that by upholding the lower court's ruling, the Supreme Court had showed that it was an independent democratic institution, even though most of the justices were appointed by General Pinochet.
"It is important for the Chilean people to know that they showed to the world that they are more democratic today than in the past," Mr. Leon said.
Sola Sierra, president of the Association for the Disappeared and Detained, said in a television interview: "I am happy because justice has been served. This day is happier than the day that democracy returned to Chile." A Government commission found that 3,000 people disappeared or were tortured during General Pinochet's rule.
Mr. Letelier was Ambassador to the United States under the Socialist Government of President Salvador Allende Gossens, who was toppled by General Pinochet in 1973. At the time of his murder, Mr. Letelier was organizing opposition to the general.
The court's decision came after months of growing tension here in which military leaders threatened a show of force if the officers were convicted and human rights groups threatened to riot if the officers were declared not guilty.
Hundreds of police officers were deployed throughout Santiago today and barricades were placed in front of the courts and military buildings in anticipation of violence. Before the verdict was announced, thousands of people began gathering in front of the courts building, many of them chanting and carrying signs asking for justice.
Tonight, the police reported minor skirmishes at Government buildings, where masked demonstrators threw rocks and gasoline bombs at officers, who in turn fired rounds of tear gas. The demonstration was not believed to be a result of dissatisfaction with the verdict, but a display of force against the police and the Government.
The appeal had been closely watched by the United States, which had asked that the two officers be extradited to stand trial in Washington. The Supreme Court of Chile rejected the request.
"The United States applauds the successful efforts of the Chilean Government to investigate and prosecute the 1976 assassinations in Washington of Mr. Lettelier and his American aide Ronni Moffitt," the United States Embassy said in a statement tonight. "We are gratified that justice has prevailed."
General Contreras's lawyer, Sergio Miranda Carrington, said on Monday night that General Contreras was certain that he was going to be found innocent, but that he would accept the court's decision. General Contreras has been staying at his ranch in Fresia in the south of Chile.

HEADLINE: Stocks Are Mixed as Technology Issues Show Big Losses

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
The stock market closed mixed yesterday, but technology stocks lost big, in part because of the prospect of slowing sales and in part because of profit taking by traders.
Intel, the big semiconductor company, fell 5 3/8, to 110 1/2, for example, after orders for equipment used in making microchips dropped for a second consecutive month in April. 
 Intel was also the most active stock, at 15.1 million shares, or double or triple the volume of the next 12 stocks, all of which were high-tech stocks as well.
"Tech stocks have been the leader in this market, so they were the first to go," said Bill Allyn, director of listed equity trading at Jefferies & Company.
William R. Rothe, managing director of Alex. Brown & Sons, said technology prices had soared too high. "The carnage, if you will, was long overdue," he said.
But nontechnology stocks were largely spared in yesterday's rout. After falling as much as 16 points, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 9.68 points, to 4,378.68. The broader Standard & Poor's 500 closed almost unchanged at 523.58, down 0.07 point.
But the Nasdaq composite index of 4,779 stocks, many of the largest of which are technology stocks, fell for the fourth session in a row, declining 13.17 points, to 858.70.
During the day, the Nasdaq index fell as much as 15.04 points, almost matching the index's largest one-day loss of 15.15 points on Dec. 8, 1994.
Since December, the Nasdaq index's advance has been almost unbroken, rising more than 22 percent by May 23. Even after the recent decline, the index is still ahead almost 20 percent.
But yesterday's market retreat cut across a wide variety of tech stocks. Indeed, of the top 10 declining stock groups in the Standard & Poor's 500, all of the top five were high-tech groups: semiconductors, software, computers, electronic instrumentation, and telecommunications equipment.
Still, most of the damage was concentrated in computer-related stocks. The American Stock Exchange computer technology index, an index of 26 large hardware and software companies, rose more than 40 percent by May 23. But the index has declined three sessions in a row, so the advance for the period was a smaller, but still handsome, 31 percent.
The rout in tech stocks seemed to be independent of the day's news, which added to a picture of a soft economy. The technology stocks started down and stayed down. But the news may have contributed to the continued decline, analysts say.
The Conference Board's index of consumer confidence fell to 101.6 in May, far more than the 102.3 that Wall Street economists had expected. It was also a decline from 104.6 in April, the first decline in three months. Consumer confidence, which was pegged at 1985 equaling 100, has ranged as high as 120.7 in February 1989 and as low as 47.3 in February 1992.
The Semiconductor Industry Association, a trade group, said the "book-to-bill" ratio for manufacturers of equipment used to make computer chips declined to 1.23 in April from 1.29 in March, and down from a record 1.43 in February.
The ratio means the industry got $123 in orders for such equipment for every $100 of equipment actually shipped. It is used as a measure of future demand for computers, which use chips as part of their operating systems.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.29 point, to 281.87, with advancing stocks outnumbering declining stocks by 1,229 to 1,036. Big Board volume totaled 281 million shares. The American Stock Exchange composite index was up 0.59 point, to 491.33.
Among advancing stocks was Hi-Shear Technologies, a military contractor, which rose 3 1/8, to 12 7/8, after an analyst recommended the stock on Dan Dorfman's program on the CNBC cable television channel. Edmark, an educational software company, rose 3, to 34 1/2, after The Wall Street Journal reported favorable analyst comments about the stock.
Among declining stocks was Altera, a designer of integrated circuits, which dropped 6 1/4, to 74 3/8. LSI Logic, another integrated circuit maker, fell 5 3/4, to 67 1/4.
Also, Morrison Knudsen, the big engineering and construction company, dropped 1 1/8, to 5 3/8, after Barron's reported over the weekend that the company might be forced to file for bankruptcy protection because of contracts that might lead to losses.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 1, 1995, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day yesterday about stock trading on Tuesday referred incorrectly to a report to which a decline of technology stocks was linked. The report, on orders for equipment used to make computer chips, is issued by Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International, not the Semiconductor Industry Association.
