HEADLINE: U.S. Is Shying From Bosnian Conflict

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 17

 BODY:
As efforts to stop the Serbian shelling of Sarajevo continue, the pleas of Bosnians for Western military intervention to rescue their besieged capital and dismembered country have fallen on wary ears in the Bush Administration.
President Bush has ruled out sending American ground troops to help end the fighting, but Washington has said it is prepared to lend air and naval support to enforce the embargo against Yugoslavia and safeguard the delivery of humanitarian aid to Sarajevo. 
 Senior Administration officials say those two contingencies are among a range of United States military options, including air strikes against Serbian targets, depending on the effects of the cease-fire that the parties to the Bosnia fighting, meeting in London, agreed to observe beginning Sunday evening. But senior Pentagon officials strongly oppose increased American involvement and there are no imminent plans to intervene militarily.
 
A Quandary for the U.S.
 Bush Administration officials say the crisis in Bosnia poses a difficult quandary for the United States and represents an unwinnable situation for the military.
If Washington does not do more, "the worry is the carnage and the bloodletting goes on and it demonstrates the impotence of the great powers," a senior Administration official said. The alternative is "getting involved in a situation that is in many respects similar to Northern Ireland, and not being able to solve it by military means," the official said.
"If you put enough force in there" you might deal with the fighting, but not with the fundamental religious and ethnic problems that transform the conflict into a guerrilla war, the official said.
Assuming the Administration does not reverse its policy on sending combat ground troops, the options open to the Pentagon include flying air cover for land convoys and supply planes and air strikes against Serbian positions.
 
Administration Reluctant
 Locked in what appears will be a close Presidential race, the Bush Administration appears reluctant to increase American military involvement in Bosnia. But Washington has said that if fighting closes Sarajevo's airfield to the international relief effort now flying in food, medicine and supplies it will contribute aircraft to safeguard the shipments.
A fine line, however, divides two situations: flying protective escort and being drawn into larger air attacks to push Serbian fighters back. Air Force F-16 fighter jets now conducting exercises at Aviano Air Base in northern Italy could attack Serbian mortar and artillery positions in the hills surrounding Sarajevo, but military officials fear this strategy could backfire.
"Air strikes would just make them dig in their heels, fight and inflict greater casualties on Sarajevo," a Pentagon official said. "The Serbs are a hardheaded people who historically have been prepared to take heavy casualties."
A British official familiar with the American military thinking agreed, saying, "A few large explosions would kill a few of them, but you can't intimidate them into stopping by roaring overhead and dropping a few missiles."
Some State Department officials disagree with the Pentagon's analysis, arguing that the Serbs respect military might and that bombing would chase their forces out of the hills.
 
A Need for Artillery
 Air strikes, however, would not achieve much without ground forces to secure the airfield and establish a cordon of 15 to 20 miles around it to protect against Serbian mortar and artillery fire. These forces would have to be equipped with their own artillery to counterattack if necessary.
Officially, the United States has ruled out sending combat ground forces, although planners at the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Washington have drafted scenarios where Marines and the Army's 82d Airborne Division could be sent to Bosnia. Officials say as many as 50,000 troops would be needed, assuming the forces encountered strong resistance from the Serbs.
Pentagon officials say that attacking the 60,000 to 70,000 Serbian regular and irregular troops in the Sarajevo area would toughen the Serbs' resolve and drag American forces into a civil war fed by ethnic animosities that are generations old.
"For us to go in there on the ground would give the existing Government a new rallying point, that outside invaders are besmirching Serbian territory," an Army official said. "We would just become a set of clay pigeons in everyone's shooting gallery."
American ground troops "could be a special target and complicate the situation rather than solve it," Brent Scowcroft, Mr. Bush's national security adviser, said on CNN on July 10.
 
History's Warning
 Military officials say that the tragic images emerging from war-weary Sarajevo coupled with the United States success in the Persian Gulf war has raised unrealistic public expectations that the American military should be capable of quickly ending the fighting in Bosnia.
"People have been mesmerized by Desert Storm," a senior Army official said. "But the Yugoslav military and terrain is totally different. It's far more akin to the kind of fighting that's gone on in Northern Ireland, Lebanon and Vietnam."
History also provides a stern warning. In World War II, Yugoslav partisan forces, including Serbs, tied up 20 Axis divisions in the Yugoslav mountains, even after the Nazis ordered that 100 Yugoslavs be executed for every German soldier killed, military historians said.
State Department and Pentagon officials say that diplomatic efforts under way to negotiate a settlement and the economic embargo of Yugoslavia are the best hopes for a peaceful solution. An eight-nation naval force has sailed into the Adriatic to monitor the embargo.
"From a humanitarian standpoint it's sad," a senior American general said. "But just because it's sad doesn't mean we can solve it."

HEADLINE: Democrats' Spending Gets Mixed Reviews

BYLINE: By MARTIN GOTTLIEB

 BODY:
Aside from getting mugged, Ron Squires's experience in New York City last week was a lot like that of many other delegates to the Democratic National Convention.
He didn't spend much money -- no theater, shopping or five-course meals -- but he had a swell time anyway and he doesn't mind talking about it. And therein may lie the story of the true economic effect of a four-day national spectacle to which the city has hitched enormous psychological, promotional and dollars-and-cents hope. 
 Despite reports of booming business from some quarters and city projections that the convention would generate nearly a half-billion dollars in spending, many merchants and service workers -- T-shirt vendors, cab drivers, restaurant owners and department store clerks -- are left wondering, in the words of one erstwhile Democratic Presidential candidate: Where's the beef?
Yet even Mr. Squires, the lone delegate to report being mugged and beaten, was a fount of praise for the city, and many economic analysts say that the good feeling and word of mouth, coupled with media images largely devoid of grime and crime, may be the city's bottom-line benefit.
"The real question is, in light of everything, would the city have done the Democratic National Convention again, and the answer is absolutely yes," said Barry F. Sullivan, the city's Deputy Mayor for Economic Development.
 
City Exceeded Expectations
 Mr. Squires, a member of the Democratic National Committee's Platform Committee from Vermont, will no doubt be back.
Compared with expectations, "The delegates are just impressed with how friendly and helpful the city is; how much cleaner and how much more of a police presence there is," he said.
But for all the good will, there are questions about whether the convention pumped up the economy as much as the city had projected.
Macy's and Bloomingdale's reported significant increases in visitors and strong indications of increased sales -- as did several topless bars. And for clubs and restaurants like Tatou and the Water Club, business was hectic, star-studded, and all that could have been hoped for.
But in the face of projections that delegates, members of the press and others would pour $72,365,353 in personal spending alone into the economy, many business and sales people made the same observation as their counterparts in Atlanta after the last Democratic convention in 1988: in the words of Felicia Sukur, 27, who was handing out free perfume samples at Saks Fifth Avenue last week, "From what I've heard, Republicans spend more money."
 
Prices Deter Spending
 For Byeong D. Park, the owner of Solomon Gifts on Herald Square, an investment in about 100 Democratic National Convention T-shirts, which he was selling for $14.99, proved reckless. "Most of them I stock, I cannot sell -- just 5 percent," he said midway through the convention.
For Gina Amador, cashier at the Eastern News Shop in the lobby of The New York Hilton, which was bedecked with convention paraphernalia and was one of the convention headquarters, only one item was selling heavily -- newspapers.
And for Cheryl To, the general manager at Keens Chophouse on West 36th Street, an expenditure on advertising, mailings to delegates, and elongated hours translated to just 20 and 30 extra lunches and dinners served each day. "I was hoping we'd get bowled over. It's been calm," she said.
Many delegates said their lack of spending could be explained in two words: high prices. Some New York Yankee T-shirts at Eastern News cost more than $30. And as Natalie Davis, a delegate from Birmingham, Ala., pointed out, "To advertise a special at lunch for $19.92 is not, for many people, a bargain."
Betty Lawrence, executive director of the Metropolitan Taxi Cab Board of Trade, which represents 18 large cab fleets, said taxi business remained flat, possibly because visitors got free passes to public transportation in one of their bags of gifts, many of which were handed out at free buffets to which they were transported by free shuttle buses. "My drivers haven't seen what we had hoped to see," she said. "We had hoped it would turn around the summer."
 
An Expanding Prediction
 Gray Line New York Tours, which provided shuttle transportation for the convention, reported that its usual tour business suffered, falling off by about 15 percent.
"The convention displaced some regular leisure travel people who'd be here in town," said Charles J. Flateman, the company's president. In fact, initial indications are that although roughly 20,000 rooms were rented in connection with the convention, boosting the hotel industry during a traditionally slow period, occupancy was still just under 70 percent.
 
Return Business Expected
 The city based its projections for the Democratic Convention on a 1989 consultants' report for the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center which estimated that the average trade show visitor spent $290 a day. Accounting for inflation, the city estimated that the typical convention visitor would spend $353.
However, besides receiving many freebies, political convention visitors -- particularly Democrats, according to political observers -- tend to spend less than trade show visitors. In addition, hundreds of delegates and members of the press were from the metropolitan region and did not spend money for hotels. And the cost of hotel rooms has fallen by 20 percent since the period measured in the Javits Center report.
Joseph J. Taggart Jr., 26, a Clinton delegate from Leon, Kan., has many exciting memories of his first visit to the city. There was the cab ride to Macy's. ("I didn't know if I was going to live. I think drivers here think horns are magical.") There was the man in the turban whom he tried to photograph and who chased him through Times Square. ("I don't know who he was or what he was bothered by.") There were the bright lights, the tall buildings, and the feeling of safety.
Until the end of the convention, Mr. Taggart had not spent extravagantly. A major purchase, a bell with a picture of New York City on it for his mother, was from Woolworth's. But he planned to spend more on gifts for his five sisters.
"I'll tell you what," he offered. "I wouldn't mind coming back again."

HEADLINE: Budget Crisis Forces California Colleges to Bar the Doors

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, July 18

 BODY:
Like millions of others of his generation, Jorge Garcia took the well-trod road to success in California, parlaying a nearly free public-college education into a good job. Now he must tell those who would follow that the road is closing in front of them.
He grew up in the 60's, the golden days of California's ascendancy. That was when Mr. Garcia, a farm worker's son in the San Joaquin Valley, could pick peaches for 50 hours to earn the $50 needed to enroll at Fresno State College, and then obtain a bargain doctorate at the University of California. Today he is dean of humanities here at California State University, Northridge, where he has had to cut nearly a third of his teaching faculty and tell angry students that many classes will not be available this fall. 
 Similar grim tales are told all across California as its once-flush public institutions face near collapse in the face of the state's gravest budget crisis since the Depression, its public revenues no longer able to support the public services and investment in freeways, dams and aqueducts at the core of the state's historic prosperity. At public schools, universities, state parks, hospitals, AIDS hospices, public libraries, welfare centers and more, staff and clients are preparing for the worst.
 
Cutting $200 Million
 The latest sign of mounting crisis came Friday in San Francisco. The regents of the nine-campus University of California, bracing for a cut of more than $200 million, or 10 percent of its state support, approved an early-retirement plan for senior faculty members, asked staff members to reduce working hours voluntarily and began to prepare for layoffs later this year.
The 107-campus, 1.5-million-student California Community College system recently began to limit admissions for the first time. And some units of the 20-campus California State University system have closed admissions for spring and even plan to eliminate entire academic departments.
"We've lost our ability to meet the demand," Dean Garcia said, before rushing to yet another crisis meeting with the campus president, James W. Cleary.
"This is the worst budget crisis I've seen in my entire career," said Mr. Cleary, set to retire next month after 23 years as Northridge's president. "We are on the borderline between quality and non-quality."
The quandary has called into question the historic definition of California, an inviting land where the streets were figuratively paved with gold. The state offered the ultimate commonweal, a place where the highways were not turnpikes with tollgates but freeways that were free, where going to college at public expense was almost as much a birthright as the warm sun and surf. Some have begun to ask if the state should continue to be so generous.
 
Living on i.o.u.'s
 The state has been without a budget since July 1 and has been paying its bills with i.o.u.'s, or registered warrants, a total of $788 million worth issued by last Thursday. A major crisis looms on July 31, the next payday for state employees, when banks say they may no longer honor the warrants. Already, two credit-rating services in New York have downgraded ratings for California bonds: Moody's Investors Service to Aa1 from Aaa, and Standard & Poor's to A+ from AA. They cited the deadlock between the Democratic-led Legislature and Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican, over bridging the $10.7 billion gap in the budget.
Even under the most optimistic outcome of that struggle, public services face severe cutbacks. The 321,900-student California State University system has cut 5,000 class sections since last year, reduced enrollment by 7,000 and raised student fees 40 percent. Now it is seeking early retirement for faculty members and preparing to lay off about 2,200 of its 38,000 employees, mainly nontenured and part-time faculty members.
Notice has been given that no students will be accepted for the spring semester at four campuses: San Jose State and Sonoma State and the California State Polytechnic campuses at Pomona and San Luis Obispo. The Pomona campus has gone to a four-day workweek for the summer, and San Diego State has planned to eliminate nine academic departments, including anthropology, health sciences and aerospace engineering.
"Nothing is sacred, nothing is protected," said Chancellor Barry Munitz at the state university headquarters in Long Beach. "The biggest problem is uncertainty: we have no assurances what we can pay for." He said he was determined to avoid across-the-board cuts, giving priority to keeping the doors open to the non-elite and the immigrants who have come to depend on the C.S.U. system, and to protecting the next generation of faculty.
 
Making Bad Worse
 In Sacramento, the chairman of the state Assembly's Higher Education Committee echoed that concern. "This could not come at a worse time, because the California economy needs more college graduates and the demographics are changing to nonwhite," said the chairman, Assemblyman Tom Hayden of Santa Monica. "The state government is saying, 'Too bad, we are pulling up the drawbridge,' just when minorities are expecting to enter higher education."
But lobbying efforts by the colleges have been undercut by recent disclosures that the University of California regents privately approved a $2.4 million retirement package for President David Gardner, who leaves Oct. 1, and set up a $100 million fund to subsidize home mortgages for faculty and top executives.
The budget crisis has also reinforced the arguments of those who maintain that California should not subsidize the educations of middle-class and wealthy residents. Even with the recent steep fee increases, for example, a year's tuition at the California State campuses is only about $1,400, a bargain by national standards.
"Over the next five years we will see a very different public higher education system," said John J. Kirlin, a longtime student of California government who is a professor of public administration at the University of Southern California. He urges a change to Michigan's system, with much higher tuition but also more aid for the needy. "If we did that, the schools would continue to grow and students would have more incentive to finish their degrees in a timely fashion," he said.
 
Sapping a Campus's Vitality
 Last August, Governor Wilson's Secretary of Child Development and Education, Maureen DiMarco, wrote to Mr. Hayden that the administration and Legislature "must be free to consider significant changes in higher education policies to accommodate reduced funding bases."
For now, reduced financing means big trouble at the Northridge campus here. From a small satellite campus of Los Angeles State College begun in 1956, it has grown with the vast San Fernando Valley it serves into a major university with 30,441 students and 1,521 faculty, the 39th-largest university in the United States. The 353-acre campus, studded with fan palms and oleander, draws students from the nearly endless suburbs of Los Angeles that stretch from Burbank to the rural reaches of Ventura County.
Reflecting the fast-changing population of the area, the college has major programs in Mexican-American, Afro-American and other ethnic studies. It is also home for the National Center on Deafness, a highly regarded program that incorporates deaf students into regular classes.
Uncertain what it will be able to spend, the college recently notified 158 faculty members that they would be laid off or given early retirement. Together with temporary faculty who will not be rehired this fall, that means a loss of 375, or nearly a fourth of almost 1,500 who taught last year. Officials are assuming that the system will lose from $100 million to $120 million, 10 percent or more, of its state support.
 
Losing the Arts
 "The young and dynamic teaching force will leave the state; that's what will happen to California," said Louise Lewis, a professor of art history who is the faculty president. The cuts have fallen very unevenly, mainly affecting departments like art and music that depend heavily on part-time teachers like Mindy Lorenz, who has been teaching a heavy load of four classes a semester in art history.
"I have not known for a good four weeks if I had a job or if I was going to be paid," Ms. Lorenz said.
Last week, the new freshman class members were on campus for orientation, but no one could tell them what the future held for their educations. "Fees are going up 40 percent, and the university's budget is being cut," said Sal Damji, an engineering student who is the student-body president. "We are paying more and getting less."

Mirabile Dictu And Wonderful Also to Hear

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP

DATELINE: ALBANY

 BODY:
During a break in negotiations on Friday with state legislators, the man who delivered the oratorical jewel of the Democratic convention walked upstairs to the battered third-floor pressroom, shot a little pool on the reporters' table, then settled into a ratty office to discuss his gift.
Like most conventions, last week's was dominated by easy, tub-thumping speeches: politicians who postured for applause after each mundane sentence, who chronicled their personal travails to fill the bathos tub, who led grown men and women in inane chants. 
 "Cheating," Gov. Mario M. Cuomo said. "During a speech, I shake off applause. I was talking to Bill Bradley last night after the speeches. Two or three of the best speeches I ever made, I got not a single round of applause until the end. I gave a Lincoln Day speech with Governor Thompson in Illinois. Nothing, and then a standing ovation. Bill Bradley says, 'That's it, no cheap applause lines, you're writing thoughts.' I don't do the cheap lines."
Mr. Cuomo's nominating speech for Bill Clinton hit all themes dear to Democrats, often without directly mentioning them. He never said "pro-choice" or "school prayer." He talked of a Republican attempt "to tell us what God to believe in and how to apply that God's judgment to our schoolrooms, our bedrooms and our bodies."
He has the writer's gift for making ideas visible: children hearing gunfire before they hear an orchestra; Captain Bush lost at sea, in search of imperceptible economic undercurrents; the quiet catastrophes, the rich hiding behind their walls with polo mallets. (He was going to use golf clubs, but too many Democrats golf.)
He didn't have to recite scripture, like Governor Clinton and Al Gore, to tell you he was religious; a passing reference to the "loaves and fishes" of trickle-down economics did it. He didn't tell you he was educated; just used a little Latin, "mirabile dictu" (wonderful to tell). "You write that in for guys like Bill Buckley." With a small ad lib, he included a wing of the party that felt bruised: "Jesse is right. They are our children."
At convention's end it was plain. Governor Clinton and Senator Gore are speechmakers. Governor Cuomo is the party's orator.
For the press corps that covers him daily here, he can be impossible, a maddening nitpicker when challenged. But fanatic attention to detail is where lovely writing comes from. He started Wednesday's speech 10 days earlier, jotting thoughts on note cards. "You go to sleep thinking about it, you think in your sleep and wake at 3 A.M. thinking about it. You're trying to dislodge your mind from the place it's stuck." And then, "probably because of terror," you see where to start. "Oh, my God, here it was, and you don't stop then. You know you have it. If that happens I can write 10 to 12 hours." He wrote in longhand, giving it to a friend to type. The Governor can't type.
"You write a speech different than an Op-Ed piece. I end a lot with periods or pauses or slash marks that aren't really sentences. I write in talking English. Bill Bradley writes a speech the way you write an essay and read an essay." Then rewriting. He had a Quayle joke: "Bill Clinton and I agree on all the important things -- including how to spell potato," but cut it. "Too cheap." He read parts to his son Andrew and aides. He almost dropped the supply-side section, but several of them urged keeping it. Commentators later said that it was the first time anyone made a major audience understand that policy's failings.
Tuesday night he didn't sleep. "Your head's so full." Noon on Wednesday he rehearsed for a small group. Clinton aides asked him to do more to link the two of them. That afternoon he tied the poor of Hope, Ark., to the cities' asphalt streets. He added a dozen Clinton references, including, "I want to march behind Bill Clinton in a victory parade."
Delivery is the easiest part. Like great teachers, writers, athletes, the orator has something magic inside that even a man who works as hard as Senator Bradley can't reproduce if it isn't there at birth.
There was nothing of Mario Cuomo's personal life in his speech. In contrast, nothing was too personal for Governor Clinton, if it was useful, not his mother's breast cancer or Chelsea's birth. (Of course, there was no point going into nonuseful suffering, such as Ms. Flowers.)
"The lawyer, the advocate, doesn't talk about himself," said Governor Cuomo. "He talks about his client." When the speeches ended, many felt the advocate was a size larger than the younger client he spoke for.
"No regrets," said Governor Cuomo. As he'd said all week, he was "four steps from wistful." And with that, the orator left to talk to the Albany press corps about the fiscal bailout for Nassau and Suffolk counties.

Japan Confronts Global Warming

BYLINE: By PHILIP M. BOFFEY

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
Japan has adopted one of the world's most demanding programs to control global warming. It sets short-term goals and looks a full century ahead. It envisions brilliant technical fixes to capture heat-trapping greenhouse gases and bravely contemplates massive restructuring of cities and industry to lessen the threat.
But is the program real -- or mostly a charade? 
 Officials in the Bush Administration, sore at being portrayed as the world laggard in confronting global warming, incline toward the latter view. They believe the Japanese, in a craven appeal for environmental applause, are promising far more than they can deliver.
But close up, the picture looks mixed. Japan's program is farsighted -- and less than it seems.
For the coming decade, Japan's effort to curb emissions of carbon dioxide, the chief greenhouse gas, is more demanding, on paper, than the American program. The Japanese have set a goal of capping carbon dioxide emissions by the year 2000, whereas the Bush Administration has opposed caps and timetables, relying instead on a range of programs to reduce emissions.
There is no great virtue in a cap. This page, in fact, has argued that a cap could prove needlessly costly. But the cap can also be seen as evidence of determination, and for that, the Japanese deserve high praise.
The Japanese commitment, however, is much less rigorous than generally understood. Japan has not embraced the goal sought by many environmentalists and some European countries -- to hold total national emissions of carbon dioxide in the year 2000 to the levels emitted in 1990. It has made a non-binding pledge only to hold per capita emissions to 1990 levels, allowing room for emissions to grow as population grows.
That might not accomplish any more than the Bush Administration programs. Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry, using population estimates put forth when the pledge was made, says it will allow a 6 percent rise in total emissions. If that is the case, then Japan's emissions will rise just as much as the Bush Administration predicts American emissions will rise. The Japanese environmental agency, using more recent population projections, says emissions can rise only about 3 percent.
The Japanese have also said they will make efforts to stabilize total emissions. But it seems doubtful that current policies can reach even the easier goal. Japan's energy efficiency has leveled off. The Government has shrunk from a carbon tax. And the plan relies heavily on building 40 new nuclear plants over 20 years, a rate that may be hard to sustain over growing opposition.
When the decade ends, observers may well find little difference between the results achieved by Japan and the U.S. Where the two countries differ sharply, however, is on the severity of the global warming problem and the probable need for drastic solutions.
Many Bush Administration officials are skeptics who shy away from corrective action, fearful that it might cause economic harm. By contrast, top bureaucrats and academics in Japan seem convinced that global warming will become serious and require drastic measures, providing profits through new technologies and efficiencies.
What's truly surprising is their extremely long view. Japanese officials say, rightly, that it doesn't make much difference if Japan misses its year 2000 goals. If global warming is a long-term threat, it will have to be met by long-range policies.
MITI has actually issued a 100-year blueprint that lays out, decade by decade, the key steps needed. The plan emphasizes technological breakthroughs. A new research institute is already trying to culture microorganisms to remove carbon dioxide from the air and is looking for processes to remove it from flue gases. Top officials talk matter-of-factly about restructuring industries and cities to reduce the generation of greenhouse gases.
Whether all that will be necessary remains uncertain. But there is little question that, if global warming does become severe, Japan will be in a better position than the United States to cope with it.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
A Mere 141 Words

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
Of the 4,250 words in Bill Clinton's acceptance speech, a grand total of 141 were devoted to international concerns. Those who nodded off briefly at the 40-minute mark of the 54-minute oratorical stew might have have gotten no taste at all of a potential Commander in Chief.
It is hard to avoid drawing two conclusions from this horrendous slighting of foreign affairs: The Democratic Presidential nominee believes that the subject hardly matters to Americans. And he seems to be running away from this unfamiliar international arena for fear of blundering. 
 He should re-examine both judgments.
First, Americans are now far more worried about domestic than foreign affairs, and should be. But they also have to be reassured that Mr. Clinton understands the world sufficiently to be entrusted with their security.
Americans have almost always treated foreign policy as a metaphor for leadership. President Bush knows this full well, and will push his advantages with the voters here. If Mr. Clinton does not take the time to define himself on world politics, Mr. Bush will do the job for him.
International issues were unimportant to the Democratic primaries. And this may have lulled Mr. Clinton and his advisers into thinking the general election will be no different. But neither the Arkansas Governor nor any of his closest aides have ever worked at the center of a national campaign. They soon will discover that Mr. Bush and the press will not leave the world alone. Mr. Clinton's own antsiness about slipping on a foreign banana peel suggests that deep down he grasps this.
Second, Mr. Clinton's limited background on international issues ought to make him wary. But based on the little he has said thus far, he should have the confidence to say more.
Most of the 141 words he uttered Thursday showed good instincts. "I know well that the world needs a strong America," he said, "but we have learned that strength begins at home." An excellent premise that seems to elude Mr. Bush. "The end of the cold war permits us to reduce defense spending while still maintaining the strongest defense in the world." Fine again. He also rightly stressed using force "when necessary," preserving the "common environment" and promoting global democracy and growth.
The two speeches in which he elaborated on these themes were both of high quality. But they left a lot of tough questions to answer and holes to fill.
Mr. Clinton shamelessly dances around free-trade issues. Sometimes he backs free trade; sometimes "fair trade," a code for protectionism. In his acceptance speech, he spoke of "exporting products, not jobs." Code again. To Mr. Bush's great credit, he champions free trade to create jobs.
Mr. Clinton's ambivalence here is particularly distressing because of the centrality he attaches to economics in world politics. He even talks of money-mighty Japan as America's most important partner. If global economics is so crucial, and it is, he ought to give at least one speech saying what he has in mind.
Nor has he been much more specific about how he intends to cut military spending and remain the world's strongest power. He says he would reduce the $300 billion defense budget by $100 billion, but his proposed cuts do not add up to that total.
This is something Al Gore, the Vice Presidential candidate, might have tackled on Thursday. He is an expert. But he, too, skirted national security in his acceptance speech. Of his 2,565 words, a mere 120 dealt directly with world politics.
Mr. Gore's main foreign offering was rather apocalyptic: "The task of saving the Earth's environment must and will become the central organizing principle of the post-cold war world." What on earth does that mean, and how on earth would a Clinton-Gore Administration pay that bill?
The dynamic duo will hurt their campaign if they focus almost exclusively on domestic affairs and virtually brush off international matters. Mr. Bush and the press will knock their heads off.
It may be hard for a team now running more than 20 points ahead in some polls to see this punch coming. But it will come, and land. Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore's scant words about revolutionizing national security policy won't protect them, or reassure Americans.

HEADLINE: Population Growth Imperils the Planet

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"There's Plenty of Room" (letter, June 30) by Sheldon L. Richman, senior editor of the Cato Institute, merits serious questioning on several counts. 
 It is meaningless, if not outright dangerous, to suggest that population density is unimportant and that there should be no concern about population pressure because the average density per square mile in the world is low. Comparative density figures are useful in describing population distribution, but they take on meaning only related to the opportunities and limitations of the ecological and economic environments.
Mr. Richman dismisses any limitation to population growth that might be caused by resource depletion by claiming that "every resource gets cheaper every year." Are we to conclude that there is a never-ending supply of oil, gas, coal, arable land, tropical forests, fish?
He cites areas and spots with high densities that are well off economically, presumably indicating that high densities are of no concern anywhere. One wonders, however, how many Hong Kongs, Singapores and Taiwans can be expected to achieve viability in the world.
More important, Mr. Richman ignores the evidence of population pressure, including widespread soil deterioration; increasing desertification; landlessness; food shortages, hunger and malnutrition; unemployment and underemployment in rural and urban areas. Perhaps he should look at such cities as Lagos, Calcutta, Kinshasa and Mexico City before reaching the conclusion that high densities are no problem.
To state, as Mr. Richman does, that there is no evidence that population growth impedes economic growth is misleading. Present population growth rates in many African countries, for example, are more than 3 percent a year, while most countries are experiencing growth rates in national incomes substantially lower than that.

HEADLINE: Why This Recession Is Different;
A Debt Puzzle

 BODY:
To the Editor:
We hear much these days about the Federal debt as a percentage of gross national product. In 1944, under President Franklin D. Roosevelt, it was 110 percent of G.N.P. We won World War II, and there was very little inflation. Today it is only 65.6 percent of G.N.P. We also hear much about Federal spending as a percentage of G.N.P. In 1944, under Roosevelt, spending was 42.1 percent of G.N.P. Today it is only 24.5 percent of G.N.P. 
 Both the Federal debt and spending are lower compared with G.N.P. than they were under Roosevelt in 1944. But we have the highest unemployment since the Depression. What's wrong?

HEADLINE: Dream Team Nightmare

 BODY:
To the Sports Editor:
I am troubled when I think of the nationalistic gloating that will surely unfold, expecially around the Dream Team, in Barcelona, Spain. 
 There are many disturbing contradictions connected with basketball (as in football and baseball) and its collegiate minor leagues: an increasingly racist and violent white population cheers on a predominantly African-American team -- as in the National Basketball Association arenas; the silence of these superstars about the social and economic deterioration in the nation; the white backlash against affirmative action for youth of color who simply wish an education that ignores the affirmative-action aid for young men and women who are exploited for their athletic ability; the anticipated victory celebration with a president whose policies have meant increased misery for millions, especially people of color, and on and on.
When the Dream Team victory euphoria wears off, as it surely will, the deep divisions we have as a people will remain -- in the South Bronx, South-Central Los Angeles and Ithaca.

HEADLINE: FILM;
Movies of Iran Struggle for Acceptance

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER

DATELINE: TEHERAN, Iran

 BODY:
THERE ARE NO NUDE SCENES. In fact, men and women rarely ever touch. There are no "Lost Weekends," featuring Iranian Ray Millands, no alcoholics -- no alcohol -- no "Saturday Night Fevers," bars or discos. There is, in short, nothing remotely resembling sex, drugs or rock-and-roll.
But despite the daunting limitations imposed by the Koran, or the Islamic Republic's literal-minded interpretation of Islam's holy book, Iranian film is flourishing. Some 13 years after the revolution that toppled the Shah and his Western-oriented regime, Iran is turning out a growing number of impressive, small-budget, quintessentially Iranian movies. They explore with candor that often borders on bitterness the searing social, economic and personal problems of ordinary Iranians in post-revolutionary Iran. Overcoming the obstacles of censorship at home and suspicion abroad, these films have increasingly been winning critical acclaim and prizes at international film festivals. 
 "In 1990 alone, we had 330 entries in international film festivals, and we won 11 first prizes," said Sayed Mohammed Beheshti, the director of the Farabi Cinema Foundation, the Government-sponsored but quasi-independent group whose mission is to increase the quantity and quality of Iranian films.
Richard Pena, the program director of the Film Society of Lincoln Center in New York, called contemporary, or post-revolutionary, Iranian film "one of the most exciting in the world today." In November, the Film Society will present a series of 15 to 20 contemporary Iranian films, a first for the society.
Much is still taboo in Iranian cinema -- women with uncovered hair, women singing on screen or dancing. And Government censors still ban films that they conclude openly challenge the legitimacy of the Islamic republic, of rule by Moslem clerics and of the country's numerous religious martyrs -- first and foremost among them, the revolution's leader, the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, whose stern, unsmiling visage continues to adorn all Government offices and many a private home. But as the revolution has evolved, many of the most fundamentalist and dogmatic film censors have been replaced by younger, better educated men and women, who at least by comparison with their predecessors, are more tolerant.
If post-revolutionary Iranian film is slowly winning international recognition, its success is attributable to the fierce determination of a handful of talented Iranian film makers who have courageously tested and stretched the cultural restrictions of this dour regime. It is also due in part to Mr. Beheshti and his foundation's dogged, politically savvy efforts to promote movies that are original, nonpropagandistic and, in Iranian terms, daring.
Today, about 30 percent of Iranian films are Government-made, work with which Mr. Beheshti has no involvement and for which he has even less regard. But his foundation provided assistance -- such as long-term, low-interest loans, subsidized film and studio facilities -- to about 35 percent of the 70 Iranian movies made by the private sector in 1991.
"Given Iran's image abroad, we've had a hard time overcoming the shock generated by our requests to participate in festivals," said Mr. Beheshti, a 40-year-old, German-speaking film buff who, unlike most Iranian officials, does not sport a beard. "We had four years of correspondence with the Germans before they let us participate in the Berlin festival. It was the same with the Italians. We finally got a booth at the Milan festival in 1986. But few people were willing even to watch our films then. Most just ate a few pistachios and left. So it has been tough persuading people that our films are not just about people praying."
In some ways, the evolution of the Iranian film industry mirrors that of the society itself. For one thing, there has always been censorship in Iran; what has changed is who the censors are and what they censor for.
The first modern Iranian film was produced in 1964, Mr. Beheshti says. After that, the industry grew rapidly, though always under the watchful eye of the Shah's so-called exhibition board. The Shah's regime preferred syrupy melodramas and action films, as did the Iranians, who flocked to the movies, then and now among the cheapest forms of entertainment. But artistic film makers, those who strived to make movies that highlighted the plight of the poor or contained a whiff of criticism of the regime, suffered under the Shah. Their films were often banned. A few had to choose between not making movies and exile.
In the first years after the 1979 revolution, just a few movies were made. Film makers and intellectuals in general were hampered not only by the post-revolutionary chaos and the bloody power struggle that followed the fall of the Shah but also by the Iraqi invasion of Iran only a year after the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini had come to power.
Despite the chaos and the war, the Farabi Foundation was established in 1983, and the number of films being made increased immediately. That year, 23 movies were produced. In 1984, the number rose to 57; in 1991, when Iran produced 70 films, the total almost equaled its pre-revolutionary record of 90 films in 1972.
But what delights Mr. Beheshti, he says, has been the improvement in quality and the expansion of subjects now being critically addressed. Today film makers are exploring such politically sensitive topics as the Iran-Iraq war. For example, "Flight Into the Night," made in 1985, is about a group of Iranian soldiers who were either severely wounded or killed after being surrounded by their Iraqi counterparts. "There is no glory or victory for these men," Mr. Beheshti said. "There is no triumph at all in this movie."
Over the objections of the Supreme Defense Council office that was responsible for rallying public support for the war, the film was shown, in Iran and abroad. So was "Marriage of the Blessed," Mohsen Makhmalbaf's savage portrait of the effects of the war, made in 1989. Haji, the film's hero, is a combat photographer who keeps having flashbacks. When he tries to document for his newspaper the misery of the poor in the slums of south Teheran, the only photo the paper publishes is one of a sunflower.
At the office, Haji encounters Youssef, a friend who served at the front with him. Youssef's face has been partially blasted away in battle. "Haji," the mutilated veteran importunes the shocked photographer, who instinctively shrinks away. "Don't you recognize me?"
Haji's marriage to the daughter of a wealthy war profiteer also begins traumatically when the groom, repelled by the lavishness of his own marriage feast, starts ranting about his father-in-law's corruption. "He will defeat the revolution from within!" Haji screams at his host and his stunned bride. "The oppressors are coming back." Haji's subsequent confinement in an isolated, eerie hospital ward filled with other shellshock victims forced audiences to face the unseen victims of the war that the Ayatollah Khomeini chose to continue years after Iraq sued for peace.
"I wouldn't say that Makhmalbaf's films question the revolution itself," said Mr. Beheshti, when asked about the savage attacks in the Iranian press on the director. "I think he's questioning parts of it," he added diplomatically.
But even highly respected directors like Mr. Makhmalbaf, who comes from a devoutly religious family, have run afoul of the censorship system, which under the clerics censors first the scripts and then the final product. The fate of a recent Makhmalbaf film, "The Time to Be in Love," illustrates the often deadening effect and erratic results of persistent clashes between pragmatists and radicals on Iranian culture, and on movie making in particular.
The film, which focuses on a love affair between a married woman and a stranger, was screened and highly praised last year at the Fajr film festival, Iran's own annual festival of Iranian and foreign films. But after radicals savagely attacked the Ministry of Islamic Guidance for approving a movie about the mortal sin of adultery (even though it shows no sex), the Ministry suppressed the work.
One of Iran's best films in recent years and one of the few to be shown commercially in the United States, "Bashu, the Little Stranger," was withheld for three years before its release in 1990, according to its director, Bahram Beizai.
"Bashu" is the story of a 10-year-old stowaway who is adopted by a woman in another part of Iran after his parents are killed and their village destroyed by Iraqi bombs. It was called "small, simple and quietly effective" by Janet Maslin in The New York Times and "pure joy" in The Los Angeles Times.
But Iranian censors did not initially share the enthusiasm, despite the fact that the 54-year-old Mr. Beizai is among the country's most admired directors. "Ershad, the Ministry of Islamic Guidance, objected to the film not only because it was perceived as being antiwar but also because the central character was a woman," he said in an interview at his home in a Teheran suburb. "To this day, publicity posters for the film show Bashu, and not Susan Taslimi, who plays Nai, the main character," he complained.
A few years later, Miss Taslimi decided to go into exile in Sweden. Mr. Beizai says the move reflects the hardships that actors and film makers face in the Islamic republic. Miss Taslimi, whom Mr. Beizai calls one of Iran's finest actresses, came under pressure soon after the revolution to play characters who were Islamically correct. Specifically, revolutionary actors and actresses were expected to take parts in plays that often portrayed various other nations as animals -- mice, cats, dogs. But Miss Taslimi refused, protesting in a letter to the director of the National Theater that this was demeaning for performers. She was fired, Mr. Beizai said, although he continued to use her.
In 1981 Mr. Beizai made "The Death of Yazdgerd," about the death of the last Persian king before the Arabs came to Iran in the seventh century. It has still not been released. "The film really had three strikes against it," said Mr. Beizai, who sports a gray, neatly trimmed mustache. "The censors did not feel that the film's position on Islam was clear. Second, they objected to the fact that the film was made shortly before all women were required to have their hair covered in public. And three, the film's central character was a woman, and that woman was Susan."
When Mr. Beizai made his next movie, "Maybe Some Other Time," the Ministry said it would authorize the script, provided he did not cast Miss Taslimi in the lead role. Mr. Beizai refused. "She was so nervous making it that she broke out in hives," he recalled. "But she was committed to the project and we persevered. However, she left Iran soon after that."
In March, the film was shown on Iranian television, to wide acclaim.
Students of Iranian cinema say that in some ways, the Islamic revolution has not dramatically affected art films. "Before the revolution, there were only four or five directors making intelligent, artistically valuable films," said one film devotee. "Today it is those same people -- Makhmalbaf, Beizai, Darioush Mehrjui and Abbas Kiarostami -- who are still making those films."
Both Mr. Beizai and Mr. Beheshti say they are most encouraged by the new young directors who are finding creative ways of circumventing some of the more unwieldly thematic restrictions and requirements. "Iran is now turning out some 15 first-time directors each year," said Mr. Beheshti.
Mohammad Atebbai, of the Farabi Foundation, agreed. "Many of them deal quite candidly with social and political problems, despite the limitations," he said.
Those limitations are not merely political or religious. They are also financial. "We couldn't make 'Star Wars' or 'Terminator 2,' " said Mr. Beheshti. "They are too technologically sophisticated and expensive for us to produce. The average Iranian film costs $130,000."
But Iranians do see virtually every American movie. While videocassette recorders are illegal in Iran, they are omnipresent in middle-class households. Each week, networks of young free-marketeers deliver door to door the latest, usually pirated, videocassettes, tucked furtively under newspapers.
"Iranians, like most people, prefer American films," said one Iranian journalist. "We're pleased that our films win prizes, but what we really want to see is 'Basic Instinct.' "
No one expects an Iranian director to produce a film criticizing the revered Ayatollah Khomeini or any of the senior clerics who continue to rule. Nor do they expect to see women singing or dancing or without "hejab" or head scarves.
Mr. Atebbai said restrictions had led Iranian directors to be, as he put it, "creative." When a script recently featured a role for a Western woman, one director filmed her with a towel wrapped around her head, as if she had just emerged from a shower.
But what about epic films, such as, say, a movie about the Romans? Mr. Atebbai initially demurred and then allowed himself a tiny smile through his thick black beard. "We don't make films about the Romans," he replied.

HEADLINE: Skippering a Canal Boat

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON; JAMES BARRON is a reporter on the metropolitan staff of The Times.

 BODY:
"IS that one of Libby's boats?" the man in the baseball cap said.
It was more of a greeting than a question. There I was, staring up at him from the bottom of what seemed like a rectangular well. I had nosed in at just the right angle and just the right speed and was hoping that he would not realize that it was my first day on the New York State Barge Canal System, the 525-mile liquid highway that traces the route of the old Erie Canal. I was determined not to slam the bow into the slimy green walls of Lock 26, east of Clyde, N.Y. 
 These days there is no Sal, and no choruses of "low bridge, everybody down" -- things on the Erie Canal are not what they used to be. Runners and bicyclists have replaced the mules that once lumbered along the towpaths. The canal itself, once the lifeline of the industrial crescent that was the Midwest, is now mostly the domain of pleasure boaters. In a week on the Erie, I saw only one big old-fashioned barge, and it was empty.
Libby's boats, as they seem to be known from Albany to Buffalo, are flat-roofed copies of 19th-century canal vessels that can be rented for $1,200 to $1,800 a week; the prices vary by season, with the highest in midsummer. Libby is Elizabeth Wiles Wing, who manages the four-boat rental fleet of Mid-Lakes Navigation Company Ltd. Her father, Peter Wiles, started the company in the 1970's as a cruise line, sailing 65-foot double-deck boats on three-day, two-night trips between Albany, Syracuse and Buffalo.
The smaller rental craft were added in the 1980's. The originals they are modeled on did not have lumbering diesel engines, electricity, showers, gas stoves, steel hulls or something called a bow thruster. But there is another difference. The originals ran on a schedule, leaving the sailors no time to bike along the towpath, buy tomatoes at a farm marvel at how the landscape matches the palette of the Hudson River School or borrow a newspaper from a locktender to find out what movies the local theater was showing.
Every fourth-grader knows that the Erie Canal came along at just the right moment in American history, opening the way to the West despite the objections of Southerners like Thomas Jefferson, who called it "little short of madness." The canal was eventually eclipsed by railroads, yet it remains a throwback to a slower world, one in which bridges are raised at the toot of a horn and lockkeepers polish brass electrical switches.
It was modernized and rerouted twice -- only short stretches of the New York State Barge Canal System follow the channel dug for the original Erie -- but the canal has not lost its idyllic cadences: rain dancing on the metal roof of a canal boat, waves lapping against the bow after the anchor has been dropped in the moonlight, herons flapping by the shore. Canal fanatics insist that the Erie is as picturesque as the Rhine; the 80 or 90 miles that a friend and I traveled last fall was a ribbon of farms and forests and picture-postcard towns like Pittsford and Spencerport and Fairport, which has an odd-looking little liftbridge that we sailed under and, later, biked over.
Our trip was scheduled to begin on a Saturday morning in early September, but in fact it began on Thursday evening at Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan, where I packed my 10-speed bicycle off to Albany in an Amtrak boxcar. On Friday, I caught an Albany-bound train, claimed the bike and met my friend, who had driven in. We took the car west on the New York State Thruway, which roughly follows the east-west canal route.
The car was packed with everything we had been told we needed to take -- clothes, food and bicycles -- but we had planned to get up early on Saturday and go to the local supermarket for perishables. There wasn't time. Even though we had spent the night at a bed and breakfast in a 19th-century Greek-revival house not far from the Mid-Lakes dock, Libby was expecting us at 10 A.M. sharp. So we went straight to the pier and decided to buy our chicken and milk once we were under way.
The dock is on the Cayuga-Seneca Canal, which runs through Cayuga Lake, at 38 miles the longest of the Finger Lakes that slice through central New York State. While my friend and I lifted our suitcases and less-than-full picnic basket on board, Mrs. Wing gave the boat, the Owasco, a final once-over, checking the fuel level in the tank, test-blowing the horn, trying out the hand-held two-way radio.
You can't water ski from one of Libby's boats: top speed is about 6 miles an hour. Mrs. Wing says they are the only boats in the United States designed specifically for use on canals with locks. Other boats are built for other reasons -- Boston Whalers are made of low-maintenance fiberglass, which would not withstand a close encounter with a lock wall. So the Wileses designed and built their own sturdy vessels of steel and wood in their own local shipyard.
They are flat-sided but not quite flat-bottomed: they have a V underneath that makes steering easier. They have diesel engines because they are safe: it is hard for a first-time captain to do much damage if he or she cannot go very fast, and diesel fuel is far less combustible than gasoline. Diesels are also economical. The tanks on the Owasco hold 100 gallons of fuel; we used about a third, Mrs. Wing told us after we had returned.
Even as we marveled at the canal's turn-of-the-century engineering, we were never more than a few steps from all the conveniences of home. (Well, all but one. No dishwasher.) Somehow the Wileses squeezed everything into extremely tight spaces without leaving us feeling the least bit cramped. The galley had enough room for a dining table as well as a sink, a refrigerator and a gas stove. We cooked in the whole week. The plates, pots, pans, glasses and silverware came with the boat; so did the mugs, the salt and pepper, the aluminum foil and the dishwashing detergent. All we had to bring was the food.
The boat sleeps six, with two sleeping spaces with double beds and a reasonably comfortable fold-out couch in the galley. There are two heads, two separate bathroom sinks and a shower.
A typical day on the boat? Hardier sailors would have weighed anchor at 5:30 in the morning. I don't think we got going before 10 more than one day the whole week. With no expressway exits or change-in-Chicago airline connections to worry about, it was just traveling from whenever we started until whenever we felt like tying up for the day.
We learned everything we needed to know about piloting a canal boat in the first couple of hours, before Mrs. Wing hopped off and left the navigating to us. It may sound as though you need years of boating experience and a postgraduate course in water safety before casting off, but we had neither. That may explain why, steering with the tiller, I encountered the against-the-reflex problem I always have on British roundabouts: to go left, push the tiller to the right; to go right, push the tiller to the left.
And then there is the bow thruster, a small motor that guides the front end of the boat left or right in short bursts governed by a toggle switch next to the throttle. This is a big help when you are lining up against a lock wall. I am certain that no self-respecting barge captain would use one. I am also certain that we would not have made it through a dozen locks without it.
As Mrs. Wing was showing us the controls, I asked if she worried about turning her boats over to amateurs. "I used to," she said. "The hardest part was not to push them over and grab the tiller and save my boat. It's easier to let them hit. They'll be less likely to do it again." Of course, there is always the $500 damage deposit. (Yes, we got the $500 back after the trip.)
Locking through turned out to be the canal-boat equivalent of parallel parking, except that it takes at least two people: one to steer, the other to handle the lines. Three beeps on the horn or a call on the radio and the huge gates swing open. You glide into the lock, aiming for ladder-like rungs along the lock wall. The person who's not steering stands midships and throws a line around a rung to steady the boat in the water. Enter the lock too fast and you will overshoot the rungs. You could ram the huge iron gate at the far end. Enter at too sharp an angle and the bow will be too far from the rungs, even if the stern is nudging the wall.
When you are down at the bottom of an empty lock, the lockkeeper looms over you like Goliath, 30 or 40 feet above you, on solid, carefully landscaped ground. He flips a couple of levers. Well-oiled gears turn. The water level rises. The boat rises. The person with the line moves the rope up the ladder rungs. The locktender shrinks to normal size as you come up to the top of the lock. A three-minute, three-million gallon miracle.
PULLING away from the Mid-Lakes dock on the Owasco, Mrs. Wing took us on a practice run through a nearby Seneca Canal lock. She choreographed the locking-through like an air-traffic controller guiding a plane to a runway. We followed the instructions, cutting the throttle, edging right and left to line up with the lock and looping the line over the ladder, one rung at a time.
Once through, we turned around and practiced pulling up alongside an abandoned barge until we had the feel of the boat. Then we went through the lock a second time and turned around again -- no instructions this time, and Mrs. Wing did not grab the tiller. Then we tied up and she got off. It was the last time we would see her for a week. Or so we thought.
We chugged north toward the Cayuga-Seneca Canal's intersection with the Erie's east-west spine, in the heart of the Montezuma National Wildlife Refuge. Once mostly marshland, it was drained in the 19th century to build the Erie. Now 300 species of birds live there. We were just getting out the zoom lenses when the engine sputtered. I pushed the throttle to full power. The engine died. I turned the key, but the engine would not turn over. Then I tried to call Mid-Lakes on the two-way radio provided with the boat, but although we had been under way for less than an hour, we were out of range. We drifted from one side of the channel to the other. Eventually, a passing cabin cruiser promised to send help. After another hour, I saw a Mid-Lakes boat in the distance with Mrs. Wing at the helm. It pulled alongside and a mechanic -- the person who had in fact built our boat -- jumped aboard. He lifted our engine hatch and twisted a bolt that regulated air flow to the engine. It ran fine the rest of the week.
By late afternoon, about five hours after we left the Mid-Lakes dock, we reached the intersection with the Erie Canal and the blue-and-gold sign -- Albany to the right, Buffalo to the left. I pushed the tiller to the right, sending us left -- literally into the sunset.
There is a timelessness to this part of the canal, but time was very much on my mind. The locktenders used to be on duty until 11 P.M. To save money in an era of deficit-induced budgets, the state cut their hours back to 7 P.M. We were determined to get through the two locks leading to Clyde and tie up for the night -- there had to be a supermarket within walking distance where we could buy the perishables we didn't buy back in Cayuga. We glided into the second lock with 15 minutes to spare.
In Clyde, founded by 19th-century Scottish immigrants, we tied up under a tall bridge. After a climb up a grassy bank and a 10-minute walk through town, we found the market.
The quiet, meandering sections of canal were an antidote to the telephones, computers, round-the-clock television and harried meals that too often define everyday life in the late 20th century. The long stretch between Clyde and Lyons, where the canal cuts through old farms and fields, is a tableau from the years after the War of 1812. That was when America went canal crazy, building more than 4,000 miles of artificial waterways and opening back-country farms and out-of-the-way mills to hard-drinking, hard-driving canal barge captains. Just after sunset on our second day, the canal was a mirror, framed by tall old trees and steeples -- the churches of Palmyra, which says it has the only intersection in the country with churches on all four corners.
A few miles west are Macedon and one of the best preserved relics of the old Erie Canal -- an original lock, complete with wooden gates. Several hundred yards south of Lock 30 on the modern canal, it is remembered for a 19th- century traffic jam that began when a too-long raft tried to go through. More than 100 boats piled up on either side of the lock, waiting, horns tooting. The lock keepers walked away, leaving the boatmen to sort things out. It took three days, but when the locktenders came back, the raft and the other boats had cleared out. (Other places where the current canal path deviates from past routes are detailed in the "New York State Canal Guide: Everything the Canaller Needs to Know and More," which Mid-Lakes published last year and sells for $19.95 a copy.)
Somewhere at the bottom of the canal between Pittsford and Rochester is a yellow beach umbrella that had been shielding us from the sun. A gust of wind lifted it out of its socket near the tiller; it sank in seconds. This necessitated a mooring at noontime and a fast convenience-store search for a wide-brimmed hat and higher-power sunblock than the SPF 15 we had brought along. Instead of a straw boater, I ended up with a Buffalo Bills cap, which turned out to be a great conversation starter. If only I followed football.
We replaced the much-missed umbrella the next morning in Spencerport in a sleepy-eyed negotiation with a restaurateur. I put $21 on his bar. He put an umbrella from one of his patio tables and a large cup of coffee in our hands. Back on the boat, we lashed the umbrella to a rail to hold it in place. Then we turned around. I had figured that we needed to head back then to make it to the Mid-Lakes dock by the end of our week. But we got to the Cayuga-Seneca turnoff too soon -- we had forgotten to factor in the time we lost to the engine breakdown -- so we decided to keep going east, deep into the Montezuma refuge, where the canal laborers had had to stand waist deep in water as they built the 31 stone spans of the Montezuma Aqueduct. Part of it is still standing, like a single Roman ruin.
The next day, running at full throttle, we got as far east as Lock 24, a marvel of spit-and-polish precision in Baldwinsville. The locktender gave us an impromptu tour, leading us across the bridge formed when the doors of the lock swing shut.
Pride has always been a part of the canal's identity. Gov. DeWitt Clinton's departure from Buffalo in 1825 was signaled "by the booming of a line of cannon stationed at suitable intervals all the way across the state to Albany and down the Hudson to New York City" that took 80 minutes. So Roy G. Finch, the state engineer and surveyor, declared in a pamphlet written for the canal's 100th anniversary. Mr. Finch called it "a grand salute 500 miles long, announcing to the people of the state the completion of the most stupendous undertaking of their time."
Smitten with the Panama Canal a century later, industry was divorcing itself from the Erie. But Mr. Finch trumpeted the advantages of the New York route. "It is 10 times as long as the Panama Canal," Mr. Finch wrote. "It has many more structures than the Panama, and some of its structures are the most notable in the world."
That's typical canal hyperbole, I know, but after a week of locking through, I find it hard not to lapse into it myself.

HEADLINE: CLASSICAL VIEW;
Today, a Bach Might Have A Hard Time

BYLINE: By Edward Rothstein

 BODY:
There was once a time when the early-music movement sought refuge from the contemporary musical scene in an alternative universe of shawms and sackbuts, forgotten repertory and neglected customs; it wanted little to do with ordinary musical life. Faced with the widespread absence of musical education, the movement created its own scholarly universe. Faced with the chasm between art-music listeners and contemporary music, it assembled its own audience. But last month, at the Berkeley Festival and Exhibition in California -- a biannual gathering of the players, instrument makers and scholars who have created this distinctively 20th-century movement -- the once monkish detachment was not to be found; the pressures of the present were evident in many discussions about the past.
In a symposium on Bach, for example, the subject was not historical performance practice or once common debates over style, but the vexing problems of contemporary life. The supposedly pastoral world of early music was appealed to for insights into our own more troubled era: Did Bach's career hold any lessons for the contemporary composer? Did the economic relationship between artist and patron in Bach's time suggest insights into the relationships between the contemporary performer, composer and patron? 
 The discussion left Bach seeming a little less pristine and a little more modern; but the longer I have thought about the subject, the greater the differences between his art and ours have come to appear. Bach, after all, has almost biblical status; we can still react to his music as Goethe did when he first heard "The Well-Tempered Clavier": it sounded "as if the ethereal harmony were communing with itself, as might have happened in God's bosom shortly before the creation of the world." In addition, Bach's genius was accompanied by the composer's apparently humble view of himself as craftsman. He was part of a dynasty of musicians in Eisenach whose name became generic for town musicians -- "die Baache." "I was obliged to work hard," he wrote. "Whoever is equally industrious will succeed just as well." He turned out weekly cantatas for church services, composed for a prince's court, taught schoolchildren; it took a half-century to edit his works.
What would be a contemporary counterpart to such a figure? The only composers who write so often and so routinely, who tailor their music to suit the occasion, who treat music as a craft and patrons as bosses, are those who write for television commercials or the movies. Their music serves a particular function and is often executed with great skill, but no one could associate it with ethereal harmony.
The problem is that even if we imagined a modern composer of Bachian abilities with a munificent patron, we couldn't imagine that music of the importance and range of Bach's would result. Patronage and funding are not determining factors; economics and sociology distract us from more profound issues.
Bach would have agreed. He had different ways of thinking about the world of finance and the world of music. His letters are mostly about business, about accounts, contracts, expenses. His appeals to his bosses begin with almost Uriah Heep-ish submission but end in demands and complaints. Often mistreated, he was hard-nosed, arrogant, petty.
Music was another matter. It should, he wrote, have no aim other than the glory of God and the "re-creation of the soul . . . . Where this is not kept in mind there is no true music, but only an infernal clamor and ranting." Scores bear dedicatory abbreviations like "S.D.G." (for Soli Deo Gloria: To God alone be praise) or "J.J." (Jesu Juva: Help me, Jesus). As for the soul, Bach often seemed to treat it in the cantatas as a sensuous being ruled by reason as well as by faith. His fugues are even greater demonstrations of reason's powers. Bach's themes have distinctive personalities, but they are rigorously controlled by the laws of counterpoint. Each voice seems both idiosyncratically free and indissolubly bound to others. His fugues anticipate the Englightenment; the powers of reason create a community of like minds.
What happened to these notions of higher law? A century after Bach's time, that faith in Reason and in God was less fervent. Their authority was often replaced by a new conception of Art itself. Art set its own laws; it required originality, technical advancement and often provocation. The greatest praise was the assertion that a work was ahead of its time. Great masterpieces flourished in the religion of Art.
But more recently, that aging religion has created caricatures. In the name of "advancement," some music can become private and esoteric; in the name of "provocation," a mannerist avant-garde has developed, with its own cliched conventions. For some, Politics has emerged as a new law, with political opinion providing authority and guidance.
The early-music movement hoped to turn the clock back, at least for its own performances, to find its law in historical authenticity. Now that, too, will no longer suffice. There often seems to be no law other than the marketplace: art, in this situation, can become mere commerce, its highest aim entertainment. This was a fear openly expressed at Berkeley. Bach, in contrast, had it easy.

The 'Girls' Talking, With a Black Perspective

BYLINE: By SHEILA RULE

 BODY:
Lekesia, an issue-conscious woman with dreadlocks, reflects on Mike Tyson's rape conviction: "Did he actually think he could violate someone and not be punished? Who does he think he is? William Kennedy Smith?"
Lydia, a highly educated single mother, chides Vice President Dan Quayle by telling her baby daughter, Aretha, "There is no such thing as an 'illegitimate' child, only 'illegitimate' vice presidents." 
 Monica, a light-skinned black woman with green eyes and long, wavy hair, is fed up with people insisting that she must be of mixed parentage: "Yes, I'm mixed. Try African-American."
These are among the creations of the cartoonist Barbara Brandon, whose weekly strip appears in newspapers in nearly 100 cities across the country. "I'm more concerned with being thought-provoking than funny," said the 33-year-old cartoonist. "I'm concerned with recording the experiences black women are having in this country and how some of us are feeling about them."
The strip, "Where I'm Coming From," is only three years old, but as the only black woman cartoonist who is nationally syndicated, Ms. Brandon seems poised for wide recognition. In her work she explores humorously the serious issues affecting black people and the nation as a whole, from the Clarence Thomas hearings to the Rodney King verdict and questions of equal justice; her aim, she said, is to help "mainstream folk," or whites, better understand blacks. Ideas come from listening to friends and looking at her own life as well as from watching the issue-oriented television programs that her father, the cartoonist Brumsic Brandon Jr., dubs the Sunday "blah-blah shows."
"After the riots in Los Angeles, how many folks were saying how surprised they were that that happened?" Ms. Brandon asked. "If mainstream folk understood the black perspective better, they wouldn't be surprised at the rage we're holding. We know white people because we're exposed to them, but they don't know us. If we're going to have a peaceful existence, they have to understand our perspective."
Ms. Brandon's growing success comes at a time when black women are increasingly prominent in the arts. In recent weeks, four books by black women have been on best-seller lists. Ms. Brandon's success, she acknowledges, is due in part to what she characterizes as "black people coming back into vogue."
While she has been called a racist by some whites, others have told her she speaks for them. Black women have written to say that they see themselves and their friends in her characters. Some black men have been supportive, although others complain that she is interested only in "dogging black men."
"Sometimes men get defensive and assume that, because the characters are all women, the strip is negative," said Ms. Brandon. "I tell them that before the late 60's, caricatures of blacks were drawn by white people, with big lips and pickaninny heads. Black hands were drawing black characters in the late 60's, but the mainstream press wanted those characters to be children saying things that no one had to be afraid of. After all, it was just kids talking.
"You have to give me credit for having adult characters talking about adult things," she said. "I don't try to dog black men. I'm holding up a mirror; that's what I'm doing."
The cities where the strip appears are circled in red on a map in the bedroom of Ms. Brandon's apartment in the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn; she works at her father's old drawing table. Readers of such newspapers as The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, The Los Angeles Daily News and The Philadelphia Daily News turn to "Where I'm Coming From" for images of black women who, like Ms. Brandon, offer straight talk.
In her strip, which some people say resembles Jules Feiffer's work in The Village Voice, the nine "girls," as she calls them, represent a patchwork of diversity. "Part of the point is how varied we are," said Ms. Brandon. "We are not a monolithic people as black women. I can't say I'm a spokesman for all black women."
That the characters appear as heads without bodies is a statement in itself.
"We are too often summed up by our body parts," said Ms. Brandon, "and black women are at the bottom of the totem pole. I'm saying 'We have opinions,' and 'Look me in the eye and talk to me.' "
Readers are attracted to newspaper comics but, with the recession, editors have devoted less space to them. Deals with syndicates are hard for cartoonists to come by. Somehow, Ms. Brandon has broken through.
"There are still very few women cartoonists of any race," said Catherine Yronwode, the co-author of the book "Women and the Comics," noting that the first syndicated black woman cartoonist was Jackie Ormes, whose work appeared in black-owned newspapers beginning in the 1930's.
"Barbara's got a good chance," Ms. Yronwode said, "because syndicate talent scouts are looking for fresh stuff from different perspectives and new angles."
Ms. Brandon, the youngest of three children, was born in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn and raised in Newcastle, L.I. As a child she colored in silhouettes and drew borders on "Luther," her father's strip about the adventures of an inner-city child, which was nationally syndicated from 1968 to the mid-80's. According to Ms. Brandon, the strip languished when "black people were no longer in focus."
Mr. Brandon is now a syndicated editorial cartoonist for black newspapers and an Op-Ed columnist for the newspaper Florida Today. Speaking from his home in Mount Pocono, Pa., he said: "I think editors are a little more sophisticated than when I started. Back then, I don't think anybody quite knew what a black comic strip was supposed to do. You could have dipped Charlie Brown in chocolate and had chocolate-covered Peanuts and that would have done it."
After majoring in illustration at Syracuse University, Ms. Brandon applied for a job at Elan, a new magazine for black women, in 1981. The editor asked her to come up with a comic strip, and she brought in samples of what would become "Where I'm Coming From." But the magazine folded before the strip was published. Ms. Brandon became a writer at Essence, another magazine for black women, and stayed for more than five years. The strip gathered dust.
In 1988 The Detroit Free Press wrote Ms. Brandon's father to say that the newspaper was looking for black cartoonists. "He asked me if I had my stuff presentation-ready and I said, 'What does that mean? I'll do it,' " Ms. Brandon recalled.
The Free Press began publishing "Where I'm Coming From" in 1989. The Universal Press Syndicate took her on board in 1990 and plans, through its book division, to publish a collection of her strips early next year. Greeting cards, mugs and T-shirts are also in the works.
Syracuse University recently informed Ms. Brandon that it wanted to give her a "young alumni" award. Ms. Brandon -- who earns less than $25,000 a year from her strip -- told the university she would accept the award, "as long as they realize I still owe six credits."

BYLINE: By MARGO KAUFMAN; MARGO KAUFMAN is the author of "1-800- Am-I-Nuts?" a collection of travel and other essays to be published by Random House.

 BODY:
HOW did Columbus find his way to America without a guidebook? Whenever I set foot on foreign soil my life is controlled by authors I've never heard of, who for all I know consider a hot shower to be as superfluous as a silver toothpaste key.
Left to my own devices, I prefer to heed the advice of Suzanne, my travel agent, whose definition of a dump and mine are fairly congruent. But my husband, Duke, trusts only what he reads for himself. A guidebook addict, he devours them the way others gobble mail-order catalogues. Weeks before we left on a recent trip to Ecuador, he'd scrutinized three books and mapped out an itinerary, while I was still working up the nerve to finish the lengthy sections on health warnings and inoculations (the one part he refuses to take seriously). 
 "They just put those in to take up space," said Duke, who complains that I travel with more drugs than a Rexall. Ever cautious, I went to the doctor and got prescriptions to combat almost everything the book said we could contract and tetanus, gamma globulin, polio and yellow fever shots too. My sore arm wasn't the only irritation caused by the printed page.
We flew into Guayaquil, a muggy port with a malarial air and nervous residents who looked as if they'd just stepped out of a Fellini film. Suzanne had advised that we check into the Gran Hotel, which was well-run, reasonable, and had good coffee, but Duke consulted his book and chose a "top end" selection on the riverside walk, the Malecon.
I was less than enthusiastic because in Chapter One the author had revealed that he traveled with a tent.
Writers of guidebooks tend to fall into two categories. Half are Robin Leaches manques who recommend private barges up the Thames and exquisite little Alpine hideaways that cost $400 a night. The others are Peace Corps alumni who believe big old buses are more fun because of all the passengers getting on and off with their livestock; who are wowed by any accommodation more luxurious than a thatched hut. My husband favors the latter variety.
Sure enough, we wound up in a sleazy overpriced joint with dank carpet, a broken lock, and two soldiers with shotguns stationed in front of the lounge guarding a bat mitzvah.
The next morning, Duke proposed that we fly to Loja, a small town in the Southern Highlands. "We can rent a cabin in Vilcabamba," he said, speaking of a remote village in the Southern Highlands known as the "valley of longevity" because inhabitants live to be over 100. "The book says it's just a two-hour bus ride from Loja."
Guidebooks are loaded with off-the-beaten-track destinations, which frequently require a life-threatening, boat, train, and/or bus journey that I'd just as soon skip. Fortunately, luck was with me. The airline schedule had changed since our guidebook was published (funny, so had the museum schedules); there was no flight to Loja that day, so instead we went to Cuenca, an attractive colonial city on the Rio Tomebamba.
It was pleasant walking around the cobbled streets but I was on guard. The guidebook had warned about a known rapist who asked females to write letters for him to nonexistent friends. He was described as a short dark man, a description that fits a good percentage of the population. I didn't meet him, but I did meet the Devil on Calle Larga.
Duke had just struck a deal with a taxi driver to take us to see the Inca ruin of Ingapirca. He was congratulating himself on getting a good price ($20 for a five-hour excursion) when a short dark man tapped him on the shoulder. "Excuse me," said the Devil in all-too-understandable English. "I heard you bargaining. You must know you're crazy to take a cab. Just go to the bus station." Then he vanished in a puff of diesel smoke from a passing bus.
"The book said there was a bus," Duke said, looking on the map for the station. Yes, but the book also said it was a two-hour ride to the closest town; from there we had to hitch 15 kilometers to the ruins, and pray we could get a ride back. "The book said the bus is only 45 cents," he said.
I pointedly reminded him of our last guidebook inspired economy. We'd just arrived in Albufeira, in the Algarve, in Portugal, after a hellish drive from Lisbon. I wanted to check into a hotel that had earned a small house, the "quite comfortable" rating from my red friend, the Michelin Guide, the one book I totally trust. But Duke was loyal to another volume, which stated if we walked down a certain street and knocked on doors we'd find a charming room for a pittance. In fact, a harried mother with three screaming toddlers offered us a curtained-off alcove filled with laundry.
On the plus side, guidebooks do lessen my fear of the unknown, even though they force me to deal with two unknown quantities -- the country and the author. I wish there was a psychological profile at the back of the book so I could determine if we had anything in common: a limited enthusiasm for churches, for example, or a passion for folk art. Lacking such information, I have my own interpretations of key words: "peaceful," for instance, usually means in the middle of nowhere; "retreat," not on my life, and "overpriced" in my experience is not bad at all.
Which is why, in Ecuador, I was looking forward to the few days we'd planned to stay in Salinas, reputed to be "best" resort in the country, and malaria free. But at the last minute, Duke rerouted us to Bahia de Caraquez, an unspoiled (translation: primitive) port. I was nervous because the major travel agencies in Quito had never heard of Aerotransportes Bahia, the small airline our guidebook claimed flew light planes to nearby San Vincente, and it was six hours by bus but my husband was undaunted. He dismissed my concerns about malaria as "phobic."
CONFIDENT the book would be wrong again, I agreed to go. My blood froze when we returned to Guayaquil and Duke triumphantly led me to a teeny terminal with a nine-seater Cessna parked outside, where he bought $16 tickets. I made him take the seat without the seat belt and gnawed my fingernails. The plane made three heart-stopping stops before finally touching down at what I believed was our final destination -- a narrow stretch of coast with a huge runway long enough for a 747.
I sighed with relief and followed Duke down the airstrip, past a couple of pigs. Twenty minutes later, I was still behind him as we trudged along the shore in the equatorial heat toward a rickety ferry dock. The next thing I knew we were crossing the choppy half-mile-wide Rio Chone in a motorized rowboat equipped with wood slabs for life jackets. The guidebook failed to mention this part of the experience.
The rowboat landed us in Bahia de Caraquez, a shrimp farming center that appeared to have suffered touristus interruptus before developers' plans to turn it into a major resort were realized, leaving a group of unfinished high-rises. I was delighted to discover an "overpriced" hotel right on the beach. Duke incautiously swam with the ebbing tide and was nearly carried out to sea -- but it could have been much worse.
So I was surprised when I woke the next morning, and found my husband looking distressed. He'd been bitten by a mosquito in the night, having turned down my offer of insecticide, and he was worried it might be malarial. When I stopped laughing, I told him I had pills for malaria and he seemed impressed. Later, the manager assured him there was no malaria in town. "Cholera, yes," he said. "We have lots of cases." Duke had just wolfed down a shrimp omelet at a dubious- seeming cafe perched on stilts over the harbor, with no apparent source of running water, but I assured him I had pills for that too. Thanks to my guidebook, I was prepared for everything.
Maybe too prepared because soon after we returned home, Duke immersed himself in a new guidebook for Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia. Thumbing through it I note that in addition to the health hazards we risked in South America, there are warnings about meningitis, diphtheria, sleeping sickness, crocodiles and lions.
I think I'll go buy a Michelin Guide for France.

HEADLINE: JAPANESE FILMS;
Did You Read the Book?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The exaggerated, almost pathological sensitivity of some of the American press to any critical discussion of Japan is exemplified by Vincent Canby's critique of my novel "Rising Sun" and Japanese cinema ["Japan Unfolds Through Many Images," June 14]. Mr. Canby takes an American police thriller, set entirely in America and populated almost entirely by American characters, and compares it to Japanese films about Japanese characters living in Japan. It's not surprising he finds so little similarity. The question is why he should make the comparison in the first place. 
 It is doubtful that Mr. Canby read "Rising Sun," since he fails to identify the book's sole, explicit cinematic reference -- to "The Bad Sleep Well," Akira Kurosawa's 1960 film about business corruption. Many of the novel's images relate directly to that film, since "Rising Sun" is also a story about business corruption -- in this case, corruption involving American politicians and lobbyists and Japanese businessmen.
It is a matter of record that such corrupt relationships exist; several are identified in the novel, and I have included a bibliography for those who wish to know more. I wrote "Rising Sun" to provoke a discussion of such relationships, within the broader framework of America's economic decline.
Instead of that discussion, we have Mr. Canby's focus on Japan-bashing. Not only does he misconstrue my book -- which is far more critical of America than it is of Japan -- but he does not even know the meaning of the words he employs. When he says, "Not since Pearl Harbor has Japan-bashing been such big and popular business," he apparently is unaware that the term Japan-bashing was used in prewar America by apologists for Japan, just as it is today. After Pearl Harbor, Japan had few defenders in this country, and the term Japan-bashing disappeared from use. It reappeared only within the last decade or so.
In an election year when several of our President's campaign advisers are registered foreign agents for Japanese corporations, it seems entirely appropriate for Americans to inquire more closely into the meaning of these relationships, and what impact they may have on the future of the country.
 
MICHAEL CRICHTON
Los Angeles
 
Mr. Canby replies: I wasn't comparing Mr. Crichton's book to great Japanese films. I was noting that it offers a cheaply superficial portrait of a people and a culture. I did trudge through "Rising Sun," but I don't remember many "images," only a cascade of dialogue that evokes "Stover at Yale" more often than even the English subtitles for "The Bad Sleep Well." The last paragraph of Mr. Crichton's letter intrigues me. Just what it has to do with either "Rising Sun" or my essay, I don't know. But it might make a better plot than the one he whomped up for his current best seller. The most valuable thing about "Rising Sun" is its bibliography. It's a very good read.

HEADLINE: U.N. Official to Persevere in Talks To End Standoff Over Iraqi Arms

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, July 18

 BODY:
A senior United Nations official said tonight that he would continue talks on Sunday with Iraqi officials in an effort to resolve a 13-day standoff between United Nations arms inspectors and the Iraqi Government.
 The official, Rolf Ekeus, head of the commission created by the Security Council to oversee the elimination of President Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction, spent six hours today in largely futile discussions with the State Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf. He agreed to continue talks on Sunday after Iraqi officials said he would meet Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz and Foreign Minister Ahmed Hussein al Simeraei. 
Mr. Ekeus had planned to depart early Sunday for New York, where he is to brief the Security Council on the outcome of his talks on Monday.
 On his arrival here Friday, Mr. Ekeus said he would warn the Iraqi leadership that it faced the risk of attack if it did not comply fully with the terms of the Security Council's Persian Gulf war cease-fire. He said he had come only to explain the Security Council's unanimous view that Iraq must give way and not to negotiate with the authorities. He delivered that warning today, and the Iraqis requested further talks on Sunday.
 For the last 13 days, United Nations arms inspectors have been keeping a round-the-clock vigil in jeeps outside the Iraqi Agriculture Ministry after they tried to gain access after a tip from a Western intelligence agent that Iraq may be storing plans for its banned ballistic missile program there.
 Iraq has refused to grant them access, saying the proposed inspection would violate its national sovereignty.
 Diplomats say the United States, Britain and France are becoming increasingly angry over Iraq's stubborn resistance to the Security Council's orders and are searching for ways of bringing home their displeasure to President Hussein, including a possible resumption of air strikes.
 On July 6, just after the standoff at the Agriculture Ministry began, the Security Council issued a statement saying Iraq had committed "a material and unacceptable breach" of the gulf war peace terms. Those terms linked a cease-fire with the destruction of Iraq's nuclear, chemical and biological weapons program as well as its efforts to build long-range missiles.
 
Relief Agencies Hampered
 The dispute over access to the Agriculture Ministry is only one of a number of quarrels between the United Nations and Iraq.
 Iraq is currently refusing to renew a humanitarian aid agreement with the United Nations that expired last month and is hampering relief agencies in their work.
 It has broken off talks on the Security Council's plan for limited Iraqi oil sales to finance food and medical imports and start compensating victims of its Kuwait invasion.
 Iraq is also boycotting the work of a commission set up to determine its frontier with Kuwait. And it is continuing an economic blockade against Kurdish-controlled areas of the country in the North as well as harassing dissident Shiite Muslims in the southern marshlands.
 In addition, United Nations personnel working here are starting to come under various kinds of attack.
 Unknown assailants have shot dead one United Nations guard working in the Kurdish North and wounded two others. The arms inspectors outside the Agriculture Ministry have faced numerous demonstrations. They have been denounced in increasingly harsh language by the local press and have had paint thrown at their vehicles and their tires slashed.

Urging Blacks to Help Themselves by Buying From Each Other

BYLINE: By SABRA CHARTRAND, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 18

 BODY:
The shopping center sits on a small hill overlooking a struggling black neighborhood, a pocket of stores surrounded by poverty and neglect. A few shoppers strolling in oppressive afternoon heat stop to puzzle over a sign in one store's window: "Going out for business."
 But it is not a mistake, as a tall man in a hat and carrying a thick stack of leaflets makes clear. It is part of a new campaign by black merchants and a black business group to promote black-owned companies and to convince black consumers that they are responsible for their neighborhood's economy. 
Buy where WE are," say the leaflets, which urge shoppers to attend a unity rally today. "When you need it, look for and support African-American businesses."
 The store is having trouble all too familiar in this recession. And the owner agonizing over falling revenues is a black woman, which makes the store rare enough for a local black business group to start a self-help campaign to keep its doors open.
 Black businesses are a tiny percentage of the American economy, and Washington is no exception. But unlike other big cities, the capital has a predominantly black population, a black Mayor and a mostly black City Council. Still, the last Economic Census, conducted by the Census Bureau in 1987, shows that only about a third of all businesses here, 8,275 of 29,244, are black-owned.
 Kid-A-Rama is one of those, a children's clothing store that opened in 1984 in the shopping center in one of the city's most economically deprived neighborhoods, Northeast Washington. The owner, Doris D. Williams, who is black, studied business in college but never finished her degree. Still, she worked hard, and the small store flourished.
 "Every year I had increased sales," said Ms. Williams one afternoon this week, standing between the baby shoes and toddlers' discount T-shirts in her store. Business was good enough that in 1990 she moved to a larger store in the shopping center.
 "The decline started last year, and its been totally downhill," Ms. Williams said, her voice firm but tired. Slowly, she began to fall behind in paying taxes and creditors.
"A whole year of that made me stop and think, can I really survive in this neighborhood?" she said.
 Ms. Williams knows that like thousands of small businesses across the country, hers is a victim of the recession. But she also sees a way out, if only black consumers were more deliberate about how they spend their money. Rather than shopping at department stores, they should patronize black businesses to shore up the meager economic base in their neighborhoods, she says.
 Ed Murphy, the tall man with the leaflets, agrees. The energetic chairman of the African-American Business Association mobilized a group of black businesses to help Ms. Williams keep her store open by encouraging blacks to buy from blacks. The group's rally today drew several hundred people; dozens crowded into Ms. Williams's store, generating more revenue than she had taken in in months.
 "The whole idea is self-help," said Mr. Murphy, who opened his first restaurant in 1964. He refused to blame the hurdles black entrepreneurs have commonly faced, like racism, red-lining -- when banks would not loan money to businesses in minority neighborhoods -- and high insurance rates.
 "Our problem has nothing to do with white people, we're not mad at the Koreans, and we're not going to sit back and wait for the government to come and help us," Mr. Murphy said. "Black businesses are dwindling so fast it's shocking. This underlying problem in our community was proven in the Los Angeles riots. If more African-Americans owned businesses, we'd have more to protect."
 Though the nation is about 12 percent black, only about 3 percent of the 13.7 million American companies were black-owned in 1987, the Economic Census found. Those 424,000 black-owned companies generated just 1 percent of American business receipts -- $19.8 billion, compared with $1.9 trillion for all businesses.
 One reason for the disparity is that 94 percent of the black companies are small, mom-and-pop operations. The average income of a black business in 1987 was $47,000, but more than half had receipts of below $10,000.
 Of the black-owned businesses, a mere 189 black businesses had more than 100 employees. "That's not much of an economic base," David Abner, a professor of marketing at Howard University's School of Business, said in an interview.
 Paradoxically, most of the best and brightest black business people are being recruited into white companies rather than starting businesses of their own, Mr. Abner said.
 "For the most part, my students are management oriented towards opportunities in corporate America, not in entrepreneurship," he said.
 Still, Ms. Williams thinks the neighborhood can be persuaded to support black-owned businesses. "We have to show our children this is a black business, this is how it works, and you can do this too if you want," she said.
 The Kid-A-Rama appeal may tug at heartstrings, but it must compete with capitalist instincts.
 "I think it's a great idea and probably I'll shop here more often," Ethellen Richardson, a 55-year-old office cleaner, said earlier this week after learning that the store where she bought her granddaughter's clothes was black owned. "But I'll still look around for the best bargain."

CORRECTION-DATE: July 26, 1992, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article last Sunday about efforts to promote black-owned businesses in Washington referred incompletely in some editions to a professor who said many black business people were being recruited by white-owned companies. He is David Abner, a professor of marketing at the Howard University School of Business.

Helping Welfare Recipients Help Themselves

BYLINE: By ANDI RIERDEN

 BODY:
THE recent legislative overhaul of Connecticut's General Assistance Welfare Program, which is administered by the Department of Income Maintenance through cities and towns, has set stricter guidelines for eligibility and placed limits on the amount of time someone can receive benefits. People who abuse drugs and alcohol will have to seek treatment to qualify and people who have entered the United States illegally will not be eligible. The state will also begin an employment program to help welfare recipients upgrade their skills and find work. The guidelines went into effect July 1.
Since 1988 the number of people receiving general assistance in Connecticut increased to 34,000 from 11,000. The program, one of several components of the welfare system in Connecticut, provides monthly grants of $314 for people who are able but cannot find work and $356 for those who are unemployable because of medical problems. Audrey Rowe, the Commissioner of the Income Maintenance Department, and a member of a state welfare reform task force formed last year, said that proposals to reform the Aid to Families With Dependent Children program would be examined in the upcoming legislative session. 
 Formerly head of the Human Resources Administration in New Haven, Ms. Rowe began her career 25 years ago as a welfare caseworker in Chicago. She also served for eight years as the Social Services Commissioner of Washington, D.C. Ms. Rowe was appointed commissioner of the Income Maintenance Department in February 1991. In her office in Hartford, she spoke about changes in the general assistance program. Here are some excerpts from that conversation.
Q. How has the caseload for general assistance changed?
A. Since 1988 the caseload has changed drastically. In the past it's been a core group of people who have alcohol or substance abuse problems or some disabilities, plus a small percentage of people who were unemployed as a result of changes in the economy. Now you have a much larger percentage of people who cannot find jobs and may not be entitled to unemployment compensation or who have exhausted their unemployment compensation. We also have more and more people who are able bodied but because they are substance abusers cannot hold a job.
Q. How will the employment program affect this new population?
A. Under the plan we'll try to take this recent population and move them from a welfare to an employment situation by returning them and or getting them into treatment centers, so they'll be prepared when the market opens up to move into an employment status rather than sit at home or on a street corner collecting a check.
For the people who are not quite job ready and still need some training -- that mainly includes the first wave of people who were laid off like day laborers, seasonal workers and individuals with minimal skills -- the legislature has appropriated $6 million. The money will go to towns with more than 300 clients to buy additional slots in area job training programs, provide people with the money to take English as a second language classes or complete a G.E.D. program. We're not creating a new employment system, we're simply giving people money to take advantage of programs that already exist.
Q. What about people who are job ready, have good work habits but cannot find work?
A. The legislature appropriated $7.2 million to the Department of Labor that will pay some portion of a salary for these individuals to get on-the-job training. For instance, though there's a mandate in the state to remove lead-based paint from buildings, many towns don't have the dollars to pay someone to do the jobs. This money could go to a nonprofit that has the staff and the capacity to train people to go in and remove paint. And that's a marketable skill that more and more firms and housing projects are looking for.
Another example would be a small shoe repair business. The shoemaker may like to train somebody in this trade, but he doesn't have the resources to hire anybody. The state could help pay for the period of time that the individual is in training by providing health insurance while the employer pays a minimum wage. Once a person is skilled and able to increase the marketability of the business, the owner could make him or her a full-salaried employee.
Q. Before you initiated the reforms, what was the procedure for obtaining general assistance?
A. First of all you never had to prove that you were actively looking for a job. When you first applied you had to register with Job Service and if you were employable you had to put in so many hours a week in Workfare. As long as you did that and had no other source of income you were continually eligible. You didn't have to worry about anything. We paid your rent, you could get food stamps and your medical was covered. And that was one of the system's major errors.
When I looked at general assistance in New Haven my concern was that it enabled people to continue abusing substances, avoid responsibility or doing anything to improve their life styles. And that was similar in nearly all of the state's cities.
Q. Under the new eligibility guidelines, how long can someone receive assistance?
A. Now you're eligible for assistance 9 months out of a 12-month calendar year. However, suppose you've done everything you're supposed to do and you've participated in the employment process and you just can't get a job. We will allow for a town to extend the eligibility for three more months. But towns won't extend someone more than two or three times. The point is that there is an expectation that you will leave this program in nine months and that we will help assist you to meet that expectation. If, through no fault of your own, you don't, then we will continue to assist you.
Q. What if you find someone a job through the employability program and they refuse to take it, or else they take it and then quit or get fired?
A. If we take you to the point where there's a job available and, though it may not be the job you ultimately want, it's a job that meets your skills and pays a livable wage, then you can't say "I want to wait until something better comes along." If you fail to cooperate you will be ineligible for assistance for 90 days. For most people it's better to take that job than to be without an income for three months.
Before, you came back to general assistance if you quit or got fired from a job and there was no penalty. That used to happen all the time where people would go to work, then get angry and quit, or else decide to work only winters or summers. Now you have to prove you quit for good reason or got fired unjustly before you can receive benefits. To determine that, you have to go through a hearing process. If you are denied assistance, then you can appeal the decision.
In addition, it used to be that if you didn't show up for work, you were ineligible for assistance for 30 days. Well, most people can make due without an income for 30 days. Now we've extended that time to three months and I think that will make people think twice about not cooperating.
Q. What about people who are able to work, yet have depended on general assistance for many years?
A. Our employability program will have to work aggressively with them. We will have to tell them that they can no longer do this forever, that they have to move towards economic self-sufficiency. We're saying to this population that we're going to give you the tools to take better care of your life, but if you don't want the tools, then you don't get the cash. The department is no longer going to be there to take care of you. There's going to be some people who are just going to leave, and say "I don't want to do this," but that is their choice.
Q. Can you qualify for benefits if you  abuse alcohol or drugs?
A. Not unless you agree to sign up for a treatment program. The state recently added $3 million to the Commission on Alcohol and Drug Abuse to add more treatment programs. If you refuse to get treatment, then you become ineligible for assistance until you go into treatment or verify that you are on a waiting list. If you deny you're a substance abuser and are trying to get around participating in the employment process, then you've got to go through a screening process. You'll have to have proof that you are unemployable, which means we have to see a medical report that includes a urinalysis. If there's a suspicion that an individual is a substance abuser we can ask them to prove that they are not as a condition of eligiblity.
Q. Are you eligible for assistance if you have entered the United States illegally?
A. In the past if you were a noncitizen, no matter what your status, you could qualify for general assistance. Now if you're a noncitizen you must present proof that you entered the country legally before we will grant assistance.
Q. In the next legislative session you will be examining the Aid for Families With Dependent Children program. What issues will you be addressing?
A. We need to look at the question of whether we should continue giving women more benefits if they have more children. It's a tough question because the reality is when the child gets here, if it doesn't get the care that it needs then we're going to pay more for that kid than if we had gone ahead and paid the benefit. Research also indicates that the woman makes the decision to have the baby not so she can get another grant but because she feels some man loves her and is going to marry her.
So what we need to do is create new incentives and educate these people so that they realize that as a single head of a household the likelihood of their children ever being able to move out of poverty diminishes for every child that they have. Instead of waving dollars we should give these people the resources to move out of a welfare life style.

HEADLINE: 200 Years Later, the Xhosa Fight On

BYLINE: By Geoffrey Wheatcroft; Geoffrey Wheatcroft, a columnist for several London newspapers, is the author of "The Randlords," a history of South Africa's mining magnates.

FRONTIERS
The Epic of South Africa's Creation and the Tragedy of the Xhosa People.
By Noel Mostert.
Illustrated. 1,355 pp. New York:
Alfred A. Knopf. $35. 
 IN 1492, European sailors traveled west to America, and there began a long and, for the indigenous peoples, disastrous conflict. Five years earlier, in 1487, Portuguese ships commanded by Bartolomeu Dias had sailed south, rounded the Cape of Good Hope and landed at Mossel Bay, 200 miles east of Cape Town in what is now South Africa. Local people on the shore threw stones at the Portuguese. Dias, says Noel Mostert in this huge and enthralling book, "picked up a crossbow and shot one of the stone throwers dead: the first indigene to be killed by the white man in southern Africa." But very far from the last. Another great conflict had begun.
The aboriginal inhabitants of the Cape were simple hunter-gatherers, Bushmen and Khoikhoi (colloquially known as Hottentots), and it wasn't until 1498 that Vasco da Gama landed farther up the coast and initiated the contact between Europeans and Bantu speakers that is the subject of "Frontiers."
Although the sea route to the East transformed European trade, sailors considered South Africa deeply inhospitable. They sometimes stopped there to take water for their ghastly journey, but it was only in 1652 that the Dutch East India Company established a settlement at the Cape. Even that remained tiny: At the end of the 18th century, when the population of the United States was already four million, there were no more than 26,000 Dutch settlers at the Cape, along with maybe 30,000 African and Indonesian slaves and as many indigenous people.
The mass of Africans lived east and north. As settlers began to spread out from the Cape they approached them, and in 1702 a party of Dutch hunters ran into the Xhosa -- the nearest great African people to the Cape. There was fruitful and peaceful contact between black and white, but there was also rivalry over cattle and land, and by the early 1780's the First Frontier War had begun. Nine of these "wars" would take place over the course of nearly a century, ranging from skirmishes to bloody campaigns; their fighting and their outcome changed the face of South Africa.
These wars -- the resistance and final defeat of the Xhosa -- are Mr. Mostert's precise theme. As he notes, other confrontations in South African history -- the Zulu wars of the 1870's, the Boer war at the turn of the century -- have seemed more glamorous to previous historians. Yet the struggle in the east Cape was as important in its way, not least as a moral drama. It ended in 1857, when a final catastrophe enveloped the Xhosa. They followed prophesying voices and killed all their cattle, in the belief that two suns would rise and their enemies would be overthrown. Instead the Xhosa starved in the tens of thousands and were broken forever. Or were they?
During the course of this "hundred years' war" one significant change took place: the Cape passed from Dutch to British hands. The English (or their colonial heirs) were fighting other frontier wars at the same time; the conquest of the Xhosa is a story with obvious echoes in American and Australian history, and "Frontiers" has affinities with Dee Brown's "Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee" and "The Fatal Shore," Robert Hughes's story of early Australia. But the differences are as important as the resemblances. Far more than any indigenous American people -- enormously more than the aboriginal Australians, or for that matter their Bushmen neighbors -- the Xhosa were able to resist the Europeans on something like equal terms for generations.
THE Cape was vital to the British because of its strategic position, but they had no great hopes for it economically, even after 1820 when an English settlement was planted in the eastern Cape, close to the Xhosa frontier. "All that South Africa ever seemed to offer was the threat of being a perpetual, accumulative financial demand upon the British Treasury and the imperial military chest," Mr. Mostert writes. It was the continual object of British administrations to hold back frontier expansion. And it was the continual belief of the colonists on the frontier that they were misunderstood by London and by the colonial authorities in Cape Town, with "their callousness with regard to our sufferings from the Kaffirs" (see, too, the Declaration of Independence and its complaint about King George III and "the merciless Indian Savages").
On the British side, many of the civilians and most of the military officers concerned were incompetent to a high degree. Mr. Mostert deals harshly with Gen. Sir Harry Smith, who was only in South Africa because he had served with Wellington, and Henry Somerset, who was there because his father was Governor of the Cape. Another group that stemmed from the British connection was the missionaries. Representing the evangelical conscience, they tried to restrain the settlers and to convert the Xhosa, and ended up despised by both. All the same, it was they who made the conflict with the Xhosa a matter of serious ethical debate, which the far worse treatment of the Australian aborigines did not become.
These were some of the actors on the European side, but Mr. Mostert, who was born in South Africa and is now a Canadian journalist, does justice to the losers also, the Xhosa leaders like Ngqika, Nxele-Makanna and Sandile. Not long ago historians of empire effectively ignored the non-Europeans. Now they try to be even-handed, and Mr. Mostert treats the Xhosa as equal players in the drama. He does not sentimentalize, or only occasionally. "The indigenous languages of South Africa are among the most beautiful in the world," he says, but that seems a little sweeping. And like too many recent writers, Mr. Mostert lauds the "value common to the Bantu speakers and called ubuntu, humanness," which seems a little patronizing.
The truth as it emerges from Mr. Mostert's narrative is that the Xhosa were morally neither inferior nor superior to their foes. The Europeans were rapacious and brutal, stealing African land, shooting and sometimes hanging miscreants. But then again, hanging had something to be said for it against the preferred Xhosa method of execution, in which red hot stones were laid on the victim's body until flesh fell off bones like charred steak.
And yet there is a problem here. Hard as Mr. Mostert tries to treat both sides equally, there is no getting away from the fact that the conquerors not only had firearms, they had that other crucial advantage, literacy. A serious historian, using written sources, is bound to pay more attention to those who wrote them.
Mr. Mostert has in fact mastered a huge range of material in the 20 years or so that "Frontiers" has been in the writing, and his book is a fine work of scholarship. Occasionally one would wish that he had stood back from his sources more, simplified and even condensed. "Epic" in the subtitle is no joke: With its almost 1,400 pages, "Frontiers" fights at the weights with a telephone book. It would be wrong to say that the book is too long but, as Dr. Johnson said about "Paradise Lost," no man would ever wish it longer. The text is in parts as thick as the Transkei bush, and the book would certainly be improved by both a brief chronology of events and a biographical index. Still, those cavils could be made about some of the great Victorian novels, which "Frontiers" resembles in sweep and vigor.
Were the Xhosa broken? I asked earlier. This is the great irony of imperialism. The Xhosas had asked for nothing except to be left alone. Instead, they were conquered and exploited. But if it weren't for that conquest there could be no modern state of South Africa (whose very name is "Eurocentric"), which a largely Xhosa organization, the African National Congress, is hoping to take over under the leadership of a descendant of the Xhosa chiefs, Nelson Mandela.

HEADLINE: WHAT'S DOING IN;
Aspen

BYLINE: By DYAN ZASLOWSKY; DYAN ZASLOWSKY, who lives in Evergreen, Colo., visits Aspen frequently.

 BODY:
Somehow, summer is the best season to observe Aspen functioning as a wholesome little town, not just as a resort driven by skiing.
People do simple, free things: residents bike to and from work, they play in the parks and older children safely roam the pedestrian mall on their own. So much of what happens in summer occurs beneath one tent or another, but the performances and lectures account for only a portion of Aspen's magnetism. 
 For along with the town's brimming art and cultural fare, it is Aspen's unadorned outdoor beauty that draws ever more devotees.
Few vistas are as gratifying or as easy to reach as the one at the end of the short bus trip from Aspen's Rubey Park Transport Center to Maroon Lake.
From the lake one can tackle a number of hikes of varying difficulty into the back country. Meanwhile, it seems mountain and road biking threaten to overtake hiking in popularity.
After so much daytime exertion, therefore, it is a wonder anyone has the energy to attend a dance concert, a free lecture at the Aspen Institute, a performance at the venerable Aspen Music Festival, or any of the may other entertainments.
Yet they do, although the evening pace slows imperceptibly as the night air cools. After dinner and a concert, the day's last activity is often a gentle mall crawl on Hyman Avenue.
Street performers surge and the sidewalks are full of people well into the night. Some shops stay open to 10 ten pm or or later -- the collegial Explore Booksellers and Coffeehouse at 221 East Main Street is open until midnight in summer, and abuzz with browsers.
 
Events
 After 22 summers of performing in the Aspen High School Gymnasium, the DanceAspen festival now commands a state-of-the-art stage in a handsome new 548-seat auditorium at the Aspen Elementary School, a space designed to accommodate any visiting dance troupe.
DanceAspen features seven companies at its new location. Miami City Ballet will perform on Aug. 10, Hubbard Street Dance Company on Aug. 13. Tickets for the festival, which will run through Aug. 22, cost from $5 for matinees to $30 for evening performances. Tickets can be ordered by phone, (800) 933-3820, or in writing to DanceAspen, Post Office Box 8745, Aspen, Colo. 81612.
The Aspen Music Festival, in its 44th year, will run to Aug. 23. More than 130 events are presented every summer, including orchestral, chamber, opera, choral, jazz and master classes. The violinist Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg will play pieces by Vivaldi and Dvorak on Aug. 6, the pianists Cipa and Misha Dichter will perform on Aug. 13. The season closes with a Beethoven Bash. Tickets from $5 to $35. Schedule and tickets: Aspen Music Festival, Ticket Sales, Post Office Box AA, Aspen, Colo. 81612; (303) 925-9042.
A bus costing $2 each way leaves from Rubey Park to Snowmass Village, 10 miles away, where the Anderson Ranch, an artists' colony that holds gallery exhibitions, is worth visiting. The Anderson Ranch Arts Center Annual Art Auction is Aug. 15; (303) 923-3181.
The Aspen Theatre in the Park performs "Crimes of the Heart," "Burn This" and "The Singular Dorothy Parker" in a tent behind the Aspen Art Museum. Up to four performances a week will be held until Sept. 13.
Tickets are $15 or $17. Call (303) 925-2750 for tickets, or write Aspen Theatre in the Park, Post Office Box 8677, Aspen, Colo. 81612.
The Aspen Historical Homes Tour on Aug. 8 is sponsored by the Aspen Historical Society.
The tour, which will last about two and a half hours, will visit six Victorian and contemporary homes and two gardens and will go backstage at the Crystal Palace Theatre Restaurant, a building that dates from 1891. Tickets are $15 before day of tour and $18 on the day. Ticket information: (303) 925-2750.
 
The Outdoors
 Mountain biking is a particularly aerobic way to see the country. Bikes can be rented at Timberline Cycle Center below the gondola; The Hub of Aspen, 315 East Hyman Avenue; Blazing Pedals by the Mill Street Fountain, and several other bicycle shops. Rates are about $10 and up for road or mountain bikes for a half a day; weekly rates are available. It is an easy half-day trip by paved road from Ashcroft or along Owl Creek Road, while Aspen Mountain's rugged trails are for the advanced rider only; carrying the bike over certain stretches is not unheard of on the most difficult trails.
Another excursion is flyfishing for trout on the Roaring Fork River. Oxbow Outfitting Company, Post Office Box D3, Aspen, Colo. 81612, (303) 925-1505, offers flyfishing clinics every Tuesday from 5 to 7, rents equipment and offers guided flyfishing trips. A half-day trip for one with all gear is $150.
Hallam Lake is in a 22-acre wildlife sanctuary in the heart of Aspen, close enough for small children to walk to. Call (303) 925-5756 for information about programs for children and adults. Programs cost up to $3.
 
Hotels
 One of this season's best deals is the Aspen Arts Package, which offers lodging with one ticket to the music festival, one to DanceAspen and free admission to the Aspen Art Museum and Aspen Historical Society Museum. It also includes a discount coupon to the Aspen Theatre in the Park. It runs through Aug. 22. Three-night economy packages start at $36 per person per night, double occupancy, up to $76. The package, which has to be reserved 10 days ahead, must be booked through Aspen Central Reservations Travel, (800) 262-7736.
Budget: The Snowflake Inn, (800) 247-2069, 221 East Hyman Avenue, is a simple modern three-story establishment half a block from the mall. It has a pool and a Jacuzzi. Rooms for two with kitchenettes begin at $95.
The Limelight Lodge, (800) 433-0832, at 228 East Cooper Avenue, is well-maintained and serviceable, with a good location in downtown Aspen; rooms start at $88 for two in summer, including a Continental breakfast.
Ullr Lodge, 520 West Main Street, (303) 925-7696. A small family-owned lodge. Rooms for two $55 to $85 with Continental breakfast.
Moderate: The Innsbruck Inn, (303) 925-2980, 233 West Main Street, not surprisingly has Alpine-style decor. Its large two-room units cost $130 a night including a copious breakfast in a pretty dining room. Outdoor heated pool and Jacuzzi.
Luxury: Hotel Lenado, (800) 321-3457, 200 South Aspen Street, re-creates something of the atmosphere of an Adirondack lodge; it is small, with 19 rooms and distinctive log furniture. Room range from $135 a night for a room with twin beds to $185 for a room with a queen-sized or king-sized bed with a wet bar and whirlpool bath. Rates include a full breakfast.
Sardy House, (800) 321-3457, 128 East Main Street, is an elegantly restored Victorian brick house that turned 100 this year. Beautifully landscaped, with a heated swimming pool and hidden brick mews. It has 14 rooms and 6 suites. Rooms cost from $145 to $220 a night; suites from $250 to $375. Rates include full breakfast.
The Little Nell, (800) 525-6200, 675 East Durant Street, which bills itself as Aspen's newest lodge of opulence, has something of a corporate feeling in its decor and atmosphere. Rooms have marble baths, two phone lines and gas-burning fireplaces. A room with a mountain view is $235, an executive suite is $750. The outdoor heated pool is tiled in black.
 
Restaurants
 ZG, new this summer at 709 East Durant Avenue in the Aspen Club Lodge (303) 925-4400, sees the return of Gordon Naccarato, formerly the chef at Gordon's. The food is excellent and creative, with Thai, Japanese and American Southern overtones. Gnocchi with crab, Caribbean scallops and light panne cota, a creamy dessert with fruit, are outstanding. Dinner for two with wine about $140.
A plush Colorado-style interior at Pinons, (303) 920-2021, 105 South Mill Street, makes the most of supple deerskin pillows, rough pine beams and braided leather banisters. Specialties are ahi in macadamia nut breading, elk tournedos, lamb loin and lobster strudel. Delicious mashed potatoes accompany most entrees. Dinner only. Cost for two with wine about $125.
One of several restaurants of the same name cropping up around the country, Mezzaluna, (303) 925-5882, 600 East Cooper Avenue, is a very popular spot with both locals and visitors. Excellent pasta, such as the penne with spicy tomato sauce, and a tasty buffalo mozzarella and tomato salad. Service is good despite the frenetic pace, and there is a patio for outdoor dining. Dinner for two with wine about $60.
Boogies Diner, (303) 925-6610, 534 East Cooper Street. This 50's retro clothing, paraphernalia store and an upstairs diner is particularly loved by children. Hamburgers, hot dogs, salads, lunch specials at $6.95.
Poppycocks, (303) 925-1245), 609 East Cooper Avenue, has excellent oatmeal macadamia nut pancakes, plus sandwiches and soups. It is open for breakfast and lunch (it began serving dinner last week) and is ideal for families. Breakfast for two $15.
 
Night Life
 While strolling the mall is probably the favorite evening entertainment, Tatou (303) 920-9091, 419 East Hyman Avenue, a branch of the New York establishment of the same name, is currently the most popular night spot. A jazz band plays between 6:30 and 10:30 P.M., with dinner entrees ranging from $14 to $22. Lunch and brunch are also served, with prices from $4.50 to $9.50. At 10:30 Tatou becomes a night club; the cover varies.
A jazz group, Peer Pressure, performs in the bar at the Little Nell Tuesday through Saturday starting at 9 P.M.
Shooter's, (303) 925-4567, 220 South Galena, is great for country swing music every night, with free country swing dance lessons on Thursday.
 
Shopping
 Unusual and reasonably priced souvenirs from Aspen do exist.
At two-year old Skin, (303) 920-1447, 645 East Durant Avenue, the proprietor Candace Goldflies devises her own formulas for natural soaps, cleansers, balms and ointments, and packages them in interesting ways. Free-form soaps made from oatmeal, comfrey, milk and honey, or tearose are $1.50 an ounce.
The Gypsy Woman Shop (no phone), 227 Main Street, is an unsung institution of Aspen, where a longtime leather worker, Chester Goss, fashions durable deerskin fringed and beaded handbags; prices start at $80.
Crystal Farm, (303) 963-2350, 208 South Mill Street, is for the extravagant budget.
Furniture and chandeliers made from deer antlers are gorgeous to see, if pricey. Chandeliers from nearby Redstone start at $2,250; a fallow deer antler settee is $9,500.

HEADLINE: The Executive Life;
Home Is Where the Megabytes Roam

BYLINE: By Michael S. Malone; Michael S. Malone writes frequently about Silicon Valley from Los Altos, Calif.

 BODY:
New owners of personal computers quickly learn a bitter lesson: There is never enough speed or storage capacity. The hoi polloi of computer users have enough time to cook breakfast while waiting for a puny PC to nibble its way through some poky little program.
But in places like Silicon Valley, a few executives and top scientists, by dint of employment at the right companies, have been able to stuff their dens and home offices with some of the most powerful computer systems in the world. Their experiences offer a glimpse of what home computing will be like for the rest of us by the end of the decade. 
 Take Gordon Bell, who led the Digital Equipment team that invented the VAX minicomputer and who recently was awarded the National Medal of Technology. Back in 1980, Mr. Bell made his office a test site for the VAX, connected to a terminal in his home. "It was great," he recalled. "At the time it was the most powerful computer in the world. And even my kids were using it."
Now, he and his wife, Gwen, own five Macintoshes, and are about to buy a sixth. As a measure of the rate of technological advance, each Mac is at least as powerful as the original VAX.
As a director of the Bell-Mason Group, which programs computers to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of new businesses, Mr. Bell uses his home machines to develop new expert systems software. But really, the Macs "run my life. I'm writing a book, doing slides, conducting my home finances."
Like any good home computing superstar, Mr. Bell has big plans: "My goal by the end of the year is to get rid of all paper -- I want all incoming correspondence automatically filed by the computer. Within three years I want to want to put a videophone on it, so I never have to leave the house." He laughs, "Then maybe a robot of me to look presentable answering the phone so I don't have to do even that."
These days, the muscle computer of choice for the home is the work station; in Silicon Valley, the people most likely to have such a machine work for Sun Microsystems, the leading work-station maker. David Cardinal, director of business development for Sun's technology enterprises subsidiary, has four computers at home, including a Sparcstation, Macintosh, 486 clone and a laptop, "the last so I can work in other rooms or on the road." Mr. Cardinal's machines are not only linked but also hooked to a home PBx for electronic mail. They also run the lights and heater in the house. The one big problem, he said, is the pervasive hum. "You have to put them in a closed room."
Jon Garman, an entrepreneur and former Sun executive, uses his Sun work station to, among other things, run his Los Altos, Calif., household -- outside lighting, hot-water circulation pump, furnace, hot tub, swimming pool and sprinklers. The computer knows the calendar, so it can adjust for weekday, weekend or holiday schedules, and knows the longitude and latitude of the house, so it can determine sunset and sunrise times and turn the lights on and off accordingly. .
"The main reason I set the system up," Mr. Garman said, "is that every time I had a power failure in the neighborhood, I had to go out and reset 15 different timers and clocks." (Now, a battery-powered clock in the work station automatically resets the computer.)
Mr. Garman's next project: a security system that will sense an intruder, notify Mr. Garman wherever he is and let him scare off the intruder through a microphone.
In the countryside near Richmond, Va., lives an executive who may have more computing power in his home than anyone in the country. Jim De Arras, co-founder of Hand Held Products Inc., the company that designed the pocket computers for Federal Express, has wired his entire house and workshop for computing. His two older children, 11 and 7, own Macintoshes and do their homework and play games over computer networks. His wife, Ann, also has a Macintosh and in the bedroom there is another Mac, as well as a Next work station. Its "object-oriented" software, which uses images instead of words, means the Next machine can help family members write computer programs despite their genetic dysgraphia, a writing disability.
And that's just the beginning. Out in the shop, Mr. De Arras has six more computers. The house has two satellite dishes and a ham radio tower for computer data transmission. When hiking or driving, Mr. De Arras carries one of his two Navstar ground positioning computers so he always knows exactly where he is. And, a self-described "time fanatic," Mr. De Arras also regularly taps into both an atomic clock and a satellite time source.
But the person with the largest ratio of computer equipment to other material possessions is probably Steven K. Roberts, a journalist and adventurer. Mr. Roberts, who has been traveling the United States for eight years, has become something of a high-tech celebrity for his specially outfitted bicycle and trailer. Reached on the road in New Hampshire, he described his operation as "two Unix machines -- a Sun color Sparcstation set up so I can wander away from the bike and still use it; a little Tadpole Sparcbook with a color screen; a Macintosh front-end controller" and two I.B.M.-type computers, one with a screen right inside his helmet.
It is at once comforting and distressing for our own future to note that even at the top, the lament is the same. "I always run out of capacity," said Mr. Cardinal, who currently has 1.5 billion -- that's right, billion -- bytes of memory capacity. Mr. De Arras, who has twice that capacity, muttered: "You never have enough speed or storage."

HEADLINE: LEGISLATIVE CHIEFS AND CUOMO REACH FISCAL AGREEMENT

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 19

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and state legislative leaders agreed today on more than a dozen major bills left over from the legislative session, including fiscal packages for Nassau and Suffolk Counties and an $800 million bond act intended to create jobs throughout the state.
The agreement salvages a legislative session that began with great promise, when a state budget was passed virtually on time for the first time in years, but ended disappointingly with many issues still unresolved. 
 And it represents a victory for Governor Cuomo, who gained assurance that virtually his entire economic-development agenda, including the jobs bond act and expanded powers for the State Thruway Authority, would be passed by the Legislature.
The accord to help Nassau County close its projected $153 million budget gap -- the stubborn issue that had held up everything else -- came after days of excruciating talks in which Mr. Cuomo and the legislative leaders dealt individually with each bill while vowing that none would succeed unless all the others did, too.
 
A Productive Session
 The agreement would allow Nassau to increase its mortgage-recording tax by one percentage point, to 2 percent, and to issue $59 million in bonds to close its budget gap.
At a news conference late this afternoon, a relaxed Mr. Cuomo said that today's agreement made this year's legislative session the most productive in years, even though two of his pet proposals -- an environmental trust fund and a state takeover of county Medicaid costs -- failed. "We got so many good things done, it's hard for me to be disappointed," he said.
Now that the Governor, Assembly Speaker Saul Weprin and the State Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, have agreed on the bills, they are still subject to approval by the Republican-controlled Senate and the Democratic-controlled Assembly. Little objection was expected to any of the bills in either house. Mr. Weprin and Mr. Marino said they would call their members back to Albany to take up the bills on July 28.
 
Bills for New York City
 The regular session ended in the early morning of July 3 as exhausted lawmakers left Albany without having resolved a passel of important issues. Though the Governor can call a special session any time, timing is important this year because by law the Legislature must pass the proposed bond act by Aug. 3 if it is to be put on the November ballot.
In addition to the economic-development bills, the leaders agreed to a half-dozen bills for New York City, including one that would extend the city's authority to negotiate the sale of its bonds and notes, and another that extends until 1999 a city program that gives tax breaks to companies relocating to areas within the city other than south of 96th Street in Manhattan. The New York City bills, which would usually pass both houses as a matter of course, were held up in the tangle of other issues.
The leaders also agreed to a bill that would authorize $300 million in bonding power for the State Job Development Authority; a bill that would distribute about $45 million in Federal employment funds, and a bill that would prohibit a doctor from referring patients to a health-care service in which the doctor has an ownership interest.
But it was the fiscal packages for the two Long Island counties that clogged the end of the session, adding another layer of complication to the intricate personal and political dynamic that drives agreements here.
 
Fiscal Plan for Suffolk
 Seeking to close their budget deficits, Nassau and Suffolk Counties had both sought permission from Albany to raise certain taxes and borrow money. In the end, the Suffolk package was not difficult to resolve. Late on Saturday, the leaders announced a plan under which Suffolk could borrow $36 million to close its 1991 deficit and then could borrow more money after its 1992 deficit had been certified by an independent auditor and the State Comptroller.
The plan would also allow Suffolk to raise its portion of the sales tax by half a percentage point, to 4.5 percent. That is in addition to the state's 4 percent sales tax.
Nassau County's request was much dicier. To close the county's projected $153 million budget gap in a $1.8 billion budget, County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta requested permission to raise the county's mortgage-recording tax, to issue up to $71 million in bonds and to freeze taxes for at least two years.
Because Mr. Marino represents Oyster Bay in Nassau and is a product of the county's powerful Republican establishment, he keenly wanted Mr. Gulotta, who is also a Republican and who is up for re-election in 1993, to receive the package he requested.
 
Unusual Leverage
 But that gave unusual leverage to Mr. Weprin, the Democratic Assembly Speaker, whose own programs are often thwarted by Mr. Marino and the Long Island Republicans. Mr. Weprin kept placing more and more conditions on the plan, insisting, for example, that Nassau submit to an outside financial control board and that the increased mortgage-recording tax be used to pay back the bonds, instead of freezing taxes.
Mr. Weprin, Mr. Marino, Mr. Gulotta and Mr. Cuomo sat with a bevy of aides in Mr. Cuomo's office for much of the weekend, often getting up to huddle in little groups. At several points, the talks appeared to be breaking down.
But the parties, and particularly Mr. Cuomo, persevered. In an effort to resolve the dispute, the Governor made one proposal after another, meeting rejection each time. "They were not able to make a deal, the two houses, and I didn't want to see this thing abort entirely," Mr. Cuomo said. Finally, he suggested that the issue of freezing property taxes be considered separately from the rest of the package, and that is the view that finally prevailed.
The agreement would allow Nassau County to issue up to $65 million in six-year bonds and also allow it to increase the mortgage tax by a percentage point. For the first 16 months, the new tax could be used any way the county saw fit, but for the remainder of the six years, the tax could be used only to pay off the bonds. As with Suffolk, Nassau's budget would be subject to oversight by the State Comptroller and by a locally appointed advisory panel.
The legislation contains no guarantee that property taxes would be frozen, but Mr. Cuomo invited Mr. Gulotta to submit a new request to Albany for such a freeze.
Mr. Marino would not comment on this. But Mr. Gulotta said he was disappointed that he could not guarantee a tax freeze for his constituents, and he warned that the Long Island Democratic Assemblymen who had opposed his request would pay for it politically.
Mr. Weprin said he was satisfied with the final plan, particularly the new oversight mechanisms for Nassau County. "I think it's a fair compromise and we have the results that we wanted," he said.
There was an almost festive mood in the air when the deal was struck, as legislative aides scattered. And Senator Marino, already three days late for a long-planned vacation in Austria with his wife, practically ran down the hall so he could catch the last flight tonight from Kennedy International Airport in Queens to Austria to meet her.
He took the Governor's state plane to Kennedy, and his aides said he had received special permission to board the Austrian flight directly from the runway, without having to go through the terminal.


GRAPHIC: Here are some of the major elements of the package agreed to by state leaders in Albany yesterday:
Chart: "Reviving Legislation: At Long Last, an Agreement"
 * A fiscal plan to help Nassau and Suffolk County close budget gaps.
 * An $800 million bond act intended to create jobs around the state.
 * Expanded powers for the New York State Thruway Authority, including allowing it to undertake economic development projects and to take over the Erie Canal.
 * A $300 million bonding authorization for the Job Development Authority, which provides loans to encourage businesses and industrial development.
 * A measure that would allow New York City to extend its authority to negotiate the sale of its bonds and notes. (pg. B4)

HEADLINE: Plan to Stock Salmon in River Is Dropped by Trenton Agency

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS

 BODY:
New Jersey, facing solid opposition from sport-fishing groups who feared an ecological disaster, has dropped plans to introduce Pacific salmon to the Delaware River watershed in the hope of creating a multimillion-dollar sport fishery.
The state Division of Fish, Game and Wildlife had proposed spending $800,000 to release 300,000 young chinook salmon annually for five years in the Musconetcong River, a tributary of the Delaware. The young fish would presumably have swum out to sea, remained there for about three years while growing to 20 or 30 pounds, then returned to the Musconetcong to spawn. They would then have been fair game for fishermen who, it was hoped, would have poured millions into the local economy. 
 But after receiving the results of an environmental impact study and fielding overwhelmingly negative public comments, the state announced on July 2 that the proposal would not be pursued further.
Officials say the plan was dropped for three reasons: because the study showed that only 240 salmon a year would return to the Musconetcong; because of budget constraints, and because the venture would conflict with plans to build up the Delaware system as a fishery for "warm water" gamefish like shad and smallmouth bass.
 
Proven Program Favored
 "Given the current fiscal crisis facing New Jersey, it doesn't seem prudent to invest that amount of money in a program in which our environmental impact statement shows such dismal returns," said Bob Soldwedel, chief of the Fish, Game and Wildlife Division's Bureau of Freshwater Fisheries. "Our priorities right now are directed toward the warm-water fish program," he said.
Opponents of the plan were delighted. "We feel elated," said Clinton C. Rodell, the conservation chairman of the New York-based Theodore Gordon Flyfishers Inc., one of several groups that banded together in the Delware River Defense Coalition to fight the proposal.
Several states, including Michigan and New York, have introduced Pacific salmon into Great Lakes waters, where they have become the basis of a lucrative industry in the lakes and along their tributaries. Michigan, for instance, estimates that anglers spend $250 million to $400 million a year on salmon fishing, while the stocking costs only $5 million.
But in the Delaware watershed, sport fishermen were almost unanimous in their opposition to the state proposal. They argued that introducing the salmon would disrupt the habitat of the much smaller trout in the Musconetcong and other trout waters in the Delaware watershed, including the Beaverkill of the Catskills, a revered stream among fly-fishers. The opponents also argued that the salmon could introduce disease.
At public hearings, residents along the Musconetcong said that even without the salmon stocking, crowds of fishermen were reducing the quality of life.
The environmental impact study, conducted by Versar Inc., an ecological consulting concern based in Columbia, Md., found that the proposed stocking would have no great ecological impact.

HEADLINE: U.N. Aide Quits Iraq After Failing To Gain Access for Arms Inquiry

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, July 19

 BODY:
Iraq sent a senior United Nations envoy away empty-handed today, citing sovereignty and security as reasons for its latest refusal to allow United Nations arms inspectors into its Agriculture Ministry.
"The Iraqi position is fundamentally unchanged," Rolf Ekeus, head of the commission to eliminate Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, said before he left the country. 
 When Mr. Ekeus arrived on Friday, he said he would warn Iraq that it faced the risk of attack if it did not comply fully with the terms of the cease-fire that ended the Persian Gulf war.
After two days of talks with Iraqi officials here, Mr. Ekeus left for Bahrain before returning to New York to brief the United Nations Security Council on his discussions.
Col. Douglas Englund of the United States Army, who heads the United Nations arms inspectors here, said, "There was nothing I could characterize as progress."
 
U.N. Team Sits in Jeeps
 A team of United Nations inspectors has been sitting in white jeeps outside the Agriculture Ministry since July 5, when they were first refused permission to search the building after receiving a tip from a Western intelligence agency that documents relating to Iraq's banned ballistic missile program might be hidden there.
The United States, Britain and France are becoming increasing irritated over Iraq's stand against the inspectors and a number of other quarrels with the United Nations. Diplomats say they are considering methods of dealing with President Saddam Hussein, including the possibility of an air strike.
On July 6, the Security Council issued a statement calling for the inspectors to be given "immediate access" to the ministry and saying Baghdad is guilty of "a material and unacceptable" breach of its obligations under the gulf war cease-fire agreement.
United Nations officials said the Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister, Tariq Aziz, showed some slight flexibility when he met with Mr. Ekeus today. But they said they were uncertain whether this indicated that Iraq was considering a change of position.
United Nations officials said the Iraqis appeared worried that granting this request might set a precedent that would allow the inspectors to poke around in other ministries and offices of President Hussein's secretive bureaucracy.
These officials speculated that the Iraqis' real fear might be that the inspectors would find clues to Mr. Hussein's personal movements and pose a threat to his security.
The standoff with the inspectors is only the latest in a series since inspectors began seeking information on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction so they could be disabled.
In all such previous confrontations, Iraq has backed down in the end, under pressure from the Security Council. But on this occasion, the quarrel is only one of a number of disputes, which suggests Baghdad may be adopting a tougher line toward the United Nations.
The work of relief agencies is being hampered by Baghdad's refusal to renew an agreement with the United Nations on humanitarian aid that expired last month. Iraq has turned down a Security Council offer to let it sell some oil to pay for imports of food and medicine and start compensating victims of the Kuwait invasion.
Iraq has also refused to accept the new boundary the United Nations has demarcated with Kuwait. And it continues its economic blockade of Kurdish-controlled northern parts of the country, denying them food and fuel from the south and refusing to pay civil servants and pensioners living there.
At the same time, United Nations workers here have started to come under attack for the first time.
A United Nations guard protecting relief workers in the northern region was shot dead Thursday and earlier this month two others were wounded in attacks by unknown assailants.

HEADLINE: AIDS-Focused New Parties Are Proposed at Conference

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AMSTERDAM, July 19

 BODY:
The eighth international conference on AIDS opened here today with a plea from the chairman for the creation of political parties devoted to AIDS and other health-care issues that would be patterned after the green parties dedicated to the environment.
At the same time, conference officials said they are considering convening a panel to discuss reports about the possibility of a new virus that causes a disease resembling AIDS. 
 The conference chairman, Dr. Jonathan Mann, said that although world leaders express concern about health, "it receives second-class political treatment in almost every country."
The worsening AIDS epidemic, Dr. Mann said, is a stimulus for political parties "to get the political and social commitment to health that everyone says health deserves, yet appears not to be the case."
Dr. Mann, former chief of the World Health Organization's AIDS program, is affiliated with Harvard University. He and his supporters advocate more government involvement in AIDS research and prevention, and a month and a half ago, they significantly increased their projection of worldwide AIDS cases by the year 2000. By then, they estimated, somewhere between 38 million and 110 million adults would be infected.
This projection far exceeded current ones of the World Health Organization. Since AIDS was discovered in 1981, many groups and communities have developed programs to educate people about ways to prevent the disease, which is caused by the human immunodeficiency viruses, or HIV.
 
Complex Influences
 AIDS is spreading rapidly in Africa, Asia and South America, Dr. Mann said, adding that the world needs to recognize that current efforts "will not stem the epidemic." The social, religious and political issues that have worsened the epidemic have not been adequately addressed, he said.
Dr. Mann asserted that health workers had contributed to the problem by playing a secondary, reactive and minor role in community and national politics, adding:
"Why has no government and no society been called to account for failures in health? Why do governments tremble when the inflation rate rises, yet no elections are lost over" health issues like AIDS or infant mortality.
AIDS is generally thought to be caused by two similar viruses known as HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 causes the overwhelming majority of cases. HIV-2 is limited to West Africa and some other areas of the continent.
From the early 1980's, when HIV was discovered, many specialists have said that additional viruses would likely be found as causes of similar diseases. They have likened the problem to hepatitis, an infection of the liver. In recent years, scientists have discovered several viruses that cause hepatitis.
But despite research in the United States and Europe, no new AIDS viruses have been detected.
The efforts have been stepped up over the last year as a result of published reports of a small number of puzzling cases of symptoms associated with AIDS, in which exhaustive laboratory tests could detect no evidence of either form of HIV.
Yet the patients had infections associated with AIDS, like Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancer, or pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, as well as fungal infections of types known to complicate AIDS.
 
Already at Risk
 Several experts have said in recent interviews that when they talk about such cases, they occasionally learn of an additional one. Although the new cases generate speculation about an undetected virus, the total number of known cases of this kind is estimated at two dozen. For the most part, the patients are among those considered at high risk for AIDS.
Among those who have found such cases are researchers at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York.
Detecting a new AIDS virus would have important health implications. If a virus is found that can be transmitted through the blood, like HIV-1 and HIV-2, it could result in the discovery of more cases of AIDS-like illnesses.
It would also be likely to lead to development of new tests to screen blood for transfusions and to determine whether individuals had been infected with the virus. For several years, blood banks have requested that individuals at high risk for AIDS avoid donating blood or limit donations to uses other than transfusion.
At least two teams of researchers have submitted reports to scientific journals of evidence of a possible new member of the retrovirus family to which AIDS belongs. But no paper has been published.
Virologists express caution about such reports because many initially published hypotheses, particularly regarding retroviruses, have turned out to be wrong. For example, some putative new human retroviruses have turned out to be animal viruses or other contaminants.
AIDS experts said that the discovery of a new virus would be far less important than detecting a mutation of either known HIV virus.

HEADLINE: Shrunken Budget Leaves Many Streets in Dangerous Disrepair

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
Street conditions throughout New York City have grown considerably worse in the last year, in some cases becoming dangerous to motorists, because of drastic cuts by the Dinkins administration in the budget for street repair and maintenance, and some community leaders charge that the remaining money is unfairly allocated.
The city's Transportation Commissioner, Lucius J. Riccio, acknowledged that the streets were reaching a state of crisis because of deep budget cutbacks by City Hall and that some roads were in such bad shape that they posed safety hazards for pedestrians and motorists. 
 "We are very concerned about the situation because there are safety issues involved here," Mr. Riccio said. "The problem is that there are just far too many roads that need repair, but unfortunately the budget situation does not allow for it."
But some community leaders charge that areas like southeastern Queens and Throgs Neck in the Bronx receive less than their fair share of even the reduced road-repair work that is being done because they lack political clout at City Hall.
 
A Local Safety Measure
 There is a pothole at the corner of 91st Avenue and 218th Place in Queens Village that is so large and has been there for so long that residents once planted a tree in it to prevent motorists from driving into it.
The tree has since been removed. But the pothole, 6 feet long and 3 feet wide, and hundreds of others in the area have not been repaired, despite repeated complaints from residents to the city's Transportation Department.
"If you drive down this street at night, your life is in danger, not from being mugged but from falling into one of these giant potholes," said Susan M. Noreika, chairwoman of Community Board 13, which helps coordinate city services in the area. "Actually, you can't really call them potholes anymore. A pothole is something that a pot fits into. You could bury a body in those holes."
The city's street reconstruction and pothole repair programs were virtually eliminated in the last two city budgets. The loss of the programs has hit hardest in areas like Queens Village and Throgs Neck, where the roads, which were poorly constructed by private developers and have inadequate drainage, are in great disrepair.
The problem is that many streets in these areas have been targeted for capital reconstruction, which in most cases will be delayed for four years. In general, streets slated for reconstruction are not eligible to be repaved, since they will simply be ripped apart again. Community boards may take a street out of the reconstruction program and ask that it be repaved, but many boards are loathe to do so because they fear necessary reconstruction will never be done.
"I don't think it's fair," said William Scarborough, district manager for Community Board 12 in Jamaica, Queens, where some streets are plagued by an obstacle course of unrepaired potholes. "Horrible street conditions like the ones we have here would not be tolerated in most areas of Manhattan."
Mr. Scarborough said the community board had received dozens of telephone calls and letters from residents who complained they had sustained physical injuries, flat tires and expensive car damage because of poor road conditions, particularly potholes and street cave-ins.
 
Need-Based Repairs
 Richard Ocken, the Transportation Department's acting assistant commissioner for highways, said that there were no "political favorites" in street repair. He said repair was based solely on need and road usage. "It's probably true that you will not find streets in Manhattan like some of the worst ones in Queens, because the Manhattan streets were built much better," Mr. Ocken said. "We certainly don't look at the socioeconomics or race of neighborhoods in prioritizing our repairs."
Commissioner Riccio said the Transportation Department was working with City Hall to restore some street-reconstruction and pothole-repair programs.
Leland T. Jones, Mayor David N. Dinkins's press secretary, said that as the recession wanes and city tax revenues improve, the administration would be able to restore funds to some of the areas most damaged by budget cutbacks. But he noted that department commissioners decide what programs to eliminate from their departments in order to meet their overall budget reduction.
Reconstructing, or totally rebuilding, a city street costs $1 million for every "lane mile," a measure one street lane wide and one mile long. Repaving costs $60,000 a lane mile. City transportation officials said most of the money in the budget is going for repaving and emergency pothole repair until the city's fiscal condition allows more reconstruction.
In the past, the city repaired all potholes reported to a special telephone line (212-POTHOLE) within five working days. Today, while the city still takes complaints over the phone, there is no money to repair the holes, except those that block main thoroughfares.
The last four-year capital budget for street reconstruction was $771 million and included both Federal and city funds. The capital budget for street reconstruction for the next four years has been reduced to a total of $191 million. And the latest capital budget contains virtually no city money, so the $191 million must be spent on Federal highway projects, not city streets. The budget for street resurfacing has remained intact at $55 million a year.
 
A Tin Lining
 So residents in Queens Village, Throgs Neck and other areas where reconstruction has been delayed appear to have little chance of getting their streets repaired, city transportation officials said. In addition, the officials said, in some areas they prefer not to fix the potholes because they provide much needed drainage, and to repair them would result in flooding.
Darren J. Morris, executive director of Deepdale Hospital, in Little Neck, Queens, said he had been trying for weeks to get the city to repair a 4-foot-wide, 2-foot-long pothole near a ramp from the Long Island Expressway that leads to the hospital. Mr. Morris said one doctor drove into the hole and broke an axle, a nurse lost a tire and ambulances nearly collide with cars trying to avoid the hole.
Mr. Ocken said that in some areas that have particularly bad streets, the city and community boards have agreed to limited repaving of those that are in the worst shape, but he acknowledged that some streets will not be repaired.
Hardent Vickram, who lives on 147th Street near Springfield in Queens, came up with a novel solution to the potholes that plagued his block. Mr. Vickram, a nursing-home attendant, decided to fill them in himself with concrete leftover from repaving a deck in his backyard. "I popped so many of my tires in those holes, I had no other choice but to do it myself," he said.

HEADLINE: The Rich Get Richer, but the Question Is by How Much

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 18

 BODY:
Trying to challenge the widespread impression that the rich got a wildly disproportionate share of the gains from the Reagan economic boom, the Treasury has been quietly circulating a "primer" on income distribution to journalists and economists.
The 24-page document, prepared by R. Glenn Hubbard, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Tax Analysis, asserts that the richest 1 percent of American taxpayers reaped only 11.3 percent of the income gains in the 1980's. The Treasury tracked the same individuals -- those who had extremely high incomes in 1979 -- from 1979 to 1988. 
 But experts in the field who reviewed the Treasury's calculation were highly critical, saying that the Treasury economist had fallen into a well-known statistical trap that all but guaranteed that the gains for the top group of income earners would appear modest.
 
Not 'Meaningful'
 "It's not a meaningful calculation," said Lawrence F. Katz, an economist at Harvard University.
The Treasury concluded that the top 1 percent of taxpayers "fared somewhat better on average over the 10-year period than many other taxpayers covered by the Treasury panel, but not very much better (and certainly did not capture a major share of the income gain)."
Its calculation contrasts sharply with one by an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Paul R. Krugman, that the richest 1 percent of American families reaped 70 percent of the growth in average family incomes from 1977 to 1988. Professor Krugman's data are now enshrined in Gov. Bill Clinton's economic program as the Democratic Presidential candidate and dismissed by the Treasury as a "meaningless statistical artifact."
There are many meaningful ways to look at the fortunes of various income groups. But economists said that by arbitrarily defining the top 1 percent as those who were in the group in 1979 -- as the Treasury did -- the study automatically introduces a downward bias in its results. By contrast, the group could have been defined as those who were in the top 1 percent in the midpoint of the 10-year period, or those who fell into the top 1 percent based on their average income over the entire decade.
"It makes a big difference how you define the rich, whether you define them at the beginning or end of the period," said Isabel V. Sawhill, an economist at the Urban Institute, a research organization.
To demonstrate this potential bias, Ms. Sawhill calculated how the income of the top 20 percent of income earners changed between 1976 and 1986.
"If you define the top quintile as people who had high incomes in 1977 and follow them for the next decade, you find their incomes declined by 11 percent," she said.
"But if you define them as people who had high incomes in 1986, and compare them to where they were in 1977, you find their incomes went up by 65 percent."
Researchers can produce skewed results in one direction or another based on whether the group being studied is culled from the year that starts a period or from the year that ends it. Those at the top in one year have only one place to go in subsequent years if they move out of the group: down. Some retire, some are discharged, and others, who may have just had an unusually prosperous year, go on to have more normal earnings. The average gain for this group is dragged down by those whose incomes move down.
Those who were in the top 1 percent at the end of the period under study could have moved up from only one place in the years past: from somewhere below. So the average gain for this group is inflated by people who joined the group by dint of big income gains.
"I would ask Treasury to redo their calculation on the top 1 percent defined by 1988 income, " said Joel B. Slemrod, an economist at the University of Michigan. "I'm pretty sure the numbers would change quite a bit."
A reporter had, in fact, asked Mr. Hubbard several times to make such a calculation, but he refused on the ground that the results would be uninteresting.
 
'Unevenly Distributed'
 Another statistic -- the Treasury's own -- is not mentioned in the Treasury's primer: In a comparison of the incomes of the top 1 percent of taxpayers in 1979 with those of the top group in 1988, the very rich accounted for nearly half of all taxpayers' gains in income.
"The gains of the 1980's were incredibly unevenly distributed, " said Mark Condon, a researcher at the Urban Institute who was co-author with Ms. Sawhill of a recent study of income mobility.
"That's what the Treasury is trying to refute," he added, "and that's what the Krugman calculation gets across pretty well."

HEADLINE: Allen Newell, 65; Scientist Founded A Computing Field

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
Allen Newell, a founder of the field of artificial intelligence and a leader in the study of human thinking, died yesterday at Montefiore Hospital in Pittsburgh. He was 65 years old and lived in Pittsburgh.
He died of cancer, a spokeswoman for the family said. 
 Dr. Newell, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, was considered one of the four fathers of artificial intelligence and an expert on how people think. He earned an international reputation for developing programs for complex information processing. He was the founding president of the American Association for Artificial Intelligence and had also headed the Cognitive Science Society.
Last month, President Bush awarded him the National Medal of Science.
Dr. Newell's interest in artificial intelligence grew from his work in the early 1950's on a Rand Corporation project for the Air Force to simulate an early warning monitoring station with radar screens and a crew. In trying to predict how the crew members would react, he became fascinated with the puzzle of how people think and make decisions.
Along with Dr. Newell and Dr. Simon, Marvin Minsky from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and John McCarthy from Stanford University are considered the pioneers in artificial intelligence by experts.
In the 1980's, Dr. Newell developed Soar, a sophisticated software system that learns and solves problems in a manner similar to human mental processes. He was the author or co-author of 10 books and more than 200 academic articles. His last book was "Unified Theories of Cognition" (Harvard, 1990).
Dr. Newell was born in San Francisco. He served two years in the Navy at the end of World War II. He graduated from Stanford University in 1949 and earned a doctorate in industrial administration at Carnegie in 1957.
He worked for Rand from 1950 to 1961, when he joined Carnegie. There he helped create the School of Computer Science and continued as a professor until his death.
His survivors include his wife of 45 years, the former Noel McKenna; a son, Paul, of Manhattan Beach, Calif., and a sister, Ann, of Pennsylvania.

HEADLINE: Japan Lures Auto Workers With 'Dream' Factories

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KANDA-MACHI, Japan

 BODY:
Move over, Disneyland. Make way for Nissan Human Land, as a company brochure describes the Nissan Motor Company's newest factory.
Here workers toil not in the assembly plant or paint shop, but work happily in the assembly or painting "pavilions." They walk along Palm Street and over Flamingo Bridge. And they eat in an employee cafeteria called the Harbor View Restaurant, with a panoramic view of the loading docks. 
 These attempts to create what Nissan officials call a "dream factory" attest to a serious problem. At a time when thousands of auto workers in the United States are losing their jobs, Japan's world-beating automobile companies cannot find enough people to fill their factories.
With Japan's rising prosperity, it seems, young people are shunning assembly-line work, which many of them view as monotonous, fast-paced and tiring. Young people have tended to favor jobs in the service industries and to avoid manufacturing jobs that are characterized by what are called the three K's -- kiken (dangerous), kitsui (difficult) and kitanai (dirty).
"Japanese are spoiled people nowadays," said Haruo Shimada, a professor specializing in labor economics at Keio University. While the economic downturn here has mitigated the labor shortage in recent months, auto industry executives expect the problem to be a continuing one.
As a result, companies like Nissan are trying to create "friendly factories" that will be easier for workers or will at least improve the image of auto factory work. "We are trying to make the work as fun as possible," said Shinichi Ariizumi, general manager of the plant, which opened in May.
The assembly plant -- er, pavilion -- is highly automated and has done away with the traditional conveyer belt. Each car sits on its own dolly, which can be raised or lowered at each work station so that workers do not have to bend or stretch as much.
"At the end of the day there are much fewer cases of muscle aches and backaches," said Katsutoshi Aihara, general secretary of the All Nissan Motors Workers Union.
But he quickly added: "It's not an amusement park, it's an automobile factory. There is still demanding work that requires muscle power, and workers still are bound by the clock and have to work at considerable speed."
At another factory, Nissan is experimenting with a "silver line" -- a heavily automated assembly line that makes work easier for workers over 50, allowing for recruitment from Japan's rapidly aging population.
And Mitsubishi Motors is allowing workers in its dormitories, where many unmarried employees live, to have their own tiny rooms, instead of having to share a tiny room with someone else.
Toyota, Japan's largest auto company, is borrowing excess workers from two depressed steel companies and plans to eliminate unpopular late-night work at a new plant. And several companies are taking what is still a relatively radical step here -- letting women work in the factory, although mainly in physically less-demanding jobs like inspecting vehicles.
Others note that even if the major auto plants are spruced up, conditions remain much tougher in the factories run by auto parts suppliers, many of which employ immigrant labor, some of it illegal.
 
Workers Were Consulted
 Nevertheless, Mr. Aihara of the union praised Nissan's efforts, noting that worker opinions were considered in the plant's design. Whereas worker amenities are usually added as an afterthought, he said, Nissan chose the site with the best view for the cafeteria, then designed the rest of the plant around it.
The labor shortage has been caused partly by a huge increase in auto sales and production in Japan. Sales in Japan increased to roughly five million cars annually in the last two years from three million in 1986, while production here, including exports, rose to 10 million cars from 8 million in 1986.
Even among the young people who do try auto work, as many as 30 percent quit in their first year at some companies. At Hino Motors, a truck manufacturer, the figure is 50 percent.
The worker shortage has meant long overtime hours, with many employees working 12-hour days and on Saturdays. That has contributed to Japan's image as a nation that cares only about production and not about the lives of its overworked citizens.
The huge bills for overtime and for temporary workers have also eaten into the profits of the auto companies. Labor costs for Japan's auto companies increased 10 percent in the last fiscal year, far faster than inflation, said Richard Ko, an auto analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities in Tokyo.
Actual wages rose only 5 percent. A starting Nissan factory worker makes about $1,200 a month, but more experienced workers can make far more, especially with overtime. Executives here say wages are at or above the levels for American auto workers, although that income provides far less buying power because of high prices here.
And auto executives say the long-term problem will not go away easily. For one thing, the auto makers are being pressed by the Japanese Government to reduce the average number of hours worked to bring Japan more in line with other industrialized nations.
Hence, more workers will be needed, even if production does not rise.
At the same time, Japan's low birth rate means that the population of 18-year-olds is expected to drop from roughly 2 million now to 1.5 million by the end of the decade.
"I don't think there will be a surplus," said Iwao Isomura, senior managing director in charge of personnel matters at Toyota. "In the short term there will be ups and downs."
Numerous tactics are being tried to cope with the recruitment problem, including opening factories in remote areas where there is less competition for workers. The new Nissan factory is on Japan's southern island of Kyushu, where Toyota is also building a plant. One drawback to this is that the auto factories are no longer close to all their suppliers, making it harder to implement such practices as just-in-time delivery of parts -- in which parts are shipped quickly as needed, rather than being stockpiled.
 
An Old Factory
 A better factory environment is another approach. At Nissan's 28-year-old Zama factory outside Tokyo, the body assembly shop is still called the body assembly shop. It is dark and noisy, with no air-conditioning, and temperatures can reach close to 90 degrees in the summer.
A striking contrast is the Assembly Pavilion in Nissan Human Land. The factory is brightly lit, with natural sunlight filtering in through skylights. Air-conditioners keep the temperature at 77 degrees.
At Zama, work is done on a traditional conveyer belt from which cars are suspended. The workers scramble to install parts, sometimes having to clamber into the car and squat on the floor, other times stretching over the front of the car to reach far under the hood. If a worker falls behind, the whole line must be stopped because all the cars advance in lockstep.
At the Nissan dream factory, cars glide along on intelligent motor-driven dollies, an innovation that is also being tried in some other plants in Japan and the United States. There is far less stretching and squatting. In addition, the cars do not all have to move at the same rate, giving a worker having trouble a little more time. When he is finished, the dolly scoots ahead to catch up with the one in front of it.
Automation is also much more evident. Painting and welding, two of the dirtiest jobs, are almost completely handled by robots, as is true in many plants. But in Kyushu, 20 percent of final assembly is automated, one of the highest levels for the auto industry, compared with 5 percent at Zama.
Nissan said the new plant would be able to produce 30 percent more cars per worker than its older plants, although there is some debate among experts about whether such automation really saves the company money once the cost of the robots is factored in.
Even in older factories, improvements are being made. Hatsuo Sato, a welder in the Zama plant for 26 years, said robots had taken over many jobs that once required him to work in dangerous, slippery places wielding a heavy machine.
"Compared with old times, the work conditions are easier," he said, adding that he thinks young people have the wrong image of auto work.

Fed Chief's Assessment Of Economy Is Awaited

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
After three years of trying to put the economy on track toward a stable, sustainable recovery, the Federal Reserve Board's chairman, Alan Greenspan, will try to explain to Congress this week why the central bank's efforts have not succeeded.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, Mr. Greenspan is scheduled to provide his semiannual presentation on monetary policy and the economy. 
 The last two times he made such presentations, in July 1991 and again in February, Mr. Greenspan did his best to sound upbeat.
Last summer, Mr. Greenspan told Congress: "We are well on the path of actually achieving the type of goals which we've set out to achieve" -- namely, a solid recovery, with unemployment down to its lowest sustainable level and inflation wholly under control.
In February, the Fed's outlook was only a bit less rosy, with Mr. Greenspan saying the stirrings of recovery visible then "should take hold in the second quarter."
 
Recovery Loses Momentum
 Since then, unemployment has risen to 7.8 percent, an eight-year high and a full percentage point above where the Fed projected six months ago that it would be by year-end.
Moreover, momentum again seems to be oozing out of the recovery, and money supply growth remains disturbingly slow.
In short, even though the Fed has lowered short-term interest rates 23 times over three years, the country seems to remain trapped in what Susan Hering, an economist at Salomon Brothers, has called economic purgatory.
For these reasons and others, private analysts are expecting a more sober assessment from Mr. Greenspan this time. And with the November elections less than four months away, Congress and the White House may not like what they hear, the analysts said.
 
'Depressing, Rambling Speech'
 "If I were Mr. Greenspan, I would not be looking forward to it," said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at C. J. Lawrence. "I think we can expect a depressing, rambling speech. But the real problem is that the economy is not responding to lower interest rates."
Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at the Chase Manhattan Bank, said: "Mr. Greenspan can say we are in a recovery, but there is no number he could point to to say that it will pick up steam. He has to go in there and say that. There is no way around it."
Although the Fed has been criticized for not easing monetary policy more aggressively up to now, the central bank's decision earlier this month to cut the discount rate to 3 percent and push down the Federal funds rate to 3.25 percent will probably make Mr. Greenspan's time on Capitol Hill a bit easier.
But most analysts say the nation has severe structural problems that are beyond the ability of monetary policy to cure. These stand solidly in the way of a more rapid rate of growth.
 
List of Problems
 Mr. Greenspan touched on some of those problems in February and is likely to spend more time elaborating on them this week.
The list ranges from overleveraged corporate and individual balance sheets to a glutted commercial real estate market and a military-contracting industry that is shrinking. An aging population has cut into demand for goods and services. And fiscal stimulus, which normally accompanies easier monetary policy in bad times, cannot realistically be expected until well after the election this autumn.
Aside from his comments on the economy and its direction, analysts and credit market participants said they would be very interested to hear what Mr. Greenspan had to say about money supply growth, which remains extremely sluggish despite all of the Fed's easing.
A year ago, Mr. Greenspan told Congress that the ideal growth rate for M-2, the aggregate most closely followed by the Fed, would be about 4 percent a year. But in the second quarter M-2 growth was flat, and for the year it has grown at a pace far below the 2.5 percent level that represents the bottom of the Fed's 2.5 percent to 6.5 percent target range for the year.
 
Mixed Signals From the Fed
 Weak money growth was cited by the Fed as the primary reason it eased monetary policy on April 9 and again on July 2. In between those dates, however, market participants received mixed signals from the Fed about the importance it placed on the performance of the monetary aggregates.
"Hopefully we will learn if the Fed has figured out why easier money isn't working, and if it knows what is wrong with the monetary aggregates," said Alan Sinai, president of the Boston Company Economic Advisors Inc.
Mr. Fine at Chase said an explanation of that sort does not seem likely.
"Virtually every Fed governor and bank president has said there are parts of the money stock they don't understand," he said. "But bank credit contraction continues at more or less the same pace as last year. As long as that continues, you cannot expect money to grow."

HEADLINE: Trade Pact Details Are Emerging

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 19

 BODY:
William H. Gates, who dropped out of Harvard to found the Microsoft Corporation, which grew into the nation's largest software company, could conceivably have a little difficulty if he wanted to program computers for a living in Mexico after a North American free-trade agreement was signed.
The agreement would ease temporary-visa rules for Canadian, American and Mexican computer operators who cross borders to find a job. But it requires the operators to have university degrees to qualify for special consideration, so as to prevent hundreds of thousands of Mexicans from flooding north after a few days of vocational training. 
 This is just one of thousands of compromises that trade negotiators from the three countries have struck in the last year. These deals, typically made with little or no public debate, will affect scores of industries the length and breadth of the continent.
 
Curtailing Debate
 The result of the secrecy has been a remarkably successful smothering of debate during an election year on an issue that prompted two months of impassioned debate in Congress last year.
And the Bush Administration has begun to investigate leaks that have occurred. In one recent breakthrough agreement, not previously disclosed, the three countries agreed to treat each other's advertising companies as they treat their own. Asked Saturday morning about this and other recent agreements, aides to Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, not only declined to comment -- on the ground that classified information was involved -- but also immediately began investigating possible sources of the leaks.
By Saturday afternoon, they had already checked the attendance records of senior advertising executives at meetings of Mrs. Hills's private-sector advisory groups and determined that not one of them had shown up for classified briefings at which the issue was discussed, an American trade official said.
 
Under Wraps
 During most of the negotiations, these deals stayed secret because all three countries classified thousands of pages of negotiating documents and conducted their talks with the secrecy and security once reserved for wartime military operations.
Now, with the trade talks entering their final weeks, the broad outlines of the secret arrangements -- and the remaining squabbles -- are beginning to spill out.
In the advertising deal, the principle of "national treatment," already applied in the international trade of manufactured goods, would give American advertising companies the same legal and economic rights in competing for contracts from Mexican enterprises as domestic companies there.
The deal would also exempt American and Canadian companies from the Mexican Government's longstanding requirement that foreign advertising companies open offices and hire staff in Mexico before they may run ad campaigns.
In a separate deal on immigration, rules on temporary work visas will be eased for professionals and executives transferred by their corporations. As chairman of Microsoft, Mr. Gates could presumably arrange his transfer to Mexico if he ever wanted to do so, and thereby qualify under the new rules, a person familiar with the negotiations said.
In another agreement, Mexico has agreed not to pursue a broad exemption from the pact for cultural industries, like films. Had Mexico received such an exemption, Hollywood's ability to compete with Mexican film companies would have been impaired. Canada received such an exemption in its 1988 free-trade agreement with the United States.
In yet another deal, negotiators have come up with a new definition of what constitutes a North American car that can be sold across the nation's northern and southern borders without duties and with fewer customs formalities. The new definition is more detailed than the one in the 1988 free-trade agreement between the United States and Canada and is a little more generous to foreign companies because it allows the inclusion of some administrative costs, like sales offices in the United States, in determining the percentage of a car's value that has been produced in North America.
But this generosity in definitions will be more than offset when the three nations set a higher percentage as the basis for special customs treatment. While the exact percentage will be one of the last decisions made, either at the ministerial or presidential level, people involved in the talks said it would likely be 60 percent or a little higher, compared with 50 percent under the old definition in the 1988 free-trade pact between the United States and Canada.
Detroit auto makers have sought a 70 percent standard, while Canada has sought to maintain the old percentage as a way to encourage further construction of auto assembly plants by Japanese and other foreign car companies.
Remaining issues, like trade in oil services and farm goods, will be addressed in Mexico on Saturday by Mrs. Hills and her Mexican and Canadian counterparts.
People involved in the negotiations said there was a slightly less than even chance of an overall deal being struck on Saturday. Many technical issues still have to be worked out, and American and Canadian negotiators are haunted by the memory that a similar deal by their trade ministers in 1987 had to be renegotiated two months later because niggling technical details proved too controversial for their staffs to resolve after the first meeting.
 
Fear of Publicity
 Mrs. Hills and her office's North American affairs section have imposed strict secrecy on the free-trade talks for fear that public debate would limit the ability of each country to compromise and strike the best possible deal.
Only a handful of copies of the incomplete agreement have been given to Congress, and those are being kept in special, high-security reading rooms and in the safes of several Congressional aides with the necessary security clearances.
Even other Government departments involved in the negotiations have been given information only about their sections of the free-trade accord and not about the overall agreement.
The Administration has maintained secrecy even at the cost of endangering President Bush's effort to maintain China's favorable trade access to the United States market. Senator Max S. Baucus, the Montana Democrat who heads the Finance Committee's Subcommittee on International Trade, and who has repeatedly led a group of farm-state Democrats across party lines in the last year to support the Administration's China policy, now says he will no longer back the President actively on China because his subcommittee has been cut off from needed information on the free-trade talks.


GRAPHIC: As negotiations continue to create a free trade agreement that would bind the economies of the United States, Canada and Mexico together into a regional trading bloc with more people and more economic output than the European Community, the Bush Administration has classified all the negotiating texts in an effort to forestall public debate until the agreement is complete. But information is leaking out from many people involved directly and indirectly in the negotiations.
 
Issues Already Resolved
Chart: "Creating a North American Free-Trade Area"
 Advertising -- Each country's laws and regulations would treat all advertising agencies in North America the same. Mexico would allow U.S. and Canadian companies to start doing business without setting up local offices and hiring local staff.
 Banking -- U.S. and Canadian banks virtually barred from Mexico, would be allowed to acquire shares in Mexican banks up to a total of 8 percent of the capital of all banks in the Mexican banking system. All banking investment limits in Mexico would be removed on Jan. 1, 2000.
 Computers and computer parts -- The circutry and half the total content of a computer would have to be made in North America to qualify for duty-free treatment.
 Copyrights -- Mexico has agreed to tighten its copyright, patent and trademark rules to bring them closer to U.S. and Canadian standards.
 Dispute resolution -- Panels will issue nonbinding rulings on commercial disputes like fishing rights. Negotiations continue on panels to issue binding rulings in subsidies and other trade law cases.
 Food safety -- Countries will be allowed to challenge each other's safety standards if they can prove that the standards discriminate against a country's products.
 Insurance -- U.S. and Canadian companies would be allowed to take over insurance companies in which they already hold minority stakes. All limits would be removed on Jan. 1, 2000.
 Manufacturing tariffs -- Customs duties on nearly 20,000 products would be reduced, immediately or in stages over as long as 20 years. Reductions in duties on glass tumblers and stemware and auto windshields are being discussed.
 Securities firms -- U.S. and Canadian firms would be able to buy companies accounting for as much as 10 percent of the Mexican industry's capital. All limits would be removed on Jan, 1, 2000.
 Textiles -- Garments will qualify for duty-free treatment only if the yarn is made on the continent, the cloth is woven from the yarn in North America, and all cutting and sewing are done in North America. Canada is seeking some exemptions from the rule.
 Trucking -- U.S., Mexican and Canadian trucking companies would be allowed to do business anywhere on the continent including on cross-border routes that are now forbidden.
 Temporary work visas -- Corporate executives and some professionals from all three countries will be able to live and work on business anywhere in North America with fewer bureaucratic formalities. The rules are narrowly written to prevent large-scale immigration to the United States from Mexico.
 
Unresolved Issues
 Autos -- Negotiations have agreed to eliminate Mexico's complicated system for requiring a rough balance in the import and export of cars and car parts. But they cannot decide how to do so. New rules have been worked out for measuring the domestic content of cars. The domestic content percentage will be higher than the 50 percent in the 1988 Free Trade Agreement with Canada, but the precise figure has not yet been chosen.
 Energy -- The United States wants Pemex, Mexico's state-owned oil company, to hire American companies for a wider range of oil drilling and refining operations. Mexico has agreed to streamline its process for issuing contracts to foreign companies, and has agreed to pay performance bonuses to oil exploration companies that work quickly and strike oil. It has not agreed to broaden the number of contracts available.
 Farm tarifs -- From avocados and corn to peanuts and sugar, disputes persist over how quickly quotas will be eliminated and tariffs reduced.
Government procurement -- Mexico wants to keep some restrictions on the contracts that its state-owned enterprises award to foreign construction and capital goods companies.
 Investment -- Canada wants to retain its rules for screening foreign investments exceeding $150 million (Canadian), or about $126 million (U.S.). Mexico also wants to maintain some restrictions.

Eric Bogosian Parodies Humanity's Dark Side

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
In the funniest among several new monologues that he performed at Alice Tully Hall on Thursday and Friday evening, Eric Bogosian parodies the popular psychologist John Bradshaw as his philosophy might be merchandized by a caricature of Werner Erhard. Where Mr. Bradshaw's earnest evangelical oratory exhorts people to get in touch with the "inner child" in themselves, Mr. Bogosian's character is a sarcastic, aggressive pitchman who urges people to indulge their "inner babies." The quintessential inner baby experience he describes is the childish happiness of successfully stealing a candy bar while the storekeeper's back is turned.
"Babies don't worry," he declares. "They are connected to the center, they are in the now." By making our inner babies happy with feedings every two hours, he promises, we can make the world a better place. 
 This Swiftian sketch was one of several new monologues in the program titled "Dog Show," which Mr. Bogosian created for Lincoln Center's Serious Fun festival. The narrator was one of several alter egos through whom Mr. Bogosian pretended to come out in various degrees from behind the characters he creates. These possible versions of his true self were sandwiched in between several of the brilliantly realized roustabout characters from his Off Broadway shows "Drinking in America" and "Sex, Drugs, Rock & Roll." They included a supercilious English rock star touting a benefit concert for the Amazonian Indians of Brazil and an urban lout chortling to a friend about the previous night's drug-fueled violence.
The new work was an attempt by Mr. Bogosian to shake up a mostly white middle-class audience that has absorbed the shock of his characters, many of whom come from the lower economic strata of American life. Mr. Bogosian's work has always trod the line between incisive character comedy and something deeper and scarier. At the heart of his vision of humanity is the idea that so-called civilized behavior is just a middle-class luxury. And in his newer material, he suggested to his audience that underneath our civilized surfaces, we are all selfish beasts. The inner-baby monologue was a pointed jab at a psychological climate that seems mired in arrested development.
In the show's most prickly sketch, Mr. Bogosian plays a middle-class man reflecting with guilt and fear on the meaning of his personal fulfillment. "Starving Africans spoil everything," he observes in a monologue that becomes increasingly surreal as he portrays the privileged life as one in which people are interactive with and dependent for security upon machines. Darkening this perspective is his nightmarish vision of old age in which he imagines himself a feeble nursing home castaway whose only pleasure in life is the occasional taste of strained peaches out of a can.
As with so many of his other monologues, this one ends with an ironic punch line, as the man who has everything except eternal youth and a clear conscience sarcastically sings, "I'm in with the in crowd."

HEADLINE: Help Russia for the Long Haul

 BODY:
The second Russian revolution is progressing only by fits and starts. Its leaders, however bold, won't be able to take many steps forward without taking some steps back.
The risk of a relapse in Russia calls for clarity about America's commitment to assist Russian reform. Yet Congress is slow to vote funds. And instead of clarity, President Bush has sown confusion. He told reporters after the seven industrialized powers pledged new aid earlier this month, "I don't know if there's enough money in the world to instantly solve the problems of the Russian economy." 
 That sort of talk just discourages American aid without spelling out the riskiness of the venture Russia is undertaking or, more important, the stakes America has in its success.
Aid from abroad cannot transform Russia, but it can encourage Russians to transform themselves. Withholding help will only weaken Boris Yeltsin and his band of bold reformers.
Democracy and the rule of law are taking root in Russia's inhospitable soil. In the Parliament new parties form and re-form. But progress is spotty. Parliament is trying to muzzle a vibrant press. And democrats have yet to consolidate their hold on major cities or establish a firm beachhead in the vast countryside. They are under threat from rising nationalism and unemployment.
Andrei Kozyrev, Russia's Foreign Minister, warns of the danger from disgruntled generals who manipulate ethnic conflicts to undermine the Yeltsin Government. The risks are apparent in Moldova, where Russia's 14th Army sides with Russian separatists against the Romanian majority and resists Mr. Yeltsin's order to withdraw.
While radicals try to rush Russia to markets, they face renewed resistance from the commissars of industry whose factories cannot survive without state subsidies or credits. Radical reformers may have the lead for now, but industrial managers who are in no hurry to free up markets are rapidly gaining ground. "We can have the workers in the streets whenever we want," warns their leader, Arkady Volsky.
The U.S. is trying to coax Moscow to markets with conditional aid, but if Russia resists the conditions and tries to find its own way, the U.S. can't refuse all help. In Russia's uneasy state it's dangerous to ignore the counsel that the mayor of Magnitogorsk recently gave: "Don't forget. You can bend a stick up to the point it breaks."
As Russia heads for turbulent times, Mr. Bush has little choice but to help the Russians do their best while reminding Americans of the real risks.

HEADLINE: Disputed Military Aircraft Crashes; 7 Aboard Lost

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 20

 BODY:
A prototype of the V-22 Osprey, a tilt-rotor aircraft whose future was already the subject of furious debate, crashed today in the Potomac River with seven people on board. Pentagon officials said no survivors had been found.
The aircraft, which takes off like a helicopter and flies like a plane, was headed for a landing at the Marine air station in Quantico, Va., about 35 miles south of Washington. 
 The aircraft was developed by a partnership of Bell Helicopter Textron and the helicopter division of the Boeing Company. Pentagon officials and spokesmen for the two companies said they did not know the cause of the crash but would investigate.
The Osprey has become a symbol of the controversy swirling around Pentagon efforts to cut military spending. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has repeatedly criticized the Osprey program as too costly and has complained that the prototype aircraft was 3,000 pounds over its weight limit.
Mr. Cheney took steps to kill the Osprey, but Congress put money into the budget to build the plane. When Mr. Cheney initially refused to spend it, Congress complained that he was illegally impounding the money.
Finally, on July 2, Mr. Cheney agreed to spend $1.5 billion he had been withholding. His decision allowed work on the plane to continue, but he put off judgment on whether the armed forces should buy the Osprey or an alternative helicopter still in development.
Robert Torgerson, a Boeing spokesman, said prototypes of the Osprey had recorded more than 750 hours of flight time in 635 flights. Four prototypes were flying before today's crash. A fifth prototype crashed on its first flight, in June 1991, at New Castle, Del., where Boeing has a test flight center. Two people aboard suffered minor injuries in that crash.
In today's incident, Sgt. Joseph M. Nuss of the Marines said the Osprey was preparing to land at Quantico when an explosion occurred and the plane plunged into the water at 1:42 P.M. Master Sgt. Paul F. Earle, a Marine Corps spokesman, said the crash resulted from "unknown technical problems."
Two other spokesmen for the Marine Corps, Maj. Barry Moore and Cpl. John W. Fritscher, said there were no known survivors. Mr. Torgerson, the spokesman for Boeing's helicopter division in Ridley Township, Pa., which builds the V-22's fuselage, said four Boeing employees and three Marine Corps employees were aboard. He was quoted by Reuters as saying late today that five of the bodies had been recovered.
 
Increasing Opposition?
 Today's crash may increase opposition to the tilt-rotor plane in Congress. The effect of the crash on Congressional support for the plane will be determined, in part, by the cause of the accident. If there was a fundamental flaw in design of the aircraft, support for its development might wane, say Congressional aides.
The Osprey has retained strong support among members of Congress, especially those from states where the plane is being developed, like Texas and Pennsylvania, which also have large numbers of electoral votes. The Marines Corps has also supported development of the aircraft.
And lawmakers have generally been reluctant to make deep cuts in the military budget despite the end of the cold war, fearing they would increase unemployment in an election year.
Representative Pete Geren, Democrat of Texas, has been a leader of House efforts to continue development of the Osprey. Describing today's crash, Mr. Geren's press secretary, Greta E. Creech, said the aircraft was about two miles away from the runway and was 200 feet above the ground when "two loud bangs or pops" were heard. "Then the aircraft dived into the water," she said.
Marine Corps officials said a search-and-rescue team was dispatched to the site of the crash to look for survivors and said they would try to recover the wreckage 27 feet below the Potomac's surface. Pentagon officials said it might take weeks to determine the cause of the crash.
 
Returning From Florida
 Terry A. Arnold, a spokesman for Bell Helicopter Textron of Fort Worth, a subsidiary of Textron Inc. of Providence, R.I., said the Osprey was flying from Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, where it had undergone testing for exposure to extreme weather.
In six months of laboratory tests at Eglin, the plane was baked and frozen, parched and soaked. It was pelted with water to simulate heavy rain and was exposed to temperatures ranging from 65 degrees below zero to 112 degrees Fahrenheit. It was to undergo further tests at Quantico.
Mr. Torgerson said the crash last year resulted from the improper wiring of flight control computers. The first flight test by an Osprey prototype occurred in March 1989.
Supporters of the Osprey said they hoped the crash would not lead to cancellation of the program.
Representative Curt Weldon, a Republican whose district includes the Boeing helicopter plant in Pennsylvania, said tonight, "From this day forward, our No. 1 priority will be to find out what happened to this aircraft."
The House Appropriations Committee and the Senate Armed Services Committee are scheduled to discuss the future of the Osprey this week.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Ross Perot;
To Boost Economy, Perot Planned to Seek Sacrifices

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 20

 BODY:
Ross Perot's plan for restoring the nation's economic health, nearly complete when he withdrew from the Presidential race last week, included a far-reaching program of investment in education, transportation and communications, as well as higher income taxes for the well-to-do, increased gasoline taxes and holding down increases in Social Security benefits.
The center of the Perot blueprint, his senior aides said, was balancing the budget in five years, with cuts in spending as well as new taxes to reduce the deficit by an average of $150 billion a year over the five years.
 
Gasoline Tax Increase
 The plan, about 50 pages long, included many steps long regarded by economic experts as necessary and by political experts as untenable. Among them were slowing increases in Social Security benefits and increasing the gasoline tax by a total of 50 cents a gallon over five years. 
 "Plenty of people not running for office have made these kinds of proposals time and time again," said Isabel Sawhill, an economist at the Urban Institute. "The problem has been that no one seeking higher office has done so. If Ross Perot can help get such proposals on the table, that would be a big contribution."
Officials of Mr. Perot's campaign said fear of public hostility to the plan was one reason the Dallas billionaire withdrew Thursday.
 
Plan Influenced Decision
 "He is an engineer," said James D. Squires, communication director for the Perot campaign. "He looks at these things. Certainly the prospect of running on this plan had to influence any decision that he couldn't win outright."
The main architect of the economic plan was John P. White, a budget official under President Jimmy Carter.
Many officials of the Perot organization are still pressing for the economic plan to be made public in the next two weeks in the hope that its ideas can influence the Presidential race, even if their candidate is no longer in it.
Mr. Perot said through his secretary today that he had "not yet signed off on the plan." But his aides said they were confident that he would approve it and make it public.
Campaign aides said the plan, some details of which were reported in The Chicago Tribune and The Wall Street Journal, also called for limiting deductions on business entertainment expenses and mortgage interest payments, with some Perot aides wanting to limit deductions to the first $200,000 of a mortgage on a house.
"The principle behind this is shared sacrifice for shared reward," Mr. Squires said. "What we saw is, the poor don't get all the entitlements. The rich and the middle-class get a lot of the entitlements."
Mr. Squires and other campaign officials said the plan also called for raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans -- as the plan of the Democratic Presidential nominee, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, would also do -- but Mr. Perot and his advisers had not yet decided how much such increases should be.
"Each piece of this plan would probably be rejected by a large majority of the voters," said Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic poll taker. "But there is a constituency in the country for facing up to hard truths and taking the bitter medicine."
 
Attacking Sacred Cows
 Linda DiVall, a Republican poll taker, said: "If Perot was going to release something specific he had to do something along these lines, particularly in the areas of sacred cows, especially in entitlements. If people really want change, then they might buy into this plan. His plan probably would have lost some favor with voters, but he probably would have regained it if he had stuck to his guns."
Charles Schultze, an economist at the Brookings Institution who was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Carter, said the program was "the best plan I've seen in a long time." He added: "If you are serious about balancing the budget, then there will have to be big tax increases. Gasoline taxes is one way."
Mr. Perot's assistants said the plan also proposed either reducing the cost-of-living increases for Social Security recipients by one-third or increasing the taxes on the wealthier recipients of Social Security. The plan would also have limited cost-of-living increases for Government pensions.
Perot campaign aides said the reductions in Social Security and pension increases would total $50 billion over five years. The plan also considered increasing taxes or premiums for affluent recipients of Medicare.
Other elements of the plan called for eliminating income taxes for new businesses for the first five years, and for making permanent a temporary research and development credit plan, an idea favored by Mr. Clinton and by President Bush. To encourage investors and business to think long term, the Perot plan would also lengthen the amount of time people must hold an investment to qualify for certain reductions in capital gains taxes.
Campaign officials said the public investment program in the plan would be tens of billions of dollars but would be smaller than Mr. Clinton's plan to invest $200 billion in infrastructure, education and job training over four years.
The Perot plan would be financed by selling bonds, especially to pension funds, an idea promoted by Felix G. Rohatyn, the New York investment banker. Mr. Perot has known Mr. Rohatyn for years, and he served on the board of Mr. Perot's computer services company, Electronic Data Systems, in the early 1980's.
Mr. Perot's plan would also provide for investment tax credits, and aides said they were also weighing a proposal to tie capital gains tax cuts to how many employees a company hires.
"We're trying to free up money to give it to the rich in the sense that it would go to business to invest in the right way," Mr. Squires said. "You have to make it attractive for the wealthy to create jobs, rather than invest their money abroad or in the gambling house on Wall Street."
Perot campaign officials say the plan was neither liberal nor conservative, borrowing ideas from the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Secretary of Housing Jack F. Kemp.
 
Seeking Higher Growth Rates
 It included tax incentives for businesses investing in depressed urban neighborhoods and proposed more job training for inner-city youths.
"The whole point of the plan is to get higher growth rates," said one Perot campaign official.
Under the plan, Mr. Perot would have cut the military budget by about $40 billion more over five years than President Bush has proposed. The Perot program also called for cuts in subsidies to farmers, with the cuts aimed at larger farmers and corporate farms, rather than small farmers, aides said.
"This plan shows very clearly how tough it is to balance the budget," said Rudolph Penner, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office who was one of the many experts Mr. White asked to go to Dallas to provide information and ideas on policy. "The real question is, if all the issues are laid out honestly, whether any politician who does that can win an election? I'd be pretty pessimistic about a politician who did that being able to win a majority of the vote."
Mr. Squires said Mr. Perot was "more comfortable showing this plan to the country as a noncandidate than he could possibly be as a candidate."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Political Week;
No Summer Doldrums In Going After Clinton

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 20

 BODY:
This is a rough season in politics. Gov. Bill Clinton rolled out of the Democratic convention with an extraordinary surge in the polls, and the Republicans have to stop it. From their perspective, they have little choice but to go on the attack. It is as simple as that.
President Bush generally leaves the job to surrogates at this stage of the campaign, but he took on the job himself today. He said Mr. Clinton's economic plan was nothing but "smoke and mirrors." He said Mr. Clinton had dodged the deficit. He even complained that Mr. Clinton had stolen one of his lines when the Democratic nominee told last week's Democratic convention, "Now that we have changed the world, it's time to change America." 
 Surrogates have gone much further. Last weekend, Senator Jake Garn of Utah warmed up a crowd at a Bush campaign rally by attacking Mr. Clinton's draft record, thus putting that issue back onto front pages and television newscasts. Mr. Garn called Mr. Clinton and Senator Al Gore, his running mate, a team of "pretty boys" who "have spent their entire waking moments since they were teen-agers, planning, plotting, their political careers." (A decidedly different take on the all-baby-boomer ticket.)
Spokesmen for the Bush campaign and Senator Garn said there was no communication between the two about the substance of the attack. "His comments were all extemporaneous," said the Senator's press secretary, Mary Jane Collipriest.
The Democrats were having none of it. "Sure, yeah, right," said James Carville, a top strategist for Mr. Clinton. "There is nothing they do that is not contrived and orchestrated."
Charles Black, a senior adviser to the Bush campaign, said Mr. Clinton's economic plan "gives us enough ammunition to run on till Thanksgiving." On Tuesday, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, a partisan warrior of some renown, will hold a briefing on the Democrat's economic policy, which Bush forces assert is the same old tax-and-spend liberalism with some moderate window-dressing. They also say that Senator Al Gore, Mr. Clinton's running mate, is an environmental "extremist." (An issue of some import in the industrial Midwest.)
The Bush campaign also has some "values issues" in its sights, Mr. Black said. Abortion. School choice. Mr. Clinton supports giving students a choice of which public schools to attend, but would not give them vouchers they could use in private or parochial school, as Mr. Bush proposes. This is a matter of interest to Catholic voters, Bush strategists say.
Democrats warn darkly of a coming Republican assault on Mr. Clinton's character; his image only recently began recovering from the primary season, when he spent much of his time denying charges of infidelity and having avoided the draft.
Democrats say that Mr. Bush has no positive message that can win him re-election, so he must rely on the destruction of his opponent. The effort is carefully planned, they say, to protect Mr. Bush as much as possible. "It's always one step away from George Bush," said Ginny Terzano, press secretary for the Democratic National Committee. "It's never his hands on it, or his sound bite. It's always one sound bite away."
The Republicans counter that they are simply running a campaign on the issues. "We don't have anything in mind for the foreseeable future that does not relate to substantive issues," Mr. Black says. They also correctly note that the Democrats at last week's convention were hardly gentle in their assessments of the Bush Administration.
Still, there are risks for the Republicans in going too far. There is the memory of 1988, when the Bush forces ran what was widely considered to be a state-of-the-art negative campaign against Michael S. Dukakis. The Bush campaign drew considerable criticism for its emphasis on the case of Willie Horton, a black convicted murderer who escaped during a weekend furlough from the Massachusetts prison system, and later raped a Maryland woman and stabbed her fiance.
There is the more recent memory of the Bush campaign's surrogate assault on Ross Perot, whose standing in the polls was falling when he left the race last week. The danger for Mr. Bush is that voters come to see him as a man with little more to his campaign than attacks. This is clearly what the Democrats hope to convey.
Mr. Carville says: "When they attack us, we're going to say this: 'That George Bush said he'd do anything to get re-elected. That we know he'll fight with heart and soul to stay in power. But he won't do anything to help the economy. Just do something to help people, Mr. Bush.' "
Whatever the risk, the Bush campaign confronts some basic facts: The economy is still ailing, the President's approval ratings are low, and Mr. Clinton seems to be making substantial progress in redefining himself as the bright young agent of change. Can the Republicans afford to let that proceed? Particularly when their experience shows that he who defines his opponent first wins?
Mr. Bush, who always seemed annoyed by the criticism of his 1988 campaign, talked of himself today as more victim than victimizer. "I have a very quiet confidence that when I take my case to the American poeple, that things will work out," he said in a Rose Garden ceremony when he was asked a sympathetic question about his treatment by the news media. "But you know, to be very honest, it's not pleasant. It's not pleasant."
The one certainty about the next few weeks is that it will not be pleasant.

HEADLINE: An Industry's Winners and Losers Once a Free-Trade Pact Is Signed

SERIES: A New North America -- First of three articles.

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MARTINSBURG, W. Va.

 BODY:
The West Virginia glass industry has become a kind of prism through which North America's steady march toward a sweeping new free-trade agreement can be seen.
The new pact with Mexico and Canada, which the three Governments now seem likely to reach within weeks, will clearly have widespread economic ramifications. 
 It will add jobs, wealth and economic activity throughout the continent, economists say, but at the same time will bring hardship to a minority of individuals.
 
Job Gains for Some
 The treaty will, among other things, provide businesses in the United States, Canada and Mexico with a market of 370 million consumers -- greater than the European Community -- with each country gaining millions of new customers.
And consumers of all three countries will be able to buy an increased variety of goods, at reduced prices.
Nowhere are forces of change that have brought the three countries together now or the ramifications of a new treaty more evident than in the glass industry of West Virginia.
The 660 workers of the automated Corning Inc. factory here, for example, can expect greater job security than they have now, and new jobs may be added. Their employer, like scores of other big American corporations that have become much more international in the last decade, has formed an alliance with an overseas competitor -- in this case, Vitro S.A., the giant glass company of Mexico. Corning is expected to gain substantially from rising sales as Mexico cuts its tariffs.
But about 2,000 workers in small handmade-glass factories 160 miles to the west, on the other side of the Appalachians, face possible financial ruin. Even with tariffs that currently add up to 38 cents to the cost of each dollar's worth of imported glass, half the local industry has already gone bankrupt in the last decade, partly because of Mexican competition.
"If that duty is released, it's just going to kill us," said Michael Hall, president and part owner of a small company, Mid Atlantic of West Virginia Inc., which makes high-quality glass flower vases and drinking glasses in two kilns set up in a warehouse in rural Ellenboro.
And experts say the changes will reverberate throughout the region, For example, United States exports to Mexico accounted for nearly a tenth of all economic growth in this country since President Bush took office and should increase even faster.
Intense negotiations to complete the treaty have been held in secret and all negotiated texts have been classified. Nevertheless it is known that broad agreements have been reached on issues involving many important industries, including banking, advertising, securities, insurance and trucking. Deals in some other areas, like the auto industry and farming, are nearly complete, and top trade officials from all three countries will meet on July 25 in Mexico to iron out as many remaining details as possible.
Although the other big glass producers -- Libbey Glass Inc., the Anchor Hocking Glass Company and the Indiana Glass Company -- are still working fiercely to maintain high tariffs, particularly on tumblers and stemware, their ranks are now split by the defection of Corning, the largest glass maker in the country, and once a powerful and influential opponent of reducing import duties on glass that now aggressively advocates the free-trade agreement.
Another of the biggest and oldest supporters of glass tariffs, the Anchor Glass Container Corporation of Keyser, 50 miles west of here, was purchased by Vitro several years ago.
Lobbying by companies like Corning and Anchor in the glass business, and their counterparts in many industries, has raised the chances of the pact's signing and eventual passage by Congress. By contrast, resistance to the free-trade pact from West Virginia's many small, handmade-glass companies and their employees has been virtually nonexistent or ineffective.
The employees' national union, the American Flint Glass Workers, has not been visible since organizing a large letter-writing campaign a year ago against the opening of negotiations with Mexico. The union, which has never called a strike at Corning, now is also divided and has been especially quiet about the planned agreement.
And the small producers are leaderless. Their trade group, dependent on foreign makers of glass-making equipment for much of its annual dues, has been paralyzed. When Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th, Democrat of West Virginia, asked 16 small companies for their views, he received only three short replies.
"When you're salesman, president and janitor, it's hard to have the time to lobby," said Kenneth B. Dalzell, who heads the 60-employee Dalzell Corporation in New Martinsville. He did not reply to the Senator's letter.
 
The Losers
A Venerable Craft Faces Extinction
 Mid Atlantic's kiln in Ellenboro is the size of a two-car garage. Glass blowers work there at a craft that has changed little since the 19th century when the industry grew up along the banks of an Ohio River that provided easy barge transportation for the needed sand.
In front of each of a half-dozen white-hot kiln portholes, several middle-aged workers dressed in T-shirts turn molten glass into flower vases with iron pincers and the strength of their lungs.
Standing in the heat, S. Douglas Davis takes a five-foot hollow stainless steel tube that two other men have prepared and pushes it into the glowing, molten glass. He slowly twirls it to gather an even layer of glass around the tip, then withdraws the rod and passes it to James C. Davis, a glass blower who is not related to his co-worker.
James Davis breathes gently through the rod until the soft, clear goo has expanded to the desired length and diameter. Then he places the glass in a vise-shaped mold at his feet, clamps the vise shut with a foot pedal and blows a little more air through the rod so that the hot glass fills the mold. He releases the foot pedal and hangs the rod and newly blown flower vase upside down on a metal rack. Other men -- the only women in the factory pack boxes with finished glass -- will shape the base and then use iron pincers to sever the vase from the rod.
The job takes a year or two to learn properly, and pays about $10 an hour. Labor accounts for half the cost of making glass in West Virginia, and natural gas accounts for another fifth. Mexican wages are $1.50 an hour and gas there is 15 percent cheaper.
Mid Atlantic has a tenuous grip on its business. It sells many of its drinking glasses to the nearby Fenton Art Glass Company, which paints or carves them with the brand names of beers and soft drinks.
When Fenton set up its decorating operation in the mid-1980's, it bought blank glasses from Vitro. Fenton switched to Mid Atlantic after Mr. Hall and a friend bought the 50-year-old factory in 1987 and reduced prices by eliminating health insurance and vacations and cutting wages by 25 percent.
But George W. Fenton, the president of the company, said that even with these drastic economies, glass from Mid Atlantic was only competitive with Vitro's glass because of the current tariffs.
With even a small drop in tariffs, Mr. Fenton said he might switch back to Vitro. "There's not a lot of difference price-wise" with the tariff included, he said. "They do a good job."
If small-town glass factories in West Virginia are forced to close, job prospects for their employees are not good. Doddridge County is the seventh poorest of West Virginia's 55 counties and has an unemployment rate of 11.5 percent. A quarter of the county's population receives government assistance.
Blowing glass is a highly specialized skill not needed by other industries. And most of the workers in the industry are lifelong West Virginia residents with little preparation and scant interest in moving to cities hundreds of miles away in search of work. If the factory closed, James Davis said: "There's nothing I could do. I'd just go home and see about going on food stamps."
The trade talks have proceeded for 13 months. Yet only in the last month have Administration officials begun to review seriously how much money, if any, they should scrape together in the Federal budget for workers who may lose their jobs as a result of the pact.
The workers themselves, who will bear much of the burden of the free-trade accord, see few ways to influence the outcome. One older glass man walking between the Fenton's kilns in Williamstown confided that he thought the free-trade agreement "stinks." But he had not sent any letters to his senator or representative.
"I can't write," he said. "I don't know how to spell right."
 
The Winners
A Chance to Win New Customers
 Corning's patented glass and ceramic mixtures, which can tolerate sudden temperature changes, were developed during the 1950's for use in the nose cones of American space rockets and nuclear-tipped missiles. Corning built its factory here in 1960, putting cold war technology to civilian use in casserole dishes and pots that could go from the refrigerator to the oven.
With $150 million invested over three decades, the factory now produces Corning's latest clear pots and dishes, the Visions line, which can be used over an open flame. The main building stands several stories tall and covers the area of two football fields. At one end squats a tank that is full of molten glass and as big as a two-story house. Corning is spending $6 million here this summer to speed the time it takes to change the colors of the pots and pans.
Day and night, seven days a week, the molten glass, heated to 3,100 degrees Fahrenheit, pours into molds made from a specially hardened steel alloy first used in aircraft turbines.
David G. Lyons, plant manager at the Corning factory here, made his company's strongest argument for a free-trade agreement with Mexico while standing next to a four-armed machine here that grabs glass pots and sticks flowery decals on them. Mr. Lyons said he and his wife still used a set of blue flower-motif Corning dishes received as a wedding gift 26 years ago.
"That's one of our problems, it lasts so long that we've got to be continually putting out new products and decorations," he said as he walked on toward the oven where the decals are fused to the pots.
By eliminating tariffs and other trade barriers along the nation's southern border, a free-trade accord will ease sales to 90 million increasingly prosperous Mexicans whose kitchen cabinets are not yet crowded with Corning's cookware and plates.
Nor are the workers at Corning complaining, even as the plant expands to meet export demand and some adverse effects of the trade-agreement become clear to them.
Max J. Corbin, the vice president of the factory's chapter of the American Flint Glass Workers, said about the pact: "If you're thriving, then you don't hear about it. But if you're down crawling, on unemployment, then you're going to start crying out."
 
The Theories
Weighing Effect Of Ending Tariffs
 Economists say the free-trade treaty will benefit customers, retailers and manufacturers while creating jobs. "We're talking about, on net, 100,000 jobs in the U.S., broadly scattered, and increased efficiency" as companies locate their factories in whichever country provides the best combination of labor, investment and transportation, said Gary C. Hufbauer, an economist at the Institute of International Economics, a nonpartisan research group in Washington.
Even without the elimination of import duties, these movements are under way and are strongly defended by corporations. In the consumer glass market, imports have captured two-fifths of the United States consumer glass market, and Richard Dulude, a vice chairman of Corning who heads the joint venture with Vitro, said the Mexican products would replace imports from Europe and Southeast Asia instead of competing with small West Virginia companies. Vitro currently controls only 4 percent of the overall United States glass market, but has larger market shares for some types of glass produced by small West Virginia factories.
The United States, Mexico and Canada have negotiated schedules for eliminating tariffs on all but a couple of hundred products, including many types of glass, of the 20,000 different product categories at issue.
While tariffs for most products will be eliminated immediately or over 5 or 10 years, tariffs on most consumer glassware are almost certain to be placed in the longest phase-out category of 12 to 20 years to help the small glass makers adjust. Even under the longest schedule, tariffs will have fallen significantly by the end of the decade.
Yet so far the issue of compensating losers from an agreement has received limited attention. The reason is partly the Federal budget deficit but also the Administration's position that Government should not interfere in the market by helping any specific industry.
"Who knows where the American economy will be in 15 or 20 years?" one senior official said when told of the glass workers' worries. "Maybe there will be jobs for them in the service sector, maybe computer catalogue jobs."

HEADLINE: BAKER AND RABIN NEAR A LOAN DEAL

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, July 20

 BODY:
A deal seemed to be shaping up today for housing loan guarantees from the United States to Israel, in which Washington would give the Israelis the guarantees they are seeking in exchange for broad limits on settlement-building activity, but not a total freeze.
A senior State Department official briefed reporters after the second day of talks here between Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and Israel's new Prime Minister, Yitzhak Rabin. The official said he was now hopeful that an arrangement for loan guarantees could be worked out in a way that would "match their needs as well as ours." 
 Israel is seeking $10 billion in guarantees from Washington to help it provide housing and jobs for immigrants from the former Soviet Union.
 
Election-Season Bonus
 The conclusion and announcement of a deal would be left for a meeting between Mr. Rabin and President Bush that is expected to take place at Mr. Bush's Kennebunkport, Me., home some time early next month. In an election year, Mr. Bush would presumably like to gain the greatest political benefit he can with Jewish voters by announcing a deal with Mr. Rabin at his side.
Mr. Baker seems to be trying to set up the basis of that deal on this trip, before his expected resignation as Secretary of State and move to the White House to help steer Mr. Bush's re-election campaign and shape overall Administration policies.
An announcement of Mr. Baker's job switch could come as soon as the end of this trip on Sunday. After his swing around the Middle East, Mr. Baker will fly to Manila for a meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
Neither Israeli nor American officials would provide details of the loan guarantee arrangement they are working on. But they said that in broad outline it involves Israel announcing its intention to substantially limit all settlement activity in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip as a condition for the American guarantees.
The United States is apparently ready to allow the Israelis to finish a certain number of housing units under construction in the territories, as well as permit a limited degree of "natural growth" in existing settlements in the Jerusalem area and the Jordan River valley. Mr. Rabin considers both of these security regions where some building must be allowed.
 
Calculus of Vital Interests
 The Jordan valley divides Israel and Jordan, and the Israelis have military installations there. Jerusalem has been reunited as the Israeli capital since East Jerusalem was captured from the Jordanians in the 1967 war. Every Israeli Government has insisted on building in and around Jerusalem to emphasize that the city will not again be divided.
Natural growth would involve either adding rooms to existing houses or constructing roads and bridges to accommodate growing families. Israeli and American officials stress that the exact numbers in these categories was still to be determined.
Mr. Rabin's officials are still sorting through the records of the previous Government of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, trying to get a grip on what sort of building commitments it had undertaken in the West Bank and Gaza, Israeli officials said. The officials added that the records were a mess and that there was a lot of activity they were not yet fully aware of.
While Mr. Baker and Mr. Bush had told the previous Government that they would allow it to finish housing units under way in exchange for loan guarantees, they were strict on the numbers involved and the limits on natural growth. Given Mr. Rabin's intention to shift spending away from the territories, the Bush Administration is ready to be somewhat more flexible with him.
Today, the Prime Minister had his Finance Minister, Avraham Shochat, and the Governor of the Bank of Israel, Jacob Frenkel, brief Mr. Baker on the general economic policies of his Government. The officials made clear that Israel intends to transfer as many resources as possible from the occupied territories to towns and factories inside the nation's pre-1967 boundaries.
Speaking to reporters after that briefing, Mr. Baker said: "We just had a full discussion with our colleagues about the reordering of national priorities that the new Government is undertaking. I hope and believe that I have made it clear to the Prime Minister and his colleagues that President Bush and this Administration in the United States attach a very high priority to the absorption of immigrants to Israel."
Nevertheless, American officials say, what is still needed is wording that will demonstrate that the Bush Administration is maintaining its position that settlements do not "promote peace" while at the same time allowing enough of a loophole for Mr. Rabin to finish a certain number of houses previously contracted and to augment those settlements he considers vital to national security.
Mr. Baker and Mr. Rabin were discussing the precise wording of that diplomatic formula tonight.
 
Considering Palestinians, Too
 Such a formula also has to be one that the Palestinians can live with. Palestinian leaders say they cannot go on cooperating with Washington if it is perceived to be subsidizing Israeli settlement building.
Mr. Baker and other American officials met today with a Palestinian delegation led by Faisal al-Husseini and Hanan Ashrawi. During their talks, the Secretary apparently told the Palestinians that whatever deal he worked out with Mr. Rabin would involve broad limits on settlement building, with some small exceptions.
He seems to have urged them to keep their eye on the broad limits and not get caught up in the exceptions, inasmuch as Mr. Rabin is clearly shifting Israeli priorities.
Mrs. Ashrawi, speaking to reporters right after the talks, signaled that the Palestinians had gotten the message and were apparently willing to tolerate such a deal, provided that it really does involve a near-total freeze on settlements and provided that the Americans insure that none of their funds would be spent in the occupied territories.
Mrs. Ashrawi said the Palestinians would not demand "a total settlements freeze before negotiations" with the Rabin Government, just as they did not insist on such a freeze as a condition for talks with Mr. Shamir. They would prefer a freeze, she said, but are realistic about the situation.
She added that the Palestinians could tolerate a granting of loan guarantees by Washington and would not walk out of the peace talks "if the U.S. insures that its funds are not used for settlement activities and has the ability to adequately monitor" Israeli spending.
The loan guarantees that Israel is seeking are not grants. They involve the United States' guaranteeing repayment of loans Israel takes out from private banks in the event of an Israeli default on those loans. The guarantees will enable Israel to get loans at favorable interest rates.
The cost to Washington would be several hundred million dollars that the Treasury would set aside to cover potential defaults, with the exact amount depending on the total of the Israeli loans.

HEADLINE: Citing Fear of City Crime, Nassau Raises Police Salaries

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MINEOLA, L.I., July 20

 BODY:
In suburbia, where the police are hailed as heroes -- and given some of the highest salaries in the country -- the onset of fiscal problems can produce particularly wrenching conflicts.
When a retired carpenter, Frank Abrami of Seaford, stood at a meeting of the Nassau County Supervisors and warned that a new police contract approved today could push the county toward fiscal ruin, "down the slippery slope like New York City," county officials were not amused by the comparison. 
 "Nassau is not going to be New York City," said the Nassau County Executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, a Republican. Referring to the audience, made up almost entirely of off-duty police officers, he added, "the people who are behind you are going to make sure that is not the case."
So it went as the Nassau County Board of Supervisors, in a fit of New York City bashing, approved a contract that would grant police officers perhaps the highest pay of any large department in the country, with raises far beyond the rate of inflation.
By a vote of 4 to 2, the supervisors raised police salaries to an average of $59,000 in 1995. The action came at a time when the county has laid off or demoted 2,300 other county workers and is seeking to borrow $65 million to keep its budget in balance.
But Benjamin Zwirn, the supervisor from the town of North Hempstead, his voice rising in outrage, said criminals were now stealing his neighbors' cars in broad daylight. "And they are heading west, not east," he said, motioning toward the boundary that divides the county from the big city to the west.
The police officers cheered. There were so many of them filling the Board of Supervisors chambers here -- 600 of the county's 1,600 or so Patrolmen's Benevolent Association members showed up for a rally outside -- that other citizens who had something to say were forced to wait in the hallway until it was their turn to speak.
Under the four-year contract, the police agreed to some concessions, including a freeze on wages this year, givebacks for newly hired officers, and deferral of some pay.
 
Increases Top Inflation
 In return, salaries for officers will raise to the highest level in the metropolitan area. Officers with 20 years' experience will see their pay rise by 1995 to $64,442, from $51,124, an increase of 26 percent, according to the police union. For the most experienced officers, pay would top $64,400.
In June the annual rate of inflation in the metropolitan area was 3.4 percent.
The police union says the contract all but pays for itself. But the contract was challenged by anti-tax advocates and by the Long Island Association, a major business group, which concluded that it would eventually cost the county $75 million.
Opponents of the settlement said that new longevity payments -- increases based on length of service -- would increase the salaries of many officers even further, bringing raises of as much as 55 percent for some officers.
When the contract was first negotiated by Mr. Gulotta, members of the Board of Supervisors from both parties grumbled about the cost. But when it came time to vote, all three Republicans and one Democrat, Mr. Zwirn, voted yes. Some were enthusiastic, some said they voted for it out of fear that the alternative -- binding arbitration -- could be worse.
Mr. Gulotta offered ebullient praise for the police and scorn for the critical business group.
"Let them go out and risk their lives and tell us what this contract is worth," he said.
 
Memorial for a Taxpayer
 Moments before the vote, Pat Friedman, from Garden City South, a leader of a tax revolt group here, announced that taxpayer groups would hold a mock funeral procession bearing the casket of a "dead taxpayer" and a grieving mother, through the streets of Nassau County to protest taxes and spending.
"We are dead and we will demand a funeral procession for Nassau County taxpayers," she said.
But she was applauded by the audience when she declared that she was not anti-police -- her brother was a New York City police officer -- and said she understood that police officers in the county were pressing for more money because "they cannot afford to live here either."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Republicans;
Bush Attacks Clinton Economic Plan as 'Big Mistake'

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 20

 BODY:
President Bush today delivered his strongest attack to date on the Democratic Presidential candidacy of Bill Clinton, calling the Arkansas Governor's economic proposals "smoke and mirrors" and "a big mistake" that would increase the Federal deficit.
Mr. Bush said a 27-page economic plan Mr. Clinton issued in June would damage the economy by raising taxes and the deficit. He also said Mr. Clinton's proposals to save money by streamlining programs and reducing "overhead" were illusory. 
 "What I see is a program that does not address itself to the deficit," Mr. Bush said in a Rose Garden talk with members of Boys Nation, an American Legion civics program. "I think we've got to get the deficit down. I don't think you need to go raise taxes on people right now. I think that's a big mistake. I think it's counterproductive."
 
Bad News on Economy
 The comments came as Mr. Bush's advisers gave him a mid-year report on the nation's economy, which most economists agree is stumbling partly under the weight of the Federal budget deficit that has doubled, to almost $400 billion a year, during Mr. Bush's tenure.
Mr. Bush's economic adviser, Michael Boskin, told the President that the annual rate of economic growth had declined in the second quarter from the 2.7 percent rate of the first three months of 1992, said one official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
The President's remarks appeared to signal the opening of a tougher and more personal campaign style by Mr. Bush, who trails Mr. Clinton in public opinion polls by 20 points or more. Until now, Mr. Bush has left it to his aides and other Republican surrogates to mount direct attacks on Mr. Clinton and his running mate, Senator Al Gore of Tennessee.
Mr. Bush has long said he would refrain from attacking his opponents directly until after the Republican convention next month, a pledge his press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, repeated today. On Saturday morning Mr. Bush stood offstage at a rally in Provo, Utah, as that state's retiring Senator, Jake Garn, criticized Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore as "pretty boys" who had never held jobs in the private sector, and assailed Mr. Clinton's efforts to avoid the military draft during the Vietnam War.
Mr. Clinton's spokesman, George Stephanopoulos, ridiculed Mr. Bush's statement today, saying the Clinton campaign would match its economic proposals "up against his any day of the week."
"George Bush has the worst economic record of any President since Herbert Hoover," Mr. Stephanopoulos said. "If he wants to debate it, we're ready."
Mr. Clinton proposes $220 billion in spending on new public works programs, education and tax cuts for families by 1996, to be offset by almost $300 billion in spending cuts.
The combination of spending cuts, improved productivity and higher economic growth would cut the Federal deficit by $150 billion over that four-year period, Mr. Clinton argues.
In his comments, the President said that he and Mr. Clinton "have a big difference on the economic approach" that the White House planned to highlight in the fall campaign. But the two Clinton proposals that drew much of Mr. Bush's fire today, commitments to reduce Government waste and to raise taxes on the wealthy, are as notable for their political significance as any money they would produce.
Merely making unspecified administrative changes, Mr. Clinton argues, would save $22 billion by 1996 and streamlining the Pentagon's inventory would save $9.8 billion. Mr. Stephanopoulos said today that the savings would be produced by applying private business practices to the Federal Government and imposing a 2 percent cut in Federal spending on items other than payrolls.
Mr. Clinton's savings proposals recall Ronald Reagan's pledge, as a Presidential candidate in 1980, to reduce 2 percent of all nonmilitary Federal spending by cutting "waste, extravagance, abuse and outright fraud." Many critics accused Mr. Reagan of engaging in sophistry at the time, and Mr. Bush said the same of Mr. Clinton today.
"When you analyze the program, they have this expression around here -- 'smoke and mirrors,' " Mr. Bush said of Mr. Clinton's savings plan. "You're going to save it all by eliminating overhead, eliminating waste, and there's billions of dollars that is earmarked to do that, and I just don't think that's practical."
The President also attacked Mr. Clinton's proposal to raise $83 billion over four years, primarily by raising the tax rate for the top 2 percent of wage earners and placing a surtax on $1-million-plus incomes.
 
'Spending Too Much'
 "I think the Government is spending too much," he said. "I don't think people are taxed too little. I mean, I don't think that's the problem." The President called tax increases "a big mistake" that would prove "counterproductive," a reflection of the Administration's belief that tax increases reduce money for investment and stifle economic growth.
Mr. Stephanopoulos agreed today that the Clinton plan called for more taxes on the wealthy, but he said some of that money would be returned to the middle class through a tax cut or a tax credit for children.
Other Administration officials expressed anger at Mr. Stephanopoulos's challenge to compare the Bush and Clinton programs, noting that many elements of the Clinton plan were identical with Mr. Bush's proposals. They include proposals for a national integrated computer network, investments in magnetically levitated trains and "smart" highways monitored by computers, tax credits for research and development, urban enterprise zones and incentives to convert defense industries to civilian uses.
"The one huge, screaming difference is that Clinton's is financed by a $150 billion tax increase, and ours is financed by cuts in entitlement spending and nondefense spending," said one senior Administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
The group to which Mr. Bush spoke today, Boys Nation, teaches the tenets of democracy and politics by staging mock elections and legislatures, and by exposing young people to leading public figures. One person who got his first taste of politics at Boys Nation was Mr. Clinton, who still boasts a photograph of himself shaking the hand of President John F. Kennedy at a 1963 meeting of the group.

Tour Touches Small-Town America

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WILMINGTON, Ohio, July 20

 BODY:
The crowd that streamed into Utica, Ohio, Sunday night doubled the town's population of about 2,000, clogged streets and yards that had to be turned into parking lots and spilled over onto side streets for blocks around.
And when the Clinton-Gore motor tour reached the Clinton County Courthouse here today, this time in the middle of a workday, a similar crowd waited, patiently standing under a broiling sun for a rally that started more than an hour late. 
 The thousands of people who have come to hear Bill Clinton and Al Gore have appeared along the route because they have seen the candidates on television or been invited by officials of the state Democratic Party. But they have also come to hear what the two men have to say.
"Ladies and gentlemen, you have some clear choices in this election," Mr. Clinton said today, practically thundering into the microphone in the picturesque town square here. "They go way beyond party politics, beyond Republican and Democrat, beyond liberal and conservative to the heart of the question. Are we for the future or the past? Are we going to go on to a new direction or have four more years of the same?"
 
Lennon, Not Sousa
 The music has changed at the rallies as the new ticket has discovered that their relative youth is an advantage. There is more John Lennon ("Power to the People") and John Mellencamp and less John Philip Sousa.
And although the traditional roster of politicians attends the rallies -- Senators Howard M. Metzenbaum and John Glenn in Ohio or Gov. Jim Florio in New Jersey -- they seldom share the stage.
The candidates' day usually begins with a jog before they climb onto their luxury buses for the trip to the first midmorning event. Mr. Gore, who began the trip by giving full, slightly blustery speeches about the state of the nation, has now begun to devote more of his remarks to praising Mr. Clinton and introducing their wives.
Both men touch on the same themes of change, renewal and the future, and their comments vary little from stop to stop. They have even begun to perfect a tandem question-and-answer style that allows Mr. Clinton to pass on the questions he seems less sure of.
 
An Unexpected Question
 But Mr. Clinton, who is fond of fielding questions at town meetings, did get one surprise this evening when a Louisville, Ky., television station used a taped question from a prominent citizen, Vice President Dan Quayle.
Mr. Quayle was in Louisville last week and taped the question directed to Mr. Clinton, criticizing an economic plan that the Vice President said would raise taxes.
"Why is a tax increase the centerpiece of your economic growth agenda?" Mr. Quayle asked Mr. Clinton in the taped piece. "Now, I know you'll say you're just going to tax the wealthy, but we've heard that before. When you Democrats start defining wealthy, it becomes defined as anyone who has a job.
"I don't buy this idea that it's just going to be a few that are going to be taxed," he said. "When you start talking about tax increases everyone gets hit."
Mr. Clinton responded, "Read my lips," and the audience burst into laughter.
"No responsible person would ever do what George Bush did and say 'Read my lips,' " Mr. Clinton said. He added that the question was not "entirely straightforward."
The candidates' message of change is a tireless repetition of the theme that the Democrats are convinced will give them the advantage in November. They hope that by winning over the independents and Republicans who have said they were profoundly disillusioned with politics and government, they can maintain the edge they have gained in public opinion polls.
 
Pounding Home the Message
 The bus tour, which left New York City on Friday with plans to cover 1,000 miles through eight states before ending Tuesday in St. Louis, has taken the reinvigorated Democratic Presidential campaign to the sort of setting Mr. Clinton likes best and is most familiar with after 11 years as Governor of a small, mostly rural state.
By pounding home the message that they will be able to change a country that polls have shown many Americans think is on the wrong track, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore are presenting themselves as the very essence of everything new and improved.
Along the route, the two Democrats are offering a laundry list of sweeping policy promises for voters: "to rebuild the economy, secure their future, build up their children's education, provide health care for all, liberate the energies of the American people and make America win again," as Mr. Clinton said today in Wilmington, about 50 northeast of Cincinnati.
But the towns are almost always small, the crowds largely white and the events carefully planned to be colorful and camera-friendly.
 
'I Like the Vision'
 "I like the things they're saying about change," said Ira Rubins, 41 years old, an association executive who had driven two and a half hours from Cleveland to Utica, about 30 miles northeast of Columbus, with his wife and sister-in-law to catch a glimpse of the Clinton-Gore ticket. "I like the vision they have. They have experience in the kinds of things running government takes."
His wife, Cathie, added, "They have a lot of specifics to say."
Such words, coming from a couple who hauled lawn chairs to Utica and patiently waited five hours for the candidates to appear, are exactly what the Clinton-Gore campaign advisers are dying to hear.
"We don't have the answers to every problem," Mr. Gore said today. "But we've got a brand new approach to governing that puts people first for a change."
In these appearances, Mr. Clinton often wears plaid shirts instead of suits. Seated on a hay bale next to his wife, Hillary, on Sunday, he actually chewed on a piece of straw. And Mr. Gore and his wife, Tipper, offer the very picture of a middle-American couple. Together, they project the image of the family values ticket, a challenge to Republicans who have said Democrats are too far out of the mainstream.
Neither Mr. Clinton nor Mr. Gore resists naked political pitches to Ross Perot supporters, and Perot supporters in Kentucky planned to meet with Mr. Clinton in Louisville. The candidates also seem delighted when the Republican opposition attacks.
"What are they going to do?" Mr. Clinton asked in Utica. "They're going to run us down. They've already started. They say: 'You vote for Clinton and Gore, those guys are kooks.'
"Look, the crowd in Washington now, they raise the taxes on people who drive pickup trucks and lower them on people who ride in limousines," he said. "Who are they to talk about tax and spend?"
The crowds are easily stirred these days, and even when the motorcade snarls highway traffic, trapped motorists generally smile, wave or grab their cameras to take pictures of the decorated buses. Mr. Gore has taken the chant he started last week at the convention, on the road.
He shouts: "What time is it?"
The crowd chants back: "It's time for them to go."
Or, as one young man did today in Columbus: "It's 10:15."

HEADLINE: SARAJEVO AIRLIFT SUSPENDED BY U.N. AFTER TRUCE FAILS

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovi na, July 20

 BODY:
The first 24 hours of a cease-fire negotiated by the European Community passed today amid such heavy fighting that the United Nations military commander here closed Sarajevo Airport and suspended the airlift of food and medicine that has been sustaining this besieged city.
Because of the airport closing, ordered by Maj. Gen. Lewis W. MacKenzie of Canada, no relief aircraft flew in here for the first time in 23 days. 
 The United Nations airlift began immediately after President Francois Mitterrand of France visited here on June 28. Until today, it stood as virtually the only breakthrough in outside efforts to mitigate the bitter war that has engulfed this newly independent republic.
 
Capital's Mood Is Grim
 At dusk today, artillery, mortar and sniper fire continued to resound around Sarajevo, as it had from the moment the cease-fire was scheduled to take effect at 6 P.M. on Sunday. But the mortar battle across the airport that prompted General MacKenzie to halt all aid flights appeared to have eased. United Nations officials said that if security in the airfield area continued to improve, they hoped to resume the 20 daily relief flights on Tuesday morning.
The mood in this capital after a day of the most intense shelling in a month was grim. The attacks added to the distress of a population that has spent the last eight days with little or no electricity and running water as a result of Serbian attacks on the major power lines running to the city.
According to figures compiled from Sarajevo hospitals, the shelling, apparently originating from Serbian forces on the hills surrounding the city, killed at least 15 people and wounded more than 100.
 
Not Peace, but Terror
 Most of the casualties resulted from mortar attacks of the kind that have killed and wounded thousands of civilians in Sarajevo since the war began early in April. The effect was to turn what was to have been a peaceful day to one of terror, with people running in panic from explosions that left as many as 15 people at a time lying in pools of blood in the street, some dead and others grievously wounded.
One mortar shell struck a narrow street near the old military hospital in the city center shortly before noon, killing 2 people and wounding 12. David Turnley, a photographer for The Detroit Free Press, said that he followed the wounded to a hospital and saw a man of about 60 lying dead beneath a blanket in a corridor, still clutching two loaves of bread bought at a bakery near where the shell hit.
He said a middle-aged woman who was severely wounded in the attack, on learning that her 9-year-old son had been killed, cried out repeatedly, "Bush! Bush!" apparently a plea of the kind often made here for American military intervention.
Other mortar shells struck near the Magribia Mosque in the city center and in front of the Presidency building, the seat of the Government. Still others fell in the western suburbs of the city, including Dobrinja, where 35,000 people have been surrounded by Serbian forces for nearly 80 days.
One of the worst attacks, in Vojnicko Polje, a suburb close to Dobrinja, hit four teen-age girls taking the evening air on Sunday.
Dr. Abdulah Nakas, chief surgeon at the old military hospital, said that one of the girls, aged 15, was in a coma from the head wounds inflicted by shrapnel and was unlikely to recover.
One of the girl's friends, in an adjacent ward, said they had taken the walk an hour after the cease-fire was to have begun. "We thought it was going to be quiet," she said.
The failure of the cease-fire surprised few here, after a succession of truces in recent weeks that were broken as soon as they began. But it attracted more attention than earlier ones that were negotiated by United Nations military commanders here, in part because it was reached in London after negotiations led by Lord Carrington, the former British Foreign Secretary who is chairman of the European Community's Conference on Yugoslavia.
General MacKenzie, announcing the airport shutdown at a news conference at the United Nations headquarters here, expressed a wearied view of the situation born of his own repeated frustrations in obtaining signed commitments to cease-fires that turned out to be meaningless.
"I had held some hope that since the cease-fire was negotiated at a high level it would be more successful than previous ones," he said, "but quite frankly it seems that the level of the fighting is proportional to the level at which the cease-fire is negotiated."
 
General's Assignment Ending
 For the general, the collapse of the cease-fire was a major disappointment, coming as it did only 10 days before his assignment here is scheduled to end.
When General MacKenzie, who is 52 years old, announced last week that he would be returning to an army command in Canada at the end of the month, he denied speculation here that he was being removed by the United Nations because of the animosity toward him by Bosnian Government officials. These have accused him of leaning toward the Serbian side in the delicate negotiations that he has conducted during his months here.
The general said that the 850-member Canadian battalion that has provided the bulk of the United Nations military force here would be returning at the end of the month to United Nations cease-fire units in Croatia. Under standard United Nations practice, he said, the Sarajevo command will pass to a general from one of the three countries that will be providing detachments to replace the Canadians, France, Egypt and Ukraine.
 
Gorazde Suffers Again
 Elsewhere across this republic, the amateur radio operators who are the only link between Sarajevo and a few remaining Government-held towns reported that intense Serbian attacks continued throughout the first day of the cease-fire.
The starkest report came from Gorazde, the only predominantly Muslim town in eastern Bosnia not to have been captured by Serbian troops who have swept through the region in what Serbian political leaders have described as a campaign to "cleanse" the entire area of Muslims.
In one radio report from Gorazde, a man's voice told of artillery attacks so heavy that wounded had to be left lying in the streets. "Please tell the world that this is what the Serbian promises in London have come to," the man said.
Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian President, renewed his appeal for United States military intervention, saying that American bombing attacks on the Serbian gun positions around Sarajevo would be enough to break the siege and give Government defenders a chance to fight on a more equal basis.

Europe's Cold Shoulder
 BRUSSELS, July 20 (Special to The New York Times) -- The European Community declared today that it would oppose the membership of the Yugoslavia composed of Serbia and Montenegro in international bodies, sealing that federation's isolation in Europe.
At its monthly meeting of foreign ministers here, the community accepted the opinion of its legal experts that the state formed by Serbia and Montenegro is not the successor to the former Yugoslavia and thus must be admitted anew to the United Nations, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and more than 40 other international bodies.
The new state had already been suspended by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and the Council of Europe. Each body has its own criteria and the European Community's opinion is not binding.
The foreign ministers approved the allocation of $168 million made earlier in the month by the European Commission for Bosnian refugees, but made no decision about where the money would be applied or whether individual community countries would accept refugees. 

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
U.N. Delays Action
 UNITED NATIONS, July 20 (Special to The New York Times) -- The Security Council delayed taking action today on the crisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina. After an informal meeting, delegates said that the Council would most likely limit itself to urging the warring sides to observe the cease-fire agreement.
The Bosnian Foreign Minister, Haris Silajdzic, met with several members of the Security Council to urge them to take more decisive action, but said afterward that he was disappointed by the lukewarm reaction he received.
"This cease-fire plays into the hands of the aggressors," Mr. Silajdzic said.

HEADLINE: Congress Opens Midsummer Session With Bills on Spending and Abortion

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 20

 BODY:
Congress today began a four-week session, wedged between the two political conventions, that will be devoted to both scoring campaign points and passing legislation to keep the Government in cash and to settle complex issues like energy and cable television.
Only one bill with clear implications for the Presidential campaign will come up in both houses of Congress this session, the Freedom of Choice Act, which would prohibit most state restrictions on abortion. The House will also take up a tax bill aimed at increasing the tax on people who earn more than $1 million a year in order to subsidize food and social services for needy children. 
 Otherwise, most of the major activity in this session will deal with appropriations bills and complex, important, but not especially partisan measures like reinstituting the regulation of cable television and developing national energy policy.
Still, there is a strong political motive behind fast action on essential measures like spending bills. After these four weeks, Congress recesses for the Republican National Convention and two more weeks of campaigning of its own, and then returns for only three or four weeks before quitting for the year.
 
Lots of Work, Little Time
 "We've got a very full agenda and not much time for it," said Senator Tom Daschle, Democrat of South Dakota.
In the House, the political initiatives will come largely from the Democrats. Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the majority leader, said that while it was late in the Congressional session to develop new partisan legislation the bill to aid children "uniquely" fit that category.
He said the measure -- sponsored by Representative Thomas J. Downey, Democrat of Suffolk, and called for by Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the Democratic Presidential nominee -- not only aided children but also "taxes the wealthy as the Clinton economic plan said we should."
The waning weeks of the session provide new urgency for another Gephardt effort, the effort to forge at least Democratic agreement on a bill to control the nation's spiraling health-care costs.
"We've got to get it out of committee," Mr. Gephardt said. "That, to me, is the most important bill we've got before us."
 
G.O.P. Focuses on Insurance
 If Mr. Gephardt can secure approval of a health-care bill in the Ways and Means Committee, the legislation may come to a vote on the floor in September. But Republicans will be ready with a substitute that could command wide Democratic backing. The substitute focuses chiefly on health insurance problems, like the difficulties in obtaining small group insurance policies if employees have had health problems.
Comparable efforts by Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, to gain agreement on health-care legislation that is probably broader in scope also face an uncertain future.
Aside from abortion, the most likely prospect for a partisan fight in the Senate will come next week, when the Finance Committee takes up legislation for enterprise zones intended to pump economic life into the cities.
The Bush Administration may try to resurrect its call for cuts in capital gains taxes and advantages for home buyers as a way to make its argument that the flagging economy is not its fault. The problem with this approach is that most Senate Republicans, unlike their House counterparts, saw little merit in the Administration's plan when it was first offered last winter.
Senator Mitchell said he hoped there would not be a prolonged effort to restart the Administration program. "I hope we can do the urban aid bill," he said today.
 
Abortion Battle Looms
 Abortion is the one issue sure to lead to confrontations in both houses. Democratic leaders, with substantial Republican support in the Senate, are pressing ahead on the bill to prohibit almost all state restrictions on abortion except statutes requiring parental consent for teen-age abortions.
Supporters contend that if some states make it very hard to obtain an abortion, pregnant women who are poor and have to travel will be denied their constitutional right to equal protection of the law, and interstate commerce will be burdened.
Democrats have the votes to pass the bill in both the House and the Senate, though not enough to override a veto by Mr. Bush. But their ability to draw that line clearly between the Democrats, including Mr. Clinton, and the President could be thwarted by a Senate filibuster.
Senator Mitchell, the chief sponsor of the bill, said "I don't know" when asked if he had the 60 votes needed to cut off debate. He said he would bring the bill up next week.
Action in the House will come later in the session.
On all sides this is clearly a political issue. Both passionate advocates and opponents of the measure see political advantage in getting their votes on the record. Democrats can tell advocates of abortion rights that if Mr. Clinton is elected such a bill would become law. The President can tell opponents of abortion that his re-election is the only thing keeping the legislation off the books.
 
Some Legislative Uncertainties
 It is not yet clear whether the Senate will go forward with House efforts to enact trade legislation intended to identify and put pressure on trading partners who restrict imports from the United States.
Nor is the Senate sure to carry through the House effort to shift some money from foreign aid to highway building, requiring an amendment of the 1990 budget act. Action on that question, and on foreign aid spending itself, is unlikely before September.
But aid for the republics of the former Soviet Union seems to have lost its potential for partisan conflict. House Democrats had kept it off the schedule until domestic measures like extended unemployment benefits and urban aid were dealt with. With those bills now settled, Mr. Gephardt said the aid measure would be scheduled for a vote before Aug. 17, when the Republican convention begins.
This week's schedule has few major partisan conflicts on it. The House will deal with efforts to block most-favored-nation trading status for China and, as it has before, will pass such a bill with Republican help. But the Senate still lacks the votes to override a Presidential veto, and the schedule there is uncertain.
The House also has spending bills and the cable television measure before it. The Senate will deal with energy legislation later this week.
But first it debated garbage legislation -- really. Without taking any votes, the Senate argued about the Interstate Transportation of Municipal Waste Act. It would allow governors to prohibit the importation of trash into their states.

HEADLINE: A Campaign to Pull Scranton Back From Disaster

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SCRANTON, Pa., July 20

 BODY:
At a news conference that drew somber city officials and community leaders, state officials today released the outlines of a Draconian financial plan intended to halt Scranton's march to certain insolvency this fall.
The state developed the plan after city officials, who were unable to agree on a proposal of their own, filed what amounted to a bankruptcy petition last year. Scranton, the fifth-largest city in Pennsylvania, is by far the largest of 10 municipalities in the state to seek this solution. 
 This city of 81,000 people, a high proportion of them elderly, has a 1992 budget of $40 million and a deficit of $7 million.
Over the past 50 years, the anthracite coal industry has declined and the city has lost nearly half of its population, but it has not made proportional reductions in services. Residents had become accustomed to a high level of services and, until the recession bit even more deeply into revenue, officials found it easier to raise taxes than lay off workers.
 
Budget Out of Kilter
 About 85 percent of the city's budget goes for payroll costs, a far higher percentage than in most cities. Scranton has a fire department with twice as many firefighters as cities of similar size elsewhere in the nation. The city also has the highest taxes in northeastern Pennsylvania, and it cannot raise them without driving away more residents and businesses.
In part because of the city's financial problems, city officials have long been in a political paralysis, said Charles W. Waters, executive director of the Pennsylvania Economy League, a nonprofit research organization. The league, under a state contract, developed Scranton's recovery plan.
"City governance has lost the respect of its citizens to such an extent that even efforts by the city to act responsibly are usually misconstrued and seldom obtain the desired outcome," Mr. Waters said today.
Under the state Financially Distressed Municipalities Act of 1987, a city's elected officials apply to the Department of Community Affairs for designation as a distressed municipality. If a city meets the criteria, the state agency steps in with technical assistance and aid. The state also has wide latitude to reorganize municipal goverment, raise temporary taxes and even dictate terms of labor contracts while the three-year plan is in effect.
Once in the program, cities must adopt the state plan or substitute one that the state agency accepts. If a city does not adopt an approved plan, the state can withhold subsidies.
The state would provide Scranton a $2 million interest-free loan and help it secure private financing to close the rest of the deficit. The 250-page plan also provides a $450,000 grant to help the city study ways to become more efficient. It authorizes a temporary 0.6 percent income tax on about 18,000 nonresidents who work in Scranton. Most savings, though, would come from a 40 percent reduction in health benefits for city employees and a 12 percent reduction in the work force, now at 628, over three years.
It is not yet clear how the everyday lives of Scranton residents will change, although eventually virtually every city service will be affected. It is known that the fire department would take the brunt, losing 50 of 200 firefighters, and about 10 of 140 positions in the police department would be eliminated. Most cuts would be made by attrition because many employees are expected to retire in the next 17 months.
Employees who choose to retire in that period would not be covered by labor contracts, whose terms will call for greatly reduced health benefits for retirees, according to the plan announced today.
 
Fewer Firemen
 After Mr. Waters gave a brief summary of the plan, several officials, including Mayor James P. Connors, praised the effort but said they would not comment until they had reviewed it.
Union leaders were more vocal. "People are going to lose 25 percent of their fire protection," said Terrence F. Osborne, president of the local chapter of the International Association of Firefighters.
Many community leaders support the proposal. "It is strong medicine for a very ill city in some respects, but it has to be taken," said Austin J. Burke, president of the Scranton Chamber of Commerce.
The state agency has scheduled an Aug. 5 public hearing on the plan, and by Aug. 15 will submit a final plan. Then the Mayor and City Council will have 14 days to accept the plan or submit an alternative one.

Citadel of History Rises From the Ashes (Again)

BYLINE: By FRANCES FRANK MARCUS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, July 20

 BODY:
Here in South Louisiana where floods, hurricanes, termites, Byzantine politics and subtropical rot come with the territory, a late-18th-century building is rising from ashes, again.
The Cabildo, a survivor of French and Spanish colonial days that was once City Hall and is now a state museum, sits in the heart of the French Quarter beside the St. Louis Cathedral, facing Jackson Square and the Mississippi River in one of the world's most graceful landscapes. 
 Inside, workers are putting the 193-year-old building back together, repairing the wreckage from a fire on May 11, 1988. A spark from a sheet-metal worker's torch is believed to have ignited the fire, which destroyed the third floor. Smoke and water blackened and soaked the remainder.
The fire was only the latest calamity to strike the Cabildo. Formosan termites munched at the foundation during the 1980's. Rioters attacked it in the 1870's. And a 1788 fire that leveled fourth-fifths of the city razed an earlier Cabildo.
"It's one of the most important historic buildings in the country, comparing with Independence Hall in Philadelphia," said Samuel Wilson, the city's leading preservationist architect. The building's graceful arches, shady arcade and handsome wrought iron railings conjure visions of sleepy Spanish colonial capitals -- if the viewer can block out the incongrous Frenchified mansard roof.
The museum, which has a wide-ranging (some would say jumbled) collection that includes art as well as historical objects, was closed from late 1984 to 1986 for lack of money. And even after it reopened its future was precarious. Louisiana's oil-driven economy had been in a recession for much of the decade, and state money was scarce.
"The fire as tragic as it was has turned out to be a blessing in disguise," said James F. Sefcik, a historian who is director of the state museum system. "Now we have money."
The Cabildo (Spanish for town hall) is being rebuilt with $6.5 million from insurance policies and money left from unrelated state capital projects. At the same time, four nearby museum buildings will be fireproofed.
An additional million dollars, raised privately, will finance the permanent exhibit. Without the fire, "we would never have raised a million dollars for an exhibit," said Robert Cangelosi, a former president of the Friends of the Cabildo and the architect overseeing the restoration.
The Cabildo's finest year was 1803, when France sold the Louisiana Territory to the United States for $15 million. Inside the Cabildo on Dec. 20, 1803, the signatories used a silver quill pen to scratch their names on papers that doubled the nation's size.
Over time, the Cabildo became a museum stuffed with objects, many irrelevant to Louisiana's history, like a French tank from World War I. One of the most popular exhibits was a death mask of Napoleon.
The mask, one of four made after Napoleon's death in 1821, was still in the Cabildo when the building burned. As Mr. Sefcik ran up the stairs during the fire, looking up at flames, he suddenly remembered the mask and was elated to find it unharmed.
When the museum reopens next year, exhibits will interpret Louisiana's periodically lurid history, including the unsavory parts.
Changing times complicated replacement of the the third floor and roof. The originals were of virgin cypress, but those were no longer common in the swamplands. Instead, the 42-foot long, 12-inch thick cypress beams supporting the roof had to be cut and milled in Florida and prefabricated in New Hampshire.
While the restoration is supposed to be complete early next year, Mr. Cangelosi said control of the voracious Formosan termite will be "ongoing." The termite, like the Cabildo itself, is a survivor. "Even after the fire," he said, "we found termites eating away in the ashes."

HEADLINE: Currency Intervention Stems Slide in Markets

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
World stock markets fell precipitously yesterday and the dollar flirted with its record low against the German mark before the United States and its economic allies moved forcefully to support the dollar and in the process stabilize other financial markets.
At least 13 central banks bought dollars in the foreign exchange market. The concerted intervention came at a time that the mood of investors was already very bearish about the dollar and becoming negative about stocks as well. 
 A sharp decline in stocks began on Friday, the day after the German central bank raised a key interest rate over the opposition of the United States and its European allies. The German move in one stroke seemed to sour investors' hopes for stronger economic growth and earnings this year in the United States and Europe.
 
Investors' Gains Are Threatened
 "The main driving force for any rally this year has been taken away," said Guy Rigden, global equity strategist at UBS Philips & Drew in London. "You don't have a win situation right now, and if you ask me how much farther markets can go down, I say I don't know." The yearlong rallies in some markets, like Britain and France, have now evaporated. And in Germany, the gains have been cut substantially.
The intervention did help the dollar rebound and did stop the fall of some stock markets yesterday. But it is not yet clear if this signal of economic cooperation can change the ugly mood in the equity markets.
The question remains whether the dollar can be prevented from falling to new lows while higher interest rates in Europe make the world economic outlook even more fragile. The recovery in the United States is still teetering, Japan's economy is in a slump and the British cannot seem to emerge from their recession.
What happens next will depend in some part on what Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, says today in his semiannual testimony to Congress. Investors will be assessing his statements on the economic outlook in the United States, the chance for another Fed easing of short-term interest rates and the level of his concern about the falling dollar.
But Mr. Greenspan is in a difficult position. For example, if interest rates were lowered further to keep the economic recovery going, the cut in rates would probably lead to a weaker dollar by making it less attractive to foreign investors.
Before the intervention yesterday, stock markets around the world had dropped sharply. In the United States, the Dow Jones industrial average was down more than 44 points, but it closed off 28.64 points, or 0.86 percent, at 3,303.00. In Europe, the Financial Times index of the London market plunged 2.7 percent, then came back to close down 1.2 percent. There was a similar rebound in France, where the CAC index ended down 1.9 percent after being down by 3.7 percent. In Germany, there was no rebound after the intervention, and the DAX index closed 3.1 percent lower.
Stock markets across the rest of Europe also declined sharply. In Italy, where the market was also rocked by the assassination of an anti-Mafia prosecutor, the Milan bourse index was in a free fall, dropping 5.8 percent.
In Latin America and Asia, markets also fell yesterday. The Tokyo market plunged 4 percent, and stocks fell 2.3 percent in Hong Kong, which has had the best-performing stock market of the year.
As for the dollar, it just missed establishing a record low against the German mark before the intervention by central banks induced traders to buy dollars. The dollar then rose sharply, although it is still not far from its record low. The dollar closed at 1.4735 marks, down from its high for the day of 1.4965 marks. The dollar's lowest New York close since the mark was created in 1948 was 1.4475 on Feb. 11, 1991. Yesterday, the dollar fell as low as 1.4473 marks.
In general, the dollar has been pulled down mainly by three forces. The economic recovery here has not been strong enough to attract foreign investment. Short-term interest rates in Europe are about three times higher than they are here, which makes it a losing proposition for foreigners to invest in dollars or dollar-based securities unless they expect a big rally in the dollar. And the uncertainty caused by the Presidential election campaign is worrying some investors.
 
The Final Straw
 The downturn of the markets has been brewing for weeks. Mr. Rigden of UBS dates it from Denmark's rejection on June 2 of the Maastricht Treaty outlining the next steps to achieve European unity by the end of the century. "The Danish vote blew out the smokescreen of hope that Europe was marching nicely into the future," he said.
But the final straw came on Thursday when the German central bank, the Bundesbank, raised its discount rate to 8.75 percent from 8 percent. Although bank officials tried to argue that the rise in this interest rate should not lead to higher rates in the future, investors were not believers.
Today, one Bundesbank official, in an effort to reassure investors, said that the discount rate increase should not lead to a jump in the far more important German Lombard rate, which directly affects short-term interest rates.
For investors, the Bundesbank move means that an expected decline in interest rates in Europe, which had been a reason for some stock market rallies, will probably not occur until next year. In addition, the high level of rates will mean that forecasts for economic growth and for increased corporate earnings would have to be scaled back.
Some analysts also saw a souring of the mood because it appears to investors that the United States and its allies cannot work together to get the world economy out of the doldrums, as the increase in German interest rates while the United States is cutting rates shows.
"This is the backwash from the economic summit in Munich, which was clearly a failed summit," said Neil M. Soss, the chief economist at the First Boston Corporation. He said that the inability of the United States, Japan and Germany to find a common approach to interest rates means "there is less growth out there than there was before the Munich summit so earnings have to be weaker and stocks have to be weaker.
"What kind of world economy do you have without coordinated leadership from the Group of Seven?" he added, referring to the nations, led by the United States, Germany and Japan, that met at the summit conference in early July. And he said he was not sure the coordinated intervention yesterday would send a convincing signal that the cooperation is still effective.
In the past, heavy intervention has worked for a sustained period only if it was combined with policy moves. In this case that would mean raising interest rates here and cutting them in Europe. This would narrow the enormous interest rate differential that is an important factor in undermining the dollar.
If the intervention yesterday and future intervention can keep the dollar from plummeting, it could ease a lot of the pressure in Europe. When the dollar rises against the German mark, that tends to weaken the mark against other European currencies. Because European currencies are linked to each other in the European Monetary System, the weakening of European currencies against the German mark is one factor that is forcing interest rates to stay high.

HEADLINE: U.S. Sales of Arms to the Third World Declined by 22% Last Year

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 20

 BODY:
Arms sales to the third world fell sharply last year as the United States, the Soviet Union, France and China all cut back sales, the Congressional Research Service reported today.
Total sales fell 40 percent, to $24.7 billion, the lowest level in at least seven years, from $41.1 billion in 1990, the research agency said. 
 The United States, which surpassed the Soviet Union as the biggest supplier in 1990, accounted for 57 percent of all sales in 1991, the report said. United States sales to Saudi Arabia alone exceeded the total value of Soviet weapons sales to the third world last year, the report said.
Saudi Arabia, the biggest United States customer, spent $5.6 billion, accounting for nearly 40 percent of total United States sales to the third world last year.
 
Sharp Drop in Soviet Sales
 Soviet arms sales to the third world fell 55 percent last year, to $5 billion, from $11.2 billion in 1990. Moscow was still the second-biggest supplier, but the value of its arms-sales agreements last year was far below the peak of $24.8 billion in 1986.
The report, delivered to Congress today, is based on data supplied by the Defense Department and United States intelligence agencies.
Richard F. Grimmett, a defense specialist who prepares the report each year, cited various reasons for the reduction in arms sales: the end of the cold war, the erosion of the Soviet Union, which was dissolved in December, and the enforcement of an arms embargo against Iraq, which had been one of the biggest buyers.
 
A Shift in the Market
 In addition, Mr. Grimmett noted, organizations like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank were encouraging third world countries to curtail military spending as a condition of getting economic aid.
French arms sales to the third world plunged 87 percent last year, to $400 million, from $3.1 billion in 1990. Chinese sales fell 86 percent, to $300 million, from $2.1 billion.
A major reason for the decline in Chinese sales is that the Soviet Union replaced China as the main supplier of weapons to Iran. Moscow sold no arms to Teheran in 1984-87, but since then has sold $4.8 billion worth of weapons, including warplanes, tanks and submarines, the research service said.
At the same time, the Soviet Union lost some of its biggest customers. Iraq had been making multibillion-dollar arms deals with the Soviets every year, but can no longer do so because of the embargo imposed by the United Nations in August 1990.
Moscow has eliminated the big subsidies offered to its friends in the past, Mr. Grimmett said. As a result, Cuba, Vietnam, Syria and India are buying much less. Indeed, the report says Cuba, which bought $11.9 billion worth of weapons in 1984-87, concluded no purchase agreements with Moscow in the following four years.
United States arms sales to the third world had risen to a record $18.2 billion in 1990, partly because of large contracts signed with Saudi Arabia after Iraq invaded Kuwait. Sales fell 22 percent last year, to $14.2 billion.
From 1988 through 1991, the United States accounted for half of all arms sales to the Middle East: $36.5 billion out of a total of $73 billion. Those sales accounted for three-fourths of the value of all weapons the United States sold to the third world in that period.
With cuts in the Pentagon budget resulting from the end of the cold war, Mr. Grimmett said, arms manufacturers are trying to increase sales to foreign countries to compensate for "lost domestic orders." But, he noted, Britain, France and other countries are trimming their military forces, so their arms makers also want to sell more overseas.
"More and more arms suppliers are likely to be pursuing a smaller and smaller list of buyers with the ability to pay," Mr. Grimmett said. "In the next few years, economic factors may be more significant than any arms control regime in restraining the international arms trade."

HEADLINE: BankAmerica Posts $240 Million Net

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, July 20

 BODY:
The BankAmerica Corporation said today that it earned $240 million, or 63 cents a share, for the second quarter, in what analysts and bank executives called an impressive show of strength after its acquisition of the Security Pacific Corporation last year.
BankAmerica agreed to acquire its California rival last August in a $4 billion deal. The combination of the two largest banks in the West created the nation's second-largest banking company, after Citicorp. Because this was the first quarter in which the resulting company reported combined results, financial performance cannot be directly compared with previous quarters. 
 The bank said that earnings would have been higher except for $181 million in nonrecurring expenses primarily related to the merger. These expenses included restructuring expenses and income tax adjustments but were offset somewhat by a net gain related to the sale of the payroll processing business of its main subsidiary, the Bank of America.
BankAmerica also said it had unusually high legal expenses relating to lawsuits in the quarter. Excluding these expenses, the corporation's operations profits for the quarter were $421 million, or $1.19 a share. Wall Street analysts' estimates for operating earnings had ranged from about 85 cents to $1 a share.
The stock market reacted positively, and BankAmerica closed up $2.875, to $44.375, on the New York Stock Exchange on a day when stocks were generally lower. The stock was the second-most-active issue on the Big Board, with more than 2.4 million shares changing hands.
"This is just a starting point, but it was a terrific quarter," said Ronald L. Mandle, a financial analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein in New York. "The first rung of the ladder was higher than we thought it would be."
Analysts and company officials said that the savings associated with the merger would first be seen later this year. The company has said its goal was to cut $1.2 billion in costs because of savings from eliminating employees and branch offices.
"We're feeling pretty good about getting off to a strong start with this merger," said Frank N. Newman, BankAmerica's chief financial officer. In the short term, the company has no plans for further significant acquisitions, he added.
The bank is facing a difficult economic climate in California and a particularly difficult situation in commercial real estate in Southern California, Mr. Newman said. But because it has diversified significantly beyond the state, he said, the company is insulated from some of the impact of the recession.
Financial analysts also saw good news in the company's loan loss reserves, which were lower than expected.
The bank said it had $4.56 billion of loans that were not earning interest, with the bulk in the construction, development and commercial and industrial categories. The bank said it was also disposing of $4.4 billion in loans, primarily from Security Pacific.
BankAmerica has said it would form a unit, called a "collecting bank," to handle some of its problem United States assets acquired from Security Pacific. The company said the stock would be distributed to holders of BankAmerica or sold.
Earnings for the first six months of 1992 were $543 million, or $1.74 a share. In 1991, BankAmerica's second-quarter earnings totaled $272 million, or $1.16 a share. Earnings for the first six months of 1991 were $554 million, or $2.41 a share.
Noninterest income for the second quarter of 1992 was $1 billion, which included a nonrecurring gain of $157 million related to the sale of Bank of America's payroll processing business. Total noninterest expense was $1.98 billion in the second quarter, including a one-time charge of $395 million for the estimated expenses related to restructuring after the acquisition.
The company also said it had received regulatory approval in mid-July for its acquisition of H. F. Holdings Inc., and its subsidiary HonFed Bank, which is the third-largest financial institution in Hawaii.

Marine Midland Profit
 HONG KONG, July 20 (By Bloomberg Business News) -- The Marine Midland Banks reported a second-quarter profit of $41 million, compared with a loss of $37 million in the comparable 1991 quarter.
The Buffalo-based bank, a unit of HSBC Holdings of Hong Kong, had losses of $295.6 million for all of 1990 and $189.9 million for 1991.
In the first half of the year, Marine Midland had profits of $43.6 million, compared with a loss of $109.3 million in 1991's first half.
The 1992 quarter included a extraordinary gain of $11.7 million; the holding company did not give the details of the gain.
Marine Midland, which has $16.5 billion in assets, benefited from non-recurring recoveries from its loan portfolio and sales of foreclosed real estate, said John R.H. Bond, the president and chief executive.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Basic Assumption Is Being Doubted

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
AS share prices tumbled around the world yesterday, there were many explanations offered, ranging from a Mafia bombing in Italy to political polls in the United States. But at the heart of the slide may be a growing fear that economic growth -- and the profits that it brings for stock owners -- is no longer to be taken for granted in the world.
In the United States, most economists think the recession that began in 1990 ended either in the spring of 1991 or early this year. But just as growth in the two years preceding the recession was substandard, the recovery has been weak. 
 In Europe, Germany's decision on Thursday to raise interest rates yet again, a further reaction to mistakes made when East and West Germany were unified on highly inflationary terms, seems likely to prolong the British recession and weaken other economies. And Japan's economy has been stumbling as stock prices have lost more than half their value since the end of 1989.
These events have challenged the comfortable assumptions that economies are sure to rebound from recessions, even if the timing is uncertain, and that share prices should be bid up in the assurance that business will soon improve.
Yesterday's slide in stock prices, which began in Tokyo and then spread as different world markets opened for trading, was halted at least temporarily after the New York markets opened and central banks intervened to support the dollar as it was nearing a record low against the German mark.
Perhaps more important than the actual results of the intervention was the fact that the major governments were capable of concerted action. At the economic summit meeting earlier this month, there was talk about agreeing on a long-delayed trade accord, but little action on anything.
"A lot of the economic problems confronting the U.S. are global in nature," said Edward Yardeni, the chief economist of C. J. Lawrence. "But rather than seeing a global coordinated response, instead we have policy discord." He noted the Germans had raised interest rates despite American pressure to lower them, and he said he would have been more impressed with the dollar-support operation if it had been accompanied by a statement from the Group of Seven leading industrial nations that the dollar had fallen far enough.
In any case, the dollar rebounded after the central banks' interventions, and the Dow Jones industrial average, which fell more than 44 points in early trading, stabilized and then recovered somewhat. It ended down 28.64 points, at 3,303.00. Some European markets also recovered part of their losses after the interventions.
There were, of course, lots of reasons offered for lower stock prices. Italy, whose market fell more than others in Europe, was reacting in part to the assassination of an anti-Mafia judge, and some analysts in the United States pointed to concerns by money managers, most of whom are Republicans, about Bill Clinton's lead in the polls.
But the widespread declines tended to reduce the importance of individual country issues and to provide a reminder that the engines of economic growth are not running on all cylinders anywhere. "Germany is raising interest rates for its own reasons, but that is one more reason that economies are sputtering in Europe," said Byron R. Wien, the chief United States equity strategist for Morgan Stanley.
The Bush Administration's effort to promote economic growth has focused almost entirely on lower interest rates, to the exclusion of fiscal policy, and until yesterday, the official attitude toward the dollar's fall could at best be viewed as benign neglect. The combination of a deadlock with Congress and huge budget deficits has blocked meaningful fiscal action.
The weak markets around the world mean that Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, will be watched even more closely when he testifies today in a Congressional hearing. He may well be quizzed about the competing priorities of stimulating the economy and protecting the dollar from a free fall. Lower interest rates have hurt the dollar, especially with rates in Europe and Japan generally higher than in this country.
Worldwide growth can reinforce itself, just as a worldwide slowdown can. The United States has tried to stimulate exports to aid growth, but this drive has stumbled, in part because of weakness in the economies of many trading partners. Similarly, the drop in American imports has helped to depress other economies.
Fears of a new recession have grown, and to many economists the rebound in corporate profits that began in the first quarter may already be fading. Disappointing profit reports from such companies as I.B.M. and Coca-Cola, as well as numerous smaller companies, have bothered many investors.
Robert Barbera, the chief economist at Lehman Brothers and one of the more optimistic of the Wall Street seers, said he saw "straws in the wind" of a pickup in economic activity this month, and he noted that many companies were reporting improved second-quarter earnings.
But, he added, the reports are generally "about profit gains at the expense of wage earners," who have been denied raises or even laid off. "You can't have that in perpetuity and make it a recovery," he said. "For profits to continue their positive rebound, there must be enough growth to go around."

HEADLINE: In Albany's Card Game, Long Island Is Trump

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 20

 BODY:
When Ralph J. Marino, the State Senate Majority leader from Nassau County, stalked out of the Capitol in a huff recently, he held up the passage of more than a dozen bills dear to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and to New York City.
But in the partisan world of Albany politics, Mr. Cuomo and the Democratic leadership in the Assembly, had their own political card to play: a pair of fiscal aid bills for Nassau and Suffolk counties. 
 In the end everyone won, something.
Over the weekend, Mr. Cuomo gained his pet economic-development project, an $800 million bond act intended to create jobs around the state; Long Island avoided huge budget cuts and property tax increases, and New York City got an extension of its right to negotiate its bond sales and an extension of a program that shifts economic development incentives from below 96th Street in Manhattan to the other boroughs.
However, the city didn't get everything it wanted when agreement could not be reached on Medicaid.
The legislative results make clear the importance of Long Island in Albany and speaks to the growing independence of Assembly Speaker Saul Weprin.
On July 3, in the last moments of the legislative session, deals between the Governor, Mr. Marino and Mr. Weprin seemed near on all those measures. But everything suddenly unraveled when an indignant Mr. Weprin refused to give Mr. Marino his Long Island package. And then the Long Island bills, of middling importance in the scheme of things, became the linchpin for every other piece of unresolved legislation.
Without the Long Island bills, Mr. Marino shouted at Mr. Weprin over the telephone early that morning, none of the other bills had a chance. Unless he got most of what he wanted, Mr. Cuomo threatened later, there would be nothing for Long Island.
A cooled-down Mr. Marino was prevailed upon to return to Albany last week to continue discussions, and the Suffolk piece came together without much trouble. Then, after hours of talks between Mr. Marino, Mr. Weprin, Nassau County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta and the Governor, a deal for Nassau was struck, allowing the county to borrow up to $65 million in six-year bonds and to double its mortgage-recording tax to 2 percent, also for six years.
With Nassau cleared up, like an overheated car being removed from a road it had blocked, everything else could move again, too. Those measures included an $800 million bond act to create jobs around the state; a plan to broaden the powers of the New York State Thruway Authority, and the half-dozen bills for New York City that would usually have passed with little trouble.
But virtually the entire weekend was devoted to the fight over Nassau, an extraordinary battle of wills in which Mr. Gulotta -- speaking for the Long Island Republicans and for Mr. Marino -- drove a hard bargain, often leaving the conference room to whisper to aides or to telephone Joseph N. Mondello, the powerful Nassau County Republican leader.
 
Standing Up to Cuomo
 He met a formidable opponent in Mr. Weprin, who refused to make many concessions on a deal he said was politically motivated and would too easily benefit Mr. Marino and Mr. Gulotta. Fighting over relatively minor points -- like whether Nassau County should be allowed to borrow $71 million, or $65 million -- Mr. Weprin asked how far the extra $6 million would go toward freezing taxes in a budget of $1.8 billion in which the projected deficit was more than $150 million.
Mr. Weprin, new to the Speaker's job after Mel Miller's conviction on Federal fraud charges last December and known for being friendly and accommodating, emerged as a tough leader who could stand up not only to Mr. Marino, but also to Mr. Cuomo. At one point, according to people in the room, the Governor yelled at Mr. Weprin to give in, saying that the Speaker was holding up his legislative agenda. But Mr. Weprin retorted that since his house had already passed the Governor's bills, if anyone was blocking anything, it was the Long Island Republicans. And the deal they finally reached was tougher on Nassau than Mr. Cuomo had originally suggested.
The Long Island deal made neither Mr. Weprin nor Mr. Marino particularly happy. But it was a compromise that allowed both parties to save face: Mr. Weprin because he had put new restrictions on the package, and Mr. Marino because there was a package at all.
The one person it benefited the most was Mr. Cuomo, who returned to Albany from his home-run speech at the Democratic National Convention last week to yet another success. With the notable exception of several environmental bills and a bill that would gradually transfer the counties' Medicaid costs to the state, Mr. Cuomo achieved nearly everything he wanted, particularly his bond act. If it is approved by the voters in November, its supporters say, it could mean tens of thousands of new jobs and an untold amount of new business around the state.
For Long Island, the deal enables Nassau and Suffolk counties to borrow money and raise some taxes in order to close their budget gaps and begin to put their finances in order. And it provides political benefits to the Republicans who run those counties and who desperately need to be able to keep property taxes down.
For New York City, it means getting the bonding authority and the extension of other programs, including one of economic incentives to businesses in distressed areas.
The agreement on those bills was a relief to the city. But another bill it wanted, under which the state would gradually take over localities' Medicaid costs, died last week, a worrisome development because the city already accounted for the extra money in its four-year financial plan.

HEADLINE: Brighton Beach Development Gains Backing

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
A much-disputed plan to replace the historic Brighton Beach Baths with a large housing development cleared a major hurdle yesterday when it won the endorsement of the New York City Planning Commission.
However, approval of the Brooklyn project, known as Brighton-by-the-Sea, came only after the developer agreed to several changes, including scaling down the project and adding subsidized housing and more open space. 
 The project's developer, Alexander Muss & Sons, had twice before scaled down its plans after failing to win the city's approval. But opponents said yesterday that they would continue to fight the project, which cannot go forward without the backing of the City Council. The opponents said the development was still too large and did not provide enough affordable housing or adequate access to the beach from public areas.
Michael Clendenin, a spokesman for the Council's leadership, said yesterday that Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone had not taken a position on the issue.
Marcia Reiss, policy director for the Parks Council, an advocacy group, said the project was "a giant step backward" in the planning and design of New York City's waterfront because it would limit public access to the beach and hinder enjoyment of it, while giving the developer tremendous economic benefits.
Mayor David N. Dinkins -- who exercises considerable control over the Planning Commission by appointing 7 of its 13 members -- has the power to veto the proposal but has expressed his support for the revised project.
 
Changes in Zoning
 Shelley Friedman, a lawyer for Alexander Muss, said the developer was "obviously pleased with the commission decision," and added that if the panel had rejected the plan the developer would have abandoned the project.
In a 10-to-2 vote, the commission agreed to change the zoning of the project site to a high-rise residential area from its current status as a commercial zone; allow the developer to build on space that had been designated for city streets; and grant a permit to build a 1,701-car parking garage and to waive set-back requirements for high-rise buildings.
The project, which was initially proposed as a five-tower, 1,600-unit complex, has been scaled back to four towers with 1,500 units.

HEADLINE: Has Delaware's Insurance Chief Gone Too Far?

BYLINE: By PETER KERR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WILMINGTON, Del.

 BODY:
At a time when states are feeling increasingly poor, David N. Levinson might seem a white knight, having brought more than $100 million in investments into the state from companies operating outside its borders.
For seven years Mr. Levinson, the state's elected insurance commissioner, has put pressure on the insurance companies he regulates to invest in a list of local businesses drawn up by his office. What's wrong with hitting up these Goliaths for what amounts to small change, Mr. Levinson argues, to help a tiny state create desperately needed jobs? 
 But what Mr. Levinson sees as economic development, a growing number of lawmakers here see as a conflict of interest that falls somewhere between the blatantly bizarre and the oddly corrupt. They say Mr. Levinson is the latest example of just how far the state regulation of insurance can go awry.
 
Critics in Legislature
 A rising chorus of critics in the State Legislature say Mr. Levinson strong-armed insurance companies to invest in the companies he favors -- including those whose executives contributed to his campaigns. And he has forced contributions, they say, to one of his favorite and strangest causes: the betterment of Latvian-Delaware relations.
State Representative David H. Ennis, the Republican chairman of the House Banking and Insurance Committee, said he had received several complaints from insurance companies although none were willing to state publicly their objections for fear of retaliation. But the national trade group in Washington representing life insurers said it was troubled by the economic development program in Delaware. "We believe there is an inherent conflict of interest on the part of someone who on the one hand regulates the solvency of insurers and on the other hand is involved in promoting investments in the state," said Henri Bersoux, a spokesman for the American Council of Life Insurers.
Perhaps what frustrates his critics most is that Mr. Levinson seems unruffled by the accusations. He sees himself as "the toughest commissioner in America" and does not think fair-minded people would think he is acting in conflict. As he contemplates an independent run for governor, Mr. Levinson argues that he has become the victim of a powerful industry that punishes insurance commissioners who slip off its leash.
"I brought jobs to Delaware and refused to bow down to multibillion-dollar insurance companies and the lawyer/lobbyists to whom they pay millions of dollars per year to do their dirty work," Mr. Levinson said. "The industry went berserk."
The Delaware controversy comes at a time when the nation's system of state insurance regulation is under fire from members of Congress and state auditors who say that slipshod performance by insurance departments resulted in major insurance failures. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners has been aggressively developing new and higher regulatory standards for departments across the country.
One powerful Democratic Representative, John D. Dingell of Michigan, recently introduced legislation calling for Federal regulation of the industry in part because quality varies greatly from state to state. While states like New York and California are known for their vigorous enforcement, regulators in many states have long been criticized for being too cozy with the industry and its lobbyists. The image of the state-run system of insurance regulation was tarnished further by the conviction in the last two years of commissioners in Louisiana and Wyoming for corruption.
In Delaware, the state's House of Representatives this year investigated Mr. Levinson's program to promote economic development. Last month the House voted to prevent the commissioner from regulating companies that he has approached for investments or had personal financial dealings with. It also voted to turn over the records of its investigations to Federal and state law enforcement officials. The move failed in the State Senate, which instead voted to have the State Ethics Commission investigate, which now must render a decision.
Until now, Mr. Levinson had generally won praise for hiring a team of financial experts, computerizing a department with fewer than 100 employees and modernizing its operations since he was first elected in 1984.
The commissioner, whose father was a small-town mayor and well- known veterinarian in the state, was educated at Harvard, and made millions in the real estate business in the Midwest. He returned to Delaware in the early 1980's to enter public life. Tall and slender with an easy charm, Mr. Levinson has both dazzled and enraged politicians here who described him, varyingly, as brilliant and arrogant.
"The commissioner has done an exceptionally good job of running his office," said Edward J. Bennett, a Democratic State Representative. "But he has taken personal loans, trips, introductions across the oceans and still has not recused himself from decisions on the companies that gave them those things."
Mr. Levinson says he sees no reason why he should.
The House committee investigation found that in June 1989, a Delaware-based insurance concern, the American Centennial Insurance Company, made a loan of $3.6 million to a Missouri real estate partnership in which Mr. Levinson had a 40 percent stake. A company affiliated with American Centennial, Wesco, purchased land from another partnership in which Mr. Levinson had been a member.
What troubled the committee most, said W. Minor Carter, its counsel, was that just two years earlier the commissioner had approved the spinoff of American Centennial from the Beneficial Corporation. The deal required the parent company to commit an additional $200 million to American Centennial's loss reserves.
Legislators question whether a quid pro quo might have been at work. "There are significant facts missing," Mr. Carter said. Further investigation, he said, would show "either a clear violation of law, both Federal and state, or simply incredibly poor judgment."
 
Levinson's Side
 Mr. Levinson said he became involved in the deal to develop 162 acres before he was elected commissioner and that it was conducted at arm's length by a partner, Leonard Saxon, and was structured to permit Mr. Levinson to be bought out on the day the loan was signed.
Asked whether the transaction could give an appearance of impropriety, Mr. Levinson said he did not think so at the time and said that as a lifelong real-estate developer it was necessary that from time to time some of his investments would involve insurance companies.
"I didn't deal with the company at all," Mr. Levinson said. "There was no quid pro quo."
Another aspect of the controversy involves Mr. Levinson's program of "economic development" for the state. Mr. Levinson said he was highly troubled when he took office that most companies domiciled in Delaware and requiring Delaware regulation kept their headquarters and jobs elsewhere. He said he presented companies with the choice of moving their home office to other states, bringing their headquarters to Delaware -- and proposed a bill that would do the same -- or of making contributions to Delaware companies that would create local jobs. The program, he said, has resulted in more than $100 million in investments.
But critics, including Representative Ennis, say that insurance companies have complained that Mr. Levinson threatened to withhold or slow regulatory decisions if companies did not contribute.
 
'Off the Wall'
 "Companies in Delaware have said to me that he has approached them, businesses that he regulates, and asked them for loans for personal business enterprises that he has been involved in," Mr. Ennis said. "When they refused he has become angry. He has gone off the wall."
In one case, Mr. Carter said, the department pressed insurers to invest in a project proposed by Swearingen Aircraft of San Antonio to build an aircraft manufacturing plant in the state if it could raise $35 million. Among the $20 million pledged, Mr. Levinson said, the largest amount was from American Reinsurance, which lent $12 million. The aircraft project has since stalled, he says, and so far no jobs have been created.
Mr. Levinson said he never used threats, but "would hope" to receive contributions from executives of state companies that benefited from state programs. Such contributions, he said, were commonplace for elected officials in Delaware and other states.
National Reinsurance, a company that underwent a leveraged buyout under Mr. Levinson's regulation in 1990, contributed $50,000 to Forward Central Delaware, a nonprofit business development group, and $30,000 to establish a Latvian trade mission office in Delaware. The Latvian mission so far has created no jobs for Delaware citizens. Mr. Levinson persuaded the Government of Latvia to place its trade mission in Delaware after making trips last year to Latvia, Russia and other former republics of the Soviet Union where he helped establish a Western insurance code. Mr. Levinson's grandfather emigrated from Latvia.
 
Money for Trips
 Forward Central Delaware has contributed to one of the trips. American Reinsurance paid for another. American Re's parent company, the the Aetna Life and Casualty Corporation, signed an agreement with Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company last month for a $1.2 billion leveraged buyout of the Delaware-based reinsurer, the largest leveraged buyout ever involving an insurance company.
The general Counsel for American Reinsurance said that it had agreed to pay for the trip only after it was approved by the State Ethics Commission.
Mr. Levinson said he often accepted payment for trips from insurance companies when he made major speeches or carried on other state business. It saves the state money, he said. Helping revive the Latvian insurance industry, he said, is state business since the Federal Government does not have the skills to assist the former Soviet Union on insurance matters.
It may have been more than coincidence, he said, that the attacks began just as he was discussing organizing a third political party for an independent run for governor.
"I am the one who kept the pressure on," Mr. Levinson said. "It didn't make me popular. But prophets never are."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Prices Narrowly Mixed

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities went through considerable gyrations yesterday, driven by developments on world equity and currency markets. But by the end of the day, prices were narrowly mixed.
The sharp drop in stock prices on major foreign stock exchanges, and the expectation that shares would be hammered once trading shifted to the United States, sparked a run into short-term Treasury notes and bills during trading in Asian and European financial markets. 
 But that move ended abruptly after the Federal Reserve and at least a dozen other central banks surprised currency traders by intervening to defend the dollar.
"When the Fed and the other central banks intervened, that seemed to fuel a belief that if the authorities were intervening in the foreign exchange market then the Fed would not be willing to cut rates any further," said William M. Brachfeld, an executive vice president at Daiwa Securities America Inc.
As Mr. Brachfeld suggested, the move to support the dollar put upward pressure on short-term interest rates, and had an impact on bids for new three-month and six-month Treasury bills auctioned yesterday.
 
3-Month Bills: 3.16%
 At the auction, three-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 3.16 percent, down from an average rate of 3.22 percent at last week's auction. Before the Fed's support of the dollar, the three-month bills were trading on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 3.10 percent.
Bids on the new six-month bills produced an average discount rate of 3.24 percent, compared with an average rate of 3.31 percent a week ago.
While the Fed's action to support the dollar seemed to suggest the central bank would not risk another cut in short-term rates, analysts said that at this point shoring up the currency was not the Fed's primary consideration.
"The fundamentals on the dollar are still bearish for as long as the United States economy looks weak and Germany is fighting an inflation and monetary growth problem," Brian J. Fabbri, chief economist at Midland Montagu Economics, said.
"But the economy, not the dollar, will dictate whether or not the Fed eases policy again."
The Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, may be questioned about the implications of yesterday's activity in the foreign exchange markets today when he testifies before Congress on the economy and monetary policy.
The last two times he delivered the so-called Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, Mr. Greenspan surprised the markets with generally upbeat views on the recovery.
Few analysts are expecting a similar assessment this time.
"Greenspan's Humphrey-Hawkins hearing should prove friendly to the market as he highlights a positive inflation outlook and sluggish money supply," Peter McTeague, a fixed-income analyst at Technical Data in Boston, said in his daily market commentary.
 
Long-Bond Yield Off
 Anticipation of the testimony, as well as a drop in the Commodity Research Bureau's index of spot commodity prices to a six-year low, helped buoy bond prices somewhat.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 29 1/2-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 103 30/32, up 7/32, to yield 7.65 percent, compared with 7.68 percent late Friday.
Among outstanding Treasury note issues, the 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 104 10/32, up 1/32, to yield 6.88 percent. The 6 3/8 percent five-year notes were offered at 102 15/32, unchanged on the day, to yield 5.79 percent. And the 5 percent two-year notes were offered at 101 3/8, down 1/32, to yield 4.25 percent.
 
Commonwealth Edison Offering
 In the corporate bond market, new-issue activity was highlighted by a $500 million four-part offering of securities by Commonwealth Edison through underwriters led by Merrill Lynch & Company.
A total of $300 million worth of one-year, three-year and five-year debentures were sold with yields from 4.23 percent for one-year securities to 6.611 percent on debentures maturing in 1997.
The remaining $200 million were offered as 30-year first-mortgage bonds maturing July 15, 2022.
The 8.50 percent bonds were priced at $99.329 to yield 8.562 percent, 90 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 percent bonds of 2021 at the time of pricing.
The debentures are rated Baa by Moody's Investors Service and BBB+ by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Moody's has awarded an A-3 rating to the first mortgage bonds. Those securities are rated A- by Standard & Poor's.
Activity was sluggish in the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds, traders said.
Prices of most widely quoted securities rose by about 1/8 point.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: Rupert Murdoch, In Hollywood, Learns The Value of 'No'

BYLINE: By BERNARD WEINRAUB, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD, July 20

 BODY:
Rupert Murdoch slouched on the sofa of his surprisingly spare office at the Fox Studios near Century City, saying with a faint smile that his voyage into the movie business still left him just a bit uneasy.
"This is a very creative, ambitious community," said the 61-year-old media mogul, speaking in his lazy Australian drawl. "Everybody's got their own agenda, their own schemes, their own projects. You've got to pass on 90 percent of them. Making films involves saying 'no' a great part of the day. What worries me are the commercial judgments in Hollywood. Not here, in this studio, but among some of our competitors." 
 It has been more than five months since Barry Diller abruptly stepped down as chairman of Fox Inc., whose parent company, the News Corporation, a media conglomerate spread across four continents, is owned by Mr. Murdoch. The apparently amicable departure of Mr. Diller, who wants to establish or buy his own network, led Mr. Murdoch to take over direct, hands-on control of Fox Inc. and to plunge into the movie and, especially, the television business.
Seated beneath an Australian Impressionist painting and sipping a diet soda, Mr. Murdoch was by turns reticent and enthusiastic about his involvement with Hollywood, the anxieties of the movie business, his hopes for Fox Television and his fascination with Los Angeles after living in New York. Mr. Murdoch was, for a while, the owner of both New York magazine and The New York Post, among other publications.
 
Fun and Heartbreak
 "I loved New York, but then I was running a newspaper," he said. "For all its inadequacies, and the things we didn't do, the resources we didn't have, we still had a real influence on that city. To be involved, hands on, in the issues of the streets and the city every day -- it was a lot of fun. Absolutely! And it was a heartbreaker. Mission impossible. Afterward I was lost and kind of depressed."
Mr. Murdoch, one of the most powerful, if private and detached, millionaires in Hollywood, has been an American citizen since 1985 and a resident of Los Angeles for more than a year. He and his wife, Anna, a novelist, have four children.
The move to Los Angeles, largely the result of his purchase in 1985 of 20th Century Fox, has proved exhilarating for Mr. Murdoch, who arrives at work each morning at 6:30 to start making phone calls to his companies abroad.
"Living here reminds me a lot of living in Australia," he said. "The weather. The openness of the society. I don't mean Hollywood, but Los Angeles. This is the modern melting pot. There's not much history here, and that leads to good things and bad things. I mean, there are no rules here. That makes it very open on the one hand. On the other hand there's perhaps less taste about it."
The glitz of Hollywood both appalls and bores Mr. Murdoch, who is rarely seen at Hollywood premieres and parties. "I'm not into that," he said. "It's a crazy business. I enjoy the risk factor. I enjoy exercising one's taste and judgment."
 
All Business
 By all accounts, Mr. Murdoch has left the movie business largely in the hands of Joe Roth, the chairman of the studio, except for decisions where major risks and major expenses are involved. Mr. Roth, who chafed under Mr. Diller's episodic but powerful control, says that he feels quite liberated under Mr. Murdoch and that conversations with his boss have focused almost entirely on the business side of movies. The two men are about to start renegotiating Mr. Roth's contract.
"Rupert has not dealt on the editorial side," Mr. Roth said in an interview. "He has not said, 'I don't want to make a movie because it's politically or morally reprehensible.' He has not told me I could not make a project. We have accounting conversations. We talk about margins and operating profits."
Mr. Murdoch's company also owns TV Guide in the United States, Sky Broadcasting in Britain and an array of newspapers and magazines around the world.
Mr. Murdoch says that he has never quite encountered anything as surrealistic as the economic and, for that matter, the creative side of the film business. Such big-budget bonanzas as "Hook," made by Sony's Tri-Star Pictures, in which the stars and the director, Steven Spielberg, walked off with millions of dollars despite the film's less than smash performance, bewilder him, he says.
"The impulse is for you, the studio, to take all the risk, and if you clear something at the end of the day, good luck to you, and if you don't, forget it, let's go on to the next thing," said Mr. Murdoch. "I'm not frightened of the risk. I'm looking at the risk and the reward. There's not enough reward for the risks involved. The secret is you don't have to make expensive movies to be successful. Look at Disney and 'Sister Act.' It looks like it was made on half a sound stage. But it works."
 
Hopes for Smaller Projects
 Mr. Murdoch insists that so far he has not played a role in approving projects. "Joe Roth green-lights things," he said. "If it's a very big film we'll sit and talk about it, whether it's really wise or not." But he said he was hoping to make a growing number of "smaller," or cheaper, films in the near future. "Of course, we all say say that, everybody says that," he added with a laugh. "Let's be honest."
Mr. Murdoch said the waste of money in movie making startled him a bit. "Every day we're shocked at the risks involved, by the excesses of money, by what you pay people, by what what you waste," he said. "But anything that's creative, I suppose, has got to have some waste. You produce a great newspaper, you leave a lot of stories on the spike, too."
Fox has had a mixed record at the box office, dominated by one huge hit, "My Girl" (with Macaulay Culkin among others), which has grossed more than $285 million. Mr. Murdoch said he was very disappointed in the failure of "Dutch," the gangster film about Dutch Shultz, and of "For the Boys," the Bette Midler musical about a pair of U.S.O. performers. "Although it was beautifully made," he said tartly of the Midler movie, "It wasn't much of a story."
It is television, especially television news on the Fox network, that is consuming much of Mr. Murdoch's attention. "We want to get away from the old-style news, which is driven by pontificating, high-priced anchors, to news that covers all the important events but has a real pace," he said. "It's got to tell a story. A face reading a teleprompter doesn't really help news. You've got to tell it in pictures, voices, reporters, good writing. People the next day will remember a big story told brilliantly in 30 seconds more than a big story told a mediocre way in three minutes."
Mr. Murdoch rejects criticism of the Fox network's so-called "reality" shows -- re-enactments of real-life events -- which have been assailed as exploitative. Fox spawned many of these extraordinarily successful shows, including "America's Most Wanted," "Cops" and "Current Affair," and other networks have emulated them. Mr. Murdoch points to the highly successful afternoon talk shows as far more tasteless examples of exploitation.
"Look, is there anything more exploitative than the most successful show on the air, Oprah Winfrey?" he said with a laugh. "Donahue, too. He copies her. She copies him. I don't know. They get these unfortunate people -- it's like a freak show every day. Intrusive? Yes. Entertaining? Yes. It's gotten to the stage where whatever station has "Oprah" in the afternoon is the dominant station in that market."
Certainly the most embarrassing episode so far in Mr. Murdoch's tenure was his recent dismissal of Stephen Chao from the presidency of Fox News. Mr. Chao was summarily dismissed for hiring a man to strip during a speech he was giving about censorship at a Fox Inc. meeting in Aspen, Colo. Mr. Murdoch recently named Van Gordon Sauter, the former head of CBS News, as Mr. Chao's successor.
"Yes, it was a loss," said Mr. Murdoch, who spoke warmly of Mr. Chao's skills as an executive. "But there's more than one fish in the ocean."

Yoo-Hoo! Is Anybody Home? It's Mets and Yanks Calling

BYLINE: By Richard Sandomir

 BODY:
Not only are fans not watching the Mets at Shea Stadium in mass quantities, they're not watching them in droves on television.
Through Sunday, the Mets' average Nielsen rating on WWOR-TV has tumbled 27 percent, from 7.3 after 47 games last year to 5.3 now. By comparison, the Yankees' rating on WPIX-TV through 29 games has risen to a 4.8 from 4.6 last season. 
 Ratings on the stations generally reflect viewing on SportsChannel and the MSG Network, the Mets' and Yankees' cable outlets, respectively.
With few important games, the Mets' television performance has stagnated for two months -- coinciding with the team's decline -- and has not recovered since June 2, when the team reached its highest post-opening day prime-time rating of 7.9.
The Mets rose a bit on the Nielsen meter over the weekend with ratings of nearly 5.5 for victories against the San Francisco Giants.
Lower ratings mean reduced ad revenues for WWOR. Tom Ryan, WWOR's general sales manager, said:
"We're in the same recession everybody else is in. We're not that far off last year. But the third quarter is not strong."
The bulk of WWOR's commercial time on Mets' games was purchased before the season, but the station isn't getting any extra gravy from new clients signing up during the season with short-term commitments.
Mike Siegel, senior vice president of Vitt Media International, a media buyer said, "Nobody's been clamoring for the Mets or Yankees."
The Yankees' ratings on WPIX, which finished at 4.4 last year, haven't had as far to fall as those of the Mets, who wrapped up 1991 at 6.1.
The Mets have fallen hard when compared with last year, but the Yankees have stumbled badly in the last two months, experiencing a 28 percent ratings downdraft since May 22. In that period, the Mets' rating is flat.
No Yankee game has rated above 5.0 in a month. Sunday afternoon's game against the California Angels rated a mere 3.0, the nadir of the season.
Yet, Yankees advertising sales are up about 15 percent over last year. MSG, which sells ads for itself and WPIX, enlisted more upfront sponsorships this year.
"Advertisers feel the team has been competitive all year and they're fun to watch," said Andi Poch, MSG's director of ad sales. "It's live, fresh summer programming that advertisers find appealing."
Baseball ratings and advertising often reflect how successful or promising a team is, not necessarily whether fans love Tim McCarver's analysis on WWOR or can't figure out whether WPIX's Phil Rizzuto is on Earth or Pluto. But for those who care about the coverage, the TV announcing teams offer wide variety:
McCarver-Ralph Kiner (WWOR): They define teamwork better than the others. On top of his skillful, punnish and puckish analysis, McCarver's care and feeding of Kiner is masterly. Ralphie Boy is at his best when spinning yarns and McCarver is ever eager to lead Kiner into temptation. Theirs is the best example of bantering that doesn't require a play-by-play man to right them. Kiner's malaprops are legendary, but part of the texture of his work; they are easily forgiven because they're funny and Kiner is engaged in the games.
Tony Kubek-DeWayne Staats (MSG): The most straightforward duo. Kubek is McCarver's equal as an analyst, but looks pained to show a lighter side when Al Trautwig tries to prod him into humor. Kubek and Staats are the "Dragnet" team, giving just the facts. Kubek fits more analysis into 60 seconds than most of his colleagues offer in 60 minutes; his tendency to be harsh on players shows an admirable independence.
Kiner-Fran Healy-Rusty Staub (SportsChannel): Serviceable but bland. Staub and Healy are not distinguished analysts by any measure, and Staub stumbles over his thoughts too often, even in taped segments. Healy and Staub are close friends and know baseball, but their voices and insights are not clarion calls to listen. Neither elicits what McCarver does from Kiner, who seems less interested in the games on SportsChannel.
Rizzuto-Tom Seaver-Bobby Murcer (WPIX): PHIL'S WORLD! PARTY TIME! EXCELLENT! A frat party at each game, overseen by chief chaperone Rizzuto. Phil's fans suggest you have to let Rizzuto be Rizzuto. Maybe. But if Rizzuto were less engaged, he'd spend all nine innings on the George Washington Bridge. "Are you listening to me, Seaver?" he keeps asking. Vintage Rizzuto used to listen to his partners better, which sparked the broadcasts. Listening to Seaver and Murcer sans Rizzuto is becoming a marginally more rewarding experience if you want to know what's happening in the game.
On the radio side, WFAN's Bob Murphy and Gary Cohen are a sparkling duo on the Mets, who improve year-to-year. Murphy's word images and Cohen's straightforward, playful style make for lovely listening.
On WABC's Yankees broadcasts, all one can say is, "Poor Michael Kay." He will never learn anything positive from partner John Sterling, whose shilling for George Steinbrenner and digressions from the game are poor examples for the rookie announcer. Kay has a weak radio voice and is too absolute in his judgments.

HEADLINE: ON BASEBALL;
A Candidate Proposes Radical Sacrifice Play

BYLINE: By Murray Chass

 BODY:
Bob Watson's plan is so bold it sounds like a Presidential candidate's program to erase the national debt.
Watson, the Houston Astros' assistant general manager, has seen baseball decline in popularity among minority groups, especially inner-city children, and believes some radical program has to be implemented to reverse the trend. 
 "If we don't do something to save our game, we won't know it in 8, 10, 12 years," Watson said. "The talent pool will continue to shrink. You go to the ball park now, both in the majors and the minors, you hear scouts talk about where are the players going to come from. If we don't do something about reviving baseball in our country, the game will not be as we know it today. That might seem farfetched, but to save this game, the players, baseball and corporate America are going to have to make some sacrifices."
The Watson plan calls for the creation of baseball academies in every major league city. About 20 clubs currently have academies in Latin American countries. Watson envisions the academies as places where children generally could be turned into productive citizens and specifically could be developed as future players.
"And if they don't turn into players, they could be fans," said Watson, who was a major league player for a decade and a half. "Our minority fan base is way down. Some of it is economics, but also baseball hasn't done the best job of promoting itself. Basketball and football have done a fantastic job of promoting themselves. Baseball is losing good athletes and fans."
Under the Watson plan, funding for the academies would come from players, major league baseball and corporations. Players, he proposes, would give 10 percent of the total value of their contracts to the project, and those sums would be matched by both major league baseball and participating corporations.
"I have some ideas that I think I could sell the owners and corporate America, and I know I have some ideas I could sell the players," Watson said. "The players would be tougher because I would take some of their money, but they'd get a tax credit and they'd get credit for the academy."
Using Cal Ripken Jr. as an example, Watson said that if Ripken were to sign for, say, $30 million with Baltimore, he would put $3 million into the inner-city program in Baltimore. "Yes," Watson said, "he's giving up $3 million, but how much is enough? No way you could tell me Cal Ripken ever thought he was going to get $30 million. They're giving up money they wouldn't have had five years ago, and they still have a lot. Ripken gets a tax writeoff and his name goes on the building and is etched in baseball history."
He wouldn't be on poverty row, Watson added, and corporate Amercia and baseball would match his contribution and "you have $9 million."
Watson, who has worked diligently and intelligently in his effort to become a high-ranking baseball executive, is prepared to talk about this idea and others when he is interviewed next month for the job as National League president. Bill White is leaving at the end of his term next March 31, and Watson is an announced candidate.
He is in that position because when he was a batting instructor in the Athletics' organization, Sandy Alderson, the Oakland general manager, gave him opportunities coaches seldom have and because John McMullen of the Astros is a color-blind owner.
Among Watson's ideas are two that would be an improvement over the policies of the incumbent: easier accesibility and tougher discipline. White, who was a very public person in his 18 years as a Yankee broadcaster, has been an invisible executive, making himself inaccessible to the type of people with whom he once had contact.
White has explained that talking with members of the news media was not part of his job description, but even some of his supporters among the owners feel he has carried that policy to an extreme, refusing to be a spokesman for the league. Watson said he would have no problem dealing with the news media or any other part of the public.
Because he was a player himself, White has been viewed as soft on players in disciplinary matters. Watson said his status as a former player would not influence his disciplinary decisions.
"Our whole fine system is in the dinosaur age," Watson said. "It doesn't make sense to have fines of $250 or $500 and guys are averaging $1 million a year. If we had a new system in place, where you could take a day's pay, approximately $6,000 on $1 million, that would get a guy's attention. A $250 fine is tip money to these guys. They have it in their money clip."
Watson, who knows that any effort to change the disciplinary system would incite a fight with the union, said he also would propose a different way to handle bench-clearing brawls triggered by a batter's charging the mound. He would call for an automatic suspension without pay for players who join the fight.
"It should be a deterrent," he said. "I won't be easy on players, but by the same token, I wouldn't be easy on umpires. I think umpires should be fined and disciplined the same as players. I'm a realist. I understand there are things that won't change, but I'm a doer and I'll try to get some things done."
If Watson is so good at getting things done that he gets players to give up 10 percent of their contracts, maybe he should run for President of the country instead of the National League.

HEADLINE: Creeping Democracy in Mexico

 BODY:
Until very recently, all Mexican elections conformed to a predictable pattern. The Government always declared that its candidate had scored a resounding victory; opposition parties always protested that they had been victimized by outright fraud.
That pattern put Mexico out of step with the rest of the Western Hemisphere, where honest, democratic elections have increasingly become the rule. Credit is now due to President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, himself the beneficiary of a tainted election four years ago, for rewriting the old, rigged rules. 
 Mexican elections remain far from pristine, but the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, has now learned how to acknowledge defeat. That's welcome news, not only for Mexico but also for the U.S., as the two countries move toward close economic integration.
On Sunday the state of Chihuahua became the second in the country to certify an election victory by the National Action Party, or PAN. Baja California Norte was the first, three years ago. The business-oriented PAN, which shares the Government's outlook on basic economic issues, has now achieved at least a grudging legitimacy within what was a one-party system.
But the more radical Democratic Revolutionary Party, or P.R.D., continues to face official resistance. The P.R.D. was ruled to have lost last week's race for Governor of Michoacan, its main state stronghold. The voting was marred by abuses, but these were probably not enough to have decided the outcome. The popularity of the P.R.D. has been waning, largely as a result of successful Government economic policies. Still, a transparent process would have made the outcome more credible.
Mexico's moves toward an open political system still lag behind its efforts toward a more open economy. Few expect a truly democratic presidential contest in 1994. And PAN needs to fight for its electoral gains. But the Chihuahua results represent real progress, unthinkable even four years ago. Americans can welcome these signs of creeping democracy, even as they recognize that true pluralism is not yet at hand.

HEADLINE: A Mideast Boost for Mr. Bush

 BODY:
In a fallow political season for the Bush Administration, unexpected succor beckons from the Holy Land. Secretary of State James Baker is back on the Mideast shuttle trying to restart the stalled Arab-Israeli peace talks. Israel's new Prime Minister, Yitzhak Rabin, is in Cairo today for the first such meeting in six years with President Hosni Mubarak. All this underscores a promising shift in Israeli diplomacy, from the blame game to let's make a deal.
The new outlook is evident in Sunday's decision by Mr. Rabin's Cabinet to halt new settlements in the West Bank and Gaza pending review of all construction approved by the previous, hard-line Government. This moves Israel closer to the freeze demanded by Arabs and sought by President Bush as the precondition for $10 billion in U.S. loan guarantees for resettling Russian immigrants. 
 It is true that Mr. Rabin has yet to distinguish precisely between "political" settlements, which he opposes, and "security" settlements, which he favors, presumably in East Jerusalem, the Jordan Valley and the Golan Heights. But his Labor-led coalition asserts that these exceptions entail nothing like the 16,500 housing units feverishly begun under former Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
Secretary Baker was right to praise Labor's path-breaking concession, and right to call for matching gestures from the Arabs. One possible deal has long been on the table. Mr. Baker a year ago urged Arabs to end an injurious and spiteful economic boycott of Israel in return for a freeze on new settlements. The idea won the support of Egypt and, more surprisingly, Saudi Arabia. But the deal was dismissed out of hand by Mr. Shamir, on grounds that the embargo was illegal while settlements, in his view, were not.
What Mr. Rabin has done is to move the dispute from legalism and ideology to a pragmatic concern for peace and security. In his inaugural address the Prime Minister movingly appealed to Israelis to overcome "the sense of isolation that has held us in its thrall," to join the global movement toward peace and to do everything possible to fit into a new world. This is a welcome change from sullen defensiveness.
It is a change, moreover, that augurs well for the Bush Administration's patient brokering of peace talks, which began in Madrid, continued inconclusively in Washington and will resume in Rome. Mr. Baker now has a chance to capitalize on a warmer atmosphere, and to persuade Israel's adversaries to abandon all-or-nothing for give-and-take. The familiar dangers abound -- zealotry, self-delusion and terrorism -- yet amazingly, this caravan is still moving.
Meantime, Americans will hope that Secretary Baker can make a good case to Congress for approving loan guarantees, so that Israel may get on with providing homes and work for its newest settlers. That's a bounce the Bush Administration will have earned and deserves.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
So Long, Suckers

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
Ross Perot still has two important things he can do in American political life. One is to shut up and the other is to get out.
That is not meant simply as a piece of unpleasantness, although that is certainly one intent. It is an alert to him, to his friends and family and to all who once put their hopes in him. 
 Mr. Perot now suggests to those he betrayed that if they want him, why, he may lead or guide their political movement even though he has quit as Presidential contender.
Just suggesting that adds serious injury to serious insult. He can be neither leader nor guide. The reason is that former Lieutenant Perot is otherwise occupied, facing a moral court-martial by his countrymen on these charges:
1. AWOL in the face of political combat. Self-explanatory.
2. Abandonment of his troops. Self-explanatory.
3. Falsification of intelligence.
Less than 24 hours before he withdrew he was still encouraging top aides, getting them ready for battle. If some mysterious something came up that knocked him out, he should have revealed it. If he quit because he decided he did not have the stomach or the background for political combat or the Presidency he should have said that too.
If he decided he did not want to spend the time or money, although he had promised he would spend as much of both as needed, he should have said that.
Instead he announced the discovery that the election might go to the House of Representatives, this Texas Christopher Columbus. That phony spiel embarrassed his close confidants even as he spoke. If they keep on apologizing for him they jeopardize their reputations. Handy reference: "Othello," Act III, scene iii, 155.
4. Violation of the code. Ross Perot failed to follow the code of taking personal responsibility for error, taught at Annapolis.
If he had spoken honestly, either of a sudden disqualifying circumstance if there was one, or of his lack of strength to carry on, he would have been a failed politician, but perhaps a respected one. He chose instead to prove his enemies were right when they said he could not even surrender like a gentleman or officer.
5. Contributing to a moral and political disorder: cynicism. Quitting as he did, he made millions more Americans suspicious of their country, its leaders and the business world.
The leaders did their own contributing. President Bush gave up fishing time to throw an embarrassing line at Mr. Perot. Governor Clinton said he was deeply moved by the Perot statement. To nausea, I trust.
Myself, I had thought Mr. Perot was worth listening to. He was shaking up both political parties. And he was the hope of many Americans longing for the kind of change that would reaffirm American economic, moral and democratic worth.
And he was worth listening to -- then. But no, not now that he has quit cold on American voters, raised anchor and semaphored the motto on his escutcheon: So long, suckers.
The day before he deserted them, Mr. Perot was urging on the experts who had worked out his domestic and foreign policies. He was supposed to disclose them this week.
But aside from any secret that may exist, he was losing total control of his world, which he so craves. He was obviously too weak to live without total domination.
He had had to answer the press about his life and businesses. Now he would have to try to grasp and justify policies that could never be his own. They did not come from his own brain, background or experience.
It must have been like one of those nightmares where you find yourself in costume before an opera audience. The lights dim, baton is raised. And you know neither the words nor music. I could almost feel sorry for the man, if only he had said, "I don't belong here -- I can't sing."
But he won't walk off the stage, even now. So if he does try to lead or guide a movement created by his followers out of their own hopes he will injure them further. He will create even more cynicism about the system that made him a billionaire and Presidential contender.
Happily for the Republic, Americans do not court-martial political contenders. In return for this grace, former Lieutenant Perot should not add to the list of charges by continuing to impersonate a leader.

HEADLINE: Model Cities Work, but Enterprise Zones Won't

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In an editorial 26 years ago, give or take a few months, you proclaimed the Model Cities program (then called Demonstration Cities) dead. You predicted that the program -- concentrating billions of dollars in demonstration grants to cities -- was doomed to defeat in Congress and destined to fail as too cautious a response to urban problems. 
 You were wrong then. Model Cities, far from expiring or being insufficient, became law and continued to survive under different names in hostile or indifferent administrations down to the Reagan Administration. Today it is acknowledged, not only for its capacity to stimulate physical and social renewal in neighborhoods but, more significant, for encouraging grass-roots political participation. Many inner-city residents moved from their first venture in Model Cities politics to elected and appointed leadership positions in our cities.
So, 26 years later, in "The Muddled Model Cities Model" (editorial, July 3), you are wrong again. With no attention to the now well-documented record of how the program began and how it expanded, you fall back on the dubious 1970 figures of neoconservatives who asserted that a "few" cities grew to 75 and then to 150.
Let me testify, as chairman of the task force under President Johnson that recommended Model Cities, that the original proposal was for 82 cities and that the subsequent expansion came over two years of planning grants. Even at 150 awards (for large, medium-sized and small cities), more than one-third of Congress never had, in your terms, "a slice of the pork." The program remained selective, a first example of the politics of innovation, instead of the politics of distribution. Set down insufficient resources to the Vietnam War.
Finally, comparison with enterprise zones is misleading. The Model Cities program, as Browning, Marshall and Tabb show in "Protest Alone Is Not Enough," an award-winning 1989 book, built a record of accomplishment in stimulating renewal and empowering citizens across the country.
In contrast, 37 states have tried enterprise zones with disappointing results, as reported by the General Accounting Office in 1988. Model Cities was the product of empirical, verifiable evidence produced by social science research; enterprise zones spring from the loosely woven tapestry of ideology, where aspirations lose touch with reality. Whatever the appropriations, they won't solve the fundamental problems of jobs, education and security that beset our cities now.

HEADLINE: U.S. Social Ills Become Medical Problems

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Many Americans favor a Canadian-style, single-payer health care system. The real question is how a Government-run system based on the Canadian model would work in a country that has social problems that countries like Canada and Germany don't share to the same extent. 
 Health care systems are best evaluated by cost, access and quality related to outcomes, not by life expectancy and infant mortality. These last indicators more properly measure a country's health status and are influenced by its demographic and socioeconomic makeup. For example, our high poverty rate surely lowers our overall life expectancy and raises our infant mortality rate.
In addition to the greater influence of poverty on our health status, more Americans engage in high-risk behaviors than people in other developed countries. Such conduct leads to more drug-abuse-related illnesses; more AIDS; more pelvic inflammatory disease; more teen-age, out-of-wedlock pregnancies, resulting in more premature and sick babies; more homicides and assault injuries, and more accidents, especially among the young. All these conditions require intensive and expensive treatment.
These behaviors, linked with such social pathologies as the breakdown of the family structure, chronic unemployment, homelessness, violence and despair, cause Americans to end up in overwhelming numbers in the emergency rooms, intensive-care units and morgues of our hospitals. The United States is paying dearly for its social and behavioral problems once they became medical problems.
The United States must commit itself to resolving its social problems before they become medical problems while addressing its vast health care needs. The challenge is to extend American health care, research and technology, often the best in the world, to all of our population, which includes the poor, at an acceptable cost.

HEADLINE: Fired Up With a Love of the Feared Reading Tests;
Koslin's Specialized Exam Wields a Powerful Influence on Millions of Students

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

DATELINE: BREWSTER, N.Y.

 BODY:
One thing that qualifies Dr. Bertram L. Koslin to design the reading tests dreaded by many of one million New York City students and their teachers is that he likes to read -- almost anything.
The mound of papers scattered across his desk takes the rough shape of a volcano, with dozens of articles about politics, science and history, and a few unpaid bills, spilling down the sides like lava. He is making his way through a book about winemaking. And at bedtime, he picks up one of the Seven Deadly Sins mysteries by Lawrence Sanders. "I'm up to the Fourth Deadly Sin," he says. 
 Dr. Koslin is, in short, not a faceless and bloodless academician but a man of varied and idioscyncratic tastes whose life has its unruly moments.
Still, he makes his living trying to place children into micrometer-precise categories of reading ability. He even believes that literature can be finely calibrated so that someone who scores 59 on his test can comfortably tackle "To Kill a Mockingbird" while someone who scores 69 will not be intimidated by "Jane Eyre."
His test, known as the Degrees of Reading Power, wields a powerful influence on not only New York City's students, but three million others in Connecticut, Virginia and New York, three states where the test is given statewide, and 1,000 school districts elsewhere.
It has become an annual rite of passage. Students first take the test in second grade and may continue to encounter it through 10th grade. Along the way it is used to determine which students must repeat a grade, which are placed in classes for gifted or slow learners, and which can qualify for Federal remedial-education money.
More informally, the tests are used to evaluate teachers, principals, even Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez and Mayor David N. Dinkins. Just last month, Mr. Fernandez and City Hall traded blame for a citywide decline in reading.
Over the years, critics have wondered whether the test is as reliable as it claims, whether it is used for purposes for which it was never intended, like comparisons of school performance, and whether scores can be massaged. Many worry that teachers spend too much time preparing students for the test.
These questions have periodically drawn attention to Dr. Koslin and the testing company he heads, Touchstone Applied Science Associates, in a two-story steel and tinted glass building in the dense woods of this northern Westchester County town.
Dr. Koslin, 62 years old, is a stout native of the Bronx with a cheery, avuncular disposition and some very fixed and sometimes cranky opinions.
Philosophically, he is a supreme rationalist who believes education can be systemized with objectives and tasks -- and tests that measure how those objectives are met. Politically, he describes himself as a New Deal Democrat comfortable with Rockefeller Republicanism.
For recreation, he concocts such French dishes as duck and olives, sometimes tossing in vegetables from his garden. One reason he likes meeting educators in New York City is the chance it affords to savor an authentic corned beef sandwich.
Until recently, Touchstone was virtually a mom-and-pop business, run with his wife, Sandra. But the Koslins divorced recently, though his wife remains at the business. And in June, with $2.5 million a year in sales, Touchstone went public, opening on the Nasdaq exchange for $5 a share. Dr. Koslin, the company's president, is paid $110,000 a year, and he owns 24 percent of the business.
 
'Helpful to Parents'
 Robin Willner, the Board of Education's director of strategic planning, said Dr. Koslin's test, which the city has used since 1986, was chosen over others because it evaluated only reading comprehension and not discrete skills like word recognition and usage that have a more arguable bearing on reading comprehension.
"It's helpful to parents in terms of understanding what does this score correspond to," Ms. Willner added."Does this score correspond to whether my children can read 'Goodnight Moon,' or 'Nancy Drew'? "
But Deborah Meier, a Manhattan principal, said students who could comprehend even intricate prose might not be deft at filling in the answer spaces under time pressure.
Dr. Koslin said his test was distinctive because it did not depend on students' background knowledge. The information needed for every question about a reading passage is contained within the passage itself. Therefore, he argues, the test cannot be faulted as culturally biased.
To write the passages that are the hallmark of his test is part fine art, part science, Dr. Koslin maintains. His writers follow an explicit manual. First, broad subject areas like bridge construction are chosen based on topics with the longest entries in the Encyclopedia Britannica. Then the writers bore in on narrower subtopics -- the engineering of the Brooklyn Bridge, for example -- scouring nonfiction books and magazines like National Geographic for material.
They write passages of roughly 300 words each, with seven words left blank, and invent five options for each blank, though only one makes sense in the context.
"It's a linguistic puzzle to do it," Dr. Koslin said, sympathizing with his writers. "It's unforgiving out there if you make one lousy mistake."
Critics claim the prose that emerges from Dr. Koslin's process is about as tasty as packaged white bread, lacking in pungency and whimsy. But Dr. Koslin defends it.
"It's good scientific writing," he says. "It has a voice in it, the voice of exposition."
He also maintains that the difficulty of the prose can be quantified according to half-century-old linguistic principles that take into account the length and rarity of the words.
Any single test is assembled from the more than 800 passages that are kept inside 300 Manila envelopes stacked on slender Lucite shelves in a locked office. Most tests use questions that appeared on earlier tests because, like fresh bread vs. day-old bread, new questions cost more.
Dr. Koslin, who grew up on the Grand Concourse, often watched his father, an abdominal surgeon, perform operations with what he calls "Matisse-like strokes." He attended public schools and recalls that when a teacher smacked his left hand with a ruler in an effort to force him to write with his right hand, he grabbed the ruler and smacked her back. He was sent to the principal.
"School in large measure was one standing quiz and I remember nothing else," he said. "They were constant demonstrations of whether you learned something or not. But if you couldn't, it was not a God-awful disaster. Somebody helped you over the hump."
Dr. Koslin was very good at tests, but he spurned the elite Bronx High School of Science, where his brother had gone, for DeWitt Clinton High School because Bronx Science required that students take a course in mechanical drawing. "That's engineering, that's not science," he said, "and I didn't want to do engineering."
 
Diverse Interests
 As a biochemistry major at Johns Hopkins University, he felt at a disadvantage with prep school graduates more learned in the classics. So he spent much of college filling those gaps, cultivating a lifelong affection for poets ranging from John Donne to Wallace Stevens.
"Intellectually, I range over a lot of fields," he said. "I think the wide range of backgrounds put me in good stead to listen to what it is people wanted by way of a new reading test."
He entered New York University Medical School, but quit after a year, deciding that doctors must be alert to abnormalities while he was more intrigued by "commonalities" among people. This outlook, he acknowledged, may explain his enthusiasm for grouping large numbers of children by reading levels.
During three years of travel abroad, he was fascinated by cultural differences in behavior, and he enrolled in the doctoral program in social psychology at the University of Oklahoma.
After teaching at Bard and Princeton in the late 1960's, he got to know Dr. James E. Allen, at the time New York State's Education Commissioner, who also believed education could be systemized. Dr. Allen asked him to devise a new reading test.
Dr. Koslin concedes deficiencies with his test, but argues that all tests suffer from these flaws and, practically, little can be done.
For economy's sake, students who take the Degrees of Reading Power test are not measured against a true national sample but against a contrived assemblage of 25,000 New York State students whose ethnic, religious and income characteristics mirror a national cross-section.
A student who scores at the fifth-grade level is reading at the average level achieved by fifth graders in the contrived national sample, which is not the same as reading at a level educators may regard as appropriate for fifth grade.
Given his fascination with measurement, it is surprising that Dr. Koslin cannot pinpoint his own reading level. He said he took an I.Q. test in graduate school and scored 140 -- a genius level.
"What does that mean?" he asks self-effacingly. "You can't eat it and you can't drink it."

HEADLINE: A Whole New Political Ball Game?

BYLINE: By Alan Brinkley; Alan Brinkley is professor of history at Columbia.

 BODY:
On Thursday, as I was walking into a meeting in midtown Manhattan, I stopped to talk with two volunteers collecting signatures to put Ross Perot on the New York State ballot. They gave me an amateurish, crudely printed brochure and seemed puzzled and disappointed when I declined to sign their petition.
"Don't you understand that Ross is our only hope?" one said. Two hours later, when I came back out to the sidewalk, Mr. Perot's candidacy had vanished. And so had his volunteers. Where they are going is a question in which both major parties have a large stake. The collapse of the Perot movement, even more than its emergence, has the potential to create a genuine political realignment -- a redefinition of party loyalties that could transform the fortunes of the Democrats and Republicans, not just in 1992 but beyond. 
 Some Perot supporters will drift back to the parties they left, as many would have done anyway. But what of the true believers -- the people to whom "Ross" was "our only hope," the people to whom mainstream politics has become anathema?
Mr. Perot and some of his followers talk wistfully of keeping the "movement" alive, using it to press the major parties to respond to their demands. But such efforts will certainly fail. It was Mr. Perot himself who gave the movement whatever unity it had. His supporters have no concrete program to thrust upon the major parties. All they had was a candidate, and he has now deserted them.
And yet while Mr. Perot clearly meant very different things to different people, he did come to symbolize two large concerns that most of his followers apparently embraced. Evidence that other candidates share those concerns is what Perot's supporter will be looking for as they consider the appeals Bill Clinton and George Bush are beginning to make to them.
One was the illusion Mr. Perot created that the "people" -- the volunteers who put him on the ballot -- were the real decision-makers in his campaign and would be in his administration. It is clear now that Mr. Perot really listens to only one person, himself, as his abrupt withdrawal from the race made clear. But one reason his withdrawal shocked his followers was that he had persuaded them to believe otherwise.
Mr. Perot managed to revive the belief that an active, engaged citizenry can seize control of the political system and make it work. He convinced previously disaffected voters that it was possible to make government into a direct expression of popular will. He restored to politics something of the joy of participation that has been largely missing from national campaigns for generations.
If the allegiances of his supporters depend on their finding a similar sense of engagement and empowerment in one of the major parties, they almost certainly will be disappointed. National politics doesn't work that way anymore, if it ever did. And neither party is likely to be able to create even the illusion, let alone the reality, of genuine popular participation in its national deliberations.
But Mr. Perot's popularity was also a sign of another feature of contemporary politics: the impatience among much of the middle class with the way both major parties seem to have defined the role of government.
The Democrats have suffered for years from the popular (and in many respects false) impression that they are committed to using government to transfer wealth and power from the middle class to minorities and the poor. But the Republicans, having succeeded perhaps too well in exploiting the Democrats' weaknesses, are suffering from an equally damaging (and also not entirely accurate) popular impression: that they will not use government at all.
The result is a major political vacuum in the center that Mr. Perot moved to fill. He avoided both the redistributive image of the Democrats and the anti-statist image of the Republicans and promised instead to make politics work better to serve the interests of the middle class.
He allowed his followers to imagine an active, effective government that would revive the economy and provide them with the services they have come to expect and demand. Unlike the illusion of direct democracy, this is a vision that the major parties can appropriate as they scramble to pick up the pieces of the Perot movement.
The Bush campaign, which believes the core of Mr. Perot's support consisted of disaffected Republicans, expects many of those people to support the President almost reflexively. But the history of earlier third party and independent movements does little to support their optimism.
The Anti-Masons of the 1830's, Know-Nothings of the 1850's, Populists of the 1890's and followers of George Wallace in the 1960's all profited, briefly, like the Perot movement, from a gulf between the ideological positions of the major parties and the sentiments of much of the public.
None of those movements prevailed, but all served as vehicles by which people severed existing party affiliations and created new ones. The Wallace movement in 1968, for example, attracted large numbers of traditional Democrats; when George Wallace left the scene, many, perhaps most, of his supporters began voting Republican.
There is no guarantee Mr. Perot's Republican supporters will switch to the Democrats in 1992 (although early polls suggest many are leaning in that direction for the moment). But the rise and fall of the Perot movement has helped create the conditions for the kind of party realignment that transformed politics in the 1850's, 1890's, 1930's and 1960's.
The Clinton campaign is already working skillfully to push that realignment along. It is not trying to persuade these frustrated middle class voters that government does not and cannot work, as the Republicans of the 1980's did; nor is it arguing that government's principal task is to help the dispossessed, as many Democrats did in the 1960's and 1970's. It is trying to persuade them that government can be made to work for them.
The challenge facing the Republicans as they try to win back Perot voters -- a formidable challenge given the anti-statist posture of the party for 12 years -- is to do the same.

HEADLINE: U.S. Trade Pact a Spur To Canada

SERIES: A New North America -- Second of three articles.

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO, July 21

 BODY:
New economic studies indicate that Canada has become more competitive as a result of its trade agreement with the United States and, some analysts believe, is about to outpace all major industrial nations in economic growth. Yet Prime Minister Brian Mulroney faces a herculean task over the next six months in getting the House of Commons to ratify an expansion of the treaty to include Mexico.
The Prime Minister's Government is expected reach agreement on the treaty with Mexico and the United States in coming weeks. 
 Despite the signs of increased strength -- manufacturing output rose four tenths of 1 percent in 1991, for example -- Canada is still suffering, along with much of the rest of the world, from the persistent effects of recession. And the current trade agreement between the United States and Canada, which came into force Jan. 1, 1989, is getting much of the blame; Canadians are upset about recent plant closings, continued joblessness and the flight of some businesses to the United States.
From a three-way arrangement, Canada is looking not only to preserve trade gains with the United States but to increase its access to Mexico's thriving market.
Canada's trade with Mexico is still modest -- $3 billion a year of two-way business, or only 1.5 percent of exchanges with the United States. Mexico enjoys a huge surplus -- $2 billion last year, chiefly reflecting shipment to Canada of Mexican-assembled cars of the Big Three. Canada last year, for example, imported 41,000 Cavaliers. Canadians also bought nearly $100 million of Mexico's fruits and vegetables.
"People are really very angry," Joan Fawcett, a Liberal Party member of the Ontario Provincial Parliament, said. "They feel these closings are a direct result of free trade -- and that the Canadian Government sold them a bill of goods."
Polls show ardent criticism of the 1989 agreement. The latest survey of the Angus Reid Group has found that 64 percent of Canadians oppose the proposed North American treaty -- and 66 percent are still against the initial agreement with the United States.
Only 6 percent believe that Canada has won any benefits at all in the accord with Washington, which by 1999 virtually eliminates all trade barriers between the two nations.
The provincial governments of Ontario and British Columbia have gone so far as to demand that Canada walk away from the negotiating table.
Many Canadians think that President Bush wants a new free trade deal to boost himself politically. Ontario's Trade Minister, Ed Philip, sounded a popular note here when he commented the other day: "Helping to get George Bush elected by signing on to a dubious free trade deal is not part of Canada's economic agenda."
Still, no one expects Mr. Mulroney to pull out of the talks, and in the end most analysts think the Canadian Parliament will go along with the agreement -- that its great economic dependence on the United States leaves it no other choice.
In fact, neither the United States nor Mexico was initially keen on Canada's participation, fearing Ottawa would only complicate already fiendishly difficult negotiations. But Canada insisted on joining because of its "vital interests," a term Ottawa used repeatedly.
Canada, Mexico and the United States are now trying to create what eventually would become a single market for North America's 370 million people. The agreement is expected to be initialed within a few weeks and come up for ratification later in the legislative bodies of all three countries.
Despite the naysayers, many Canadian economists insist that treaty has had strongly positive effects. New studies are showing that free trade has quietly helped manufacturers reverse a long-term decline in productivity, made Canadian enterprises more global and given Canada a supranational judicial process providing a measure of protection against arbitrary American trade decisions.
A University of Toronto analysis has found that freer trade has stimulated growth, lowered the rate of inflation and lessened the severity of the recession. The researchers found that Canada's output of goods and services last year was four-tenths of a percent higher than it would have been without the free trade agreement; unemployment was down one-tenth of a percent and inflation was seven-tenths of a percent lower. The International Monetary Fund and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development have both recently predicted that Canada, energized by free trade, is about to become the fastest growing of the major industrial countries.
"Things are looking up," said Allan R. Taylor, chairman of the Royal Bank of Canada, the nation's biggest bank, adding, "It is ludicrous to argue, as many are doing, that Canada would somehow have been more protected in the current recession without the free trade agreement."
Trade liberalization, combined with anti-inflation policies, deficit control and industrial deregulation have put Canada in the position, according to Mr. Taylor, where "our costs and prices are finally under control," adding that "they are now running below those of the United States."
 
The Results
U.S. Companies Expand in Canada
 In contrast to the highly publicized plant closings, many large companies are quietly expanding in Canada to serve the North American market. American multinationals in Canada, it is estimated, have created at least as many jobs as they have terminated.
Figures from the Government's Statistics Canada agency show a net loss of 403,000 manufacturing jobs and a net gain of 185,000 service jobs since Jan. 1, 1989. But Doug Drew, manager of the statistical agency's Labor Force Survey, said it was not clear how much of the changes reflect freer trade and how much Canada's recession.
The stakes for Canada in an expanded trade zone are unusually high because trade with the United States is so closely linked to its own prosperity. More than 75 percent of its exports went to the United States last year, while almost 70 percent of its imports came from the United States. Exports to the United States, a market 10 times larger than Canada's, account for 20 percent of Canada's gross domestic product. No other country -- not even Germany's trading partners in Europe -- are so economically dependent on a neighbor.
Together the United States and Canada do $200 billion of trade with each other, representing the largest commercial relationship in the world. The opening up of new markets in Mexico should help diversify Canada's trade and reduce dependence on the United States.
Procter & Gamble, with 94,000 employees worldwide, says it has capitalized on freer trade to create 200 additional jobs in Canada in the production of specialty soaps and hygienic products for North American distribution. At Pointe Claire, outside Montreal, it has a new pump-soap production line. At Belleville, in southern Ontario, it has just started another operation for the Always panty liner.
"We've been able to take the opportunities created by the free trade agreement for moving product and raw materials across the border more cheaply," said Margaret Bawden, manager of public affairs for Procter & Gamble's Canadian subsidiary. "We find some operations in Canada now more cost effective."
Others taking advantage of lower tariffs to expand are Dow Chemical, Cargill Foods, Du Pont, Rubbermaid, GTE Sylvania, Hughes Aircraft and Kodak.
Freer trade has also accelerated industrial reorganization, as companies seek to operate more efficiently and cut their production costs. The readjustment has been painful in some instances. Jobs indeed have been lost, though in some cases the cause may be an isolated downturn in business, not the lower trade barriers.
Cooper Industries, for example, recently closed a plant near Coburg in southern Ontario that employed 200 people who made hand-held steel files for removing and smoothing metal or wood. Brock McCloskey, a vice president of employee relations, said the operation was consolidated in Cullman, Ala., where the company already had a larger file-making plant.
He said the move had "nothing to do with free trade," adding, "We had excess capacity in both plants and consolidated into one to best utilize manufacturing capacity."
 
The Rivalry
Canadians Remain Suspicious of U.S.
 If free trade has become the agreement the Canadian people love to hate, part of that feeling stems from the belief among not only the people but also Government officials that the United States continues to use its economic power to keep Canada down in a number of critical sectors, including autos, lumber, steel, beer and apparel. Or, at least, to exact as many advantages as it can before 1999.
Even Mr. Mulroney, who usually strikes a friendly pose toward the United States, has been hotly critical, using terms like "unacceptable" and "counterproductive" and accusing Americans of "sideswiping Canada." And, illustrating the degree of resentment are the widely quoted remarks of Simon Reisman, the man Mr. Mulroney appointed to lead the Canadian free-trade negotiating team in the late 1980's. "The Americans are bastards," he told an interviewer earlier this year. "They're behaving like real thugs these days in protecting their interests."
In recent weeks the United States has threatened to hit Canadian exports of steel and beer.
American steelmakers have accused the Canadians of "dumping" steel, or selling it in the United States at below cost, a violation of United States law. If the American industry can prove its case, higher tariffs would be forced on Canadian steel.
But the Canadians say any such action would make a mockery of free trade. They say that because of the recession and the high degree of integration of the North American steel market, they cannot help but sell below cost in the United States.
The American complaint "amounts to taking advantage of people on the downside of an economic cycle," laments Roger Phillips, president if Ipsco Inc., a $500 million a year company that makes tubular steel in Regina, Saskatchewan, and Calgary, Alberta.
Backed by Ottawa, the Canadian companies have opened negotiations with their American counterparts on a potential peace formula -- a pact that would reflect the integrated nature of the steel market and prohibit antidumping measures if imports are either priced to meet the competition or do not have a substantial market share.
In beer, the United States has accused Canada of lacking good faith in removing trade barriers against American beer and has threatened to retaliate to recover $80 million of lost business. Washington has cited what it calls discriminatory practices by Ontario and Quebec. Particular anger has been voiced against an Ontario tax of 10 cents on all cans of beer sold in the province. Most of the American beer is sold in cans.
And Canada's apparel industry says it is fighting for its life in the Mexico-Canada-United States talks because of American demands for restrictive North American content rules. To placate the powerful American textile industry, Washington is insisting that clothing be cut and sewn in North America from fabric and yarn made on this continent before it can be traded duty-free among the three countries.
Yet virtually all the fabric in the Canadian dress and sportswear industry is imported from outside North America. "We search the world for great sources of supply, and we sell the niches; we're masters of nichemanship," says Jack Kivenko, vice president of Jack Spratt Manufacturing Inc. a jeans and workwear producer in Montreal and president of the Canadian Apparel Manufacturers Institute, a trade group.
If the American demand is accepted, he said, "it will mean that Canadian manufacturers will have to close down and locate manufacturing outside of Canada." The Canadian apparel industry employs about 125,000 people, 60 percent of whom work in the province of Quebec.
 
The Politics
Trade Issue Could Dominate
 If the treaty does come up for ratification next year, the timing could not be worse for Mr. Mulroney, who may find free trade dominating the general elections. Although he has come up a little in the polls, a negative popular attitude toward the treaty is not what he needs. Only a few months ago his was the least popular administration since poll-taking started a half-century ago.
The Mulroney Government must call elections at least by the fall of 1993, and many expect the call next spring. But that is just when the North American agreement would be headed for final ratification by Congress and the two Parliaments.
Even if the Canadian Government tries to ignore the matter or play it down, the treaty's opponents do not plan to let that happen.
Lloyd Axworthy, a Liberal Member of Parliament from Winnipeg, Manitoba, and a leader of the opposition to free trade in 1988, said, "We will be much better prepared this time."
The Conservatives then won 169 of the 295 seats in the House of Commons, but they did so with less than half the votes cast -- 43 percent out of 13.1 million. Under Canada's plurality system, a candidate need poll only one vote more than the runner-up to win a seat, no matter how many votes the other candidates amass. The fact that the Liberal and New Democrat parties, both of which oppose free trade, were able to pick up 53 percent combined is cited by free-trade opponents as a justification for continuing their struggle.
Maude Barlow, an adviser on women's issues during the early 1980's Liberal leadership of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, heads the Ottawa-based Council of Canadians, the chief lobby against free trade. She said her group would begin a campaign this fall to abrogate the 1989 pact "with brochures, buttons, cross-country tours, town hall meetings, the works" and is "forming alliances with like-minded organizations in the United States and Mexico, to bring our experiences to bear."
The free-trade opponents include a powerful coalition of labor and farm interests and social activists, who cite not only high joblessness (the latest unemployment rate was 11.6 percent of the labor force) but also what they see as greater American economic leverage over Canada and a resulting diminution of sovereignty.
Government officials insist that free trade is getting a bum rap.
"It's time to blow the whistle on the free- trade blame game," said Michael Wilson, Canada's International Trade Minister. "Despite the problems generated by a tough global recession, a spate of difficult disputes with the United States and a deep slide in public support for the free trade agreement in Canada, there is now clear evidence that the free trade agreement is working."
In addition to the University of Toronto, the O.E.C.D. and the International Monetary Fund studies, the Government points to a recent survey by a consulting firm, DRI Canada, that found 97 Canadian manufacturing industries gained or maintained their American market share in the last three years, while only 11 lost market share.
Also underscoring the gains from the pact, the Government statistics that show manufacturing output per person rising four-tenths of 1 percent in 1991 represent an exceptional gain for a recession year, economists say.
Every $1 billion of new Canadian exports translates into roughly 15,000 new jobs. Canada's exports rose to $103.4 billion in 1991, a 5 percent increase over 1989, according to Statistics Canada, still another sign that the pact may be working in Canada's favor.
Over the same period, Canada's trade surplus with the United States increased from $10.6 billion to $17.2 billion, which is about a third the level of Japan's.
In Mexico, Canada sees openings chiefly for exports of financial services and high-technology electronics and telecommunications. Some 200 Canadian companies showed up at a trade fair earlier this year at Monterrey, Mexico, and, according to the Canadian Trade Ministry, are filling their order books.
These companies represent the new competitive edge that Canada is getting in international trade. They have become so aggressive, said Mr. Wilson, the trade minister, that "they are not even waiting for the trade agreement."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: In the Heartland;
Candidates and Issues Stir Small-Town Frenzy

BYLINE: By DON TERRY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: VANDALIA, Ill., July 21

 BODY:
When Gov. Bill Clinton and his bus caravan across the American heartland arrived here tonight nearly two hours late, he was still cheered like a rock star by a large crowd that had been gathering for seven hours.
Spontaneous enthusiasm for Mr. Clinton appeared to have pulled many in the crowd of about 8,000 people out of their homes and kept them patiently waiting in the streets and on the lawn of the old State House on this rain-laced night. 
 But curiosity at such a huge spectacle in such a small town, the hard work of local Democratic volunteers and a five-member Clinton advance team also helped get some out for the rally.
The building of the crowd began days before the Clinton caravan was anywhere close to this town of 6,100 people, when Lisa Sims, a Clinton campaign worker from Pittsburgh moved into an inexpensive motel on the outskirts of Vandalia and went to work.
 
Seeking a Crowded Heartland
 It is Ms. Simms's job to help make sure that the Arkansas Governor and his running mate, Senator Al Gore of Tennessee, have plenty of people to wave to. It looks so much better on the evening news when the heartland is crowded.
She arrived in Vandalia, which is about 50 miles northeast of St. Louis, on Saturday and got busy. She had 1,000 fliers printed up announcing Mr. Clinton's visit and recruited 9- to 14-year-old members of a 4-H club to distribute them to the outlying towns of 200 and 400 residents, towns surrounded by soybean and corn fields and weathered farm houses. She taped Clinton posters to lamp posts on the streets of Vandalia and asked merchants to put them up in their windows next to the Abraham Lincoln souvenirs.
But Ms. Simms said she found that because Vandalia is a small town, surrounded by even smaller towns, word travels like lightning here.
"We're all excited," said Virginia Mabry, the owner of a downtown gift shop. "We're all having a ball."
Ron Kretzer, a 41-year-old school teacher, said he waited several hours to hear Mr. Clinton speak because he was a loyal Democrat. Campaign aides said the caravan was late because it made several unscheduled stops so Mr. Clinton could address crowds that had gathered along the highway.
"When do we ever get a chance to see a Presidential candidate," Mr. Kretzer said. "People want to be part of politics. Politics has to come back to the people and that's what Bill Clinton is trying to do."
Ms. Simms said Mr. Clinton's visit had been big news here for days, broadcast almost hourly on local radio stations. Television newscasts and newspaper articles have added to the flood of free publicity.
People said they had come out to see and hear Mr. Clinton for the spectacle and because they were curious about his message. Life is pleasant in Vandalia, many said, but it is slow. Marie Siebert, 37, said she had not seen so much excitement around here since someone thought they spotted Cher at the local Pizza Hut five years ago.
"This town was buzzing then," Mrs. Siebert said. "The Pizza Hut was swamped."
 
Reluctant Support for Clinton
 Throughout the day volunteers set up chairs and sold Clinton-Gore T-shirts at $10 apiece. Allen Blurton, 57, a foreman at a plastics company, stood under an awning. A Democrat, Mr. Blurton said he would reluctantly vote for Mr. Clinton.
"I think our candidate is as weak as our country," Mr. Blurton said. "He's not addressing the real needs. We're not down and out, we're the middle class. We have to do something about the underprivileged. If we ignore the poor we're all going to be dragged down."
Vandalia is the state's former capital and the white brick State House where Mr. Clinton spoke this evening is the site of some of Lincoln's first attacks on slavery when he was a young legislator.
 
Visit 'Is Good for Business'
 The Clinton visit has caused excitement across party lines.
Never mind that Lamire X. Wiss is as Republican as Abe Lincoln, whom he named his real estate business here after. Mr. Wiss said that he was happy to see the Democratic Presidential nominee come to town and that he planned to attend the rally.
"I have no intention of voting for him," Mr. Wiss said. "But Clinton's visit is bringing lots of people to Vandalia and tons of free publicity. And that, my friend, is good for business."
Business has not been good in these parts for a while. Vandalia is the seat of Fayette County and in May the unemployment rate in the county was 11.6 percent, as against 7.8 percent statewide.
 
'Things Are So Bad'
 Fayette County and Vandalia are about equally divided between Republicans and Democrats, although Republicans have only won one of the last four Presidential elections here. That was in 1980.
"If I vote for Clinton it will be for economic reasons but I won't like it," said Jeff Hurst, a Methodist minister from nearby Brownstown, Ill. "I think Clinton is going to have a lot of trouble around here because of his pro-abortion position. This is pretty conservative country."
His wife, Brenda, said she had not made up her mind about who she would support in November because she, too, was deeply troubled by Mr. Clinton's support of abortion rights.
"It seems like the Democrats have a lot of bad morals," she said, "and the Republicans are just for the rich. You try to weigh which ones are more important: the economy or morals."

HEADLINE: U.S. Was Aware the Iraqis Were Buying Technology

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 21

 BODY:
A year before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, American intelligence agencies had amassed evidence of President Saddam Hussein's vast network set up to buy Western military technology, including an Iraqi-owned front company based in Cleveland, according to documents disclosed today by Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, a Texas Democrat.
Representative Gonzalez, chairman of the House Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs, also released documents that illustrate the disarray within the Administration that resulted from President Bush's order on Oct. 2, 1989, to use political and economic incentives to moderate the Iraqi leader's behavior. 
 Among them was a declassified November 1989 State Department memo that expressed confusion about whether to approve transfers of sophisticated equipment that could be diverted to Iraq's extensive nuclear program.
"The problem is not that we lack a policy on Iraq; we have a policy," read the memo, written by an official in the Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs. This was the State Department office responsible for insuring that American-made equipment would not be diverted into nuclear weapons projects abroad. "However, the policy has proven very hard to implement when considering proposed exports of dual-use commodities to ostensibly nonnuclear end users, particularly state enterprises."
 
Export Licenses Considered
 The memo went on to recommend approval or disapproval of several export licenses. Among the items approved -- with a warning that they not be put to nuclear use -- were machine tools that could be used in the Mr. Hussein's nuclear program. High-speed photography equipment was also approved because while it was deemed suitable for conventional military uses, it was regarded as "far too slow for nuclear applications."
Throughout the Iran-Iraq war, which ended in 1988, Mr. Hussein was remarkably successful in buying weapons, primarily from the Soviet Union and France. But he also developed extraordinary complex state-run military-industrial complexes to build his own nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and ballistic missiles.
In a speech on the House floor, Representative Gonzalez asserted that the documents provided further evidence that the Bush Administration permitted Iraq to acquire sensitive Western technology for use in its domestic arms-making programs.
Before the new documents were made public today, little had been disclosed about what the Central Intelligence Agency and the nation's other intelligence agencies knew about Iraq's global strategy to obtain technology for its home-grown projects. Mr. Gonzalez today referred to several more still-classified United States intelligence reports in 1989 and 1990 that he said provided information about both the procurement networks in the West and the military complexes inside Iraq.
One of the documents Mr. Gonzalez discussed was a June 1989 intelligence report stating that the procurement network was so extensive that it included the Matrix Churchill Corporation, a Cleveland-based tool machine supplier bought in 1987 by a company owned by the Iraqi Government. Matrix Churchill was shut down and its assets seized after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.
An intelligence report dated July 1990 titled "Iraq's Growing Arsenal: Programs and Facilities" captures the deception in Iraq's procurement program, saying, "We believe many entities are false end users, passing the materials acquired from foreign suppliers directly to state enterprises involved in military projects, including chemical and biological warfare programs."
Representative Gonzalez also charged -- without offering any evidence -- that the intelligence community had extensive knowledge of the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro's global activities. This was the Italian bank whose Atlanta branch was under Federal investigation for a multibillion-dollar bank fraud revolving around the bank's loans to Iraq.

HEADLINE: 90 HAITIANS DROWN AS BOAT CAPSIZES

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, July 21

 BODY:
About 90 Haitian refugees were reported to have died at sea on Sunday when their small boat capsized and sank about 20 miles to the north of the capital, the authorities here said today.
Haitian officials said the badly overloaded boat carrying about 100 refugees failed shortly after it was launched from the town of Source Matelas. By Tuesday, 15 of the passengers' bodies had either washed ashore on nearby beaches or were recovered from the sea. 
 An official of Haiti's provisional Government charged with refugee affairs, Marlene Dorfeuille, told Haitian radio stations today that an account of the boat sinking was given by nine would-be refugees who were forced off the boat for lack of space before it left.
According to United States diplomats in Haiti, the sinking was the first known case of a boat carrying Haitians seeking to flee their country since mid-June.
 
Sanctions Hurt the Poorest
 Officials said that a policy introduced in May of immediately returning Haitians intercepted at sea had seemed to effectively discourage would-be emigrants from setting out in small, fragile craft.
Thousands of Haitians had sought to reach the United States in that way in the months after the violent overthrow of the country's President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, in September.
The United States contended throughout the crisis that the bulk of the boat people fleeing Haiti were doing so for economic reasons. In punishment for the coup against Father Aristide, the Organization of American States imposed a hemisphere-wide embargo that has had a crushing impact on the economy of Haiti, already the hemisphere's poorest country.
International advocates for the refugees have asserted since Father Aristide's overthrow that political violence and widespread repression were major factors in setting off the exodus from the country.
In the most recent wave of violence here, at least four bullet-riddled bodies turned up in the streets of the capital today. Foreign human-rights advocates say similar incidents are common in the countryside as well.

HEADLINE: Debate on Trump's West Side Proposal

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER

 BODY:
Reacting in staunch opposition to the proposal of Donald J. Trump's plan to develop 74.6 acres along the Hudson River, Community Board 7 on the Upper West Side yesterday issued a draft resolution that listed 69 reasons that the project should not go forward.
The resolution, issued last night before the first of three public hearings scheduled for consecutive evenings at Martin Luther King Jr. High School, set the stage for a noisy and contentious session, the latest round of debates over the proposal by Mr. Trump's Riverside South Planning Corporation. 
 The hearing last night was evidence of the issue's volatility; of the 600 people who showed up, more than a third stepped to the microphone to speak. In numbers, testimony tilted slightly against the proposal, but overall the debate presented a wide spectrum of concerns by New Yorkers who perceive the proposed development as either a potential threat to or a potential enhancement of their life styles.
The plan calls for the development of Penn Yards, Manhattan's largest undeveloped waterfront property, which builders and community leaders have been wrestling over for a decade. The hearings are part of the Uniform Land Use Review Procedure, the process set up in the City Charter under which proposed changes in land use are analyzed, modified and put into practice.
 
The Public Is Heard
 The proposed development, now known as Riverside South, would convert the site -- which stretches from 59th Street to 72d Street between the Hudson River and West End Avenue and Freedom Place -- into a complex of 14 apartment buildings, a 1.8-million-square-foot film production studio topped by twin office towers and a 21.5-acre public park along the waterfront. It would also extend Riverside Drive from 72d Street to 59th Street, and reroute the West Side Highway so that it is no longer elevated and runs farther inland, separated from the Hudson by the new park.
At the hearing last night at the school, on Amsterdam Avenue and 65th Street, the project was called gross and grotesque, sensible and reasonable. For all those who complained that their river views would be blocked by new skyscrapers, there were others who looked forward to jogging in a new riverside park.
For all those who questioned the neighborhood's ability to support added pedestrian and vehicular traffic, there were those who argued that the project would create thousands of construction jobs, rejuvenating the city's recession-enervated building trade.
Of course the oratory was colorful. Sylvia Gould, a woman who said she spoke on behalf of the Gray Panthers, said, "Future generations will be appalled by the audacity and greed of those forcing this on the community."
The veiled implication was to Mr. Trump, who was not at the meeting but who bore the brunt of the evening's name-calling. At one point it was suggested he be tarred and feathered.
 
'Where Do You Live?'
 Also unsurprising was that passions occasionally erupted. One speaker, who said the project was "a fantastic opportunity for all New Yorkers," was roundly booed.
And when Robert P. Maguire, the vice president of the Building Trades Council, said, "I implore the Community Board to endorse Riverside South," he was heckled unmercifully.
"Where do you live? Where do you live?" people shouted from the audience. He replied, shouting into the microphone and pointing, "Shame on you!"
Community Boards have only advisory power in the approval procedure. For this reason, and because residents have the most at stake, community boards have frequently played the devil's advocate in the process, forcing consideration of the smallest matters to keep developers and city agencies from proceeding with what they regard as undue haste.
The board is to vote on the draft resolution tomorrow and no one expects it to be favorable, least of all Richard A. Kahan, chiarman of the Riverside South Planning Corporation.
"The vote will be negative," he said. "They have legitimate issues which will be discussed over the last five months, and the plan will be improved from what it is now. But for them to vote yes at this point simply takes them out of the process."
 
Litany of Complaints
 Critics have contended, among other complaints, that the $3 billion project, which would comprise 8.3 million square feet of space and add 5,700 apartments and a film production studio to the area, would further burden the already precarious infrastructure of the Upper West Side, particularly taxing the North River Sewage Treatment Center and the 72d Street subway station.
The board's resolution included both specific recommendations -- for example, that the development be limited to 6.9 million square feet of space -- and nonspecific expressions of discontent. Item 25 reads, for example, referring to the proposed riverside park: "Rethink the freshwater pool."
Proponents of the project argue that the current plan, which arose as an alternative to the second of two previous proposals by Mr. Trump for even larger projects (he has owned the site since 1964) is committed to "reasonable development" of the West Side.

Chart: "What Happens Next: Hurdles for a Trump Plan
Members of Community Board 7 on the Upper West Side of Manhattan yesterday began considering Donald Trump's Riverside South project, a mixed-use project of offices, retail space and housing from West 59th Street to 72d Street along the Hudson River. The project, certified as complete in May by the New York City Planning Department, is subject to public hearings and cannot begin until the seven-month approval procedure is completed. Following are steps the project faces:
Community Board 7: The board held a public hearing yesterday and plans another for today on the project. After a third hearing tomorrow, it is expected to vote. Community Boards have only advisory power in the process.
Borough President: The proposal is expected to move to the office of Ruth W. Messinger on July 27. Ms. Messinger, who has scheduled public hearings for Aug. 3 and 4, has 30 days to make a recommendation.
City Planning Commission: After the community board and the borough president, the proposal goes to the planning commission. The commission, which has 60 days to render a judgment, can approve the proposal, reject it or ask for changes. A tentative public hearing is set for Sept. 5.
City Council: The proposal then goes the City Council, where it will be reviewed first by a subcommittee of the Land Use Committee, then by the entire committee. The full Council will vote on the plan after it comes out of committee. If the Council makes changes in it, it goes back to the planning commission for 15 days, then returns to the Council.
The Mayor's Office: After being approved by the Council, the proposal would then go to the Mayor, who has five days to act. If the Mayor vetoes the proposal, the Council has 10 days to override the veto. A two-thirds majority vote would be needed for an override.

HEADLINE: Port Authority Says Cleaners Overcharged

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG

 BODY:
Dozens of tenants at the World Trade Center were overcharged by a total of almost $1 million for cleaning services over the last year because of inadequate monitoring by officials of the Port Authority, the executive director of the agency said last night.
In acknowledging the failure in oversight, the executive director, Stanley Brezenoff, said he was reassigning two top officials who were responsible for managing the trade center and its contracts with Ogden Allied Services Corporation, which has cleaned the offices in the twin towers since the mid-1980's. The Trade Center is owned by the Port Authority. 
 The disclosure and the quick action underscored the sensitivity of top Port Authority officials to suggestions of mismanagement, after reports that millions of dollars were wasted on major projects that were later abandoned at Kennedy International Airport. While those projects and the cleaning contracts with Ogden preceded Mr. Brezenoff's arrival at the agency, the poor supervision of cleaning services persisted under his tenure, which began in 1990.
A senior vice president at Ogden, Murray Rosenblatt, declined to comment on the Port Authority's disclosure when reached at his home last night.
 
'Inadequate Monitoring'
 One of the Trade Center officials reassigned as a result of the audit is Frank Garcia, a 34-year veteran of the Port Authority who oversaw the Trade Center's business operations from May 1990 until January, when he was named director of the agency's economic development department. The other is August K. Preschle, who has been with the agency 23 years and who oversaw the Trade Center's maintenance and daily operations.
Mr. Preschle did not return a phone message left at his home last night. Someone who answered the phone at Mr. Garcia's residence said Mr. Garcia would not answer questions on the matter.
Mr. Brezenoff said the overcharges -- which he estimated at between $800,000 and $1 million -- were discovered during an internal audit that he commissioned earlier this year. The audit, which reviewed the Trade Center's cleaning-services contracts and is close to completion, "concluded that there were inadequate monitoring and oversight of billing and charges to the Port Authority and to tenants," Mr. Brezenoff said.
Mr. Brezenoff said the agency would move aggressively to recoup the extra charges and would consider suing the company if the money was not returned. He said the agency would not decide the fate of the company's current cleaning contract with the Trade Center, which expires in December, until the overcharges were resolved.
Since the company has not responded to the findings of the audit, he said it was too soon to say whether the overcharges were deliberate or a result of sloppy bookkeeping. He said that the agency was not considering pursuing a criminal complaint.
Under a $24 million annual contract that was last renewed in January 1990, the agency said, Ogden provides basic office cleaning for the tenants of the Trade Center, which include the Port Authority itself. In addition to overseeing that contract, the agency also monitors several dozen contracts -- totaling an additional $4 million to $6 million -- that individual tenants have signed with Ogden to provide more specialized and intensive cleaning services.
 
Renovations Needed
 Under the main contract, tenants are provided with such basic services as vaccuuming, dusting and the cleaning of bathroooms. Tenants negotiate the additional contracts to arrange for more frequent visits from cleaning crews and for extra services like furniture polishing.
It was under these additional contracts, Mr. Brezenoff said, that Ogden charged tenants rates that exceeded what it had negotiated with the Port Authority. Agency officials said they had not yet determined how many tenants had been overcharged and they declined to identify any of the tenants involved or detail the amounts individual tenants overpaid.
The disclosure of the audit comes as the Trade Center, one of the premier corporate locations in Manhattan, is in need of hundreds of millions of dollars in renovations if it is to hold on to its place in a competitive real-estate market. And the audit that uncovered the overcharges was conducted in part to help retain that competitive edge, Mr. Brezenoff said.
Mr. Brezenoff said he began taking steps soon after he joined the Port Authority in the fall of 1990 to shore up the center's management. Those steps included creating a new division within the Port Authority specifically to oversee the twin towers, and, earlier this year, beginning internal audits to assess operations.
"You fight tooth and nail to attract and retain tenants and you hate to run the risk of a facility getting a reputation for being overpriced on services," Mr. Brezenoff said. "The individual contracts were supposed to be reviewed and they were not."
Ogden Allied Services, the principal subsidiary of the Ogden Corporation, is a nationally known company that also handles cleaning and general maintenance at the metropolitan region's three main airports, which are also operated by the Port Authority. Ogden also used to handle cleaning and booking of trade shows at the Jacob J. Javits Convention Center, but the company was recently dropped at the center in a cost-cutting move.
In the wake of the overcharges, Mr. Brezenoff said the Port Authority would overhaul the Trade Center's cost-accounting system.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The State Department;
Eagleburger Is Viewed As the Likely Successor

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 21

 BODY:
A move by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d to the White House would be likely to leave the State Department in the hands of Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger and the outlines of United States policy virtually unchanged, Administration officials said today.
Several officials said that to their knowledge the move, which is expected to occur in August, had not yet been discussed by Mr. Baker and Mr. Eagleburger. 
 In Congress, several Democrats complained that President Bush -- whether he decides to leave Mr. Baker's seat vacant or fill it with a new Secretary -- would be "decapitating" the department in the eyes of a world facing multiple crises, putting politics ahead of statesmanship.
 
Call for Resignation
 At a minimum, Democratic members of Congress say, Mr. Baker should resign formally so that full authority can be given to Mr. Eagleburger or another appointee and the State Department, now run by a close circle of Baker confidants, is not left on hold.
Mr. Baker is expected to resign rather than take a leave.
"We are making the painful transition into a world where regional conflict in breaking out everywhere," Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, said, adding that Mr. Eagleburger has the experience to take charge of policy operations but might not accept a caretaker role.
"There is no more important job in the United States Government than the Secretary of State and that office has to be up and running at all times," Senator Moynihan said. "We can't put off crises until December. They don't arrange crises according to our electoral calendar."
 
Not in Inner Circle
 Administration officials and policy analysts suggested that while Mr. Baker's preference might be to go on leave from his job in the hope of easily returning as Secretary of State after the election, a leave would be unworkable, and politically unwise. But they contend that major policies are in place and functioning and could probably weather a three-month hiatus under an acting secretary. There is less certainty about how the Administration would cope with an unexpected crisis.
Mr. Eagleburger has not been a member of Mr. Bush's inner circle of advisers, suggesting his influence would be limited. As a longtime associate of Henry A. Kissinger, the former Secretary of State, Mr. Eagleburger has never been popular with conservative Republicans.
The Middle East peace process, given a boost by the election of a new government in Israel and Mr. Baker's trip this week to the region, can move mostly of its own volition to a new round of talks between Arabs and Israelis, probably in September.
Mr. Eagleburger has already taken much of the responsibility -- and been the target of Democratic criticism -- for policy in other areas, such as Yugoslavia and the former Soviet Union. But the Deputy Secretary, who is directing Administration aid efforts to Russia and other republics, would have to take on the added task of persuading Congress to back the Russian aid package, which has yet to clear the House of Representatives.
Beyond his involvement in policy on Yugoslavia and the former Soviet republics, Mr. Eagleburger has also taken prominent roles in areas for which Mr. Baker has had little interest. In many such areas, most notably the continuing standoff on Haiti, the Secretary of State has left assistants in charge.
 
Internal Policy Debates
 The President, the Secretary of State and the National Security Adviser, Brent Scowcroft, long ago established a pattern of debating the most important policies among themselves, sometimes also involving Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, Gen. Colin L. Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, or a few other officials.
Mr. Eagleburger has remained largely outside this circle.
In the Department, only a handful of officials -- among them Margaret D. Tutwiler, the spokeswoman; Dennis B. Ross, director of Policy Planning, and Robert B. Zoellick, the department counselor and also the Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs -- have had regular access to Mr. Baker, who is widely regarded inside and outside the Administration as a hard working and skillful manager, but not a warm personality able to relax and listen to the ideas of a wide range of people. The three aides might all end up moving with Mr. Baker, Administration officials said.
His management of the Department has left many officials feeling left out in shaping policy in areas where they have expertise.
But there is wide respect for Mr. Baker's dedication and managerial skills among diplomats and foreign leaders who have dealt with the Secretary of State. Arab delegation heads to several rounds of Middle East talks said that Mr. Baker had gained the confidence of Arab leaders who had long been of the opinion that the United States would automatically back Israel in any dispute.

HEADLINE: RUSSIANS OFFERING NUCLEAR ARMS FUEL FOR U.S. REACTORS

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
Desperate for hard currency, Russia offered yesterday to sell the United States tons of uranium from retired nuclear arms, saying the concentrated material could be diluted into fuel for civilian reactors that make electricity.
Any East-West deal that turned nuclear swords into plowshares would be a milestone in dismantling the cold war's machinery. For the Russians, the main alternative is to store highly enriched uranium in underground bunkers. Some Western experts say they fear that material put in storage might eventually find its way back into bombs. 
 Victor N. Mikhailov, head of Russia's Ministry of Atomic Energy, yesterday discussed the potential sale of Russian uranium in Washington with top officials of the Energy Department, which oversees the nation's production of nuclear arms and civilian reactor fuel.
 
'A Lot of Hurdles'
 "The Russians are very serious," said Dr. Thomas B. Cochran, a senior scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council who has discussed the proposed sale with Mr. Mikhailov. "But there's a lot of hurdles that have to be overcome, so he's over here to cement the deal."
The Russians have also reportedly talked to France and Japan about possible sales of uranium derived from warheads. There is no indication that the Russians have tried to sell highly enriched uranium to any other countries.
Mr. Mikhailov and his aides have lined up several American companies eager to dilute highly enriched Russian uranium from warheads and to sell it as reactor fuel. Yesterday he lobbied for the plan with Federal officials, who must approve any deal.
Among the major questions are whether Russian bomb-grade uranium can be shipped overseas without theft or accident and whether it can be sold without sending the world uranium market into a tailspin.
Already, cash-starved Russians have sold large amounts of natural and mildly enriched uranium in Western commercial markets, feeding a price decline that has driven some uranium producers out of business and threatened the uranium enrichment business of the Energy Department, the world's largest supplier of commercial reactor fuel.
Private experts say that, despite the potential problems, the Federal Government might eventually approve the sale since revenues could help Moscow dismantle its nuclear arsenal and aid the ailing Russian economy.
Several American companies are clearly eager to make agreements, including Allied-Signal Inc., a aerospace and chemicals giant based in Morristown, N.J., that recently signed a preliminary agreement with the Russians.
"We hope to start the processing work next year and eventually to build a plant in Russia," said Michael J. Ascolese, a company spokesman.
Walter A. Simon, vice president for business development at General Atomics, a San Diego company also talking with the Russians, said recycling bomb material into reactor fuel had benefits beyond economics. "It's better than having it stockpiled for military purposes," he said in an interview.
Yesterday the Energy Department said Mr. Mikhailov met with Energy Secretary James D. Watkins and other departmental officials to discuss the potential uranium sale.
"We agreed to try to come to an early determination" about the deal's feasibility, said William H. Young, the department's assistant secretary for nuclear energy, adding that no timetable for a decision had been set.
The United States has 110 operating nuclear reactors, all of which must be at least partly refueled with fresh uranium every 12 to 18 months.
The retirement of thousands of warheads from the arsenals of East and West, as called for by recent accords, will free hundreds of tons of plutonium 239 and uranium 235, the two main fuels of nuclear warheads. So far, few decisions have been made about the final disposition of this material. The main options are to store it, to recycle it into new arms or to transform it into reactor fuel.
For a host of technical and political reasons, such conversion is more difficult for plutonium than uranium. By and large, the plutonium is slated to be stored.
Natural uranium ore is made up of a mix of isotopes. Only 0.71 percent of it is uranium 235, the fissionable isotope used in bombs and reactors. Uranium for most American nuclear power reactors is enriched to a level of about 3 percent, while fuel for bombs has more than 90 percent.
The plan now under discussion is to reverse that enrichment process, diluting uranium 235 from bombs with natural uranium for use in commercial nuclear power plants.
Dr. Thomas L. Neff, a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has long advocated the sale of bomb uranium, said in an interview that the dismantlement of Russian nuclear arms might yield up to 20 tons of highly enriched uranium a year, which in diluted form could annually power about 20 commercial nuclear reactors.
Conversely, Dr. Neff said, that same uranium could fuel about 1,500 Hiroshima-sized bombs.
Since the Russian stockpiles of weapons-grade uranium are so large, it seems unlikely that the West would be able to purchase enough of it for reactor fuel to insure that it did not get into unfriendly hands.
At least four American companies have negotiated with Moscow in recent months to buy highly enriched uranium. One team is composed of General Atomics and Babcock & Wilcox, and the other partnership is Allied-Signal and Nuclear Fuel Services of Erwin, Tenn. All the companies have nuclear expertise. In addition, Babcock & Wilcox and Nuclear Fuel Services have plants that process highly enriched uranium, mainly for the Federal Government.
On July 3 in Moscow, Allied-Signal and Nuclear Fuel Services signed a tentative agreement with the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy and the Russian Academy of Sciences to buy enriched uranium, according to a copy of the protocol. It calls for an "interim arrangement" in which 11 tons of highly enriched uranium would be purchased by mid-1993, with similar amounts thereafter annually.
No price is disclosed in the document. But Dr. Cochran of the Natural Resources Defense Council said 11 tons of bomb material might fetch up to $100 million if diluted for the reactor fuel market.
The tentative accord calls for the joint venture with Allied-Signal and Nuclear Fuel Services to eventually set up a plant in Russia where enriched uranium would be diluted for sale.
Reactor fuel produced by the East-West venture would be sold "to or through the U.S. Department of Energy for use in the world commercial fuel market, or on terms acceptable to both parties" in a way to minimize any disruption of world uranium markets, the agreement says.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Optimistic but Cautious

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 21

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, gave an only faintly upbeat forecast today, saying the economy would gain momentum soon. But he failed to say how soon and added that the jobless rate -- the most politically sensitive economic indicator in an election year -- would remain above 7 percent for the rest of 1992.
Mr. Greenspan's testimony before Congress is likely to give the White House little encouragement that the economy will bolster President Bush's faltering re-election campaign. The Fed chairman characterized current economic activity as dull and gave no firm indication that it would pick up before Election Day. 
 Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the Democratic Presidential nominee, who leads Mr. Bush in the public opinion polls by 20 points or more, has made the Republicans' stewardship of the economy a central campaign theme. The Democrats contend that Republican policies have mired the nation in its longest slump since World War II.
 
 
Sees No Triple Dip
 In his testimony, Mr. Greenspan, the nation's most influential economic policy maker, rejected the idea of a triple-dip recession, saying the economy "is likely to strengthen moderately" between now and the end of 1993. He added that the jobless rate, now 7.8 percent, would fall to a range of 6.5 to 7 percent by the end of 1993.
In a triple dip recession, the normal recovery after an initial downturn would give way to two substantial dips in output.
"I expect that the economic expansion will soon gain momentum, which lower inflation should help to maintain," he said. He said industrial production was increasing in July, based on preliminary reports, after declining in June.
Mr. Greenspan appeared before the Senate Banking Committee, as he is required by law to do twice a year, to discuss monetary policy and the state of the economy. The hearing was unusually testy, with several senators attacking the Fed chairman for acting too slowly to cut interest rates and asking why they should believe this forecast when several of his recent predictions had been wrong.
In his testimony, Mr. Greenspan made these other points:
*It would be risky to use fiscal stimulus, like increased spending, to spur the economy, because that would produce a higher deficit and could push up already high long-term interest rates. Some Democrats in Congress are considering such a package of fiscal stimulation.
*The American economy would not benefit from letting the dollar fall. On Monday, the Fed joined a dozen other central banks to buy dollars, in an effort to keep the currency from falling to record lows against the German mark.
*Cutting the capital gains tax rate would help lift investment -- a position he espoused even before he became Fed chairman. The Bush Administration plans to push Congress to pass a capital gains tax cut and a tax credit for first-time home buyers, among other measures, to enhance growth. Many Democrats frown on cutting capital gains taxes, believing it would help the rich while doing little to stimulate investment.
 Mr. Greenspan said one reason the economy should pick up soon was that with profits up, many banks had become healthy enough to make more loans. He said many households had reduced their debt, laying the foundation for increased consumer confidence and household spending.
But Mr. Greenspan added that growth would continue to be held back by the large burdens of debt still held by households and businesses.
"Last year, I characterized this process as the economy struggling against a 50-mile-an-hour headwind," he said. "Today its speed is decidedly less but still appreciable."
The Fed has lowered interest rates to the lowest level in 29 years, and he said it was now considering another way to spur lending. The central bank might ease the ratio of capital to assets that banks are required to meet, he said.
 Democrats questioned Mr. Greenspan's prediction that the economy would soon pick up, implying that he was seeking to help his Republican friends. "I speak to people across the country, and you're about the most optimistic person I've talked to," said Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., the Michigan Democrat who is chairman of the committee.
Mr. Riegle and other senators were skeptical of Mr. Greenspan's forecast, noting that he had said in January that the economy would pick up in the second quarter. Instead, the jobless rate soared, and Mr. Greenspan acknowledged today that growth in the three months that ended on June 30 would be about 2 percent, appreciably below the 2.7 percent of the January-March quarter.
In July 1991, Mr. Greenspan said the nation was moving toward "a solid recovery," but after that the economy dipped steeply, with growth falling to an anemic four-tenths of 1 percent in the fourth quarter.
"Why is there any more reason for us to think that you're right this time," Mr. Riegle asked, "when we look at the record and see that you've said essentially the very same thing before in past months, and it's turned out not to be right?"
 As senator after senator criticized him during the four-hour session, Mr. Greenspan sat stoically, his head propped up on his left hand. Occasionally he interrupted them in mid-sentence to defend himself, just as they often butted in during his testimony to air their disbelief or unhappiness.
Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, joined Democrats in saying the Fed chairman did not show enough urgency about the economy. After the hearing, Mr. D'Amato called on Mr. Greenspan and Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady to step down and recommended that Housing Secretary Jack F. Kemp replace Mr. Brady.
 
 
Sees Lower Jobless Rate
 Mr. Greenspan said that growth for the year would be between 2.25 and 2.75 percent, rising to 2.75 to 3 percent in 1993. He said the Fed was predicting that the jobless rate would fall to between 7.25 percent and 7.5 percent by the end of this year.
Mr. Greenspan devoted much of his testimony to explaining why the economy remained weak even after the Fed cut the Federal funds rate -- the rate at which banks lend each other money -- 23 times since mid-1989.
He explained that the surge of debt in the 1980's caused consumer and business spending to fall when the value of assets stopped increasing. He said rate cuts failed to stimulate activity as much as expected because many banks, shocked by bad loans, were reluctant to lend, and many consumers and businesses, weighed down by debt, were loath to borrow.
Although he acknowledged that monetary growth had fallen well below its targets this year, he said the Fed had provisionally adopted the same monetary growth targets for next year that were set for 1992. The Fed is aiming for growth of 2.5 to 6.5 percent for M-2, the most closely watched gauge of the money supply, and of 4.5 to 8.5 percent for debt.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: White House;
Campaign Focuses on Baker As Bush Stumps in Northeast

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GARFIELD, N.J., July 21

 BODY:
President Bush's campaign has always had the sense of a political operation waiting for something to happen. On the campaign trail today, waiting for James A. Baker 3d has simply added a new tang to the air of expectancy.
Months ago, the question was whether Mr. Bush would name a new chief of staff and when he would pick his campaign team. That done, Bush advisers wondered when he would announce his candidacy and answer demands for action on the economy. Then, it was whether he would mount an attack on Congress, and after that, whether he would replace his new chief of staff. 
 Today the questions that campaign aides were asking focused on Mr. Baker as Mr. Bush campaigned in Philadelphia and here in Bergen County, trying to shore up two groups that help make up the Republican base: supporters of Federal subsidies for parochial schools and people of Eastern European ancestry.
Some Bush aides cautioned against seeing Mr. Baker as a solution to all their problems. Mr. Bush's campaign, a Washington aide said, is "so far in our own end zone that we're going to have to throw something high and very risky to get back in the game."
But Mr. Baker was seen as a figure who could impose order and energy on the disorganized and desultory Bush team and, perhaps most important, act as the peer that Mr. Bush has been lacking to give advice and, when necessary, prod him to action.
The President himself did not mention Mr. Baker today. But the course of the campaign was clearly on his mind as he talked in Philadelphia of "the funny period we're in." There were times when he, too, seemed to be waiting as he went through the motions of campaigning in the weeks before the Republican National Convention, which opens on Aug. 17, in Houston.
And there were moments when his mind did not seem to be entirely on the business at hand.
At a question-and-answer session at Archbishop Ryan Catholic School in Philadelphia, Mr. Bush had to pause for a second to recollect where he was on his frenetic itinerary. "I am determined not to bring into this lovely school arena -- gymnasium, or whatever lovely auditorium we are in -- a lot of partisan politics," he said.
Later, a woman who said she was concerned that middle-income Americans were not getting enough help, asked Mr. Bush if there was an income ceiling on his proposal to give families $1,000 to spend on the school of their choice -- public, private or religious.
"In this program that we're talking about here today, there is no means testing," he replied, using the bureaucratic term for a program in which people above a certain income are not eligible. "A family like yours would be covered," he added, apparently believing the woman was referring to herself when she mentioned families earning $40,000 a year.
He was partly right. Campaign aides later acknowledged, with some embarrassment, that there is an income ceiling in his proposal. It is $40,000.
Mr. Bush's campaigning recently has been aimed largely at two things: seizing back the "family" agenda that the Democrats tried to appropriate at their convention in New York last week, and dispelling the lack of resolve that haunts the Bush team.
He has taken every opportunity to reassure his supporters that he intends to fight hard for re-election, as he did on Monday night, when the President's aides arranged a satellite broadcast to 34 gatherings of supporters in 27 states. "The Democrats have had their day, and next month it's our turn," Mr. Bush said. "And we're going to come out of Houston strong."
Today, in this industrial city in northeastern New Jersey, Mr. Bush addressed an enthusiastic crowd outside the Three Saints Russian Orthodox Church to commemorate "National Freedom Day," a celebration of the crumbling of Communist power in Eastern Europe.
"The family is under siege, and the choices in this election are clear," he said. "On one side the advocates of the liberal agenda, on the other side are you and I and those values of family that we share."
He added, "They want public schools to hand out birth control pills and devices to teen-age kids."
Mr. Bush closed with a new assurance of his determination, delivered in a shout: "I will not let you down! I will fight for the faith! I will fight for the American family! We are one nation, under God, and never forget it!"

HEADLINE: People Who Need Care Find Men Are Giving It

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN TELTSCH

 BODY:
By day, Albert C. Wiltshire is a no-nonsense chief executive running the Brooklyn Navy Yard with a powerful grip -- his staff irreverently calls him Darth Vader.
But at night, he turns into Big Al, a 55-year-old bachelor homemaker who cooks, shops, cleans and supervises school work for his 10- and 12-year-old grandsons who have lived with him since his daughter's marriage foundered a year ago. 
 His dual-track life makes Mr. Wiltshire one of about 12.7 million older men looking after children and grandchildren or providing hands-on care for ailing or disabled relatives, friends and neighbors, according to the Commonwealth Fund, a New York foundation specializing in issues involving health care, the aging and the work force.
After surveying 2,999 Americans age 55 and over, the study concluded that while women still are the major providers of care for other people, men are taking an increasingly bigger role.
How much bigger is tough to measure because, until recently, researchers paid little attention to the role of men, said Lenard W. Kaye, a Bryn Mawr professor who has done studies of men involved in providing care.
"These men are unsung heroes, standing outside the spotlight," said Professor Kaye. "They are the husbands, sons, sons-in-law, brothers and other men who provide about a third of the care for the elderly. Their number is likely to grow because women as caregivers are reaching the saturation point and the need for caregiving continues to increase."
Dr. Robert N. Butler, chairman of the Department of Geriatrics at Mount Sinai Medical Center, says the change in men's roles has been stimulated by economic, political and cultural changes.
"Increased longevity, the high costs of health care and the feminist movement all are moving society in the direction of greater shared responsibility," he said. "We also are seeing in many cultures evidence that gender roles can change in the middle years, women becoming more assertive and less likely to accept automatically the caregiver's role and men showing more interest in nurturing."
The Commonwealth Fund and others including the Brookdale Center on Aging of Hunter College said the new survey is probably the most comprehensive statistical effort to measure the providing of care by gender, age, income, race, employment and marital status. Based on data developed by Louis Harris and Associates, ICF Inc. and the University of Massachusetts-Boston, the survey showed that half the men over 55 who have children or grandchildren are caring for them.
And other researchers suggested that the survey may in fact underrepresent the number of male providers. For example, they said that members of minority groups were probably underrepresented because they were more likely to care for family members without reaching out for help from social-service agencies and thus they were more difficult for researchers to find.
 
An Unknown Dimension
 Another unknown is the dimension of the providing of care in the gay community by younger men helping partners with AIDS, said Dr. Robyn Stone, a senior policy analyst at Project Hope, an international health foundation in Chevy Chase, Md. Dr. Stone, who has studied the frail and elderly and is planning to look at younger male helpers, also said that more is needed to be learned about the scope of male providing of care, how much of it is intermittent help like grocery shopping and how much of it is full-time personal, hands-on care.
The Commonwealth study did not address this question specifically, but it did make clear that those providing care were doing more than an occasional good deed. It found that men spend an average 15.9 hours weekly as providers of care and women 22.8 hours.
According to the Commonwealth study, among married couples, 1.6 million men and 1.8 million women are caring for a sick or disabled spouse; 1.2 million men and 1.9 million women are caring for a sick or disabled parent, and 2.1 million men and 3.1 million women are caring for a sick or disabled friend or neighbor.
Hispanic people are more likely than whites or blacks to help their children, and both Hispanic people and blacks are more likely than whites to take care of grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
 
Doing Double Duty
 Even the researchers say the studies so far do not reflect the range of experiences of men who have served both as helper to an ailing parent or spouse and simultaneously as homemaker for children.
A case in point is Joseph O'Mara, who cared for his gravely sick wife for two years and also looked after their young children.
When his wife died seven years ago, Mr. O'Mara said, he considered returning to Ireland with the five children, then ages 4 to 14, but decided instead to stay put among the neighbors and friends who had poured out support for the family, especially during his wife's illness.
"I didn't do it alone, everybody helped," said Mr. O'Mara, who turns 55 in October and has worked as a cook for 20 years at the Mad Hatter, an Upper East Side restaurant just around the corner from the family's walk-up.
For starters, there was Dolly Benn Epstein, a widow, who ran a nearby thrift shop for charities and looked out for clothes that would please the children, and James Levett, a next-door neighbor, who saw that they kept doctors' appointments, and Laura Kaye-Stewart, who secured a $25,000 school tuition fund for them -- all five attended St. Stephen's of Hungary -- and Bob Keon who kept an eye on the younger ones as they played on East 78th Street, and Paulette Meiselas, a social worker from Spence-Chapin who stayed at their side through many a family crisis.
 
Rugby Club Pitches In
 High on the list of helpers is the entire New York Rugby Club, which bought the family a station wagon so Mr. O'Mara could keep up his habit of collecting a dozen or more neighborhood children on Saturday mornings for an outing to Randalls Island even though his arthritis keeps him from playing the game himself.
"I guess a lot of us helped the family," said Rose Garvey, whose family lives close by, "but the bottom line is Joseph always is there for us too when we need him."
Both Mr. Wiltshire and Mr. O'Mara said they had grown accustomed to their bachelor head-of-household roles.
"I put the bar in the cellar and turned my den into a second bedroom," said Mr. Wiltshire. Two bicycles are parked in the living room now and he's buying another for himself, he said, adding, "We're doing just fine."
Nonetheless, they are constantly reminded that they are breaking new ground. At parent-teacher meetings, Mr. Wiltshire occasionally gets to his feet to complain that all the advice he hears seems directed at the working mother, demanding, "What about fathers -- and grandfathers?" Mr. O'Mara was the only man in a single-parent club run by the Rev. Vincent Biagi at Xavier High School.
"There needs to be more attention paid to men who head families," said Mr. Wiltshire. "If the idea was more widely accepted, more of us would get involved. It's just society that hangs on to the stereotypes that taking care of children is women's responsibility."
Mr. Wiltshire, who was divorced 16 years ago, said he regarded his help to his grandsons as "a second chance to do what I should have done for my children." He was particularly proud when 12-year-old Vernell Sullivan won a medal in June for the biggest improvement in his class.
The experiences of men moving into caring roles already has demonstrated a need to provide men with more opportunity for training and assistance, said Dr. Albert Hollenbeck, assistant director of the Andrus Foundation of the American Association of Retired Persons, which sponsored Professor Kaye's survey. "Men often do not bring to caregiving the typical skills of a homemaker such as cooking. Neither do they have the support networks to sustain them emotionally."
When men began turning up for a course in providing care at the Office for the Aging of Orange County in Goshen, N.Y., Bobbi Hull, a special programs director, was not surprised because, she said, "we saw this trend emerging as more men took on the job of helping spouses and parents who suffered from Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, stroke and other disabilities." The 12-hour course includes psychological counseling and practical demonstrations by nurses in how to bathe and transfer a patient from bed to wheelchair.
 
Unreal Expectations?
 In a typical class of 30, 5 to 11 participants are men, she said, and a number are holding jobs as well as providing care. The course, created as one of 17 countywide programs financed by New York State, has drawn men and women from Delaware, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, she said.
New York City's Department for the Aging, which conducts lunchtime seminars on providing care for employees of corporations, has found a significant increase in men attending, said Commissioner Prema Mathai-Davis. "When we began five years ago, two or three men would show up. Now regularly one-third of the audience are men and sometimes a half. This certainly shows men feel they have a need to know what services are available for the elderly, such as home-delivered meals or other help."
Despite the evidence that men are getting more involved in caring, Dr. Katrina W. Johnson, a research administrator of the National Institute on Aging, cautioned against unreal expectations. "We think of men these days as being more willing to demonstrate they are caring, sensitive people as we see them on television shows," she said. "It's one thing to picture the male as willing to be a caregiver and help an adorable 4-year-old orphan who may grow up to be President. But is a would-be Alan Alda ready to care for his ailing, elderly mother?"

Vote to Sell TV Station Splits Iowans

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AMES, Iowa, July 21

 BODY:
In 1950, an unexpected windfall led to a visionary idea, and leaders at Iowa State University bought a commercial television station. The station has been a laboratory for students in both journalism and meteorology ever since, while at the same time serving as a network affiliate station for central Iowa.
But in June the Iowa Board of Regents, which runs the state's three public universities, voted to sell the station. Along with an expected $14 million, the vote produced a lawsuit. 
 Calling themselves Iowans for WOI-TV Inc., a group of faculty members, former regents, students, alumni, Iowans and former Iowans who oppose the sale asked a state court to stop the transaction. Neil Harl, a professor of agriculture and economics who is the group's president, said the group believed that WOI is an important educational and economic asset for the university and that the regents did not have the authority to sell it.
The group maintains that the Regents by law have the authority to manage and control the three universities but not to sell their assets. The regents have a date in court next month to defend the sale.
The Regents say owning a commercially profitable television station does not fit into the university's mission, and that if it ever lost money it would have to borrow funds from the university. They voted to sell the station, an ABC affiliate, on June 17 to the Capital Communications Company, a joint venture of the Citadel Communications Company of Bronxville, N.Y., and the Lynch Corporation, a Connecticut concern.
The transfer will take about a year to complete. In addition, the sides have yet to work out several details, including whether the station will continue to use students as interns.
In the meantime, students, along with paid full-time employees, continue to work at the station in the middle of campus.
Mr. Harl said WOI was owned directly by the university until 1987, when the Iowa State Broadcasting Corporation was established so that it could operate independently. But it has consistently contributed profits, nearly $400,000 annually in recent years, to Iowa State, he said. The station also pays $80,000 a year in rent.
The station employs students as camera operators, reporters and weather forecasters. And WOI and its equipment serve the university's Distance Learning program, which sends lectures by satellite to students far from Ames. The program has transmitted lessons to Czechoslovakia and has plans to send transmissions to the former Soviet Union.
Students in the broadcast journalism program are required to work at the station for one course, and some classes have been held in its building. Rod Fowler, a full-time anchor at WOI and a recent Iowa State graduate from Tama, said his time at WOI was invaluable. He said the station helped him decide to enter the university's journalism program.
"From beginning to end, students get the hands-on experience that they need," he said.
Iowa State established WOI in 1950 with funds left over from a Federal grant it received for work on the Manhattan Project, the World War II project to build the atomic bomb. Two Iowa State professors and four graduate students produced tons of high purity uranium for the bomb project.
The station was the first commercially operated television station owned by a university in the country. Joe Esser, associate editor of Broadcast and Cable Marketplace, said there were only two other university-owned commercial television stations in the nation: WNDU at the University of Notre Dame and KOMU at the University of Missouri at Columbia.
Mr. Harl said the money from the sale, which will be placed in trust, could not make enough in interest to offset the income the university now receives, and could later receive, from the station.
Iowa State's president, Martin Jischke, and several campus groups oppose the sale. "Everybody concludes that the stream of benefits would be greater if I.S.U. kept the station," Mr. Harl said.
But Marvin Pomerantz, a prominent Iowa businessman and chairman of the Board of Regents, said the board had considered the decision carefully. "The quality of our educational programs will improve, and the university will benefit financially from the sale," he said.

HEADLINE: For Inner-City Students, a Program Offers a Taste of Private-School Life

BYLINE: By WILLIAM CELIS 3d

 BODY:
Picture a private school setting, with all of the educational extras such schools can afford. Open the campus for a summer school that aims to help inner-city adolescents. Then recruit as instructors bright high school and college students considering teaching careers.
Give the students, all of whom are in middle school, rigorous instruction in math, science, history and language, combined with electives in the arts and sports. Offer hugs and support; then listen to the students who are accepted to the tuition-free, six-week program called Summerbridge. 
 "I wish there were public schools like this," said Manuel Billups, an 11-year-old who is enrolled in the Summerbridge program at Riverdale Country School in the Bronx and who will be a seventh grader at Intermediate School 164 in Harlem in the fall. "You have to go to a private school to get all of this, and even then privates don't offer all of this."
As educators and policymakers continue their search for ways to help students from the inner city, Summerbridge demonstrates what can be done with hard work and a spending level that corporate sponsors and other contributors call cost-effective. As a result, it has been copied in nine cities since 1990.
 
Two Summers of Work
 Founded in 1978 by Lois Anderson Loofbourrow, a former public school teacher in San Francisco, the program seeks to lift students both academically and personally. For two summers, youngsters have class in the morning and pursue elective subjects and sports in the afternoon. In the intervening school year they receive tutoring.
Summerbridge says the approach has paid off: 92 percent of the 700 students who have gone through the San Francisco program since 1978 have enrolled in top-tier private college-preparatory high schools, most on scholarships, or won admission into competitive public high schools. Some graduates are now attending Ivy League universities or highly selective public institutions.
And it is a double success, in that 64 percent of the high school and college students who have taught in the program have gone on to pursue careers in education.
For 12 years San Francisco had the only such program, but since 1990 others like it have been established in New York; Miami; Louisville, Ky.; Providence, R.I.; Manchester, N.H.; Ross, Calif.; Cambridge, Mass., New Orleans and Hong Kong. Six more are scheduled to open next summer in New Haven; Cincinnati; El Paso; Bethlehem, Pa.; Kansas City, Mo., and Portland, Ore.
The program's cost -- about $1,000 per student -- is borne by the host private schools, which donate their campuses and supplies, and by the InterPacific Group, a San Francisco company, as well as other corporations and foundations. Salaries for teachers are $500 for high school students and $750 for college students, and some college students are given extra money in the form of financial aid.
Since 1988, InterPacific, which manages and owns resorts and other businesses, has contributed $600,000 to $750,000 to Summerbridge in San Francisco, said Charles Frankel, the company's director of community support. The company has also given $25,000 grants to start programs in the other cities.
 
Class Consciousness
 But the program's use of affluent private schools instead of public schools has raised concerns among some of Summerbridge's teachers.
"I don't know that by bringing them to a private school we are sending a message that says, 'See what you can have if you work hard,' or 'See what you can never have,' " said a teacher in the New York program, Michelle Celestine, who will be a senior this fall at the University of California at Berkeley, majoring in English. "That's something the national office should look into."
Mrs. Loofbourrow, however, responds that students need to learn about the economic divide. Others, like Mr. Frankel, say the program is intended to give students not only an academic jump-start but also exposure to an economic level to which they should aspire. "That's what this program is all about," he said.
About 75 percent of Summerbridge's national enrollment of 1,000 students this summer come from poor neighborhoods in the cities in which it operates. Generally, the students the program chooses are those who perform well on standardized tests but who have difficulties in the classroom.
The response from students is usually overwhelming. Summerbridge in New York received 170 applications and enrolled about 60 students this summer. Neither the students nor the teachers receive credit for their work, but for many the experience is enough.
"It is much different from my school," said Douglas Cajas, a 14-year-old completing his second summer in the San Francisco program. "The academics are harder, but that's good."
Douglas, who will enter a private college-preparatory school this fall, came to Summerbridge last summer to work on his writing. Last year, he said, he had difficulty composing a simple paragraph, let alone writing and organizing an essay. Although he says his writing still needs work, Douglas said that he could now put together a competent essay, and that his confidence has soared as his abilities have improved.
 
Small Classes and Innovation
 Much of the program's success stems from the small size of the classes and the innovative way lessons are taught.
At the Riverdale Country School, Nika Lee, a freshman at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, divides her six students into two teams and conducts a French class as if it were a game show. To choruses of good-natured laughter, students help each other produce the correct response as they practice greetings and basic commands in French.
"I've learned that school can be fun," said Sandra Gutara, a 12-year-old who is taking Ms. Lee's French class and who will enter the seventh grade this fall at St. Philip Neri in the Bronx. "After all we've done here, it's going to be hard to go back to regular school."
For many of the student teachers, Summerbridge has been an educational nirvana. The days are long, usually 14 hours, but the experience of teaching and drawing up their own curriculums far outweighs the low pay, said many of the teachers.
Like their students, they have to apply for admission to the program, describing how they would design a course or a curriculum around that course. Their progress is monitored by teachers who work in the private schools where the program is held and who, in many cases, were once Summerbridge teachers themselves.
"The kids teach you about yourself," said Nancy Nagramada, 20, who is teaching for a second summer at Summerbridge in New Orleans. "They teach you what your limits are and where you need to grow as a teacher."
Themselves not much older than their students, the teachers say it is easier for them to recall their own adolescence and what it was like for them in school. Most recall their middle-school years as relentlessly boring and so are determined to present invigorating lessons.
In her class this summer, for instance, Ms. Nagramada taught her students how the heart works by drawing the organ on a large piece of paper, putting it on the ground and then telling her students to walk through the chambers of the heart pretending they were blood cells. Last year, it took two days of classroom lectures before her students learned the information; this year, using the walk-through method, she said, her young charges knew the material in 30 minutes.
"It proved to me that learning occurs more quickly by experiencing," said Ms. Nagramada, who plans to attend Hunter College in New York this fall to major in education. "The best thing you can do for these kids is don't give them any label of any sort and give them your time and your love and to let them know they matter."

HEADLINE: A Last Resort In College Aid: The Kindness Of Strangers

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

 BODY:
It was another turn-down day at the Andriekus home outside Lansing, Mich. In the mail was a bill for $9,999, one semester's tuition and housing at the University of Pennsylvania, where 16-year-old Amy E. Andriekus had been, to her unanticipated delight, accepted.
Also in the mail the same day last week was a standard rejection letter from former President Ronald Reagan, one of more than 800 people to whom Miss Andriekus has written to ask for contributions after Penn told her that the only financial aid she will get is a $2,500 loan. 
 Although soliciting donations was an unusual response to her financial emergency, Miss Andriekus is a good example of the middle-class squeeze that so infuriates families today.
Her father, Paul, is an assembly line electrician at General Motors. Her mother, Martha, is a paraprofessional in the local schools. Their total annual income last year was $58,892 and her brother, Kenny, will also start college in the fall, at Lansing Community College.
"We never thought of ourselves as rich," said Miss Andriekus, who graduated from Waverly High School with a grade point average of 3.99 out of a possible 4.0. She said her family cannot afford to pay more than $20,000 a year to put her through the Wharton School at Penn. Penn essentially disagreed. The differing views reflect a common clash that is also a continuing source of middle-class anger.
 
More Aid Than Ever
 Penn and other expensive universities offer more financial aid than ever, but it goes to the most disadvantaged students. Amy and her parents are willing to pay a big part of the cost of a college degree, but they do not believe they should have to deplete their life savings to do so.
The situation is complicated by the fact that Amy has other choices. She has been accepted at the University of Michigan, which costs less than $10,000 a year, and has been offered a $6,500-a-year scholarship at Alma College in Alma, Mich., where the total annual cost is about $16,000.
She said she is determined to go to Wharton because it is the best place to study economics, no matter the cost. Using her mother's computer, she typed out a spunky letter describing her thrill at being accepted and her disappointment about the financial obstacles.
 
'Beginning of a Journey'
 "In the course of human events," she wrote, unself-consciously borrowing a phrase, "there always seems to be thrown in the path of those who endeavor to make their life eventful, rewarding, and meaningful for the betterment of others, that one rock, which blocks their way. I have hit that rock."
She spent the first weeks of her summer vacation writing to 800 company executives from the Fortune 500, former United States Presidents, newspaper and magazine editors and anybody else who could give her the money to pay for her education. She plans to send a total of 1,000 letters.
So far, 85 have come back with polite rejections. The only positive response came from Harper's Magazine, which plans to publish an edited version of her letter in its September issue, and pay her a $75 fee.
She has until Aug. 6 to pay her first semester bill if she is to attend Penn in September.
Miss Andriekus said she feels betrayed by Penn. When she visited last November, an official told her that if she got accepted Penn would make sure she could afford to be there. The problem for the Andriekus family and many others of middle income is defining what affordable means.
"What usually happens is not an income problem," said William M. Schilling, director of student financial aid at Penn. "It is a problem of family expectations."
Mrs. Andriekus said she and her husband had saved for their children's education, often spending vacations at home and doing without fancy clothes.
Last year, when interest rates dropped, they put most of the money into stocks. Along with savings, this produces about $11,000 a year in interest and dividends.
Mr. Schilling cannot discuss an individual student's finances, but he said that universities consider stock holdings to be at least partially available for education, even if they must be sold at a loss.
Mrs. Andriekus also said that her husband considers it his moral obligation to provide the same help to each of his children, even though Amy's bills at Penn would exceed $20,000 a year and Kenny's bills at Lansing Community College will be just over $5,000.
The Andriekuses are giving each child $10,000 a year. But under the formula used by Penn and other universities, the family contribution for Kenny would be the cost of his education; the rest would go to Amy.
 
Father Strives to Be Fair
 "My father wouldn't do that," Miss Andriekus said. "It's not fair." She said Kenny will put the unused portion of his money toward completing his last two years at a four-year college.
Mr. Schilling said that universities cannot be swayed by a family's values. "Families make a lot of choices, and we can't necessarily consider all those choices in what we're doing," he said.
Miss Andriekus has tried everything she could think of. General Motors has scholarships for minority students but not for her. Her father was born in Lithuania, but Lithuanian aid societies said she was not Lithuanian enough: her grandfather was born in the United States.
Mrs. Andriekus has even considered writing to Japanese automobile companies and offering to let them put Amy in a commercial saying the Japanese helped her when General Motors would not.
"My kids mean more to me than supporting my husband's employer," she said. "If they can't help me and a foreign company can, well, hey. You know?"

Profits Up at Citicorp and 3 Other Big Banks

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Citicorp, recovering from loan losses that all but wiped out its profits in the last two years, said yesterday that it earned $171 million in the second quarter, up from $11 million a year earlier.
The improvement at Citicorp, the nation's largest banking company, was similar to recent earnings reports by many other banks. While increases in loans to individuals and businesses have been meager at most banks, the industry's profits have improved, thanks to reduced losses from bad loans, a widening spread between interest rates paid to depositors and those charged borrowers, and cost cutting. 
 Among other large banking companies, the Chemical Banking Corporation said cost savings resulting from its merger with the Manufacturers Hanover Corporation were accumulating faster than expected and helped raise its profit 20 percent, to $240 million.
In California, where the downturn in real estate prices came later than in other parts of the country, the Wells Fargo Corporation of San Francisco announced an unexpected increase in delinquent and other troubled loans. Although Wells earned $82 million, up nearly sixfold from $14 million a year ago, its loan problems led some analysts to reduce their earnings estimates, and caused Well's stock to fall $2.50, to $70.75 a share, on the New York Stock Exchange.
The Banc One Corporation of Columbus, Ohio, the nation's most active acquirer of other banks, reported a 30 percent gain in profits to $181 million. Its record as one of the nation's most profitable banks enabled Banc One to increase its quarterly dividend to 32 cents a share from 29 cents, and lifted its stock price enough to make it easier for it to buy other banks by issuing new shares.
Following are details of the banking companies' results:
 
Citicorp
 Citicorp's second-quarter profit, equal to 32 cents a share, raised the banking company's profit for the first half of the year to $354 million, or 69 cents a share, from $104 million, or 5 cents a share, in last year's first half. Second-quarter profits were reduced by a special charge of $95 million related to various cost-cutting programs.
While Citicorp's profits are on the mend, the banking company still needs a substantial decline in troubled loans to begin earning profits commensurate with its size. Citicorp's earnings, for example, were equal to only 31 cents per $100 of assets, compared with 70 cents at Chemical and $1.52 at Banc One.
"Citicorp is over the worst of its loan problems, but they remain at a very high level," said Thomas Hanley, a banking analyst at First Boston. Still, now that Citicorp has reduced expenses and seems committed to keeping a lid on future increases, Mr. Hanley said, "their earnings can really explode late next year and in 1994," assuming that problems with bad loans subside by then.
In the second quarter, Citicorp wrote off as a loss $705 million of business loans (including $100 million to Olympia & York Developments), and $784 million of consumer loans. Combined, those figures were down slightly from the first quarter. Although Citicorp's biggest problem, losses from commercial real estate loans in North America, rose to $355 million, from $108 million a year ago, Citicorp officials say they expect losses from bad loans to subside in the second half of this year.
Citicorp has continued to gradually increase the size of its reserve for loan losses it expects in the future. That reserve was increased by $181 million in the second quarter, and is now $900 million greater than a year ago. Reserves for losses on loans to less-developed countries continue to be reduced in light of new agreements with main borrowers like Brazil and Argentina.
Other parts of Citicorp's business are faring better. The consumer banking business, which includes credit cards and branch banking, earned $234 million in the second quarter, up 34 percent from a year ago.
The corporate finance business, called global finance at Citicorp, earned $294 million, in contrast to a $10 million loss a year ago.
 
Chemical Banking
 At Chemical Bank, the second-quarter profit equaled 83 cents a share. Per-share profit was reduced because the company sold 57.5 million additional shares earlier this year.
Walter Shipley, president of the company, said that savings this year from the merger of Chemical and Manufacturers Hanover were expected to total $280 million, up from the company's previous estimate of $225 million. The two companies expect to begin closing more that 70 branches in the New York area during October. By 1995 they expect savings from the merger, mostly through the elimination of about 6,200 jobs, to exceed $750 million.
Much of the improvement at Chemical came from the increase in the spread between interest rates it pays depositors and the rates it charges borrowers. That spread was 3.69 percentage points in the second quarter, up from 3.16 percent a year ago.
Chemical's holdings of delinquent loans and or real estate acquired through foreclosure increased $95 million during the quarter to $5.1 billion. The company wrote off $345 million of loans as a loss, and added an equal amount to its reserve against future losses.
 
Wells Fargo
Wells Fargo's earnings of $82 million, or $1.33 a share, were up from $11 million, or 21 cents a share, a year earlier.
Carl E. Reichart, the chairman, blamed the weak California economy, noting that "loan demand remains weak, and asset quality is slow to recover."
Wells said that its holdings of badly delinquent loans, or loans so troubled that they are not expected to be repaid in full, totaled $2.33 billion, up from $2.068 billion March 31. The company charged off as a loss $184 million of bad loans and provided $300 million to its loan-loss reserve, increasing the reserve by $116 million.
 
Banc One
The Banc One Corporation, whose emphasis on consumer and small business lending enabled it to aovid the worst of the loan problems that have plagued other banks, remains one of the nation's most profitable banks.
First-quarter earnings were equal to 87 cents a share, compared with 70 cents in last year's first quarter. Nonperforming assets, either badly troubled loans or property acquired through foreclosure, fell to $621 million, from $644.5 million on March 31.

HEADLINE: Banks' Rates On Deposits Drop Again

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Banks and savings institutions across the country continued to reduce interest rates on consumer deposits in the last week, though the declines were smaller than earlier in the month.
Even though some bankers have been worried that already-low rates may make it difficult to impose still lower ones on their customers, data compiled by The Bank Rate Monitor show that many banks have for the first time moved below 3 percent for three-month and six-month certificiates of deposit. Rates of less than 3 percent on money market accounts were already common. 
 Bank deposit rates have been falling for more two years and in some cases are half the level they were a year ago. In the Treasury bill market, a benchmark used by banks in setting their rates, new three-month bills sold Monday at an average rate of 3.16 percent, down from 3.22 percent a week earlier and 5.60 percent a year ago.
The most recent round of rate cuts quickly followed the move on July 2 by the Federal Reserve to reduce interest rates, and the banks' own move to reduce their prime lending rate by half a percentage point, to 6 percent.
In general, each half-point cut in the prime means rates paid on deposits fall by 25- to 33-hundredths of a percentage point. Robert Heady, editor of The Bank Rate Monitor, noted that the cut in rates seems to have occurred more quickly this month, rather than being spread over the usual span of six weeks or so.
In the New York City area, the average rate paid by commercial banks on money market accounts fell to 2.88 percent on July 21 from 2.90 percent a week earlier and 3.09 percent before the latest round of interest rate cuts.

HEADLINE: Europe Caught in Crosscurrents

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, July 20

 BODY:
Germany's stubborn determination to place its fight against inflation before any concessions to spurring a European economic recovery is causing increasing political tensions across the Continent.
Indeed, a worrying question is now pressing with increasing insistence on Europe's governments: could the high cost of unifying Germany, which is fueling the country's unfamiliar problem with inflation and leading it to impose high interest rates, cause such resentment elsewhere that Europe's drive for unity will stall? 
 The catalyst for the recent sharp falls in stock markets, as well as the weakness of the dollar, was the German Bundesbank's decision Thursday to raise a key interest rate. The central bank's action was its latest attempt to stanch inflationary pressure stemming from the unexpectedly high costs of absorbing the economy of the former East Germany.
But the decision also underscored Europe's fundamental economic paradox: its biggest economy, Germany, is taken up with fending off the specter of high inflation that unification has brought, while other nations like Britain are looking to stimulate their recession-hit economies through cuts in interest rates.
Tension is rising over this split just as Europe is trying to move toward greater economic union through ratification of the Maastricht Treaty, which calls for a single European currency by 1999. The threat, in the view of several economists and political analysts, is that Maastricht and European union could be the victims of the growing rancor that Germany's economic problems are causing.
High interest rates attract investment money, and thus usually strengthen a nation's currency. So the high German rates, which tend to bolster the mark, virtually compel other European countries to raise their rates because the European Monetary System obligates members to maintain their currencies within a narrow exchange-rate band.
The German decision last week has thus convinced many that the stagnation in Europe will continue because the current high cost of money discourages investment and spending. Reckoning that corporate earnings will be hurt by the continued slowdown, a selloff on stock markets began.
The dollar also suffered because United States interest rates are at their lowest levels in 30 years while German rates are at their highest since World War II. Low interest rates in the United States discourage people from buying dollars when they can get a much higher return on their money in Europe.
The popularity of the idea of European unity is being battered by these economic tensions just as France prepares for a crucial referendum on the Maastricht Treaty on Sept. 20.
The problem facing Europe is that Germany, with its particular phobia over inflation stemming from its experiences with hyperinflation earlier in this century, is unlikely to be budged from its present course in the near future.
"We cannot accept that others push us around on interest rates," said George Grosche, a senior official at the German Finance Ministry. "We have a temporary problem right now with our huge transfers to the East, and we have to keep our belts tightened."
An estimated 180 billion marks -- about $121.6 billion -- will be transferred to eastern Germany this year, increasing the German budget deficit and stimulating inflationary pressure.
 
A Hangover From the 20's
 "We don't like inflation," said Klaus Friedrich, the chief economist for Dresdner Bank. "Germans are still somewhat shaped by the hyperinflation of the 1920's."
But as Germany pursues its stubborn course, others are beginning to suggest that the current situation offers a foretaste of a European monetary union, as laid out in the Maastricht Treaty, that is neither desirable nor possible.
If other European economies already feel burdened by the yoke of German policy, the argument goes, how much worse will it be when the envisioned single currency creates an even tighter bond with the Continent's biggest economy?
Already, several leading economists in Britain have suggested in the last week that the country should leave the European Monetary System so that Britain will have the flexibility to cut interest rates by as much as two percentage points to stimulate the economy. Up to now, Prime Minister John Major has firmly resisted such calls.
In France, the current German policy is increasingly being portrayed as the harbinger of what life would be like under the European central bank envisioned by the Maastricht Treaty. The treaty's insistence on low inflation and low budget deficits is being vociferously criticized as little more than a Bundesbank-dictated recipe for further deflation at a time when a slump already exists.
 
Attacking the Treaty
 "The criteria of Maastricht, imposed by the Bundesbank, are contrary to all good sense," a former Socialist minister, Jean-Pierre Chevenement, wrote in Le Monde last week. "How many million more unemployed people will have to pay for the blindness of European technocrats in the service of financial capital?"
Already, the proportion of opponents of Maastricht in France has surged in recent weeks to 42 percent from 35 percent, according to one survey. A French rejection of Maastricht would kill the treaty and probably create turmoil as markets reassess the future of European integration.
A fear of such a fragmentation appears to many to lurk behind the current nervousness afflicting investors. Optimists believe Europe can keep on track while Germany gets its domestic problems under control. But the camp of the pessimists is growing.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Securities Little Changed

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Congressional testimony by the Federal Reserve Board chairman, Alan Greenspan, contained few surprises for the credit markets yesterday, and prices of Treasury securities were little changed.
In his remarks, Mr. Greenspan expressed confidence that the economy was expanding and that a sustainable recovery would be under way soon. This echoed the views he presented to the Senate Banking Committee a year ago, and again in February. 
 By law, the chairman of the Federal Reserve is required to testify before Congress semiannually on the economy and monetary policy. Mr. Greenspan will go before a subcomittee of the House Banking Committee today.
For a day at least, traders interpreted his remarks to mean that the Fed has finished easing monetary policy.
"He didn't say anything unexpected, but on balance it doesn't seem to be good news for the front end" of the maturity spectrum, one government securities trader said. "And in these politically uncertain times, nobody wants to buy bonds."
Meanwhile, some economists said they were disappointed that Mr. Greenspan was not asked how surprisingly bad June economic data fit into his mildly optimistic outlook.
 
Fed Raises Its Forecast
 Reflecting a rosier view, the Fed raised its 1992 growth estimates to a range of 2.25 percent to 2.75 percent, from the 1.75 percent to 2.50 percent range it forecast in February.
But some economists wondered if the weaker June numbers were reflected in the forecast presented yesterday by Mr. Greenspan. Some noted that the Fed met to prepare its forecast before June employment data were released earlier this month.
"I think June represented a rather dramatic event in the development of this recovery, because with the exception of car sales none of the numbers pointed in the direction of recovery, " said David H. Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities International Inc. "Private sector forecasts have been lowered dramatically since those numbers came out."
Joseph Coyne, a Fed spokesman, said Fed governors and bank presidents had the option of revising their forecasts after the June employment data were released. He said he did not know how many had chosen to exercise that option or how it might have affected the forecast.
 
Long Bonds Up Slightly
 In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 29 1/2-year bonds of 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 103 31/32, up 1/32, to yield 7.65 percent, unchanged from late Monday.
Among outstanding Treasury note issues, the 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 104 14/32, up 5/32, to yield 6.86 percent. The 6 3/8 percent five-year notes were offered at 102 17/32, up 3/32, to yield 5.77 percent. And the 5 percent two-year notes were offered at 101 11/32, down 1/32, to yield 4.26 percent.
The sense that monetary policy is on hold pushed up rates on short-term Treasury bills.
Three-month bills were offered late yesterday at a discount rate of 3.18 percent, up 4 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates rose by 2 basis points, to a late offered rate of 3.24 percent.
A number of issues were priced in the investment-grade and tax-exempt municipal bond markets.
 
Utility Sells Notes
 By far the biggest issuer was the Tennessee Valley Authority, which offered a total of $1.25 billion worth of seven-year and 10-year notes at competitive bid. The sale was the largest competitive bid offering ever by an American utility company.
Bids from a group led by Goldman, Sachs & Company won both parts of the offering.
The seven-year securities were reoffered to investors with a 6.25 percent coupon at a price of $98.47 to yield 6.526 percent, 15 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 percent seven-year notes at the time of pricing.
The 10-year notes were reoffered with a 6 7/8 percent coupon at a price of $98.585 to yield 7.075 percent, 19 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing.
In the asset-backed securities market, FCC National Bank, a subsidiary of the First Chicago Corporation, priced $1 billion worth of certificates backed by credit card receivables through underwriters led by the First Boston Corporation.
The securities, which have an average expected life of 5.07 years, carry a 6 1/4 percent coupon and were priced to yield 6.353 percent, 55 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 6 3/8 percent five-year notes at the time of pricing.
The securities are rated AAA by both Moody's Investors Service and the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
 
New York Refunding Bonds
 An offering of more than $372 million worth of New York State general-obligation refunding bonds was well received by investors.
Yields on the serial bonds sold range from 3.0 percent in 1993 to 4.90 percent in 1997, 5.75 percent in 2002, 6.05 percent in 2007 and 6.15 percent on bonds maturing from 2010 to 2015.
Merrill Lynch & Company acted as lead manager for the negotiated sale.
The bonds are rated A by Moody's and A- by Standard & Poor's.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, traders said prices of most issues were unchanged.
Participants in the tax-exempt municipal bond market said prices of most widely quoted securities had risen by an eighth of a point to a quarter of a point.

McElligott Wright Unravels In Full View of the Industry

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
AN AGENCY founded with much promise less than two years ago is floundering amid conflicts and unusually public squabbling involving its partners.
McElligott Wright Morrison White, a creatively focused shop in Minneapolis with billings estimated at $30 million, is quickly coming apart in the wake of disagreements among its four principals: Tom McElligott, chairman, chief executive and creative director; Tony Wright, president; John Morrison, associate creative director, and Rob White, director of planning. 
 How McElligott Wright fares is being closely watched not only by its employees and clients, but also by the many people in advertising who have followed Mr. McElligott's career since the talented copywriter helped craft memorable campaigns for Porsche and Lee jeans. To them, the agency's fate typifies the promises and the enormous pitfalls inherent in that most courageous and foolish of moves: the entrepreneurial agency start-up.
"We may be seeing the passing of the phenomenon of the agency built around the cult of a personality," Tom Weyl, president and chief creative officer of Martin/Williams Advertising, said in a telephone interview yesterday from Minneapolis, where his agency and McElligott Wright are tenants in the same office building.
"Maybe there's something to be said for the venerable names of Batten, Barton, Durstine and Osborn," he added, referring to the long-ago founders of the giant BBDO agency. "Nobody's seen them for a long time."
The latest development in the implosion of McElligott Wright came yesterday, when Andy Berlin, president of DDB Needham New York, said that Mr. Wright and Mr. Morrison were in discussions to join his agency in Manhattan.
"We're very excited about the possibility of doing something with them," Mr. Berlin added, confirming recent reports in Adweek. "But it is still only a possibility at this point."
Regarding Adweek's speculation that Mr. Morrison and Mr. Wright were seeking to bring clients and employees of McElligott Wright with them, Mr. Berlin said, "They need to determine what is precisely in the best interests of their clients and their careers."
Among the agency's clients are The Washington Post and the Easy Spirit footwear line of the U.S. Shoe Corporation; one client, the Ringer Corporation, a maker of pesticides, has said it will probably put its $5 million account into review.
Candace Medd, The Post's director of circulation marketing, said the newspaper would "provide whichever agency they affiliate with the opportunity to give us a creative capabilities presentation."
Bob Burton, a spokesman for U.S. Shoe in Cincinnati, said, "We have found their work to be good, and we are waiting to see what their longer-term plans are before making any decision."
As for those plans, Mr. White, in a telephone interview, said that negotiations among the partners and Claire Canavan, the agency's former director of finance and administration, were nearly completed.
"We are trying to come to an agreement among all five partners, in an amicable and constructive manner, on how the agency should proceed," he added. "And we're making definite progress."
Mr. White said that "family reasons prevent me from moving to New York," and that he was in discussions with shops like Fallon McElligott, the other agency in Minneapolis that Mr. McElligott helped to co-found.
McElligott Wright's end would write an abrupt and disappointing finish to a tale that began with ambitious expectations in September 1990, when the executives, who had worked at agencies like Fallon McElligott, Chiat/Day/Mojo and Goodby, Berlin & Silverstein, opened their own shop.
"By all standards, it's been successful in new business," Mr. Weyl said, though he added that perhaps "the big, quality, choice clients you daydream about didn't come knocking," like American Isuzu Motors or Mercedes-Benz. (Guy Day, who was named vice chairman of McElligott Wright a year ago, as the agency competed with four other finalists to land the Isuzu account, left after the car maker selected Goodby, Berlin.)
Lee Lynch, chairman and chief executive of Carmichael Lynch in Minneapolis, said that although the McElligott Wright partners "had worked together, they had never been in business with each other before."
He added, "Partnerships generally show the most stress in the first two years."
Mr. Weyl also cited the current economic climate as "really a tough time" to start an agency, a task that is challenging enough during a flush economy. He said, "When you think of all the success a guy like McElligott has had -- he's won more awards than many large agencies -- it's probably pretty damn hard to do over again."
It was while Mr. McElligott was away from the office last month, serving as a judge at the International Advertising Film Festival in Cannes, that he was the subject of what he called a "palace coup." The next three weeks brought charges and countercharges that confused and dismayed industry executives.
"I hate to see something unravel like that in public," said Patrick R. Fallon, chairman of Fallon McElligott, who co-founded that agency with Mr. McElligott and a third partner, Nancy Rice, in 1981. "It's not good for the business."

HEADLINE: Pepsico Profit Climbs 20.4%

 BODY:
Led by a strong performance at a revitalized Frito-Lay, Pepsico Inc.'s second-quarter profits jumped 20.4 percent, the company said yesterday. The beverage and restaurant businesses also had solid gains.
Profit for the quarter was $383 million, or 48 cents a share, compared with $318.3 million, or 39 cents a share, for the corresponding quarter last year. Sale rose 11.6 percent, to $5.21 billion, compared with $4.68 billion. 
 Operating profits for snack foods jumped 23 percent, and the beverage and restaurant operations each had profit gains of 15 percent.
Earnings were at the high end of analysts' expectations, and Pepsico's share price gained $1.125 to close at $36.75 on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday.
"The key to the quarter was Frito-Lay," said Martin Romm, an analyst at First Boston. "The momentum is back at Pepsi."
Analysts said Pepsi should return to its traditional 20 percent annual profit growth this year after an off year in 1991.
In a weak economy, the snack-food unit's shipments in the United States increased by 7 percent. Domestic beverage sales grew 11 percent, although the company said June volume fell below last year's levels.
Profits jumped 50 percent at Kentucky Fried Chicken. The gain was attributed to cost-cutting in the United States and improved volume.
Pizza Hut did not fare as well, with operating profits inching up 2 percent.

Capital Cities Net Up 15.4% In Quarter

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
Capital Cities/ABC Inc., the giant broadcasting and publishing company, said yesterday that its net income for the second quarter rose 15.4 percent, to $147.5 million, or $8.84 a share, compared with $127.8 million, or $7.60 a share, in the corresponding quarter a year earlier.
Revenues for the quarter increased 2.2 percent, to $1.39 billion, from $1.36 billion in the corresponding quarter of 1991. 
 Capital Cities said a number of one-time factors had affected earnings. The results for the latest quarter included a gain on the sale of the company's interests in Tele-5, a German television network. That was partly offset by losses for the disposal of real estate in New York City and the write-down of certain other nonoperating assets. The net result of these items was a pretax gain of $24.9 million. Without this gain, quarterly earnings per share would have been $8.16.
 
'A Difficult Environment'
 David Londoner, who follows the company for Wertheim & Company, said: "It is not a bad performance considering what a difficult environment it is. The stock is down slightly." The shares lost $5 each yesterday to close at $441 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Mr. Londoner added: "I think people are focusing on relatively flat unit prices to marginally up for advertising in the upfront season. There had been some expectation that prices would be up 2 percent to 3 percent." The up-front season is the period of advance sales of advertising for the coming fall television season.
The broadcasting operations continued to suffer from the recessionary environment, the company said.
Total operating income was $268.8 million, a gain of 8 percent from the 1991 period, with broadcasting increasing 3 percent. Earnings for the ABC television network showed a modest increase, largely because the comparable quarter last year had included a charge for staff reductions.

Sears Posts 15.5% Gain In Earnings

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
Sears, Roebuck & Company yesterday reported a robust 15.5 percent increase in earnings in the second quarter, despite a 50 percent plunge in income from its retail operations.
Overall earnings climbed to $345.8 million, or 90 cents a share, from $299.4 million, or 87 cents a share, during the comparable quarter last year. Total sales rose slightly to $14.27 billion from $14.09 billion. 
 But the company's retail business has failed to regain its footing, in spite of strenuous cost-cutting efforts that have eliminated about 45,000 jobs and are expected to save $840 million this year and $940 million in 1993.
The company said earnings in the merchandising group were $78.5 million, compared with $156.9 million a year earlier. Sales for the group continued to slip, dropping 1.1 percent in the second quarter to $7.57 billion from $7.65 billion during the similar period last year.
"What is surprising about the merchandise group is that despite massive adjustments to its cost structure, and to its pricing structure, they appear to be losing market share and profitability as fast as ever," said Edward A. Weller, an analyst at Montgomery Securities in San Francisco.
 
Insurance Unit Does Well
 Sears's Allstate Insurance group cushioned the impact of declining retail sales and earnings. Its earnings jumped 68.3 percent, to $235.3 million, from $139.8 million in the second quarter of last year, thanks to increased income from its property and casualty underwriting and growth in investment income.
While Sears's second-quarter performance was fairly close to analysts' estimates, many of them were surprised by the steep decline in retail income. They said the performance of Sears stores and catalogues must improve to give the company's stock a jolt.
Edward A. Brennan, Sears's chairman and chief executive, attributed the merchandise group's problems to the weak economy and increased competition that whittled away at profit margins. He also noted that the company had planned for a decrease in revenues from its catalogue. It spent $20.2 million to close counters in its stores where customers could pick up catalogue merchandise.
N. Richard Nelson Jr., an analyst at Duff & Phelps in Chicago, said he was keeping his estimate of Sears's 1992 earnings at $4.25 a share. "But my estimate might prove to be too high unless things get better in the merchandising group," he said.
Mr. Nelson and other analysts expect Sears's retail business to improve during the second half of this year, partly because its earnings last year during that period were so depressed.

The Dollar Is Mostly Lower After Greenspan Comments

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar was mostly lower yesterday after the Federal Reserve Board chairman, Alan Greenspan, gave no indication that the Fed planned further moves to support the United States currency.
Gold fell to $357.60 a troy ounce on the Commodity Exchange in New York, down $1.50 from Monday's close. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid of $357.50, off $1.20 from Monday. 
 The dollar rose in cautious European dealings yesterday after the Fed and other central banks intervened on Monday to help support the sagging currency. The dollar even bounced a bit as Mr. Greenspan told a Congressional committee that a weak dollar would not help with the coming recovery from the recession.
Analysts said the market did not get the reassurance it wanted from Mr. Greenspan that the Fed would support the dollar.
Mr. Greenspan's testimony "didn't have a big impact on the market, actually," said Arnold Sherrer, chief trader for the Royal Bank of Canada in New York.
Analysts noted that the Fed and other central banks did not return to the market yesterday. Traders interpreted their absence as a sign that the dollar could be nudged lower.
By the close in New York, the dollar fell to 1.4870 against the German mark, down from 1.4935 at Monday's close. Earlier in Europe, the dollar rose to 1.4880 marks, up from 1.4825 late Monday.
The dollar closed in New York at 125.25 Japanese yen, down from 125.45 yen Monday. In Tokyo overnight, the dollar closed at 125.12 yen, up 0.51 yen. In London, the dollar was quoted at a higher rate of 125.30 yen.

HEADLINE: GTE Earnings Up by 13.2%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn., July 21

 BODY:
The GTE Corporation today reported a 13.2 percent jump in second-quarter earnings on continued growth in its telephone operations and cellular-mobile phone businesses.
Income from continuing operations rose to a record $446 million, or 49 cents a share, compared with $394 million, or 44 cents a share, in the second quarter last year. Earnings per share rose 11 percent. 
 "GTE continues to perform very well despite a soft economy," said Charles R. Lee, GTE chairman. "The long-term strategic-positioning steps taken by GTE over the past several years are generating positive results, while at the same time improving our competitive position."
Consolidated revenues and sales rose 4 percent, to $5.06 billion in the quarter, compared with $4.85 billion in the second quarter last year.
For the first half of 1992, income was $873 million, or 96 cents a share, compared with $591 million, or 65 cents a share, in the first six months of last year.
The 1991 results included a one-time net charge of $204 million, or 23 cents a share, in connection with GTE's merger with Contel and gain on transfer of certain cellular properties. Excluding the one-time charge from last year's results, earnings per share from continuing operations for the first half of 1992 increased 9 percent over 1991.
Consolidated revenues and sales from continuing operations were $9.89 billion for the first half of the year, compared with $9.54 billion for the first half of 1991.

HEADLINE: Root Beer: A Flood Of Memories, A Sip of Foam

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
GIVEN root-beer drinkers' fierce attachment to their beverage, it's the unwise brew master who dares to tamper with a recipe.
But fortunately, some slight adjustments have been made to accommodate modern palates. 
 "In the early days of root beer, some unscrupulous manufacturers would add soap to the formula to give it a bigger head," said Jesse Meyers, the publisher of Beverage Digest, a newsletter that reports on the doings of soft-drink makers. (When the giant soap maker, the Procter & Gamble Company, acquired Hires root beer in 1980, Mr. Meyers's report on the transaction carried the headline "Another Tide Outlet.")
Absent the soap, old-time root beer is enjoying a bit of a comeback these days. While the $48 billion soft-drink business is dominated by two corporate behemoths, the Coca-Cola Company and Pepsico Inc., root beer has been left largely to the province of a handful of smaller companies.
In much the same way that micro-breweries have sprung up in the shadows of assembly-line-produced beer, small root-beer makers, like Triple XXX in Houston and Cable Car Beverage Corporation in Denver, have sprung up between the cracks of the cola giants. And while the big cola companies, with their seemingly bottomless advertising budgets, have battled on the grounds of catchier sayings and sunnier life styles, root-beer companies seem united in their intent to sell their beverage as a nostalgic reminder of simpler times and summers past. Some root beers now come in old-fashioned brown bottles, with slogans like "Tastes like root beer used to taste" or "Taste the legend."
"It's an icon of a naive and innocent time," said Jane Stern, who, with her husband, Michael, chronicles the eating habits of Americans. "It's from a charming time."
Root beer is the only soft drink that people still brew at home, she said, adding that some Amish families make and sell their own root beer from roadside stands. "You don't see anybody advertising homemade colas or homemade 7 Up," she said.
Hires, a division of Cadbury Schweppes, of London, which acquired the company from Procter & Gamble in 1989, contends it is the oldest "continuously marketed" soft drink in the United States. According to the public relations archives at Hires in Stamford, Conn., the drink made its debut in 1876, when Charles E. Hires, a Philadelphia pharmacist, showed off his drink at the same Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition that displayed Alexander Graham Bell's telephone, the typewriter and H. J. Heinz's ketchup.
Root beer originally was brewed from a combination of 16 different wild roots and berries, including juniper, wintergreen and pipsissewa. Nowadays, most root beer is made in laboratories by flavor technicians, using extracts of roots, bark and berries.
A sip of it often evokes a flood of reminiscences.
"It's an elixir of fond memories," said Kim Feil, the product director of Hires. She said that people are often at a loss to describe the taste of root beer, but when they are asked what it reminds them of, she said: "Out tumble very personal memories. It's sort of like a serum."
Last year, Olga Whaley, from Middleburgh Heights, Ohio, received a brown bottle of Stewart's Original root beer from her son for her 75th birthday. She said that, after taking a sip, "I closed my eyes, and it was just like I was a kid again at Euclid Beach," an amusement park in Cleveland, where she grew up. Root beer was served on tap for a nickel a glass at the amusement park, she said. Once or twice a summer, her father, who worked in a quarry for a brick factory, took her and her four siblings to the park for root beer. "We saved our nickels," she said. "Those big foamy glasses of root beer -- that was the biggest treat we ever got."
Lee Lydick, the president of the Triple XXX root-beer company, said: "The nostalgia appeal of root beer is very strong. It is one of the key marketing elements."
Drinks like Stewart's Original, made by Cable Car Beverage Corporation, have found a ready audience. Based on the growing popularity of its root beer, Cable Car Beverage is one of the fastest-growing small publicly traded companies in the country. In 1989, Cable Car Beverage licensed the name and recipe from Stewart's Restaurants, a 68-year-old chain of drive-in stands, based in New Jersey.
The popularity of old-fashioned root beers has not escaped the few big companies that make and sell root beer. Hires recently introduced an old-fashioned long-neck bottle, using the same root beer it uses in its cans. After less than a year on the market, Hires' long necks account for nearly a third of the company's sales in some cities.
While large corporations often copy ideas that have been made successful by smaller, nimbler concerns, some bottlers rue the trend toward packaging root beer the old-fashioned way. It takes longer and costs more to fill a bottle instead of a can. Also, although some people find a bottle pleasing to sip from, bottles are much harder to ship and stack than a pallet of cans.
That makes Steve Sourapas, a Hires bottler from Seattle, not very enthusiastic about new old-fashioned bottles. "It's not a high-volume package," he said. "After a while, the economics get to you."
Such sentiments are a delight to Samuel Simpson, the president of Cable Car Beverage. "It's very difficult for the big guys to get root beer in the brown bottle," he said.
The nation's largest root-beer maker, A & W Brands Inc. of White Plains, tried and decided it was not worth the trouble. M. L. Lowenkron, who as the chairman of A & W is qualified to refer to himself as a root-beer maven, called the old-fashioned bottles "a clever marketing approach." A & W accounts for about a third of all the root beer sold in the country, Mr. Lowenkron said. Over all, he said, old-fashioned-style root beers make up an insignificant portion of the root-beer market.
And not all of the quaintly bottled concoctions are made in backyard breweries. I.B.C., which comes in bottles that look as if they were culled from antique stores, is made by a division of the Dr Pepper / Seven-Up Companies of Dallas.
Putting root beer in brown bottles dates back to Prohibition, when many brewers converted their idle plants to root-beer factories, using their inventories of brown beer bottles.
Pepsi has its toe in the root-beer waters with its Mug Old-Fashioned brand. Coke has all but ignored the market; its Ramblin' brand is sold in only a handful of cities.
People in the middle of the country drink far more root beer than people in the rest it, market researchers for Hires said. Pittsburgh is the root-beer-guzzling capital of the world, said Mr. Lowenkron, adding that he did not know why.
But colas still dominate the nation's taste, accounting for nearly 70 percent of all soft drinks consumed, according to figures compiled by John C. Maxwell Jr., a stock analyst with Wheat First Securities in Richmond. Lemon-lime drinks and drinks like Dr Pepper are next in popularity, with root beer beating out orange for fourth place.
Even though root-beer consumption is growing slowly and steadily, people these days often seem more interested in clear, sparkling fruity drinks.
Frank Armstrong, the chairman of the Monarch Company in Atlanta, which makes Dad's Root Beer, thinks he knows why. "It's not a yuppie drink," he said.


GRAPHIC: Eleven brands of root beer were tasted blind by Bryan Miller and Florence Fabricant. No diet root beers were included. In general, the tasters were looking for the satisfyingly rich, earthy, slightly resinous quality associated with old-fashioned root beer. Most were too sweet. The brands are listed alphabetically within each category.

HEADLINE: Wine Talk

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
A RESTAURANT with a couple thousand bottles of wine in its cellar is a serious restaurant. One with 20,000 or 30,000 is in the big leagues, oenologically speaking.
What does that make a place with about eight million bottles? It makes it Air France. 
 From the lordly Concorde en route to New York to a 747 over the Himalayas to a 737 on a quick hop to Geneva, wine is as much a part of Air France service as the fuel that gets the planes aloft. The airline is one of the largest purchasers of French wines. And only French wines; Napa Valley is not spoken here.
All airlines carry wine these days and most of what they serve, particularly in business and first classes, is good. But some of the stuff doled out in the back of the bus can be awful. The Air France list, however, really has no clunkers.
Of course, even with Air France, if you're shoehorned into economy and trying not to spill your pocket-size wine bottle into your blanquette de veau, you might debate that value. But that's the fun of flying.
Actually, eight million is pushing it a bit. Most of the bottles are quarter-bottles, sometimes called splits. They hold 18.75 centiliters, a fourth of what's in a standard 75-centiliter bottle. This year, Air France is buying 6.2 million of these splits.
The most popular wine with Air France passengers? Champagne. The airline is buying 360,000 full bottles and 1.7 million quarter bottles of Champagne this year.
About 135,000 bottles of premium reds and whites are stocked for first class and Concorde passengers; Le Club -- business class -- passengers are served 25-centiliter bottles, of which the airline buys about one million a year. And then there are 4.5 million of those little quarter bottles of red and white wines, all of them destined for economy passengers.
What you drink very much depends on where you sit. If you're on the Concorde or in first class elsewhere, you will be offered one or more of five different Champagnes: Dom Perignon 1985, Cuvee Louise Pommery 1987, Laurent-Perrier Cuvee Grand Siecle 1985, Krug Grande Cuvee and Mumm de Cramant. (These and other wines are sometimes subject to change, depending on availability.)
When it comes to Champagne, the Concorde is a glorious exercise in wretched -- but Gallic -- excess. Concorde-class passengers arriving at Charles de Gaulle Airport here for the regular 11 A.M. dash to New York are greeted by a sumptuous breakfast buffet, with red and white wine, Bloody Marys and two or three varieties of Champagne to wash it down.
On board, the Champagne resumes, now competing with iced vodka -- to go with the caviar, naturally.
There is no fooling around on the Concorde: no "discoveries," no wines from trendy new regions, none from unpronounceable grapes. Air France appears to believe that folks paying $1,000 an hour for the ride want to deal only with proved successes -- like themselves, presumably.
Among the four white Burgundies served on the Concorde are Chassagne-Montrachet premier cru "Les Vergers" 1989, and Chablis grand cru "Les Clos" 1990. Among the four red Burgundies: Corton grand cru 1986 and Echezeaux grand cru 1985. Red Bordeaux -- there are six -- include Chateau Grand-Puy-Ducasse 1982, Chateau Lascombes 1985 and Chateau Cantenac-Brown 1988. There are two Sauternes: Chateau Rieussec 1981 and 1982. Air France will buy 19,200 bottles of these quality wines this year just for its Concorde clients.
Not all wines are carried on every flight, and it's probably a good thing. The point of taking the Concorde from here to New York -- it lands at 8:45 A.M. -- is to get there in time for a full day's work. One shudders to think of a solid French businessman arriving at breakfast time, already befuddled by Corton-Charlemagne.
Passengers in first and business class on other Air France flights will be welcomed with one of half a dozen Champagnes, including Pol Roger Brut and Pommery Brut rose. First-class clients, like those on the Concorde, are exposed only to Burgundy and Bordeaux, but wines with a little less breed, perhaps, and an occasional minor vintage. For example, there is a Chablis premier cru "Vaillon" 1989 among the white Burgundies, but there are also a Puligny-Montrachet 1989 and a Meursault "Clos du Cromin" 1989.
The clarets illustrate this same thinking: Cantenac-Brown 1988 and Chateau Batailley 1986, and Lynch-Bages 1987, a lesser year. Air France is buying 115,000 bottles of these wines this year. Le Club's white Burgundy is actually from Macon, and its two reds from Morgon, in Beaujolais, and Mercurey from the Cote Chalonnais. The clarets are young and less well known. Among them: Chateaux Belgrave 1990 and Tour du Moulin 1986.
With Le Club the airline's buyers ventured afield, picking up a riesling from Alsace and reds from the southwest, a Cahors and a Bergerac.
There are around 14 different wines for economy passengers with, usually, two reds, two whites and a Champagne to choose among on any flight. The Champagne, in a screw-top quarter bottle, can be Pommery Brut Royale, Charles Heidsieck Brut Reserve or Veuve Clicquot Brut. The whites could be a Macon Villages and a simple Bordeaux blanc; the reds a Duboeuf Morgon from Beaujolais and a light Bordeaux rouge like a Chateau Beau-Mayne 1988. Wines from Cahors, Bergerac, Alsace and the Var may also appear.
With their wines, Air France passengers each year eat more than 20 tons of caviar, 20 tons of foie gras, 55 tons of smoked salmon, 100 tons of fresh salmon, 250 tons of butter and 130 tons of cheese. And these items just for the kitchens at DeGaulle and Orly, the two main Paris airports.
There is of course, no accounting for taste. For dieters, teetotalers and of course for gourmands who have partaken of a bit too much, there is mineral water -- Vittel, Volvic, Evian, Perrier and others.
Any old airline can serve good wine. Who but the French, though, would boast of serving 1.5 million gallons of bottled water every year?
 
TASTINGS
Rully 1989, Louis Jadot, Burgundy; about $15.
There are three well-known appellations in the Cotes Chalonnaise, a wine region at the southern end of the more famous Cote d'Or, the source of Burgundy's best wines. The three are Rully, Mercurey and Givry. The best known of the three is Mercurey, and indeed its wines are the best. For a long time, Rully was allowed to sell its red wines as Mercurey. When the Government stopped that, the growers turned to making sparkling Burgundy. After the passing of the vogue for sparkling Burgundy, most of it sweet, the growers concentrated on white wines. There are some good red Rullys around, however, and this is one of them. It's lighter than a Cote d'Or wine, of course, but it can hold its own with all but a few of the best Mercureys. The wine has body and true Burgundy flavor and the color is excellent. Good Burgundy at a good price is always a rare find. Not much of this wine is made; if you see it, don't pass it up.

Travel Books That Nourish a Vision

BYLINE: HERBERT MITGANG

 BODY:
It is generally more rewarding to read about someone else's travels than to hear about them (especially when there's a slide show). Vita Sackville-West had it right: "There is no greater bore than the travel bore. We do not in the least want to hear what he has seen in Hong Kong." But even seasoned travelers carry visions in their mental luggage: romantic encounters, unspoiled locales, recaptured youths, imagined historic times, and a good book can nourish the pursuit of those visions.
Here is a decidedly mixed handful of readable books that take the reader not only across but above the United States, as well as to the towns of Europe and the islands of Oceania. 
 AMERICAN PLACES: A Writer's Pilgrimage to 15 of This Country's Most Visited and Cherished Sites, by William Zinsser. (200 pages, HarperCollins. $20.) This inspiring guide includes places everyone means to go to some day, all described with the usual clarity of the author of "On Writing Well." A reader ticks off the well-known destinations: Mount Rushmore, Lexington and Concord, Niagara Falls, Yellowstone Park, the Alamo, Appomattox, Mount Vernon, Kitty Hawk, Disneyland, Rockefeller Center, Pearl Harbor. Then some unusual places: Mark Twain's Hannibal, Mo.; the Civil Rights Memorial in Montgomery, Ala.; Dwight D. Eisenhower's hometown, Abilene, Kan.; the lecture and adult educational center in Chautauqua, N.Y.
Mr. Zinsser personalizes each place, giving its history and adding his own keen observations. In Montgomery, he interviews Maya Lin, who designed both the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington and the Civil Rights Memorial; their conversation turns to the people who were killed during the civil rights movement. After speaking to park rangers, librarians and curators, Mr. Zinsser says, "The eloquence of the so-called ordinary man or woman is the most extraordinary resource waiting for any writer who goes looking for America."
THE CANNIBAL QUEEN: An Aerial Odyssey Across America, by Stephen Coonts. (Illustrated. 344 pages. Pocket Books. $22.) The novelist describes a flight with his 14-year-old son in a 1942 open-cockpit biplane across the United States. The plane, named "Cannibal Queen," was built as a trainer for the Royal Canadian Air Force, declared surplus, used for crop dusting, then bought by the author. He discovers that you can fly an airworthy plane anywhere in the country without a flight plan or anyone's permission.
From the perspective of his biplane looking down on Mount Rushmore, Mr. Coonts decides that his candidates for additional faces carved on the cliff are Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., "the two greatest Americans of this century."
AMERICA EATS, by Nelson Algren. (Illustrated. 123 pages. University of Iowa Press. $22.95) Anything by Nelson Algren deserves notice. This book, a rarity, was written in the late 1930's when the novelist worked with such writers as Saul Bellow and Richard Wright for the Illinois Writers Project, a branch of the New Deal Works Progress Administration. While researching the book, Algren traveled around the Midwest, wrote about what farmers were growing, cooks cooking, restaurants serving. It's a portrait of ethnic America, with recipes for Russian pancakes, Spanish eggplant, English scones, Hungarian goulash, Flemish booya ("30 pounds of ox tails, 10 pounds beef soup bones, 4 fat hens") and other hearty, cholesterol-packed eats.
Like his prose poem, "Chicago: City on the Make," this gustatory travel junket is pure Algren: "These are the blue plate specials, the streamlined steaks and the laborer's lunch pail, passed down an endless boarding-house table from a brave in buckskin to a blue-turbaned voyageur, from a coonskin Yankee to a drawling steamboatman, from a Negro fish-vendor to an Irish section hand."
ASTONISHING WORLD: Essays, by Barbara Grizzuti Harrison. (285 pages. Ticknor & Fields. $22.95.) This collection of essays includes sojourns in Tuscany, Sicily, Dubrovnik in Yugoslavia and Morocco, not to mention lively interviews with Gov. Mario M. Cuomo in Albany and Gore Vidal in Rome. Ms. Harrison, who never forgets that her roots are in the old Bensonhurst neighborhood of Brooklyn, is unafraid to allow her emotions to show through her observations.
"Shopping in Morocco has become for me a transaction almost as personal as sex," she writes. "The Astonishing World" continues the autobiographical style of her keen "Italian Days" and "The Islands of Italy."
THE HAPPY ISLES OF OCEANIA: Paddling the Pacific, by Paul Theroux. (528 pages. Putnam. $24.95.) The novelist and travel writer goes from Australia and New Zealand to Hawaii by way of Melanesia (the Solomon islands, Vanuatu, Fiji) and Polynesia (Tonga, Samoa, Tahiti, the Cook Islands, Easter Island). Because of an unexplained domestic crisis and a possible illness, he decides to get away from it all. So he packs a collapsible kayak, paddles around the islands, camps on an aboriginal reserve, hikes mountain trails and encounters natives and tourists in civilized Oceania.
He can be the toughest of travel writers: "When France has succeeded in destroying a few more atolls, when they have managed to make the islands glow with so much radioactivity that night is turned into day, when they have sold the rest of the fishing rights and depleted it of fish (already Tahiti and the surrounding islands have been overfished), when it has all been thoroughly plundered, the French will plan a great ceremony and grandly offer these unemployed and deracinated citizens in T-shirts and flip-flops their independence."
Mr. Theroux's sharp eye and tongue make his "Happy Isles of Oceania" a strong if not always cheerful reading adventure.

Helping Guests With the Answers

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
Pop sociology rides again. Barbara Walters is in the saddle tonight, whipping along eight attractive young men and women who have been selected to personify the 40 million or so Americans who were born in the 1970's.
Ms. Walters concedes at the start of "Twentysomething: What Happened to the American Dream?" that eight people can't speak for all those now in their 20's, but she adds that they can tell of "growing up, romance, sex, their hopes and fears and what the American dream means to them." All right. But she or her producers are evidently unwilling to settle for human interest; they want human interest with a social-science face. Despite her disavowal, Ms. Walters indulges in generational generalizing: "This is a generation that pursues the quality of life. They want time for family, friends, themselves. They want to enjoy life on their own terms." Unlike all other generations? 
 The show works this way: Ms. Walters tosses out a statistical snippet, and a guest confirms it. By age 20, the typical American has spent 23,000 hours in front of a television set; a woman admits cheerfully to being a television addict and there she is at home watching the tube. Recent graduates have been particularly hard hit by the recession; meet a woman who is looking for a job. Millions of women in their 20's are on welfare; see the unmarried mother caring for her baby.
So it goes. Ms. Walters spurs her guests with leading questions: "Don't you think you are kind of serious as a group?" And perhaps flattered or awed at being in the presence of so famous a personality or just courteous or trying to perform as expected on national television, someone always comes through: "I think we're terribly serious for 20." Noting that divorce became more common in the 1970's and 80's, Ms. Walters prods, "It may make you more afraid when you grow up in a family where you see divorce." "Right." Ms. Walters informs them, "You are pretty turned off with politicians." "Absolutely."
Disappointments keep popping up. Several of the young people, responding to hints from their hostess, ooze envy at past generations. For example, the fear of AIDS has taken some of the kick out of the famous sexual revolution. (That invites a discussion about the use of condoms, a sure-fire talk-show subject.) And there are references to lowered economic expectations.
Ms. Walters calls the twentysomething set, somewhat unoriginally, a lost generation. And the group is encouraged to advertise its moral superiority over what she dismisses as the me decade. She announces that this generation is more interested in "personal and fulfilling rewards" than in big salaries and big jobs, and, believe it or not, nobody proudly declares they are out mainly for the buck. A man who makes television commercials clucks that in the 80's "money became the end instead of the means to the end."
The only safe generalizations from this exercise are that most groups are inclined to feel put upon and if given an opportunity will let the world in on their discontents. The one married man present tells of the burden of paying back big school loans and meeting all the other bills of a growing family. A black bank executive says he has to work harder than whites to win respect. The welfare mother tells of the difficulties of working her way off welfare.
Any of these conditions might make for an illuminating hour. But Ms. Walters, like a schoolteacher determined to obtain the answers set down in her curriculum guide, elicits uplifting cliches. She asks what her sample would most like viewers to know about their generation. An A to the man who answers: "We are responsible and we are willing to take the torch."
Given the amount of television these people admit to having watched, they ought by now to be wary of shows that pander to the latest consuming generation. "Twentysomething" is upscale Oprah. Categorizing eight men and women, if it is to be at all enlightening, takes a more sophisticated touch than is applied tonight. So it would be unfair, as you might be inclined to do at moments in this exasperating hour, to write 40 million people off as the kvetch generation.

HEADLINE: Snack Hierarchy: Small Is Good, Tiny Is Better

BYLINE: By TRISH HALL

 BODY:
AMERICANS are getting bigger and heavier, the Government says, but you would never know it from what they eat: food is getting smaller and smaller.
Every aisle of the supermarket now holds miniature versions of familiar brands: shrunken Oreos, tiny Dove Bars, and Ritz crackers the size of a thumbnail. 
 There are plenty of reasons to eat itty-bitty foods. They're cute, like puppies and kittens. And a little version of anything familiar creates warm feelings. Small is neater, too. When everything disappears in one bite, there are no crumbs.
More important, delusions are easier to sustain with tiny foods. For adults who try to control what they eat, smaller foods feed the fantasy that they're eating less. For children, it may be easier to persuade parents to buy a package of tiny cookies.
Some of the charm of the small is novelty. Go to any extreme, and attention follows. That's why some food marketers and restaurateurs are taking the opposite approach: selling gigantic muffins or serving restaurant portions so big that doggie bags are mandatory.
But for the moment, miniaturization seems more prevalent than gigantism. Smaller-than-usual foods are among the fastest-growing items in the supermarket.
"Everyone is looking at their portfolios and thinking, 'What can we shrink next?' " said Tony Adams, vice president of market research at the Campbell Soup Company. "It's sort of hard to shrink soup," he conceded, but that hasn't stopped the company from trying. "We are shrinking some of the ingredients," he said, mentioning little noodles shaped like dinosaurs and teddy bears.
One reason for the trend stands out: companies like Campbell are trying to make food more fun. "This is a countervailing balance to the seriousness about food," Mr. Adams said. "Miniaturization reminds us that food is there to enjoy."
Researchers who talk to people about their feelings about life say respondents report a general loss of pleasure. The Trends Journal, published by the Socioeconomic Research Institute, a future forecasting company in Rhinebeck, N.Y., suggests that stress levels are higher than they have been since the late 1940's. Americans, the journal says, are "anxious and tense and losing their sense of humor."
Blame the recession, maybe, but also blame the grim attitude people have acquired toward food. Food has always been an important source of pleasure, but now it is increasingly a source of worry. More often, it is regarded as medicine, and medicine is not fun.
For adults, small foods can produce pleasure by leading to a greater sense of freedom: you can seem to eat more, but with less guilt, because you're not really eating more. (In calories and weight, eight mini Oreos equal two regular Oreos.)
Millions of Americans struggle with weight. The mean weight of men grew by six pounds between 1960 and 1980, and their mean height increased by almost an inch; the mean weight of women grew by four pounds in that time and the mean height by half an inch, according to the National Center for Health Statistics, which is determining whether weights and heights changed in the last decade.
It's hard, fortunately, to keep count. "You think you're eating less, but you're probably eating more," said Frances Colorio, a receptionist at an advertising agency in New York who buys Ritz Bits every few weeks.
Children and teen-agers like small foods for different reasons. Vera Barkas, a 13-year-old who was shopping for groceries last week at a supermarket on the Upper West Side with her mother and brother, said she liked the cheese-filled Ritz Bits.
"You can get a whole bunch, and you don't have to keep reaching in the box," she said. "It's fun to pack them in your mouth." When really hungry, she figures she can fit five in her mouth at one time.
She also likes the tiny Oreos because she can pop them right into her mouth. That's not possible with the standard Oreo. "It takes too much time to eat the big ones," she said, because she feels compelled to take them apart and scrape off the white filling with her tongue. With the little ones, that onerous task is unnecessary.
People are starting to eat cookies and crackers the way they eat chips. In the industry, the lingo is "hand to mouth." That's very different from the way cookies used to be eaten: at the table, as a dessert. Carefully. Slowly. Not in a stream.
"Minis are very snackable; you just put them in your mouth, one after another, like chips," said Barbara S. Thomas, the senior vice president of marketing for the Nabisco Biscuit Company, which has shrunk 10 of its brands in the last five years, including Ritz, Oreo, Chips Ahoy! and Lifesavers.
Small foods suit an ever-more-rigorous definition of convenience. "People are eating on the run," said Stuart Greenblatt, a spokesman for the Keebler Company. "They want things that are easy to consume." In the last year, Keebler has introduced small versions of some of its better-known products, like Rainbow Chips Deluxe and Pecan Sandies.
Among the fastest-growing foods in the supermarket, according to Nielsen Marketing Research in Northbrook, Ill., are four new mini products: Bagel Bites, Milky Way Miniatures, Mini Chips Ahoy! and Snickers Miniatures. But miniaturization is not without its hazards, and success can be fleeting. Some mini products that have been around for a while are losing sales, and others have been taken off the market: Nabisco Honey Maid Graham Bites and Nabisco Triscuit Bits lasted less than two years.
Impulse, of course, plays a part in buying snacks. Monica Desai, 3, sat in her mother's shopping cart recently, explaining why she likes Mini Chips Ahoy! but not regular Chips Ahoy! "I like these because they have these nice little cookies," she said.
But then she noticed a bag of fudge-covered Oreos and insisted on having them. To her, the color of the fudge on the package looked pink, and she likes pink.
Shoppers didn't always have vast choices in food size. Candy bars were available in only one size until the late 1950's, said Hans Fiuczynski, a spokesman for M & M/Mars. "They were like the Model T: you could have it in any size you wanted as long as it was the standard size," he said. Then, in the late 1950's, Mars introduced its "fun" size bar, which took two bites to eat. In the last year, it has introduced one-bite miniatures.
Maybe the most extreme miniaturization is the Lifesaver Hole. "There's a play value to the product," said Bruce Wood, president of the Planter's and Lifesavers divisions of Nabisco, which introduced the Holes last year. "People eat them in little bunches."
Indeed, it would be easy to have a feast of mini food, to obtain real-life versions of the tiny plastic foods set out in dollhouses. Some are old, like the miniature bottles of liquor served on airplanes; some are new, like snack-sized yogurt; some are processed, like doughnuts, coffeecakes and Shredded Wheat, and some are natural, like finger-size bananas and baby vegetables.
The little foods, not surprisingly, can be seen as part of larger shifts in society. Peter Landry, shopping for food last week on the Upper West Side, said he found the little foods "kind of silly." They simply try to give the illusion that there is more, when there isn't, he said.
"It's almost political," he said. "We've been through an era of excess. Now it's the reverse: if it's smaller, it must be more hip, it must be better."

HEADLINE: OLYMPICS;
Yugoslavia May Snub Invitation To the Games

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BARCELONA, Spain, July 21

 BODY:
The United Nations Security Council informed the Spanish Government tonight that athletes from Yugoslavia would be welcome to compete in the Barcelona Olympics in individual events without national identification, but not in team sports.
But Yugoslav Olympic officials suggested they might withdraw from the Games rather than comply. 
 The decision was made to allow Spain to comply with sanctions, which prevent members of the United Nations from allowing athletes who represent Yugoslavia to participate in international sports events. The United Nations has identified Yugoslavia as the aggressor in the current civil war.
In the ruling, from the sanctions committee of the Security Council in New York, individual athletes can compete in the Games, provided they do not participate as a group, gather for any group appearances or march in any ceremonies with the Yugoslav flag or anthem.
Any violation of those terms, said Matthew Nerzig, a United Nations spokesman, would become "grounds for expulsion of the athletes from the Games."
It was not immediately clear, however, whether those conditions would satisfy the Yugoslavia Olympic Committee, whose secretary general tonight left open the possibility that Yugoslavia, now just the two republics of Serbia and Montenegro, would send no athletes, rather than a fractured team. The prohibition of team competitions would eliminate more than half the 118 athletes Yugoslavia was prepared to send.
"We will study this matter tomorrow, and our president will make a decision," Caslav Veljic, the secretary general, said from Belgrade. "It is my opinion, that we say, 'Thank you very much for the invitation, but rather than be present with no name, no country, no flag, we will not come.' If everybody is against Yugoslavia, we can live without them. Goodbye. It is very stupid to ask that we divide our team."
Meanwhile, one of the two members of the International Olympic Committee from Yugoslavia, Slobodan Filipovic, said tonight that he would ask the I.O.C. to request an extraordinary session of the Security Council in an attempt to change the decision of the sanctions committee.
 
Bound to Obey
 "This is a really difficult decision for the Yugoslavian Olympic Committee," Filipovic said. "It is good for any athlete to compete in the Olympics Games. But it is also important to think about solidarity."
As a member of the United Nations, Spain is bound to observe the sanctions, but the I.O.C. has obliged itself to maximize Olympic participation for as many athletes as possible.
In addressing concerns of the sanctions committee raised earlier, the I.O.C. proposed that all Yugoslavs could compete under the banner of the Independent Team, a nonpolitical designation, and march into the opening and closing ceremonies by the white Olympic flag with five rings.
That solution satisfied the sanctions committee only so far as individuals were concerned. Some committee members still had serious reservations about team events -- Yugoslavia qualified for men's and women's handball, men's water polo and women's basketball -- and it was on the basis of those concerns that the split decision was rendered.
The I.O.C. delayed any response tonight, pending its own discussion during a regularly scheduled meeting Wednesday morning.
In essence, the I.O.C. members have more of a philosophical question to debate, rather than a practical one, in that Spain must follow the United Nations mandate.
 
Which Way to Go
 "The debate is whether we get Yugoslavia to the Games in some form," said Kevan Gosper of Australia, an I.O.C. vice president, "or do we protest the discriminatory decision of having individuals, not teams. Do we take the whole team, or do we say some are better than none? That's the dilemma."
The I.O.C., he said, also must factor the notion that, as sponsor of the Olympics, it makes no distinction between individual athletes and those who compete as part of a team. Just as an individual athlete receives a gold medal, so does each member of a victorious team.
Whatever decisions are reached here and in Belgrade, they are not likely to affect teams from two former Yugoslav repubics, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia. Their athletes are waiting to learn from the I.O.C. under what conditions they will be allowed to compete, either as separate teams or as one and under what name and flag.

HEADLINE: Mr. Perot's Chance for Courage

 BODY:
Just before Ross Perot quit the Presidential race, his campaign staff put together a courageous plan for rebuilding the nation's economy. Would that Mr. Perot had been as courageous. He has yet to release the plan or endorse it. Still, judging by published reports, the program is full of excellent ideas that challenge both Bill Clinton and George Bush, as well as the electorate.
Jimmy Carter's budget director, Charles Schultze, calls it "the best plan I've seen in a long time" for balancing the budget and moving the country forward. The plan draws freely from independent economists, liberal and conservative. It seeks, in ways both clever and fair, to distribute pain and reward. 
 The plan calls for higher income taxes on the wealthy. It would sharply increase gasoline taxes, a move that would raise costs for most Americans but also provide important budgetary and environmental benefits.
The plan does not propose the same level of public investment Mr. Clinton asks for, but seeks in various ways to encourage private investment. It would also limit deductions for mortgage interest and curb runaway entitlement programs like Social Security. These are sacred cows that few politicians have been willing to challenge, even for a greater good.
Unfortunately, sensible economic ideas are often political suicide. Walter Mondale damaged himself by proposing higher taxes in 1984; news accounts suggest that Mr. Perot blanched when he saw what his advisers were asking him to do. According to his media director, James Squires, "Mr. Perot was more comfortable showing this plan to the country as a non-candidate than he could possibly be as a candidate. "
The plan is certainly far more threatening to special interest groups than Mr. Perot's earlier and generally painless ideas for reducing the deficit. Mr. Perot once said that if elected, he and Congress would waltz together "like Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire." With this new plan, what he was looking at was four years of slam-dancing.
Like many who yearn for serious discourse and truth-telling in the 1992 campaign, the economist Isabel Sawhill of the Urban Institute hopes that Mr. Perot will endorse the plan. "If Ross Perot can help get such proposals on the table," said Ms. Sawhill, "that would be a big contribution."
Mr. Perot's jilted advisers, it appears, have given him one more chance at courage.

HEADLINE: Stocks Rebound a Bit, With Dow Up 5.41

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Buyers made a tentative return to Wall Street yesterday after two days of steep losses, but bargain hunting was inhibited by continued worries about the health of the nation's economy.
Congressional testimony on the economic scene by Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, failed to provide the market with much fresh insight. Investors chose instead to focus on earnings reports. 
 Bank stocks were among the most active issues after a spate of second-quarter results in that sector.
The Dow Jones industrial average edged up 5.41 points at 3,308.41. Gainers outpaced decliners by 901 to 844 on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume rose to 173.8 million shares, from 165.8 million on Monday.
The Fed chairman said it was not likely that the United States economy would return to recession in the foreseeable future.
 
Gross Domestic Product
 Mr. Greenspan expects the nation's gross domestic product growth to have grown some 2 percent during the second quarter. He also said he believed new revisions in payroll data would show less weakness in the labor market.
"He doesn't seem to have had any effect" on the markets, John Blair, County NatWest's head trader, said.
Shares in London, Tokyo and Frankfurt all staged partial recoveries from the sharp selloff that gripped world stock markets Monday.
"There were no new bombs in earnings," said A. C. Moore, a market analyst at Argus Investment Management, explaining one positive factor on Wall Street. When I.B.M. reported on Friday that its earnings had increased fivefold -- which was less than analysts expected -- it set off two days of losses in the market.
"The stability in the currency has also been helpful," the analyst said. The dollar has recovered some ground after hitting historic lows against the German mark following a German rate increase.
Mr. Blair said: "The bank stocks were fairly active, with a lot of earnings out on those. That was probably the real issue today."
Among the banks, Wells Fargo slumped 2 1/2, to 70 3/4, despite a sharp earnings gain. Citicorp, which reported a surge in profits to $171 million, added 1/4, to 20 1/4. Mellon Bank fell 1/4, to 40 1/2, and Chemical Banking lost 1, to 35 7/8.
Among individual shares, Syntex dropped 1 7/8, to 32 5/8. Smith Barney removed the stock from its investment policy committee's recommended list.
STAC Electronics shares tumbled 3, to 5 1/2, after releasing third-quarter results. Alex. Brown cut estimates, citing a slowdown in sales at the company's retail outlets.
Shares of Ford Motor slipped 1 1/4, to 44, and General Motors fell 3/8, to 39 7/8.
I.B.M. recouped some ground, rising 7/8, to 93 3/4.
Shares of United Technologies added 2 1/4, to 53 1/2 after reporting second-quarter results late Monday. Bear, Stearns repeated a buy.
Intelligent Electronics added 1 5/8, to 9 1/8, after it said it was exploring options to increase shareholder value.
The Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks ended 0.01 point higher at 413.76. The American Stock Exchange index rose 0.30, to 384.82.
The New York Stock Exchange Composite index of all listed common stocks eased 0.04 point, to 227.47. The average share price was unchanged. The Nasdaq index was up 4.35 points at 568.63.

CORRECTION-DATE: July 24, 1992, Friday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Wednesday about shares of stock sold short and not covered by mid-July included an erroneous figure supplied by the American Stock Exchange. The number of shares sold short on that exchange for the period ended July 15 was 69.5 million shares, up 5.6 percent from the 65.8 million shares reported in mid-June.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN;
Bush on the Attack
But Charges Against Clinton and Gore Could Raise His Own Negative Image

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 22

 BODY:
President Bush has wasted no time attacking the Democratic nominee, accusing Gov. Bill Clinton this week of peddling birth control pills to teen-agers without their parents' consent and encouraging children to "haul their parents into court."
Today, Marlin Fitzwater, Mr. Bush's spokesman, accused Senator Al Gore, Mr. Clinton's running mate, of selling out the economy to environmentalists and making America look bad before the world. 
 Mr. Bush's own attack on his rival is generally couched in vague references to "they," rather than to Mr. Clinton personally. The Bush campaign said the President was talking about "people in general" who advocate the policies he was criticizing.
But the campaign acknowledged that Mr. Clinton fell into that group, and it was evident that Mr. Bush had the Arkansas Governor in mind in his remarks. Some of what the President said had some basis in fact or amounted to a political argument that could not be proved one way or another. Other accusations seem misleading.
 
Wife's Writings Cited
 In one case Mr. Bush appears to be trying to use old legal writings by Mr. Clinton's wife, Hillary, about the rights of minors to give voters the impression that Mr. Clinton would encourage children to sue their parents.
Mr. Fitzwater said he attacked Mr. Gore's environmental record because the Democrats were the first to "go negative." But Republicans have been attacking the Democrats all year. And their strategists are counting on such attacks -- which spring from voluminous research by the Bush team, just as Mr. Clinton's team has been researching Mr. Bush's past -- to drag down the Democrat's approval ratings.
Political history shows that this approach can be effective and that campaign attacks need not be entirely true to hurt an opponent. Indeed, in 1988 much of Mr. Bush's strategy against Michael S. Dukakis, then the Democratic nominee, was based on accusations of varying accuracy that were intended to chip away at public trust in his character and patriotism.
 
Bigger Risk This Time
 But politicians from both parties suggest that Mr. Bush is taking a much bigger risk this time by focusing his campaign on attacks against Mr. Clinton, since polls show that the President's own negative image with voters is very strong.
"Bush is in trouble because people don't think he's committed to changing anything," said Representative Vin Weber, Republican of Minnesota. "He can't fix that just with a negative campaign. It's not enough."
Some of the things the candidates are saying about each other simply cannot be assessed easily for some black-and-white truth.
Mr. Fitzwater, for example, sharply criticized Senator Gore today for going to the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro last month and condemning Mr. Bush's refusal to sign a new treaty on endangered animals.
"Gore here is Mr. Sellout America," Mr. Fitzwater said, adding: "Now he wants to be Vice President. Now he tries to talk about economic growth when he spent a week in Rio saying, 'The heck with the economy; sell it out to the environment.' "
 
Business vs. Environment
 The Senator did not say that exactly. Moreover, both candidates say they favor both environmental protection and economic growth. But the White House says Mr. Gore would bankrupt businesses by imposing costly regulations, while the Clinton camp says Mr. Bush favors businesses at the expense of the environment.
"The Administration is so blinded by its big contributors that it can't see that simple truth," said George Stephanopoulos, Mr. Clinton's communications director.
Other charges are more specific.
In a speech Tuesday at the Three Saints Russian Orthodox Church in Garfield, N.J., Mr. Bush said the 1992 Presidential election was a choice between himself and "the advocates of the liberal agenda."
"They want public schools to hand out birth control pills and devices to teen-aged kids, and they believe it's no business of the parents and that it's strictly a matter between our children and the Government," Mr. Bush said.
 
Clinics at Public Schools
 The President appeared to be referring to clinics at public schools in Arkansas that receive Federal and state money. Under the program, which Mr. Clinton supports, local school districts can dispense condoms, birth control pills and spermicidal foam at the clinics.
Mr. Stephanopoulos said children must have parental consent to use the clinics. Mr. Clinton supports the distribution of condoms, he said, "to prevent AIDS and to help prevent unwanted teen pregnancies."
In the same speech, Mr. Bush asserted: "They even encourage kids to hire lawyers and haul their parents into court. And I believe kids need mothers and fathers, not 'big brother' bureaucracy,' and the bond between the parent and the child is sacred and it is fundamental."
Responding to that comment today, Mr. Stephanopoulos said: "That's spurious and specious, because it has nothing to do with Clinton's record or his plans. It's a legal analysis, and it's Hillary's legal analysis."
Mrs. Clinton, who has served as co-chairwoman of the Children's Defense Fund, said in articles written for legal journals starting in the 1970's that children should be allowed in some circumstances to bring legal action against their parents. She said the longstanding legal principle that adults are presumed "competent" in the eyes of a court and that children are not should be re-examined.
Mr. Stephanopoulos said this was not intended to "encourage" children to sue their parents but to give courts some recourse in cases of abuse or neglect. He provided this citation from an article by Mrs. Clinton, entitled "Children's Rights, a Legal Perspective," published by Columbia University's Teacher's College in 1979:
"Even among persons in the children's rights movement there is a concern that extending rights to children against their parents is too difficult to control, and in all but the most extreme cases such questions should be resolved by the families, not the courts."

HEADLINE: U.S. Aides Split Over Whether to Attack Iraq for Defying U.N.

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 22

 BODY:
Senior Administration officials are divided over whether to mount a military strike against Baghdad and, if an attack seems necessary, whether it could be done effectively enough to avoid backfiring in the midst of President Bush's re-election campaign, officials said today.
Publicly, the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said today that Iraq "must be held accountable for its defiance of the U.N. resolutions and for the safety of all U.N. personnel in Iraq, as well as other international personnel providing assistance to the Iraqi people." He added, "We are not ruling out any option, including the use of military force." 
 But privately, fears that President Saddam Hussein could emerge from any allied military action unfazed politically and emboldened in his defiance of Washington have sent State Department lawyers and Pentagon planners scrambling to devise a military solution that would meet a specific military objective and would be perceived as having changed Mr. Hussein's behavior and improved his compliance with the cease-fire resolution that ended the Persian Gulf war 17 months ago.
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney was said by Administration officials to have joined Gen. Colin L. Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in questioning the use of military force at this time, but a clear consensus has yet to emerge. It seemed certain that with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d traveling in the Middle East, Mr. Bush had not gathered the small group of top aides to review his final array of options, as was his pattern during the gulf war.
 
Position Papers Circulate
 A high-level White House meeting of Administration "deputies" was canceled Tuesday as additional position papers circulated raising new questions about the use of force, Administration officials said.
Mr. Baker was scheduled to meet with King Fahd of Saudi Arabia on Thursday to discuss anti-Iraq planning as well as the Middle East peace process. Saudi officials appeared confident that Mr. Hussein had miscalculated both Mr. Bush's political situation at home and the strength of the international resolve to force Iraq's compliance with the terms that ended the war. The Saudis have granted permission for American and allied air forces to use Saudi bases to stage any United Nations-sanctioned mission against Iraq, Administration officials said.
At the Pentagon, however, one paper drafted this week by Carl W. Ford Jr., the principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for International Security Affairs, articulated what one official described as a convincing case that military action was fraught with risks if it was not properly focused, proportional and effective.
One Administration official signaled the acute White House concern over the prospect of military impotence by saying: "There is no political motivation to talking about military action. If anything, the pull is the other way."
Administration officials said the longstanding conventional wisdom that a well-timed military strike against Baghdad might reclaim for Mr. Bush some of the political luster he garnered from the gulf war operation has now been eroded by the fear of taking action that does not produce results.
Still, Mr. Bush has projected an aura of studied determination this week. Boarding his Presidential helicopter Tuesday, he said, "We want Iraq to comply with the United Nations resolutions, and we are insisting that they comply with the U.N. resolutions."
The Iraqi leadership appeared to be calculating that Mr. Bush's political vulnerability in a Presidential contest against the just-struck Democratic ticket of Bill Clinton and Al Gore has instilled a new sense of caution about a potentially risky military venture that, whatever it achieves, will probably leave Mr. Hussein in power.
Iraq's Ambassador to the United Nations, Abdul Amir al-Enbari, recently returned from Baghdad, bluntly told reporters in New York "throwing a bomb or two, whether on Baghdad or here or there, is not going to change" matters. To the contrary, he said, such limited strikes show that the United Nations Security Council, "cannot do much" without "the cooperation of the Iraqi Government."
Nevertheless, there is a deep, underlying sense in the Administration that Mr. Hussein has just survived the most significant attempted revolt from his army since the war's end, and that although he brutally and efficiently detected and pre-empted the coup plot late last month, it signified the overall weakness of his position.
Mr. Hussein's new aggressiveness toward the United Nations presence in Iraq could thus reflect a more desperate need to break the international blockade that has been inexorably strangling Iraq's economy by denying Mr. Hussein any source of national income.
One major predicament for Administration planners was devising a punitive military strike that is "proportional" to Mr. Hussein's defiance in refusing to allow United Nations inspectors to enter Iraq's Agriculture Ministry, where an archive of documents on Iraq's ballistic missile program is suspected of being hidden.
A plan to bomb the ministry has in effect been ruled out, officials said. Such a strike would destroy the very evidence the United Nations is seeking and would not be likely to change Mr. Hussein's behavior, officials fear. It would also reduce to rubble a civilian building whose leaders oversee food and crop production in Iraq.
Plans to bomb other military and industrial targets in Iraq may not meet the legal test that has been asserted by some Administration legal experts. These experts argue that United Nations authority for allied military action may be limited to targets that are related to Iraq's violations.
Other officials, however, argue that the target list has been expanded as the United Nations Security Council has cited Iraq for more and more numerous violations of the terms of the cease-fire and its follow-on resolutions related to the sale of oil, the Iraq-Kuwait border dispute and human rights abuses against the Kurdish minority in northern Iraq and the Shiite Muslim majority that predominates in southern Iraq.
Administration officials emphasized that there was broad consensus in the Government and among the allies to take some action, but Mr. Hussein's provocation, narrowly defined as his refusal to open his Agriculture Ministry, has thrown military contingency planning into a quandary.

HEADLINE: Dow Off Again, Losing 30.80; Japanese Stocks Rebound

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The stock market fell sharply again yesterday, resuming a slide prompted by heavy overseas losses, disappointing earnings and a weak dollar.
But in trading in Tokyo today, Japanese stocks recovered from a steep selloff yesterday. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 30.80 points yesterday to close at 3,277.61. It was the the third big loss in four sessions, broken only by Tuesday's modest 5.41-point rise. Declining issues beat advancers 1,092 to 643. New York Stock Exchange volume edged up to 191.8 million shares, from 173.8 million Tuesday.
Stocks fell worldwide yesterday. Tokyo stocks hit a six-year low before recovering today. Meanwhile, the leading London stock average lost 1.15 percent and the main German index fell 1.9 percent.
 
Nikkei Wipes Out Losses
 Still, Japanese stocks bounced back today. The Nikkei index of 225 issues gained 497.99 points, or 3.20 percent, to close at 16,039.94. Much of today's gain came in the last half-hour of trading and it wiped out yesterday's lose of 460.46 points, or 2.88 percent.
Japanese brokers said traders bought back shares today that they had sold yesterday in hopes that the Government would take some action to prop up the market. But they also said investor sentiment was wary.
Yesterday, the American stock market was also unsettled by speculation about whether the United States would lead an attack on Iraq. And it showed little response to Congressional testimony by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan.
Some analysts said that the market's reaction could have been worse yesterday. Hersh Cohen, president of Shearson Asset Management, said he believes the market's decline has been fairly contained.
"For two out of the last three days, it looked like it was going to get killed, but it can't seem to gather steam on the downside," he said. "The market is being aided by this low interest rate structure."
With yields on bonds and bank accounts at levels not seen in years, some traders say the stock market remains the only game in town.
The over-the-counter market was dotted with stocks posting sizable declines after disappointing results. Among the weaker stocks were Advanced Technology Labs, down 8 3/4, to 16 5/8, and Symantec, off 7, to 20 3/4.
Among individual issues, Computer Associates topped the Big Board volume list, up 2 1/8, to 13 3/4, after releasing results. Dean Witter upgraded it to buy from hold and raised estimates.
On the losing side, Cray Research tumbled 4 5/8, to 23 7/8, after releasing lower earnings, and Symbol Technologies dropped 3 1/2, to 14 1/2, following its unexpectedly weaker profits.
First Community Bancorp jumped 8 1/4, to 26 3/4. It will be acquired by Banc One in a stock swap.
Upjohn rose 1 7/8, to 34 1/4, after the company's scientists said they had synthesized an AIDS compound that was more potent than similar drugs.
Amgen rose 3, to 65. Analysts upgraded their ratings or repeated buy opinions after the company reported strong second-quarter results.
The Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks fell 2.83, to 410.93. The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 1.34 points, to 226.13. The American Stock Exchange index fell 1.65, to 383.17. And the Nasdaq index dropped 4.75, to 563.88.

HEADLINE: COMMITTEE DEFINES U.S. GOAL IN WORLD

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 22

 BODY:
Saying the Administration and Congress are failing to meet the complex challenges of the post-cold-war world, a high-level panel of foreign policy experts warned today that a slide into isolationism and protectionism would be disastrous for the American economy and the international prestige of the United States.
"The world is new, but what isn't new is how we are dealing with it," said Winston Lord, a former Ambassador to China and chairman of the 23-member panel assembled by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, which issued its report at a news conference today. 
 "We see no coherent vision at home or abroad to guide us into the next century," Mr. Lord said.
The report, "Changing Our Ways: America and the New World," reflects six months of discussion among academics, former senior Government officials and heads of international organizations. The panel hopes to use its study, which surveys the world broadly and also makes specific policy recommendations on trade, the environment and population, to touch off a debate on foreign policy.
 
Why Is There No Confetti?
 Focusing on what it sees as a nearly inexplicable malaise gripping American institutions and policy makers just as the United States could be celebrating the collapse of Communism, the reports says, "Ours is a paradoxical victory."
"There has been no Victory-over-Communism Day," the panel wrote. "No confetti, no strangers kissing in the street. Indeed, it is a long time since America has been so uneasy about itself and so uncertain of where to go next."
Speaking at the news conference today, David R. Gergen, former White House communications director, said the United States was entering the third great policy watershed of the century.
In the first, after World War I, Americans displayed a "lack of wisdom" that contributed to future conflicts. After World War II, he said, the United States made "some of the smartest, shrewdest foreign policy moves in our history."
Now, he said, Americans risked repeating the folly of the 1920's. "Too little attention is being paid to what kind of world we want," he said.
 
What They Propose
 These are among the report's recommendations:
*United States foreign policy must be built on renewed domestic strength. Rebuilding the United States economy should be the highest priority, but not through protectionism or purely regional trade organizations at the expense of international free trade and competition.
*United States world leadership must continue, but with a new emphasis on collective action in support of peace, democracy and open trade.
*NATO should be associated with the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, thus abandoning a "NATO or nothing" approach.
*Germany and Japan should become permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, acknowledging their pre-eminent roles in economic and political affairs while also having them pay a larger share of international operations.
*The United States should raise energy taxes for economic, environmental and security reasons.
*The fight against narcotics should focus on reducing demand at home rather than attack overseas suppliers.
*The United States should withdraw all forces deployed abroad while strengthening the peacekeeping functions of the United Nations.

HEADLINE: Fed Chairman Tries a Balancing Act

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 22

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, returning to Congress for a second day to testify about the economy's uncertain future, walked a tightrope again today between pressures from his White House friends in an election year and pressures from within to preserve the Fed's independence.
Economists said Mr. Greenspan did not step into the domain of the brazenly political in giving his guardedly optimistic forecast. But in their view he offered a few nuggets that might help the White House, notably his predictions that the economy would gain momentum soon and that the unemployment rate would fall substantially in the next 18 months. 
 Fed chairmen usually put a positive spin on their forecasts. Mr. Greenspan followed this tradition, some economists said, not because he wanted to help the White House but because he, like his predecessors, knew that painting a gloomy picture could cause markets to plunge and companies to lay off workers.
 
'Benefit of the Doubt'
 "His economic forecast was perhaps somewhat on the optimistic side," said David M. Jones, the author of a book on the Fed under Mr. Greenspan and the chief economist for Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, a New York securities firm. "One could perceive it as giving the benefit of the doubt to a stronger economy, which colors things more favorably for President Bush."
But while the chairman's forecast of a stronger economy could give President Bush some ammunition to contend that conditions will soon improve, political experts say voters act less on promises and forecasts than on what is happening on Main Street.
"How the economy acts from March to June is the most sensitive period in affecting how people vote in November," said Michael S. Lewis-Beck, a University of Iowa professor who has studied how the economy affects election results. "The President can do very little right now in the short run to change the course of the economy."
To be sure, if Mr. Greenspan's new forecast proves too rosy, it would not be the first time. He made overly optimistic forecasts last July and in January, and many economists say that the optimism in his newest forecast stems not from politics but from his conviction that low interest rates should spur growth soon.
Joseph R. Coyne, a Fed spokesman, rejected suggestions that Mr. Greenspan was seeking to help President Bush, whose poll ratings have plunged because of the economy. Mr. Coyne argued that Mr. Greenspan was calling it the way he saw it.
 
An Ex-Official's View
 Scott E. Pardee, a former senior Fed official who is chairman of Yamaichi International (America), a New York securities house, said of Mr. Greenspan, "His integrity as the chairman of the Fed is probably more important than anything he can do for the Republican Party."
In Mr. Greenspan's testimony today before the House Banking Committee's Subcommittee on Domestic Monetary Policy, he said as he did on Tuesday that there would soon be an economic pickup, but he added that it would not be vigorous because many households and businesses are still weighed down by heavy debts.
He said the economy would grow by 2.25 to 2.75 percent this year, and 2.75 to 3 percent next year. He forecast that unemployment, now at 7.8 percent, the highest in eight years, would fall to between 7.25 and 7.5 percent by year-end and to between 6.5 and 7 percent by the end of 1993.
Robert G. Dederick, chief economist for the Northern Trust Company in Chicago, who was Under Secretary of Economic Affairs in the Reagan Commerce Department, said the forecast that the economy would gain momentum soon "was a fair statement," adding that "if it helps the White House, so be it."
But Mr. Dederick quarreled with the employment forecast. "The only bone he tossed to the Administration was his comment that the unemployment rate would come down significantly," he said. "I don't see where they are going to get a sharp drop in the unemployment rate from the rate of growth they're predicting."
All in all, Mr. Greenspan seemed far less preoccupied with politics than with defending the Fed against criticisms that its actions have been too little and too late.
With long-term interest rates already high, he said, more aggressive action on short-term rates "more than likely would have been interpreted by market participants as risking a resurgence of inflation."
 
Confounding the Experts
 Mr. Greenspan said there was general surprise among experts that the Fed's repeated interest rate cuts had still not produced a vibrant recovery.
Mr. Greenspan took credit for helping avoid a depression, saying easier credit had helped keep the drop in asset values from snowballing.
Mr. Jones, the economist, said Mr. Greenspan's optimism made excellent strategic sense. "It's a good tack to take," he said, "when Congress is berating you for not doing enough, when the White House is concerned about the election and when it's consistent with your view that lower interest rates are someday supposed to produce stronger growth."

HEADLINE: House Ethics Panel Sees No Evidence Of Violations in Post Office Scandal

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 22

 BODY:
A Congressional panel investigating the House post office said today that it had found no evidence that any members of Congress violated ethics rules. But it described a postal operation plagued by accounting failures, patronage problems and the gross inflation of mail volume to justify more jobs and a larger budget.
The House voted unanimously to turn over all the material from the five-month investigation to both the House ethics committee and Justice Department investigators, who are conducting a parallel inquiry. As a practical matter, the report appeared to bring an end to the House's scrutiny of itself in the post office affair. 
 The resolution adopted 414 to 0 by the House gave the ethics committee no mandate for further action, and Democrats said that they did not expect action to be taken against any members.
In other action, the House on Tuesday night removed one hurdle to anuclear waste repository that has been the subject of much debate in New Mexico by approving a transfer of the land above the site to the Department of Energy. But opponents added several requirements to the measure that could delay the opening of the repository for years.
 
Partisan Split
 Republicans on the panel investigating the House post office issued their own report, shattering any illusions that the group, half Democrats and half Republicans, had maintained the cordial bipartisan air that had earlier been proudly proclaimed. And they named the members, mostly Democrats, who had used the post office for political or personal reasons. Still, they stopped short of finding any violations.
The Republicans asked the ethics committee to review the entire record, while the Democrats asked that the ethics committee look only into the conduct of four post office employees.
The House bank and post office cases have already claimed the jobs of Robert V. Rota, the postmaster, and Jack Russ, the sergeant-at-arms, who resigned in March and recently returned to the Congressional payroll as a $100-a-month part-time adviser to Representative Mervyn M. Dymally, Democrat of California. Some low-level employees have also pleaded guilty to embezzlement and drug dealing at the post office.
All of the members of the special group looking into the post office contended today that the investigation had been severely hampered by senior employees in the office like Mr. Rota who had asserted their Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination, and by the United States Attorney's office in Washington, which counseled some witnesses not to cooperate with Congress.
Prosecutors have privately questioned whether the group could competently conduct an investigation because it includes lawmakers who oversaw the post office and provided patronage jobs for relatives and political allies.
The panel did not substantiate accusations by one employee, James C. Smith, that he had made cash payments from postal funds to Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who heads the Ways and Means Committee, and two other House Democrats, Austin J. Murphy and Joe Kolter, both of Pennsylvania. The office expenses of the three have been subpoenaed in the criminal inquiry and they have said they would be cleared.
The Republicans said as many as 25 current and former lawmakers had used House post office employees to deliver campaign donations to the Capitol from post office boxes elsewhere in Washington. But their report identified only current members: Nicholas Mavroules of Massachusetts, Dennis M. Hertel of Michigan, Mary Rose Oakar of Ohio, Jim Moody of Wisconsin, Edward F. Feighan of Ohio and Mr. Rostenkowski, all Democrats and Jan Meyers, Republican of Kansas.
The Republican report also said that Mr. Rota had overestimated the mail volume handled by the office by as much as 350 percent, which the Democrats did not dispute, in an effort to get a larger budget and more employees.
 
New Hurdles to Repository
 In action on Tuesday night concerning the nuclear waste repository, the House voted 382 to 10 to approve a proposal to transfer 10,240 acres of Federal land in New Mexico that lies above the project from the Department of the Interior to the Department of Energy. Three court decisions said such a transfer must be authorized by Congress before the repository, called the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, can accept radioactive wastes.
But even as the House voted to approve the transfer, opponents of the project managed to include new barriers that could indefinitely prevent the $1.3 billion repository from opening.
Among the new provisions is one that requires the Environmental Protection Agency to establish new standards for disposing of radioactive wastes before any can be put in the repository. Five years ago, a Federal Appellate Court in Boston struck down the existing standards, saying they were lax.
Today, an E.P.A. spokesman said the agency may propose new standards in the fall, but final rules would not be ready until months later. Other provisions in the House measure, like one that requires public comment and E.P.A. review of certain operations, could delay the repository for years.
The Government wants to proceed with this project quickly because tens of thousands of tons of waste contaminated with plutonium are stored in boxes and barrels across the nation, much of it in unstable conditions.
The Bush Administration opposes the House measure but supports a related bill passed by the Senate late last year that does not include any of the barriers in the House version. A conference committee has not yet been named to resolve differences in the two proposals.
The House legislation is another marker along the punishing path the Energy Department has taken to get the repository opened. The repository was finished in 1988 after nearly a decade of construction in salt beds deep beneath the desert near Carlsbad, N.M. It is intended to entomb nearly one million barrels of waste contaminated with plutonium from nuclear weapons plants and laboratories.

HEADLINE: Nicaragua's Government Astir as Police and Ex-Troops Trade Fire

BYLINE: By SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANAGUA, Nicaragua, July 22

 BODY:
The police came under a military-like assault from demobilized soldiers on Tuesday night near key public buildings as the Government of President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro struggled to defend itself against critics and opponents.
The 20-minute exchange of fire near presidential offices and the National Assembly, in which 14 police officers were wounded, pitted two elements controlled by the opposition Sandinista Front against each other. 
 That seemed to reflect differences over how to function as a democratic movement that have rent the former guerrilla force since it lost power in elections in February 1990.
But that confusing episode -- the culmination of two days of violent strikes and demonstrations by bus drivers, university students and former soldiers -- contributed only one part to the growing sense that the Government is under siege.
Mrs. Chamorro also faces demands from the coalition that put her in office that she break her alliance with the Sandinista Front and remove the minister on whom she is dependent to run the Government -- her son-in-law Antonio Lacayo -- because of corruption allegations.
The Government is further pressed by the Congressional blockage of $104 million in previously authorized American aid. Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, requested the cutoff until, among other things, the Chamorro Government breaks with the Sandinistas and speeds up the return to legal owners of properties confiscated in the Sandinista era.
As she left earlier this week for the Ibero-American summit meeting in Spain, Mrs. Chamorro brushed aside questions about whether Mr. Lacayo would resign, saying that, if Mr. Lacayo goes, "Violeta leaves, too."
The two Ortega brothers -- Gen. Humberto Ortega, the army commander and the Sandinista whom Mrs. Chamorro took into her inner circle, and Daniel, the defeated former President -- seem to be following contradictory lines on the use of violence.
Daniel Ortega Saavedra, in recent days, has seemed to encourage disgruntled Sandinistas to take up arms to back economic and social demands, while General Ortega has sharply condemned such actions.

HEADLINE: Senate Nears an Accord On a Coal-Benefits Issue

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 22

 BODY:
Breaking a logjam that had been holding up an ambitious energy bill, Senate Republicans and Democrats negotiated the broad outlines of a compromise on an amendment forcing coal companies to provide medical benefits to 100,000 retired coal workers.
The coal-company provision has attracted strong opposition from the Administration and has threatened to lead to a crippling filibuster. But by this evening, senior aides of senators on both sides of the issue said that except for a few details, negotiators had reached agreement, essentially guaranteeing a demand by Senator Jay Rockefeller, Democrat of West Virginia, that retired miners and their families not be stripped of benefits they had been promised. 
 In return, Mr. Rockefeller dropped a provision in his amendment calling for a tax on coal companies.
 
A Potpourri of Issues
 Both the Senate and House have passed similar versions of the energy bill by overwhelming margins, but final enactment has been delayed the last two months by legislative maneuvering involving a number of tax provisions. Because the bill deals with a potpourri of complex and economically sensitive areas, from deregulation of electric utilities to possible storage of spent nuclear materials in Nevada, final passage of the most important energy legislation in more than a decade could still be weeks or months away.
The latest in a seemingly endless series of controversies occurred when Mr. Rockefeller persuaded the Finance Committee last month to attach to the energy bill a measure to bail out an insolvent health care fund that President Truman and the United Mine Workers set up in 1946 with a tax on coal companies.
Mr. Rockefeller's measure drew heated criticism from the Administration and Senate Republicans, who contended that nonunionized coal companies should not be held liable for health costs they did not agree to meet in negotiations. Republican leaders promised that President Bush would veto the energy bill if Mr. Rockefeller's amendment was not scratched or at least modified.
 
Threats and Compromise
 Such threats led to several weeks of negotiations between Senator Rockefeller and Senators Malcolm Wallop, Republican of Wyoming, and Wendell Ford, Democrat of Kentucky, which several aides thought would culminate in a compromise within hours. An eventual compromise should insure a successful cloture vote to close off debate on the energy legislation on Thursday, all but guaranteeing that the bill would proceed to a House-Senate conference committee for final compromises on a separate array of issues.
Having achieved the objectives in the energy bill of streamlining licensing procedures for new nuclear power plants and deregulating the natural gas and utility industries, the Administration did not want to forfeit them over the Rockefeller measure.
In recent days, Labor Department negotiators told Rockefeller aides they were willing to accept a substitute for the Senator's coal tax provision that was based on a measure proposed a few years ago by the West Virginia Democrat. That proposal imposed health care responsibility for retired miners and their families on companies that had bought out or taken over the properties of the defunct firms that had once employed the workers. Administration officials said such a solution would reduce the bureaucratic waste that would accompany a tax.
The Administration offer formed the basis for the emerging compromise.
 
'A Huge Victory'
 "We consider this a huge victory," said a senior Rockefeller aide. The aide added that Mr. Rockefeller still wants to insure that the guarantees of health benefits are permanent, and that will require "an additional small amount of funds" beyond what the Republicans have agreed to.
A Republican aide agreed that the two sides were narrowing their differences, adding, "We'll be working most of the night" to reach a final settlement.
Another hurdle was overcome earlier today when Senator J. Bennett Johnston of Louisiana, the Democratic chairman of the Energy Committee, dropped his support for a controversial nuclear-waste-disposal provision. To smooth final passage, he said he would insure that a House measure to allow the Energy Department to override Nevada laws to determine if the Yucca Mountain storage site in Nevada is suitable for the disposal of high-grade nuclear waste would not survive a House-Senate conference committee.
Nevada's two Democratic Senators, Richard H. Bryan and Harry M. Reid, had threatened to block final passage of the energy legislation with a filibuster if the House provision was included in the final draft of the bill.

HEADLINE: Asian Nations Hope to Settle Dispute Over Islands Peacefully

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANILA, July 22

 BODY:
Foreign ministers from across Southeast Asia, reflecting a growing fear of China's military intentions in the region, called today for a peaceful resolution of disputes over a chain of tiny islands in the South China Sea coveted by Beijing and thought to be rich in oil.
Earlier this year China claimed sovereignty over the entire chain of the Spratly Islands, which it calls Nansha, and in June Beijing announced it had contracted with the Crestone Energy Corporation, of Denver, to explore for oil and gas in the area. 
 The Chinese move angered and alarmed the other five nations that claim all or part of the Spratlys: Vietnam, Taiwan, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei.
 
Call for Restraint
 In a joint declaration issued here today at the annual meeting of foreign ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the officials urged that the dispute be resolved "by peaceful means, without resort to force." The association's members are the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand.
The message was clearly meant for China, which has been willing to battle over the Spratlys in the past: In 1988 its forces sank two Vietnamese warships in the Spratlys, killing more than 70 Vietnamese, and Chinese soldiers were stationed on several of the islands.
The unspoken fear is that China, capitalizing on Washington's pullout from its military bases in the Philippines, will use the Spratlys to assert military supremacy in the region.
 
An Added Sense of Urgency
 The Philippine President, Fidel V. Ramos, warned during the conference that a diplomatic failure could lead to "perilous developments."
The Spratlys, tiny uninhabited islands and reefs spread across several hundred square miles of the South China Sea, are the subject of an old dispute. But China's recent moves have added a sense of urgency, and they threaten to undo the recent detente between China and its traditional adversary in Hanoi.
Vietnam, which resumed normal relations with China last year after years of tension, has said that Beijing's oil-exploration plans in the Spratlys are threatening the stability of the region. Vietnam also claims sovereignty over all the islands and once awarded oil-exporation rights there.

HEADLINE: Prof. F. S. C. Northrop, 98, Dies; Saw Conflict Resolution in Science

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

 BODY:
F. S. C. Northrop, a protean scholar at Yale University who used the scientific method as his philosopher's stone and influenced politics, culture and the cold war, died yesterday at a nursing home in Exeter, N.H., where he had lived for many years. He was 98 years old.
Professor Northrop died in his sleep, said his son Stuart J. Northrop. 
 An expert in the fields of philosophy, science, anthropology and law, Professor Northrop studied the major scientific advancements of the early 20th century, especially Einstein's theory of relativity, and related them to the cultural conflicts emerging from the two world wars.
"Do the advent of the atomic bomb and the possibility of biological warfare make the physicist and biologist, rather than the scientist and humanist, the wisest guiders of policy?" he asked in his book, "Ideological Differences and World Order" (Elliot's Books, Northford, Conn., 1949). "Have psychology, anthropology and history demonstrated that irrational emotions, environmental stimuli, biological heredity, or inevitable historical trends determine what will happen? Or do ideas really matter?"
He argued at the outbreak of the cold war that it was not ideological, political or economic issues but rather science that offered the basis for improving relations between the United States and the Soviet Union. In the early years after the United Nations was formed, he grew skeptical that brokering for peace on a political basis could prevent a third world war.
At a conference to plan for an Emergency World People's Congress in 1947, he said it appeared "that the United Nations has failed quicker than the League," referring to the doomed League of Nations begun after World War I.
 
A Native of Wisconsin
 Filmer Stuart Cuckow Northrop, who used only the initials of his first three names, was born in Janesville, Wis., in 1893, a descendant of Joseph Northrop, who arrived in New Haven in 1638. He graduated from Beloit College in 1915 and began his graduate work at Yale in 1917. He served in the Army tank corps during World War I, then worked in China for two years before returning to Yale to complete his master's degree.
He received his doctorate from Harvard in 1924 and later studied in Germany and England. He became an instructor in philosophy at Yale in 1923 and remained on the faculty for nearly four decades. He was chairman of the Department of Philosophy from 1938 to 1940 and was the first master of Silliman College, one of 12 residential colleges at Yale, from 1940 to 1947.
He had the rare distinction of being appointed to a Sterling endowed professorship, the highest scholarly honor at Yale, in both philosophy and law. He was one of the few nonlawyers to teach at Yale's law school.
 
Prolific Author and Scholar
 In 1927, Professor Northrop spent a year in Germany and Switzerland, where he began in earnest his 20-year study of Einstein's theory of relativity and the nature of the scientific method.
He was the author or editor of 12 books, the most influential of which was "The Meeting of East and West," a critique of the world's principal philosophical traditions in their cultural settings, published in 1946. In a front-page review in The New York Times Book Review, Howard Mumford Jones called the book "great, difficult and important," and said it was the "most important intellectual event in the United States thus far in 1946."
Professor Northrop theorized that the East, embracing Confucius and Lao-tze, used "concept by intuition," while the West, in the tradition of Aristotle and Plato, valued most highly "concepts by postulation." This placed the two cultures in conflict with each other, the solution to which, he theorized, rested on a synthesis of values.
"The Meeting of East and West"has been reprinted 10 times, most recently in 1979 by Ox Bow Press of Woodbridge, Conn., and translated into three languages.
Through the course of his studies, Professor Northrop became an expert on the writings and theories of Einstein and the philosopher Alfred North Whitehead. He once described both as "men of genius who are as sensitive in spirit as they are brilliant in mind."
Professor Northrop served on several international organizations involved in resolving international ideological conflict. He was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a member of the American Academy of Political and Social Science.
He is survived by his sons Stuart, of New London, N.H., and Johnston F., of Lakeville, Conn.

HEADLINE: Fed to Cut Money-Supply Goal

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 22

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said today that the Fed was planning to reduce its target for monetary growth below current levels to reduce inflation.
But in his testimony before the House Subcommittee on Domestic Monetary Policy, the Fed chairman said the central bank was holding off for the moment because it was still trying to analyze the erratic behavior of M-2, the most closely watched gauge of money. 
 The measure includes cash, savings and checking accounts, money market funds and short-term certificates of deposit.
"We were generally in agreement that we have to bring the ranges down another notch to conform to our long-term goal of price stability," he said.
He said the Fed had provisionally adopted a target range for growth in the money supply for 1993 that is identical to this year's. The Fed's goal is growth of 2.5 to 6.5 percent for M-2 and of 4.5 to 8.5 percent for debt.
He noted that growth in M-2 had been far below the Fed's targets in recent months. He added, however, that the historic, fairly consistent relationship between the growth of M-2 and growth in the overall economy seemed to be breaking down.
He explained, for instance, that many people were moving their savings from six-month certificates of deposit, which are considered part of M-2, into mutual funds, which are not considered part of M-2. He said the Fed's chief policy-setting committee, the Federal Open Market Committee, would reconsider its targets for money growth no later than its meeting next February.
"The reason we forestalled in moving this time was primarily because of the fact that the problems involved in relating M-2 specifically to gross domestic product have gone so far off track," he said.

HEADLINE: U.S.-Russia Uranium Talks Seen

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 22

 BODY:
The United States will hold secret talks with Russia and four other former Soviet republics to settle a dispute over whether the republics have been selling low-grade uranium to American utilities at illegally low prices, Administration officials said today.
At stake is whether the Energy Department will be able to buy weapons-grade uranium from Russian nuclear warheads for peaceful uses, as Russia has offered. The American uranium industry, in a longstanding lawsuit, is trying to make all uranium from the republics subject to the prohibitive duties that the Commerce Department imposed May 29 on low-grade imports from the republics. 
 The decision to open negotiations follows an active effort by Russia to turn the trade dispute into a diplomatic issue.
 
Taking Their Case to the Top
 "They've raised it at the highest levels," Robert Strauss, the United States Ambassador to Russia, said in an interview today. "They've raised it with me; they've also raised it with President Bush."
In the last two months, the Bush Administration has almost completely reversed its position in the highly political case, a case study in effective lobbying and in the sensitivity of Federal agencies to the mood of the capital -- in this case, to a desire not to throw roadblocks in the way of economic growth in the former Soviet Union.
Not only does the case involve Mr. Strauss, the former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, but also Frank Fahrenkopf Jr., who was chairman of the Republican National Committee during most of the Reagan Administration.
Until mid-May, the Energy Department enthusiastically supported the uranium industry in its suit for steep punitive duties on all imports of uranium from the republics. Then, startling and angering the domestic uranium producers, the Energy Department asked that weapons-grade uranium be excluded from the case because it was unsuitable for commercial use, Government documents show.
Weapons-grade is the type of uranium that the department and several American companies are now talking about buying from Russia. The material would have to be diluted before it could be used in reactors.
Mr. Fahrenkopf, who represents the Russian exporter of the uranium, said the Energy Department had been discussing the possible purchase "for some period of time."
Meanwhile, the Commerce Department has decided to open negotiations under a never-used provision of American trade law that would allow the department to impose a settlement on the domestic industry without its consent, said a department official who insisted on anonymity. The section only applies to trade cases filed against countries with nonmarket economies and was enacted in 1988.
The settlement would impose a tonnage limit on uranium shipments but not a duty.
 
Industry Is Angered
 The initial decision to exclude highly enriched uranium, followed by the possibility that the uranium may now be used for civilian purposes, angered the American industry, which contends that political interference took place.
"The preliminary decision to exclude appeared to be cooked to us," said Valerie A. Slater, who represents the American uranium industry."It was done within tight time constraints, without any time for us to respond." .
A Commerce Department official said that nobody from outside the department's office for trade cases had made any effort to interfere.
Ms. Slater works for Akin, Gump, Hauer & Feld, a Texas law firm formerly known as Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld. Mr. Strauss, one of the firm's founders, left when President Bush named him Ambassador to Moscow last year.
Mr. Strauss said today that because of the conflict of interest, he had not become personally involved in efforts to settle the case and had tried to avoid acquiring information about the case. "I don't have any, don't want any and haven't accepted any," he said.
 
Playing Down the Politics
 For his part, Mr. Fahrenkopf played down his political connections. "I'm acting as a lawyer in this context," he said, acknowledging, "I have written to the President."
"I have written to everyone I can write to," he said, "because I just feel this is so outrageous."
Uranium accounted for an eighth of the entire Soviet Union's exports to the United States last year, as sales soared to $110.4 million from just $2 million in 1986.
In its preliminary ruling on May 29, the Commerce Department imposed a duty of 115.82 percent on all types of uranium except the highly enriched uranium. The decision is subject to confirmation by the Commerce Department and the International Trade Commission before it becomes official, and the American uranium producers have filed legal briefs in the case asking that highly enriched uranium be included once more.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
NBC Still Aims for the Gold in Its Olympic Sales

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
If selling spots for the 1992 Summer Olympics were an Olympic event like a footrace, NBC would find the finish line to be tantalizingly close. But whether its performance was of gold-medal caliber would still be up to the judges.
The network has sold 96 to 97 percent of the $500 million worth of commercial time it has intended to make available during its 161 hours of Olympic coverage, which begins with the opening ceremonies on Saturday and continues through Aug. 9. That translates into upward of $480 million, a notable achievement in a daunting, recessionary climate plagued with slackened demand from advertisers to sponsor sports programming. 
 "I think they did a whale of a job in a tough economy," Paul Schulman, president of the Paul Schulman Company, a media-buying service in New York, said yesterday.
Andy Donchin, director of national broadcast at Media Buying Services International in New York, agreed. "It's impressive," he said. "I'm surprised they made it this close."
 
'Battered and Bruised'
 Yet close is, of course, still shy of a sellout -- an accomplishment that network sales departments seek with as much intensity and determination as athletes strive for Olympic medals. For instance, CBS, when it presented the Winter Olympics, managed to sell out all its commercial time just before those Games began in February.
"We're battered and bruised, but every time the bell rings, I answer it," said Larry Hoffner, executive vice president of sales at NBC in New York.
"We're not at our goal," he added, "but if we miss, we can't miss by much."
Mr. Hoffner said his challenge had been intensified by a fundamental shift in marketers' spending patterns. In contrast to previous years, when companies budgeted additional money for special events like the Olympics, he said, "now, the majority of funding is coming, not from corporate funds, but from brand budgets."
 
Less Earmarked Money
 Bert Fett, director of sports sales at John Blair & Company, the television sales-representative firm in New York, agreed. "There aren't a lot of advertisers who have earmarked funds specifically for the Olympics," he wrote in the current issue of the Blair Outlook newsletter.
Media buyers said that NBC's results were impressive, despite coming up short, because of the network's decision to avoid deeply discounting prices, which run around $335,000 for each 30-second prime-time Olympic spot.
"My staff and I are doing everything to get to that number," Mr. Hoffner said, referring to the 100 percent level, "but we don't want to do bad deals to get there."
The NBC sales efforts will continue through the Olympics, he added, as they did in 1988, when the network broadcast the summer games from Seoul, South Korea.
One potential advertiser yet to be heard from is Bush-Quayle '92. There has been widespread speculation that the national ad efforts from the President's re-election campaign might be inaugurated with a series of spots during the Olympics; it is a logical venue, given the patriotic feelings that the Games often inspire, especially if the United States is winning plenty of gold medals.
"We are looking at a number of different options," said Jack Irving, executive vice president and director of media operations at Saatchi & Saatchi Media Advantage in New York, "but we've not been given approval to buy anything at this point." His firm is sharing the campaign's media-buying duties with National Media Inc. in Alexandria, Va.
Though advertising and media executives are curious as to how NBC fares in selling commercial time for the Games, they are perhaps even more fascinated by the fate of the Olympics Triplecast. The pay-per-view presentation, being marketed by NBC and the Cablevision Systems Corporation, is a highly unusual experiment, offering 15 days of Olympics coverage on three cable channels for $125.
Most executives have insisted that few, if any, subscribers in local cable markets around the country will sign up, resulting in losses for the project as high as $100 million to $150 million. Some, though, looking to previous pay-per-view events, have suggested that a flood of last-minute subscribers is possible.
Mr. Schulman, the media buyer, said he disliked the Triplecast because the extensive commercial time that NBC devoted to promoting it "could have been used to get the country familiar with the U.S. Olympic team and to promote the Olympics," thus possibly raising NBC's broadcast ratings and delivering larger audiences to advertisers.
Television Digest, an industry newsletter, reported in this week's issue that even though the Triplecast "is generating significantly less customer interest" than NBC projected, the network's overall Olympic losses might run as low as $20 million to $50 million.
NBC "actually could break even," the report added, based on calculations that include additional revenues like the $75 million in new business the Olympics is expected to generate at NBC's six owned-and-operated stations.

Taxable Yields Fall Again; Tax-Exempts Rebound a Bit

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
Yields on taxable funds slipped a bit further in the latest week, according to IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report. The cut in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve three weeks ago is apparently still exerting downward pressure on taxable yields.
Yields on tax-exempt funds, however, rebounded slightly after a sharp slide. Investors have been withdrawing their money to invest in higher-yielding stocks and bonds. In addition, investors who had temporarily parked their income from a spate of municipal bond redemptions are also shifting those funds elsewhere. The outflow has given yields a small lift. 
 The seven-day compounded average yield for tax-exempt funds rose 12 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 2.21 percent. The simple yield rose by the same amount, to 2.06 percent. The 30-day compounded and simple yields each dipped 5 basis points, to 2.29 percent and 2.26 percent, respectively.
 
Long Maturities
 Walter S. Frank, chief economist at IBC/Donoghue's, said the assets of tax-exempt funds shrank a modest $581 million, to $96 billion. The average number of days left to maturity of tax-exempt securities held in fund portfolios slipped a day, to 62 days.
Mr. Frank noted that the long maturity suggested that investors were not especially concerned that interest rates would head higher.
In its weekly survey of tax-exempt funds with $100 million or more in assets, IBC/Donaghue's reported that the New York fund with the highest yield was the Boston Company New York Tax Free Money Fund, with a seven-day compounded yield of 2.54 percent. The top Connecticut fund was Fidelity Spartan Connecticut Municipal Money Market Portfolio, with a yield of 2.69 percent. And the leading New Jersey fund was the Vanguard New Jersey Tax Free Money Market Fund, with a yield of 2.53 percent.
Yields on taxable funds continued to slip as assets rose by $7.7 billion, to $501 billion. Institutional investors accounted for most of the increase in assets, which probably reflected the rocky stock market as well as the Fed's latest easing.
Money market yields typically descend more slowly than open market yields, so investors historically put money into funds for several months after the Fed cuts rates.
The average seven-day compounded yield for taxable funds was 3.24 percent, down 5 basis points. The simple yield also declined 5 basis points, to 3.19 percent. In the meantime, the 30-day compounded yield was down 5 basis points as well, to 3.31 percent.
The average days to maturity of the securities decreased a statistically insignificant one day, to 62 days.
This week's leader among taxable funds was the Olde Premium Plus Money Market series, with a seven-day compound yield of 4.01 percent, down 11 basis points from the previous week.

HEADLINE: Beer Dispute Flares Up Between U.S. and Ontario

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO, July 22

 BODY:
Ontario brewers are preparing for a new beer battle with the United States after learning that the Bush Administration's interagency Trade Policy Review Group has recommended a 50 percent import duty on Ontario beer.
The action is subject to approval by the Cabinet, and Canadians say they will retaliate in kind. 
 Kathy Lydon, the assistant United States trade representative for public affairs, said no final decision had been reached but said the trade representative's office was preparing to make an announcement on Friday.
The dispute over beer, after a peace accord "in principle" was reached in April, underscores the unusually high political sensitivity over trade issues that both Governments are wrestling with, as they combat economic sluggishness, prepare for elections and try to reach a free trade agreement with Mexico.
 
One of Many Disputes
 Beer is just one of a number of trade sectors, including steel, magnesium, lumber and pork, where the United States and Canada have clashed in recent months.
Both Canada and the United States have complained that the other was applying protectionist policies to maintain domestic beer production and employment and hinder cross-border shipments. Trade arbiters in Geneva under the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade have upheld the respective cases.
Canada agreed to steps to open its market in April, but as the two Governments sought to put the final details in place, the provincial government of Ontario, which has a fair amount of autonomy, introduced a 10-cent-a-can levy on beer cans, which enraged exporters from the United States, most of whose beer enters Canada in cans. Canadian brewers sell mostly in bottles.
In addition, the Liquor Control Board of Ontario has set a $2.53-a-case warehouse charge, which Canadian brewers do not pay. Ontario is Canada's largest province, where about 40 percent of all Canadians live.
Leading the fight for retaliation in the United States are the G. Heileman Brewing Company and the Stroh Brewery Company. The three largest American brewers -- the Anheuser-Busch Companies, the Coors Brewing Company and the Miller Brewing subsidiary of the Philip Morris Companies -- have longstanding licensing arrangements with the Canadian brewers under which their major brands are produced in Canada.
The projected new American levy, which would amount to about $3 on a case of 24 bottles, would hit Molson Breweries of Canada Ltd., the Labatt Brewing Company, Sleeman Brewing and Upper Canada Breweries.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Greenspan Comments Help Prices

BYLINE: BY KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities moved higher and interest rates declined yesterday, as credit market participants were encouraged by comments from Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, that suggested the Fed remained vigilant in the fight against inflation.
In response to a question during his appearance before a subcommittee of the House Banking Committee, Mr. Greenspan suggested that in coming years the Fed might lower its money supply growth targets. 
 Answering a question about money supply from Stephen L. Neal, a Democratic Congressman from North Carolina, Mr. Greenspan said the Fed's Open Market Committee was "generally in agreement that we have to bring the ranges down another notch to conform to our long-term goal of price stability."
 
'Anti-Inflation Bias'
 Steven A. Wood, director of financial markets research at the Bank of America, said Mr. Greenspan's comments "suggest to me there is still a very strong anti-inflation bias at the Fed."
"Even though Mr. Greenspan has admitted there is a breakdown between money growth and economic activity," he added, "there still seems to be enough of a connection between money and inflation to keep going."
In addition to Mr. Greenspan's comments, prices of Treasury securities also benefited from a further decline in stock prices abroad and in the United States, as well as from rumors that the Fed was selling short- to intermediate-term issues and buying bonds for a customer. Traders said the purchaser was rumored to be the German central bank.
"I don't know who is doing it, but someone is giving the long end a nice bid," a government-securities trader said. "And with the yield spread between two-year notes and bonds at 3.40 percentage points, there is a good reason to buy bonds."
In his testimony yesterday, Mr. Greenspan said that "long rates have a good way to go down if inflation expectations could be purged from the system."
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 29 1/2-year bonds of 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 104 1/2, up 18/32, to yield 7.61 percent, compared with 7.65 percent late Tuesday.
Among Treasury note issues outstanding, the 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 104 23/32, up 10/32, to yield 6.83 percent. And the 5 7/8 percent three-year notes were offered at 10 33/32, up 1/8 point, to yield 4.68 percent.
Yesterday afternoon the Treasury announced it would sell $15 billion of new two-year notes on Tuesday and $10.5 billion at an auction on Wednesday. The size of the auctions is unchanged from June.
In when-issued trading after the announcement, the new two-year notes were offered at a price to yield 4.30 percent, while the new five-year notes were offered at a price to yield 5.78 percent.
Rates on short-term Treasury bills fell, as the further decline in stock prices persuaded some investors to seek haven in safe short-term debt instruments.
Three-month bills were offered late yesterday at a discount rate of 3.15 percent, down three basis points, or three one-hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by two basis points, to a late offered rate of 3.22 percent.
New-issue activity accelerated in the corporate bond market.
Among the issuers was Ralph's Grocery Company, which priced $300 million of 10-year high-yield securities through underwriters led by Merrill Lynch & Company.
The 10 1/4 percent notes, which are noncallable for five years, were priced at $100, or par.
The issue is rated B-2 by Moody's Investors Service and B- by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
In the investment-grade corporate bond market, Merrill Lynch acted as lead manager for an offering of $300 million worth of 30-year debentures for the Province of Nova Scotia.
 
Tax-Exempt Rally
 The 8 1/4 percent noncallable debentures were priced at $98.20, to yield 8.415 percent, 77 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 percent bonds of 2021 at the time of pricing.
The securities are rated A-2 by Moody's and A- by Standard & Poor's.
The rally in the Treasury market spilled over into the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds.
Traders said that prices of most widely quoted securities improved by 3/8 point in fairly active trading.
"The market is in very good shape," a municipal securities trader said. "At the moment there are not enough bonds around, and there is too much money."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Mixed Trading for Dollar, While Gold Moves Higher

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar was mixed yesterday in sluggish trading, with money traders apparently worried that the central banks might take concerted action again to support the United States currency.
Gold prices rose to $358.90, up $1.30 from Tuesday's close. A late bid at the Republic National Bank of New York quoted gold at $357.50, up $1.50. 
 Kevin Logan, chief economist in the New York branch of the Swiss Bank Corporation, said comments by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, to a Congressional committee on Tuesday that the dollar should not fall much further "just reminded everybody the central bank is out there."
On Monday, the Fed and several other central banks intervened in the currency markets in a coordinated swoop, supporting the sagging dollar by purchasing large amounts of the currency and selling German marks. The mark had been rising because of an increase in German interest rates last week.
The dollar fell yesterday against the German mark in New York trading to 1.4850, compared with 1.4870 late Tuesday.
The dollar closed in New York at 126.63 yen, up from 125.25 yen Tuesday. In Tokyo overnight, the dollar closed at 125.42 yen, up 0.30 yen from Tuesday's close. In London, the dollar was quoted at 126.95 yen.
The British pound fell to $1.9065 in New York, from $1.9095 Tuesday. In London, the pound fell to $1.9025, from $1.9105 late Tuesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's rates, included: 1.3150 Swiss francs, down from 1.3235; 1,127 Italian lire, down from 1,130.00; 5.0145 French francs, down from 5.0245, and 1.1882 Canadian dollars, down from 1.19185.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday, were: 1.4885 German marks, up from 1.4880; 1.3215 Swiss francs, down from 1.3235; 5.0235 French francs, down from 5.0255; 1.6785 Dutch guilders, up from 1.6780; 1,128.50 Italian lire, down from 1,130.50, and 1.1903 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1925.
Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $359.38 an ounce, from $357.85 bid late Tuesday. In Zurich, it rose to a closing bid of $358.85, from a $357.90 bid late Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Will George Bush Read Their Lips?

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
A STIFF tax on gasoline . . . higher income taxes on the rich . . . caps on Social Security . . . tax incentives for business research and investment . . . more money for education and infrastructure . . .
To many analysts, Ross Perot's aborted call for shared sacrifice was the impossible dream that was, indeed, impossible -- tough common sense from a nonpolitician who in the end did not have the stomach to challenge a decade of national self-delusion. "I might have written it myself," said Benjamin Friedman, a Harvard economist who has been tirelessly proselytizing for deficit reduction since Ronald Reagan inaugurated the decade of what-me-worry economics. 
 But unlike Ross Perot's bid for White House gold, the plan may not be dead. For while one of the remaining candidates has offered a clear sense of how he would energize the economy, polls suggest that the other man is deeply in need of the vision thing.
"The Perot plan was the plan for the consummate outsider with nothing to lose," said Jeffrey Garten, an investment banker with the Blackstone Group and author of the new book "A Cold Peace." "But it might still become the plan for the consummate insider with nothing left to lose: George Bush."
Two scenarios, both admittedly longshots, are intriguing:
The Agent of Change. Count the reasons why candidate Bush would never embrace the Perot economic agenda. "The stickiest issue is taxes," said David Hale, an economist with the Kemper Financial Group. Tax proposals would offend key supporters -- everyone from hard-line supply-siders, who view higher levies on income as the devil's work, to suburban commuters who already resent paying $1.19 a gallon for unleaded regular. Indeed, Mr. Bush has made no secret that he regrets the day he broke his no-tax pledge.
Then there is the matter of momentum: Any radical policy shift would face opposition from the White House-Treasury coalition that crafted Mr. Bush's 1993 budget proposal. "I bristle at the dismissal of our effort to cut spending on entitlements," said John Taylor, who recently returned to Stanford University after a tour of duty on the President's Council of Economic Advisers.
If enacted, Mr. Taylor argues, the Administration's proposals would allow the economy to grow its way out of big deficits. And while the Congressional Budget Office politely demurs -- it forecasts a rising deficit after 1996 under Bush policies -- there is certainly an impulse to justify the last few months' politically punishing effort to stay the course.
But 20-point-plus debits in the opinion polls have a way of focusing politicians' minds. So do economic forecasts, echoed this week by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, that unemployment is certain to remain stuck above 7 percent through the election. And surely one lesson of the career of the man who coined the phrase "voodoo economics" is that Mr. Bush is capable of changing his mind -- indeed, his political persona -- when the votes of millions of would-be Perotists are on the line.
Were the President to abandon budget business as usual, he would probably not have to look far for moral support. While supply-siders, the anti-tax ideologues in the Republican Party, wield influence beyond their numbers in Congress, most Administration tacticians believe in fighting deficits the old-fashioned way.
Mr. Bush's budget director, Richard Darman, reportedly toyed with proposing a gasoline tax before the invasion of Kuwait blew the lid off energy prices. And he has certainly never hidden his frustration with the Administration's failure to tame the great engines of escalating Federal spending, Social Security and Medicare.
The January Surprise. One reason for discounting the prospects of a pre-election conversion is that Mr. Bush's campaign advisers can still make a plausible case for toughing it out. The President can win, the argument goes, if he can hang onto Republican redoubts in the South and West, and then pick off a few Rust Belt states.
But suppose Mr. Bush does manage to squeak back into office, there to face a hostile Democratic majority in Congress. Would he hunker down to what seems likely to be four more years of tepid growth, political fingerpointing and policy gridlock?
Mr. Hale thinks not. "This would be President Bush's last term," he noted, "the time to do the dirty work." If he struck early and hard, he might regain the respect he has frittered away since the gulf war. And if he is at all inclined to take the chance, he might well be quietly egged on by Republican Presidential hopefuls -- everyone from Dan Quayle to James Baker -- who would be eager to remove the deficit albatross before they faced the voters in 1996.
A war on the deficit would be hard to win, of course, because the enemy is almost all of us. "But even if he went down with the program," argued Mr. Garten, "it would be a better way to lose."

New Lines Hold Hope For Chrysler

BYLINE: By Doron P. Levin

 BODY:
FEW new products from Detroit in recent years have provoked as much curiosity on Wall Street as the Chrysler Corporation's midsized models, code-named L/H and set to be sold as the Dodge Intrepid, Eagle Vision and Chrysler Concorde.
Accordingly, several financial analysts took the unusual step this week of attending the L/H debut in Rancho Santa Fe, Calif., held principally for automotive journalists. 
 The debut, held in three sessions to accommodate everyone, consisted of technical briefings by Chrysler executives and test drives of Intrepids, Visions and Concordes over several hundred miles through horse country and the 112-degree heat of Borrego Springs, Calif.
Cars made by competitors were available, too. So analysts and reviewers could drive a $19,000 Intrepid for a while, and then switch to a $30,000 Acura Legend to see how they compared.
Too often in the past, Chrysler cars compared poorly.
Hobbled by rock-bottom credit ratings and unfinanced pension liabilities of some $4 billion, Chrysler now needs a "home run" car to restore financial stability and confidence. The Ford Motor Company -- and its common stock -- received just such a lift in the mid-80's when its Taurus and Sable midsized models became smash hits.
Analysts were optimistic when they saw hand-built L/H prototypes last year. But they were eager to assess how L/H's built on production tooling compared with cars like the Taurus, Toyota Camry and the Legend, which are competitive on either size or price. They were also keen to hear professional judgments of automotive reviewers, because their recommendations often shape consumers' early buying patterns.
"Certainly some cars the reviewers love don't sell well," said Jerry G. Paul, automotive analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, which owns about 20 million Chrysler shares. "But it's a lot easier for a car to sell well if they love it than if they don't."
The reaction of Kathy Hamilton, senior editor of Automobile magazine, seemed to exemplify what most automotive writers were saying: "The consensus was that this is an exceptional automobile. It definitely was major league, in my opinion, and the first American car I've seen in a long time that you could call state of the art."
Reviews of the L/H cars will begin appearing next week; the cars will trickle into dealerships during August and September and become more readily available later in the fall.
Chrysler executives say the L/H proves they have been able to restructure their development process from a hierarchical system to a team system, in the manner of the best of their Japanese competitors.
Most of the 22 automotive analysts tracked by Zaks Investment Research in Chicago are already recommending either a full-fledged buy or a buy-hold on Chrysler stock. The main reason for the buy signal is that the economy is in an early phase of recovery, which usually spells price appreciation for the cyclical automotive stocks. But if the L/H succeeds "it could give the stock an especially strong tailwind," Mr. Paul said.
Analysts warn that Chrysler must still prove it can maintain the quality of the L/Hs's when the assembly line cranks up to speed. And the economy must grow robustly enough to provide buyers. Given those caveats, the L/H could once more turn Chrysler stock into a great turnaround story.
Harvey Heinbach, Merrill Lynch's automotive analyst, said that driving the L/H and listening to reviewers extol its virtues reinforced his confidence in the No. 3 auto maker. If Chrysler sells 225,000 L/H's annually, pretax profit could top $1.1 billion, he estimated, representing a gross profit of $5,000 a car -- about what Chrysler earned during its best years from its highly profitable mini-van.
The depressed price of Chrysler stock during the last two years reflects the auto maker's recent earnings performance: break-even in 1990 followed by a $795 million loss last year. But unlike Ford and the General Motors Corporation, Chrysler's balance sheet remains scarred by its near-bankruptcy in the early 1980's. The auto maker can no longer borrow money in public credit markets.
In December, when Chrysler was forced to raise $350 million of new equity, its common stock was selling for roughly $10 a share. That compared with a peak of $48 a share just before the market crash of 1987. Yesterday, shares closed at $18.50, down 62.5 cents.

Times Mirror Net Up 54%

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, July 22

 BODY:
The Times Mirror Company said today that its second-quarter profits rose nearly 54 percent despite charges arising from job cuts at Newsday and weak newspaper advertising revenues.
The company, which also publishes The Los Angeles Times, said it had earned $47.2 million, or 37 cents a share, on revenues of $911.4 million in the quarter. That compared with profits of $30.7 million, or 24 cents a share, on revenues of $900.9 million a year earlier. 
 Operating profits rose by 16.5 percent in the company's book and magazine publishing group, by 10.6 percent in cable television and by 27.3 percent in broadcast television operations.
The charges related to Newsday totaled 10 cents a share, Times Mirror said. Upon completion of the Newsday buyout program, which covers about 300 employees, staff levels will be down 8 percent from a year earlier.
The company said newspaper advertising revenues continued to be hurt by weakness in the Southern California and New York regional economies.
Newspaper publishing revenue fell 1.8 percent and operating profit was off 23.4 percent from the comparable quarter of 1991, the company said.
Times Mirror also publishes New York Newsday, The Baltimore Sun and The Hartford Courant.
The company's shares dropped 25 cents today, to $34, on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Republicans;
FACING PRESSURE, BUSH IS ADAMANT ON KEEPING QUAYLE

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 22

 BODY:
With pressures mounting within his own party for further measures to revitalize his re-election campaign, President Bush denied today that he was even considering the possibility of replacing Vice President Dan Quayle.
Deeply concerned about the President's dismal standing in the polls, two groups of Republican Senators, in separate meetings, held what Senator Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming, the minority whip, described as "spirited discussions of what should be done" to get the flagging campaign moving again. 
 One participant in the meeting of the Wednesday Club, to which mostly moderate Republicans belong, said at least half the 15 or so Senators there either explicitly or implicitly said Mr. Quayle should be dropped from the ticket.
 
Opinion Sharply Divided
 The replacement of the Vice President was also Topic A today among Republican campaign workers, state party officials and strategists, with opinion sharply divided as to whether a change would help to reverse the precipitious slide in popularity that has imperiled Mr. Bush's re-election.
The President appeared to leave open not the slightest possibility of a change in the ticket. Asked at a White House photo session whether the Vice President's status was shaky, Mr. Bush replied, "No, it's very certain." He dismissed the talk about replacing Mr. Quayle as "a lot of crazy rumors."
David Beckwith, Mr. Quayle's spokesman, said the Vice President would not step down voluntarily, adding: "If he seriously thought it would help the President, he would do it. But he doesn't think that, and neither does the President."
 
'Goes With the Territory'
 "I'd just soon not have the stories but it goes with the territory," Mr. Quayle said in an hourlong appearance tonight on CNN's "Larry King Live.""Believe me if I thought that I was hurting the ticket, I'd be gone. I want George Bush re-elected, so my decision is predicated on what is best for the President."
The statements of denial did little to quiet the fever of speculation in Washington. Instead, in the often perverse logic of the capital, they fed the storm, with political professionals sensing that something must be afoot.
There were also widespread calls on Capitol Hill for the dismissal of Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and the budget director, Richard G. Darman, said participants in the meetings of the Wednesday Club and the Steering Committee, the other Republican Senators' group. Some nervous incumbents said that as things now stood the Republicans might lose four to six Senate seats.
One indication of the disarray in the party, said Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, was that most Republican Senators had little interest in attending the party's convention next month, preferring to keep their distance.
An Associated Press poll indicated that 4 in 10 Republicans nationwide thought Mr. Quayle should be dropped from the ticket. Few Republican Senators suggested that he deserved, on the merits of the case, to be replaced; indeed, most said he had done a good job.
Yet some, like Senator Lugar, said Mr. Bush needed to "send a signal that by its very drama tells people that this is a whole new ball game, a new campaign with a new game plan and a new vigor." He said he thought that "a dramatic statement about growth and jobs" would produce the best results, but conceded that other lawmakers, "stunned by what they have heard at home in their states the last two weeks," thought Mr. Quayle should go.
 
Concern Over Bush's Health
 Others, like Senator Warren B. Rudman of New Hampshire, said many voters were concerned about Mr. Bush's health, "whether there's any ground for it or not," and that made them worry about Mr. Quayle, whom many would not trust with the Presidency. It was not fair, Mr. Rudman added, "but it exists, and people have gone to the President to tell him about this."
The discussion about a new Vice-Presidential candidate centered on Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, who is believed to be as acceptable to conservatives as Mr. Quayle. Most Republican politicians believe that Housing Secretary Jack F. Kemp, another popular conservative, would find it hard to work closely with Mr. Bush.
Until the Los Angeles riots in late April and early May, Mr. Kemp was all but ostracized by the White House, and his often innovative ideas were usually given short shrift.
But Mr. Cheney might present problems, too. He has had a history of heart problems and has undergone bypass surgery, although he appears to be in robust health now.
Even the chance that Mr. Quayle, a former colleague, might be sacrificed clearly pained most of the Republican Senators. Mr. Rudman, for example, said, "He's a lot better than most people seem to think, and he's a very good friend of most of us, but the public perception is just not very good."
Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York also mentioned concerns about the President's health as an element hurting Mr. Quayle, and said the White House "is going to have to come to grips with this, sooner or later."
The President and his physician have both denied that he has any serious health problems.
"There is no Bush campaign now," Mr. D'Amato said. "We have to make changes, get rid of Darman and Brady, and get bold, decisive leadership."
Many Republican insiders have come to believe in the days since the Democratic convention that Mr. Bush would be obliged to consider dropping Mr. Quayle by the very perilousness of his situation. But most, like Senator John McCain of Arizona, said they thought the President would refuse to do so because of his strong belief in loyalty to subordinates and because of political reality.
"He should have fired Brady and Darman a long time ago, but that isn't his way," Mr. McCain said. "The only way Quayle will go is if he concludes that this battering is bad for him and the party, which is certainly possible."
By replacing Mr. Quayle, Mr. Bush would be tacitly admitting that he had erred in choosing Mr. Quayle in the first place, and he would be breaking his repeated pledges to keep him on the ticket. And it might not solve the problem. As the Vice President's aides and backers argued feverishly today, Mr. Bush has had both good ratings and bad with Mr. Quayle at his side.
 
'Bush Has a Bush Problem'
 "Bush doesn't have a Quayle problem," said Richard A. Viguerie, a conservative consultant, in a comment typical of Quayle supporters. "Bush has a Bush problem. Dan Quayle musn't be scapegoated in the President's re-election strategy. President Bush's troubles are a direct result of his failed economic policies."
The pending switch of Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d from diplomacy to campaign management appeared to be one factor feeding the speculation. A senior Republican who rode the Bush campaign plane four years ago commented, "I saw how bitterly Jim Baker resented the selection of Quayle then, and I have to believe he will try to move him out as soon as he takes control."
That is expected to take place in mid-August, before the Republican convention opens in Houston. Asked about a news article in The New York Times this morning reporting the change, Mr. Bush's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said that "it's all speculation," but did not deny it.
Traveling in the Middle East, Mr. Baker also avoided a denial, but he said, "Until you hear it from the President of the United States and the Secretary of State of the United States, I wouldn't make book on it."
But most Republican politicians and campaign strategists took it as a done deal, and said they wished Mr. Baker was available tomorrow.
"I'm delighted that Jim Baker's coming back," said Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr. of South Carolina, the Southern chairman of the Bush effort. Asked if he was sure the switch was definite, the Governor answered firmly, "Baker will be back."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Democrats;
Bus Trip Leaves Bandwagon Air For Time Being

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS, July 22

 BODY:
More than 25,000 office workers, labor unionists and curious onlookers jammed the streets for blocks around the city's main public library today to give the Democratic ticket of Gov. Bill Clinton and Senator Al Gore an ecstatic salute at the final stop of their six-day bus tour.
The 1,240-mile trip, which took the campaign through eight states with rallies along superhighways and two-lane rural roads, at times eclipsed its planners' efforts to make it exciting. While the results were occasionally chaotic, they provided the Democrats with continuing coverage after the intensity of the New York convention.
 
Promises a Rescue
 
 Stripped to his shirtsleeves and drenched in sweat at a humid lunchtime rally, Mr. Clinton gave an old-fashioned tub thumper of a speech as he promised to rescue the American people from a Government that he says cares and does too little for average people.
"If you're sick and tired of the way it's been going," he said, "if you want the American people in control again, if you believe your country is still the greatest country in the world, if you think we can compete and win again, if you're tired of being heartbroken when you go home at night and you want a spring in your step and a song in your heart, you give Al Gore and I a chance to bring America back."
"We'll lift the country up," he said, as the sound of applause rolled down the streets and bounced off office buildings. "It's time for them to go. It's time for us to rescue America."
Recognizing that pictures often leave a more lasting impression than words, the Clinton-Gore ticket tried this week to take from the Bush Administration its claim to represent family values. Standing on platforms with their wives, Hillary Clinton and Tipper Gore, the candidates waved, applauded and whipped up the crowd into chants as hired crews filmed the events for campaign commercials.
Frank Greer, one of the campaign's media strategists, said the Democrats do not plan to televise commercials before next month's Republican National Convention unless they are attacked first.
"It would be icing on the cake," Mr. Greer said. "I don't think we need to waste money on commercial advertising right now."
In Vandalia, Ill., thousands of people waited for hours Tuesday to see the Democratic ticket, lit candles after they spoke and waited more than an hour afterward for a closer glimpse or an opportunity to touch the Clintons and Gores.
In dozens of interviews, people in the crowds Tuesday and today spoke most often about the need to elect a candidate whose views they share on jobs, health care, abortion and crime prevention. They mentioned family values only when specifically asked.
"He may be trying to put a wholesome family image across now because of his past problems," said Sue Albrecht, a clerk from St. Louis who heard Mr. Clinton speak today. "He won't get my vote on that issue. No one will. I think there are too many other important issues." She said she was "on the fence" about Mr. Clinton because he favors abortion rights.
 
Mutual Admiration
 The image the campaign has cultivated on the tour, that of two devoted young families, has been obvious. On Sunday, Mrs. Clinton rubbed her husband's back as they sat side by side on hay bales. On Tuesday, the Gores held hands as they walked down the street. And each day, Mrs. Gore and Mrs. Clinton -- arms linked around each other's waists -- waved at crowds and then stepped into the background to gaze adoringly while their husbands spoke.
Initial plans to have the Gores drop off the bus in Louisville, Ky., on Monday to return to Tennessee were scrapped after strategists realized that the Clintons and Gores together were causing some of the reaction.
"We hoped it would just send a signal that we were going to run a serious, people-oriented campaign," said George Stephanopoulos, the campaign's communications director. "Instead, we got a signal back from the American people."
Aides to the Clinton campaign said more joint campaigning is planned. They are also scouting out new motorcade routes for future bus tours.
The apparent success of the bus tour together with recent polls showing Mr. Clinton with a significant lead over the President, seem to have stung the Republicans. President Bush has dispatched surrogate speakers to at least three stops along the way. Vice President Dan Quayle, Labor Secretary Lynn Martin and a domestic policy adviser, Clayton K. Yeutter, made separate taped or live appearances in Pittsburgh, Louisville and St. Louis.
"Governor Clinton does not have one-tenth the stature the President has all over the world," Mr. Yeutter said. "The American people are going to wake up and realize this."
And in Washington, Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, called Mr. Gore "Mr. Sellout America" for supporting stronger environmental planks than the President did at the recent world environmental summit in Rio de Janeiro.
"Now he tries to talk about economic growth when he spent a week in Rio saying 'the heck with the economy, sell it out to the environment,' " Mr. Fitzwater said.
Both Democrats dismissed the White House criticism today. Mr. Clinton said that Senator Gore "tried to help America lead the world again" during his participation in the environmental summit. The Republicans, he said, "are going to attack us for their failures."
Mr. Gore said that by recruiting Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d to rescue its flagging fortunes, the Bush-Quayle campaign was "getting desperate."
"I think you're seeing with the decision to pull Secretary of State Jim Baker -- the best they've got -- out of the Middle East peace talks at a critical moment to concentrate on politics is a sign of panic in the White House," Mr. Gore said.
The Clinton forces seem supremely confident as they watch at least some of Mr. Clinton's message take hold. The caravan's path through small towns often took on the feeling of a Fourth of July parade.
At the end of the rally today, dozens of people lined up to autograph the Gore-Clinton banners that were attached to the buses.
Mr. Clinton's route through the Middle West steered away from inner city neighborhoods, and there was little evidence that an effort had been made to attract the traditional Democratic constituencies of minorities and organized-interest groups.
An aide to Mr. Clinton said such forays would be made in the future. But for the first week, he said, the Democratic ticket wanted to make its presence felt in battleground states.
"The thing that kills a country is when people get up every day and they don't think tomorrow is going to be better," Mr. Clinton said. "We want to restore to this country a genuine sense of community and caring, to say we're all in this together. We're going up or down together without regard to race or region or income. This is America. Let's start acting like it again."

Clinton Is Welcomed Home

LITTLE ROCK, Ark., July 22 (Special to The New York Times) -- Governor Clinton was greeted by a cheerful crowd of several hundred campaign workers and supporters when he returned home this evening for a welcome rally outside his national headquarters.
"We have just a little over 100 days in this campaign," Mr. Clinton said, before signing dozens of autographs and greeting his hometown well-wishers.
"One hundred days of struggle and effort; 100 days of spirit and hope. I want you to know that no matter how tough it gets and how long the days get, we're going to stay to the end, and we're going to win this campaign because of people like you."

HEADLINE: In Free Trade, Mexico Sees An Economy in U.S. Image

SERIES: A New North America -- Last of three articles.

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MONTERREY, Mexico

 BODY:
When Mexico dreams of itself as a free-trading country, it imagines Monterrey.
Driving through this rugged city in a Mexican-made Ford or a Mexican Chevrolet, the vision comes into focus against the jagged spine of the Sierra Madre. Past the freshly painted houses of factory workers and the apartment buildings sprouting satellite dishes, the elegant quarters of big industrial companies stare out from a hillside. Beside the rusted carcass of what was the largest foundry in Latin America, 250,000 square feet of new convention center glow in rainbow colors.
 
New Commercial Landscape
 
 Past a Blockbuster Video outlet, the Burger King and the Sirloin Stockade, a sign in Spanish reads, National Lumberyard. But the structure from which it rises isn't that at all. As a joint venture would have it, the store is Mexican but the shelves are stocked by True Value Hardware; even the nails come from the United States.
After half a century of devout economic nationalism, Mexico's embrace of a proposed North American Free Trade Agreement has crystalized changes in everything from the way the country does business to the way that it looks.
To an extent that is difficult to fathom in the United States or Canada, where the treaty would mean far less economic or social change, the idea of a union with two big, rich neighbors has come to dominate the Mexican imagination.
In the future that President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has proffered to his countrymen, free trade has become a guarantee of their deliverance from underdevelopment. The rapid Americanization that has already taken place in Mexico's consumer culture whispers that the economy, too, might be transformed in America's image.
But the expectations of a new prosperity are at best unevenly shared. In some industries, the pain of adjusting to foreign competition is just starting to be felt. Ancient factories, decrepit infrastructure and poor, uneducated workers challenge the idea of competing at all. At the other end of Mexico from Monterrey, the fear of being left behind is palpable.
In the steam heat of Tuxtepec, a river town set a few dozen miles inland from the Gulf of Mexico in the southern state of Oaxaca. Andrea Solis Ramon, 23 years old, said she believed free trade had changed some things already. But as she stood across railroad tracks from a dilapidated sugar mill and scolded the tiny children running shoeless through her garbage and mango peels, she did not include herself among them.
"There are imported products in the stores, but who can buy them?" asked Miss Solis, who has neither a husband nor a job. "We only buy rice, sugar, beans, soap and bleach." She counted the items slowly on her fingers.
"For the peasants, for us, it is nothing," she went on. "It is only for the big businesses. There is no work here, and that is not going to change with this free trade."
Trade officials from Mexico, the United States and Canada are expected to reach an agreement within weeks. The accord must then be ratified by the legislative bodies of all three countries, a process that will likely take until next year.
 
The Meaning
Investment, Jobs, Political Change
 While trade barriers have been falling in Mexico since 1987, the agreement has come to represent infinitely more than new rules of commerce. Even in the hierarchy of economic benefits, it is less important as a means to open foreign markets than as a magnet for foreign capital.
As the flow of foreign investment quickens, there are to be better wages, stronger industries, and cheaper, more efficient services. According to a study by the Institute of International Economics in Washington, Mexico would gain 600,000 jobs by 1995. Subsequent governments will be bound by treaty to continue the economic opening, Mr. Salinas has argued, and the development of the economy will beget democratic political change.
"I don't want Mexicans leaving the country anymore," he said last year, "only our products."
But nothing quite like the merger that the 43-year-old Harvard-educated President is proposing for his country has ever been tried before.
The Mexican economy is one-twentieth the size of America's. It is full of bottlenecks, inefficiencies and failing companies that still hang on. Under the expected terms of the treaty, Mr. Salinas's third-world nation will have to integrate with its first-world neighbors more quickly (though less fully) than Spain or Greece did in joining the European Community. And it will receive nothing like the regional-development funds that the European club gave its new members.
In its sales pitches abroad, the Salinas administration tends to concentrate on its market of 85 million consumers, the tariffs it has brought down to an average of 11 percent and the looser investment regulations that are to follow a trade agreement.
For many foreign companies, however, the essential attraction is still cheap labor. Mexicans' per capita annual income is $3,458; that of Americans, $22,690, and Canadians, $21,245. Even in big industrial companies in Monterrey, assembly-line workers are paid as little as $5 a day.
By its de facto control over most of the Mexican media, the Salinas Government has projected a more consistently positive image of the accord than either of its North American counterparts could hope to do. The Government's success in ending nearly a decade of economic crisis has also inspired many Mexicans, even among the nearly 40 million who live in poverty, to grasp its vision without reserve.
 
The Fears
New Competition Will Be Tough
 Yet while opinion polls show that Mexicans support a trade agreement by a large majority, interviews with scores of laborers, businessmen and farmers suggest a country nearly as skewed in its allocations of confidence as it is in the distribution of its wealth.
Corn farmers who survive on a crop for which the Government now pays them twice the world price have drawn only some reassurance from officials' promises that the price supports will continue for more than a decade. Small-business owners worry that they might face extinction, though they cannot foresee how or when. In industries like chemicals and textiles, plastics and automotive parts, the mortality rate for companies has already shot upward.
Despite Mr. Salinas's call for a new, more confident nationalism, there is also widespread unease about partnership with a country that has stood larger in Mexican history as an adversary than as an ally.
"There are going to be dead and wounded," said Adrian Gonzalez, a manufacturer of steel shapes who heads the Monterrey Chamber of Commerce. "This is going to be like those winters in the United States and Canada. The snow will come and kill all the pests."
In the last three years, about 3,000 of Mr. Gonzalez's 22,000 affiliated businesses have shut down. Some 2,000 new enterprises have joined. Elsewhere as well, Mexican companies accustomed to much more government protection have begun to fail at a rate more like that of the United States, economists say.
 
The Promise
Better Standard Of Living for All
 Boiled down, the promise for Mexico is that by fixing investment rules, magnifying its manufacturing and assembly advantages, and opening paths into both its own market and those of its bigger, richer neighbors, the treaty will draw new business from North America, Europe and Asia.
That capital, officials say, will raise people's living standards as it slowly narrows the gap between Mexican wages and those paid across the border. In raising annual economic growth by 1 or 2 percent, it will also provide the Government a cushion to continue structural changes in the economy.
Aides to Mr. Salinas argue that the sharpest pains of Mexico's adjustment have already been felt, and some independent economists agree.
During the foreign debt crisis that exploded here in 1982, they note, companies were forced to slash work forces and increase efficiency to an extent that domestic competition never required. A withering internal market also prompted some that had never thought about exporting to look abroad. No longer satisfied with the savings of cheap labor, large industrial concerns now routinely scrutinize their production costs against foreign benchmarks.
"There has been a very important change in productivity," said Jesus Reyes Heroles, an economist who heads the Mexico City consulting firm GEA.
The end of import permits and the fall of tariffs has helped bring down the double- and triple-digit inflation that eroded lower incomes severely for a decade; Mexican manufacturers have had to lower their prices in the face of new foreign competition.
Moreover, the increase in American products and franchises has not always hurt local business. Mexicans often own, staff and supply the new businesses, distribute the new goods and provide the new services.
But the modernization taking place from textile mills to supermarkets is one that took a generation or much more in developed countries. The free-trade agreement will give Mexico only a few years.
"We've been in the free-trade mode ever since we started coming to Mexico in 1990," Thomas O. Mudd, the managing director of Blockbuster Mexico, said, sounding as though he were harking back to another time. "We felt that Mexico was becoming hot, and now look at it -- it's the hottest country in the world!"
In a market cluttered with the same sort of mom-and-pop rental stores that it took on in the United States, Blockbuster opened its first Mexican store in September. Within less than nine months, it had 15 scattered around the country. Plans are for 300 by the end of 1996.
 
The Revolution
Retailing Sector In an Upheaval
 If change is spreading everywhere across the Mexican economy, then retailing is in the throes of a revolution.
Even a few years ago, discount stores were almost unheard of in Mexico. Markdowns and sales, when they occurred, were a product of bankruptcy or economic crisis, and a handful of big supermarket and department-store chains could comfortably extract profits of 30 percent or more.
But driving north along the smog-laced highway that circles Mexico City, in the plastic, strip-mall world that is Ciudad Satelite, or Satellite City, one now finds el Price Club and Club Aurrera.
The two steel and concrete warehouses sell mostly to Mexican businesses, offering the large quantities at low prices typical of hypermarkets. The first of what are to be at least a dozen Price Clubs within five years is a 50-50 joint venture of the San Diego-based company and Commercial Mexicana S.A., a Mexican grocer. Opened on Feb. 29, it already has 65,000 members, a subscription rate that its chief executive, Jaime Gonzalez, says is "unheard of" in the United States.
In the cavernous Club Aurrera, part of a $20 million joint venture of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. of Bentonville, Ark., and the Mexican retailing giant Cifra S.A., the phenomenon is explained by Jesus Real, a 43-year-old dry goods merchant in the city of Queretaro, 93 miles away.
As he is interviewed, Mr. Real moves through the store slowly, hauling a pallet stacked with a ton and a half of sacked beans, instant coffee and boxes of Kellogg cereal. His bill comes to nearly $10,000, but Mr. Real describes this as a bargain. By no longer shopping at Mexico City's teeming Central Market like other grocers, he says, he has saved not only $2.25 on each sack of beans but bribe money for the police, tips to the self-appointed parking attendants and the small rocks usually mixed with his beans.
Like Wal-Mart and the Price Company, many American and Canadian investors have sought Mexican help to interpret consumers, circumnavigate Government rules, and set up distribution networks. With few exceptions, big Mexican food companies have either joined forces with, sold out to, or been overrun by foreign counterparts in the last two years.
"I've yet to find a company of medium or large size that is oblivious to what's happening," said Carlos Lukac, a vice president in Mexico City of the consulting firm Booz, Allen & Hamilton. But being aware of competition does not necessarily seem to mean being prepared for it.
 
The Advantages
Mexicans Know Their Markets
 Constantino Lacayo, a vice president of Offset Multicolor, conceded that his printing company, which did $30 million in sales last year, was vulnerable to American and Canadian rivals. But he said: "We think we can give our clients a quality of service that only one Mexican can give another. It is going to take them a long time to understand the market."
In Glasgow, Ky., however, the American printer R.R. Donnelley has already added 10 Mexican publications to a client list that rang up $3.9 billion in sales last year. Two years ago, Donnelley opened a plant in Reynosa, on the Texas border, and it recently bought a large printing company in central Mexico.
"We have considerable respect for the local parties," said James M. Ratcliffe, Donnelley's vice president for corporate relations. "But having said that, we wouldn't have moved into Mexico if we didn't think we could compete successfully."
 
The Contrasts
Two Regions, Worlds Apart
 In larger industries especially, the drop in Mexican tariffs has fostered a whole new series of private-sector demands on the Government. Steelmakers complain of higher electricity costs. Cattle ranchers say they pay too much more for their feed. The deregulation of areas like trucking and the reduction of corruption and labor union control at key ports and border crossings allow goods to move more smoothly but Mexican exporters say they can still be crippled by the added costs of inflation and faulty services.
The prospect that these difficulties will be temporary seems clearest in Monterrey. Of the 18 banks auctioned in the Government's recently concluded selloff, nearly half were bought by local industrialists. The city boasts the best-educated people in Mexico, the highest wages, the greatest concentration of satellite dishes. It is home to both of the country's two major multinational companies, the glass maker Vitro S.A., and the cement manufacturer Cementos Mexicanos S.A., which is known as Cemex.
The state Governor, Socrates Rizzo, said in an interview, "We are moving toward the integration of Texas and northeastern Mexico in a single region." And there is much to support the claim. Within months, a new highway will cut the driving time to San Antonio from six hours to four and a half, speeding the imports of Borden milk that is already on grocery shelves. General Motors has a big automotive plant nearby, and scores of other American and Canadian businesses have set up shop over the last three years.
But for every Monterrey, there seem to be at least a few Tuxtepecs.
By its own definition, the city of about 150,000 people would qualify as a pole of development for the destitute state of Oaxaca. There is a "Tuxtepec Industrial Park," although it is thigh-deep in grass and its only three structures -- an ice factory, a sawmill and a metal workshop -- have all closed. Yet as cows graze peacefully, the mood is so far from that of Monterrey as to belong to another country. In the afternoon, the air seems thick enough to have pulled the mangoes down from their trees; no one picks them up, and they perfume the squalid landscape as they rot.
Outside the town, Gaudencio Medina slumps in the thin shadow of his hedge and tells the history of the paper factory where he has worked for 32 of his 48 years. It began in 1958, he says, when the the President came to lay the cornerstone. Everything was fine until a couple of years ago.
"Now they tell us our paper is no good, that it's not like the paper in the United States," he says. "One of the machines is shut down and 420 workers who depended on that factory one way or another are already out. We don't know why they have abandoned us like this."

HEADLINE: Big and Little Reunions For Black Americans

BYLINE: By ENID NEMY

 BODY:
THEY stood in the doorways of the Stop 1 Supermarket, the Red Hook Chinese Kitchen, Freddy's Fast Cleaners and other small businesses, smiling, waving and looking delighted and puzzled as the 28-piece marching band strutted and danced along Van Brunt Street in Brooklyn at noon on Saturday.
They waved, too, at the matriarch sitting in the horse-drawn carriage that followed, who acknowledged their greetings with a gracious nod and a flutter of a hand reminiscent of Britain's Queen Mother. Most of the crowd had no idea what the woman, the people marching behind the carriage or the black and gold uniformed band from the Jackie Robinson Center in Brooklyn were doing on their street. But before the entourage had reached the entrance to Coffey Park, word had spread among the curious. The procession was a prelude to what was believed to be the biggest African-American family reunion ever held in Red Hook. 
 It was, too, a tribute to the head of that family, a 77-year-old woman named Grace (Mudgie) Stevens who with her husband, Thomas, left St. George, S.C., in 1937 and ended up in Brooklyn some 30 years ago. The reunion, with its white and purple T-shirts printed with family names and the rubric "When you know where you come from, It's easy to see where you're going," was similar in format to many others being held across the country this summer.
Although black family reunions have been going on for generations, they proliferated after the publication of Alex Haley's "Roots" in 1976 and the television mini-series the following year. And the last seven years have seen a phenomenal increase in the number of participants. For example, more than six million people have attended the black family weekend reunions that the National Council of Negro Women began in 1986. While many participate in small family reunions at these weekend gatherings, many more come to festival activities as part of a symbolic extended family. In addition, the amount of money participants spend is significant to businesses in the host cities.
The council's original program in Washington, a weekend festival combined with family reunions, has expanded to seven cities -- Washington, Philadelphia Chicago, Los Angeles, Cincinnati, Memphis and Atlanta. Los Angeles, which attracted 150,000 people to Exposition Park for its first weekend celebration, expects a total of some 600,000 at its Aug. 7 weekend this year. Cincinnati had a total of 200,000 at Sawyers Point in 1990. More than 50,000 people turned up for the first day of Chicago's reunion weekend in Grant Park earlier this month.
Queen L. Gladden, national director of the celebrations, noted that "the whole idea is the restoration and strengthening of black families and emphasizing traditional values."
"It's a broad picture," she said, "an extended family reunion as well as reunions of immediate family and friends. People usually come and bring their families and meet other family members. You'll see family groups with T-shirts, but you'll also see just two members of a family, a mother and daughter, or just a person alone."
The weekend festivals are coordinated by the National Council of Negro Women. There are commercial sponsors of pavilions and activities.
Dr. Dorothy I. Height, president of the council, said: "We've had some six million in attendance in the last six years and not a single police incident. We started these weekends in response to the negative projection of the vanishing black family, and we plan the family reunions within the festivals."
The format for most of the reunion weekends begins with an invitation-only leadership forum, reception and prayer breakfast. The remainder of the weekend, open to everyone, is concentrated around picnics, pavilions dealing with family values, health, drugs, education, the arts and, Dr. Height said, "our African heritage and contribution to this country, showing we are not a problem people but people with a problem." There are, as well, African-American marketplaces and vendors.
The Stevens-Shuler festivities in Brooklyn (Shuler was Mrs. Stevens's maiden name) began with a blessing offered by Nellie Stevenson, a family member who is an evangelist, and continued through the afternoon with entertainment and with presentations by members of the Emergency Medical Service and of the Police and Fire departments. There was also an information poster on subjects ranging from the environment to AIDS.
With the exception of several dozen friends and neighbors, white and black, the more than 500 people honoring Mrs. Stevens were family members, among them her eight children, most of her 64 grandchildren and numerous great-grandchildren whom, she allowed, she hadn't yet counted. Not all of them stayed for all 15 hours of picnics, programs and dancing that tapered off only at 3 A.M., although Mrs. Stevens was on hand until well after midnight.
The entire event was orchestrated by Annette Renaud, a granddaughter, as a way of honoring both her grandmother and her family. (As a peripheral activity -- a celebration within the park celebration -- Ms. Renaud also organized a bridal shower for Cheryl Crawford, a friend.)
"My grandmother did housework for many years, in private homes during the day and hotels at night, to help raise her family," Ms. Renaud said. (Mr. Stevens, who died 20 years ago, was a plumber.) Her grandmother still sends $100 every two months to the Shady Grove United Methodist Church in St. George, S.C., she continued, adding: "She's also helped raise at least one child of each of her daughters. I thought it was time to do something to honor her."
Ms. Renaud, one of 11 daughters (all of them college graduates) of Mrs. Stevens's daughter Willie Stevens Renaud, arranged the Afrocentric-theme program with her aunt Barbara Reno. A popular entertainer was Clyde Wilder of Message From Our Ancestors and his stilts dance.
Ms. Renaud also paid most of the costs, other than those for the individual family picnics, photographs and T-shirts. "It was just easier that way," she said. The day also included a disk jockey and music, a petting zoo and pony, a cotton candy and ice cream truck, and an ice sculpture of the family crest. There were portable bathrooms, a refrigerator truck and scores of other incidentals.
As in many family reunions, this one had most participants staying with relatives and comparatively few in hotels. Nonetheless, particularly in the case of the gigantic weekend reunions, comparatively few can add up to a considerable number.
"I've no idea of the percentage of our business done with family reunions, but it's important," said Marc Michaelson, a spokesman for Motel 6, with 700 motels in 48 states. "For the last two summers 20 percent of our advertising budget has been targeted at family reunions."
Pamela Gilbert, director of sales at a Holiday Inn in Orlando, Fla., speaking of black reunions, said: "It's a growing market. We expect 2,000 to 3,000 room nights this summer, which, at about $60 a night, would come to $150,000." Jeff Ericson, the Holiday Inn regional field marketing manager in Atlanta, said the chain of 1,400 hotels was seeing "more and more family reunions, with black reunions in the forefront of them."
"It's meaningful business," said Gordon Lambourne, public relations director of some 200 Marriott hotels in this country.
Even more meaningful is the overall economic impact of family reunions. The Cincinnati Convention and Visitors Bureau estimated that the 200,000 at the 1990 black family reunion in that city spent an average of $93 each, bringing some $18.6 million to the area. The office of Kenneth Hahn, the Los Angeles supervisor whose district includes Exposition Park, used $10 million as a conservative figure for the reunion weekend's impact on local business last year.
But in Red Hook, business was the last thing on anyone's mind. Mrs. Stevens could only repeat, "This is really something," with an occasional nod of the head and "oh, my" thrown in. She was kept wondering for weeks, she continued, adding, "They wouldn't tell me anything." But once the day began, she rather enjoyed the surprises and "the blessing of so many of the family and so many nice neighbors, white and black."
"This is just a little bit of us," said Barbara Reno, Mrs. Stevens's youngest daughter, who is noted for her own parties and fish fries.
"We've all been here all our lives," said Debbie Graham, a friend of Ms. Renaud. Mrs. Graham came to the reunion with her husband, John, a loading dock worker at a chemical plant, her young son, Jason, and her mother and father, Hazel and Emerson Melton. "Annette and I went to school together and it was always the kind of thing where if one of us was bad, either mother could handle it."
Jeanette Dozier, who came with her four children and identified her mother as a cousin of Mrs. Stevens's husband, summed it all up: "You have to thank God when you're blessed with this kind of family."

HEADLINE: Quayle Insists Abortion Remarks Don't Signal Change in His View

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LEXINGTON, Ky., July 23

 BODY:
Under increasing pressure to prove that he is a political asset, Vice President Dan Quayle found himself on the defensive once again today, this time on abortion, an issue that is central to his appeal to his conservative base.
Mr. Quayle intended to use today's trip to Indiana and Kentucky to shift blame for the country's economic troubles to the Democratic majority in Congress. But much of that message was obscured by the political storm surrounding his comments on Wednesday night that he would support his daughter "on whatever decision she made" if she decided to have an abortion. 
 Mr. Quayle, his wife and his aides all maintained today that the comment did not represent a softening of the Vice President's stance against abortion rights. Mr. Quayle said he had been talking only about a hypothetical situation involving a grown daughter.
Mr. Quayle and his wife, Marilyn, both said today that if their daughter, Corinne, who is 13 years old, became pregnant now, they would insist that she carry the pregnancy to term.
"Under the current situation, she would have the child," Mr. Quayle said at a news conference in Evansville, Ind., the first of two campaign stops. "We are pro-life and we are opposed to abortion."
He said he would support her decision "were she an adult."
"I would counsel her and encourage her not to have an abortion, but I would support my daughter," Mr. Quayle said.
 
Fresh Ammunition
 Mrs. Quayle, interviewed on a radio show in Des Moines today, said that if her daughter became pregnant now "she'll take the child to term." Asked if she would make that decision for her daughter, Mrs. Quayle said, "We will make it with her."
Mr. Quayle's remark about his daughter appeared to provide fresh ammunition for Gov. Bill Clinton, the Democratic Presidential nominee, and his supporters at a time when the Bush-Quayle campaign is trying to move onto the offensive.
"Sounds like choice to me," said House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, a Washington Democrat.
The trouble began during Mr. Quayle's appearance on CNN's "Larry King Live" program on Wednesday night, when Mr. King asked the Vice President how he would react if his daughter was pregnant.
"Well, it is a hypothetical situation and I hope that I never do have to deal with it," Mr. Quayle responded. "I would counsel her and talk to her and support her on whatever decision she made."
Mr. King asked whether he would support her if she decided to have an abortion.
"I'd support my daughter," Mr. Quayle said. "I would hope that she wouldn't make that decision."
Mr. Quayle defended his statement under questioning at both campaign stops today. By the time he landed at the airport in Lexington this afternoon, the abortion issue had become grist for a homemade anti-Quayle campaign poster. "Choice -- Is it only for the families of the powerful and the wealthy?" asked the sign, which was held by a woman in the crowd of several hundred people who greeted Mr. Quayle on the tarmac here.
 
Losing Opportunities
 William Kristol, Mr. Quayle's chief of staff, said, "The only thing that strikes me is the cynicism of the pro-abortion groups in trying to exploit a sincere and personal comment of the Vice President."
Mr. Clinton, speaking to reporters on the way to the Governor's office in Little Rock, Ark., said he did not think he should comment on Mr. Quayle's statement about his daughter. But he added, "I think it reinforces my position that these matters should not be turned back into crimes."
Later, Mr. Clinton said: "My impression is he was asked a question that he was not prepared for, prepped for. He answered it as a father, not a Vice President."
Asked what he would do if his 12-year-old daughter, Chelsea, were pregnant, Mr. Clinton said, "I wouldn't talk to the press about it."
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York told reporters today in Albany that Mr. Quayle's remarks on Wednesday night constituted a "classic pro-choice position" because "you can't make a distinction between your own blood and everybody else's daughter."
For Mr. Quayle, the abortion controversy meant yet another suspension of political momentum. He faced a similar problem last month when his offensive on family values stalled after he misspelled the word potato in a New Jersey classroom.
This time, the trouble came at a juncture when Republican leaders, including some members of Congress, have been talking among themselves about whether President Bush should remove Mr. Quayle from the ticket to stop the Republicans' decline in public opinion polls.
 
Support From Abortion Foes
 Mr. Bush said on Wednesday that Mr. Quayle's place on the ticket was "very certain." But the discomfort caused by the polls is likely to focus attention on Mr. Quayle until the Republican National Convention begins in Houston on Aug. 17.
The Republican Party platform, which should be adopted at next month's convention, calls for a constitutional amendment to ban most abortions. Mr. Quayle has long opposed abortion except in cases of rape, incest or when the life of the mother is in danger.
Opponents of legal abortion consider him a more dependable ally than Mr. Bush, whose position on abortion has shifted over time. Aware that Mr. Quayle was in some political trouble, they rallied to his side today.
Mr. Quayle's statements were "consistent with his pro-life views, his role as a parent, and the reality that abortion is legal," said Wanda Franz, the president of the National Right To Life Committee.
Mr. Quayle's trip to his home state of Indiana and then to Kentucky was planned around tours of new subdivisions under construction. He said he wanted to "promote a little good news" by stressing that the weak economy makes it a good time to buy a house.
In a breakfast speech to the Chamber of Commerce in Evansville today Mr. Quayle demonstrated that he could make a joke at his own expense.
Referring to the now-infamous potato incident, Mr. Quayle said he knew how to spell liberal: C-L-I-N-T-O-N.
And in a bit of gallows humor, he joked about his use of the television character Murphy Brown to make the case for family values. "Actually," Mr. Quayle said, "I'm a little envious of Murphy Brown. At least she's guaranteed of coming back this fall."

HEADLINE: REPORT IS CRITICAL OF ESTATE SYSTEM IN NEW YORK CITY

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL

 BODY:
More than four years after a state report found widespread mismanagement and theft in the handling of certain estates in New York City, a follow-up investigation has found that the problems remain largely unabated and in some cases have worsened.
The estates at issue are those in which there was either no will or a will whose terms could not be executed. Thus, they fell under the supervision of public administrators, appointed officials assigned by the Surrogate's Court in each of the city's five boroughs. 
 The new investigation by the State Attorney General and the State Comptroller found problems ranging from long, unnecessary delays in the handling of such estates to public administrators intentionally misinforming the court, to the use of estate funds to pay office and personal expenses, including computers, staff bonuses and automobile insurance. In one case, a draft version of the report said, staff members who had been accused of stealing property from the apartments of people they believed to be dead were allowed to continue work.
 
Unnecessary Fees
 One of those staff members, inspecting a Brooklyn estate valued at more than $1 million, reported finding property worth only $130. The report said that public administrators' investigators suspiciously reported recovering "little or no property from estates of high value."
The report portrayed a kind of feeding frenzy on the estates. In Queens and the Bronx, the report said, an unnecessary 3 percent fee was levied on estates when real estate was sold at public auction to pay brokers who accompany prospective buyers. In Queens and Brooklyn, lawyers who already receive 6 percent commissions on real-estate sales received extra fees.
The report said all five public administrators purchased services on behalf of estates without competitive bidding to assure the lowest price.
As in the past, the findings are expected to be made available to the criminal-justice authorities. Some criminal charges grew out of the last report.
In 1990, the city's five administrators controlled $135.8 million in estates, with Manhattan accounting for the largest share, $81 million.
 
'Little Has Changed'
 "We found that little has changed," the report concluded. "As a result estate assets continue to be at risk."
The draft version of the latest report by the State Attorney General and the State Comptroller concluded that few changes suggested by the last investigation had been adopted.
It also said that, as before, the deficiencies in Manhattan, where the bulk of the big estates were concentrated, "were particularly alarming."
There, the report found, the administrator was "improperly" holding more than $4 million in estate funds in special office accounts under her control. As before, the inquiry found that many cash accounts were so poorly maintained that the office could not say where the money came from or to whom it belonged.
 
Call for Legislation
 The two statewide officials, Attorney General Robert Abrams and Comptroller Edward V. Regan -- a Democrat and a Republican -- renewed their 1987 appeal for legislative changes, including a removal of the public administrators from the sway of the patronage-ridden Surrogate's Court, to which the administrators owe their appointments and before which they practice.
The latest critical report comes as Federal investigators are pressing a separate investigation into operations of the Surrogate's Court, including the public administrators' offices. Yesterday, a politically connected Manhattan lawyer, Melvyn Altman, was indicted on Federal racketeering, mail fraud and money-laundering charges in what the United States Attorney in Manhattan, Otto G. Obermaier, called a continuing investigation that identified the Surrogate's Court as a "racketeering enterprise" used by the defendant.
Many of the sharpest criticisms in the report were directed at the Manhattan Public Administrator, Ethel J. Griffin, who was appointed in 1988 when her predecessor resigned in the wake of the previous revelations.
The report said that by officially reporting to the court "under oath" that the fees had been paid she "misrepresents the actual status of legal-fee payments on sworn court submissions."
Ms. Griffin, in an interview, denied any wrongdoing and said her actions were with the knowledge and approval of the two Surrogates, Eve Preminger and Renee R. Roth.
The draft report did not include responses from the public administrators who received copies months ago. But several of the administrators, reached yesterday by telephone, challenged the findings.
According to the report, legal fees to the lawyers total more than $3 million a year, an amount it termed "excessive." Several hundred thousand dollars go to a few private accountants. All the money comes out of the estates. The report said the same services could be provided more economically by salaried lawyers and accountants.
The report also criticized the administrators for how they invested cash receipts, contending that the administrators deposited the principal and accrued interest from estate accounts into office accounts to pay for things like computer equipment, staff bonuses and personal car insurance.
But one administrator, Samuel Plotkin, from Brooklyn, said in an interview that because he assumed all his other automobile expenses, he was permitted by his surrogate to pay his $1,378 annual car insurance premium out of estate funds.
In some cases, the report said, conditions have worsened since the last review. In 1985, it said, the Manhattan administrator had $1.2 million in "house accounts" for payment of office expenses. By 1990, this had grown to almost $4.2 million.
This practice, it said, had cost estates hundreds of thousands of dollars in lost interest.
In 1989 and 1990, the report said, the deputy public administrator in Manhattan had improperly drawn checks of $750 and $1,200, payable to himself from estate accounts, for staff bonuses.
And it said of its review in Manhattan that it again found that the public administrator "still holds many passbooks belonging to closed estates, does not always attempt to locate beneficiaries and does not submit passbooks to banks with court papers, as required to close accounts."
 
'Questionable Disbursements'
 In Brooklyn, the report said, the office made "a number of questionable disbursements" to an investigator who was later convicted of stealing property from a dead person's residence.
Even after that staff member and another investigator were charged with such thefts, the office did not dismiss, suspend or reassign them, the report said. Instead, the public administrator "allowed them to continue searching residences for one and a half years after their arrests," it said.
Mr. Plotkin, the Brooklyn Administrator, challenged that finding in the interview, saying they were let go. Charges against one were later dropped, he said, and the other had his conviction overturned by an appellate court.
The Bronx Public Administrator, Robert S. Black, criticized the report for unfairly lumping the Bronx, with what he said were fewer shortcomings, with the other boroughs.
The Staten Island Administrator, John D. Kearney, who handled relatively few cases, said he had made some of the changes sought by the state officials.
The Queens Administrator, Mindy Trepel, did not respond to a message left with her office.
 
'No Valid Reasons'
 In Manhattan, the report found some large estates that had languished for decades "with no valid reasons."
It raised particular questions about some of Ms. Griffin's actions in Manhattan, particularly her withholding of 40 percent of the fees of a counsel whose work she was disputing.
The lawyer, John J. Connolly, who is suing the Administrator for what he says is at least $317,000 in fees due, has produced court documents showing that Ms. Griffin put more than $100,000 withheld from him in an account marked "Estate of John J. Connolly" in the Union Chelsea National Bank "although I am alive."
He said he never knew about the account at the time and had never authorized deposits into it. Nor, he said in a sworn deposition, did he ever authorize any payments out of it, as were made to other accounts.
Ms. Griffin said yesterday that "I don't know if he knew or not," but called it an "escrow" account until Mr. Connolly completed his work. She said that she did not know who endorsed the checks to other accounts but that she did not do it.
The Surrogate's Court -- one elected judge in each of the boroughs, except Manhattan, which has two -- appoints guardians for minors and the mentally incapacitated, probates wills and appoints executors in cases where wills are absent or deficient. By its ability to award lucrative appointments, the court has traditionally wielded enormous influence and power.
The surrogate judges also appoint the public administrators, who hire lawyers to oversee the estates under the court's jurisdiction. The lawyers arrange funerals, collect and inventory the decedents' assets and distribute the proceeds to heirs they track down.
For this, the lawyers may charge fees equal to 6 percent of the value of each estate over $10,000 and lesser fees for smaller estates. The administrators also take a sliding scale of commissions for their office expenses from each estate administered.
In the 1990 fiscal year, the latest year studied, the administrators' offices received a total of $1.5 million from the estates.

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, July 23

 BODY:
Israel's new Government stopped all planned construction for Jewish settlers in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip today, but said thousands of apartments and houses already started would be completed.
The decision means that more than 8,700 new housing units in progress will be built in the territories while nearly 6,700 that were on the drawing boards will be frozen. Those include many for which construction contracts were signed but real work not begun. 
 It was the most politically sensitive action taken thus far by the young Government of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, and obviously it fell well short of Arab demands for a complete building freeze.
 
West Bank Roads Halted
 In principle it also flies in the face of the Bush Administration's opposition to Israel's settlement activity as a major obstacle to peace. Although the Americans have spoken approvingly of Mr. Rabin for moving in the desired direction, it is not clear how they will react to the large numbers of new houses that will be finished
In addition to freezing future housing plans, Israel also halted work on several West Bank highways defined by senior officials as "political roads," designed by the former Government to help settlers avoid routes along which they risked attacks by Palestinians.
The 8,700 units given the go-ahead are now in various stages of construction, from little more than a hole in the ground to, far more commonly, near-completion. Senior officials say a large majority are either in the final stages or well beyond merely a framework.
 
Shamir Assails 'a Nightmare'
 The Government also did not touch 1,000 new apartments planned for areas around Jerusalem that Mr. Rabin, like his predecessor, Yitzhak Shamir, considers an integral part of Israel and not negotiable.
The action today left Israelis unhappy on the political left and right.
Mr. Shamir said the announced freeze was "a nightmare," and Benny Katzover, head of a settlers' group called the Samaria Regional Council, denounced it as "a grave anti-Zionist act."
There were calls for protests and unspecified forms of resistance from some of the 110,000 Jews estimated to be living in 140 West Bank and Gaza communities.
On the left, Peace Now, a prominent anti-settlements organization, said that by allowing thousands of apartments to be completed, the Government would increase the settlers' population by about 50,000, in the process "adding an obstacle to talks toward an agreement with the Palestinians."
It was not feasible to stop existing work in its tracks at this stage, Israeli officials said, asserting that the important point was that they had begun to shift national direction on the issue.
In separate interviews, the new Finance Minister and Housing Minister said that their goal was a sharp and swift scaling back of future settlement-building, and that that would be reflected in their 1993 budget proposal.
"I would say the investment will be negligible in proportion to what was before," Finance Minister Avraham Shohat said.
It is now up to the United States to decide whether the Israeli actions amount to the glass being half full or half empty if Washington intends to give Israel $10 billion in loan guarantees that have been suspended for months because of friction over the settlements.
Housing Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer said Mr. Rabin had told Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d about the planned housing restrictions when the Secretary visited Israel early this week at the start of his latest swing through the Middle East.
In Cairo on Wednesday, Mr. Baker pronounced himself "really very satisfied with the philosophy and the orientation" of the Rabin Government on settlements, and he predicted "a severe and substantial reduction" in construction.
Earlier, in Amman, Jordan, he said that he did not accept Mr. Rabin's distinctions between "political settlements," which the Israeli promises to end, and "security settlements," which he says must continue. But the Americans have strongly suggested that they are interested in bolstering Mr. Rabin's 10-day-old Government, and may be ready to turn a blind eye to a certain level of construction.
"We see an entirely new situation," Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said today on the NBC program "Today." Mr. Peres also expressed confidence that a loan-guarantees agreement will be reached, saying, "We feel the air is very favorable."
In the last few days, Palestinian peace negotiators from the territories have also begun to adjust their settlements position. They still want a freeze, they say, but they have also expressed willingness to accept some construction as long as there are assurances that no American aid ends up financing such activity.
Although Jewish neighborhoods in the territories are routinely referred to as "settlements," the word can be misleading. For many people it conjures up visions of tent cities and messianic pioneers. In fact, many -- perhaps most -- are indistinguishable from red-roofed suburbs in Israel.
And the settlers, far from having gleams in their eye, are often families and young couples initially lured to the territories by the lower prices and favorable mortgages to be found there.
Mr. Rabin and his ministers insist that they are not kowtowing to the Americans but rather are shifting national priorities on their own away from settlements and toward other social and economic needs.
In addition, Mr. Ben-Eliezer said, the intense construction championed by the former Likud-led Government amounted to an "undeclared annexation" of the territories that in his opinion endangered the peace talks.
The new settlements policy has emerged in stages over the last week, relying in part on gestures like a Cabinet order last weekend to review previous Government decisions to approve about a dozen new communities in the territories. On paper, it looked like a new freeze. In fact, the order lacked immediate significance because even Likud had not found the wherewithal to start those settlements.

HEADLINE: 2d Big Bank Sets I.O.U. Deadline For California

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, July 23

 BODY:
California's budget crisis deepened today when the Bank of America, the nation's second-largest bank and the biggest in the state, said that on Aug. 5 it would stop accepting the i.o.u.'s the state has been issuing employees and other creditors while Gov. Pete Wilson and legislators fight over the $11 billion deficit.
Later, Wells Fargo Bank, the state's second-largest bank, reiterated its position that it would stop accepting the i.o.u.'s, or "registered warrants," dated after July 31. 
 After the two announcements, a smaller bank, the Union Bank of San Francisco, said that it would also stop acceping i.o.u.'s dated after July 31.
Several of the state's smaller banks have said that they would either not accept the i.o.u.'s or limit the amount they would honor.
"It is very unfortunate for the entire State of California that this situation developed at all," Richard M. Rosenberg, chairman and chief executive officer of the Bank of America, said in a prepared statement. "In essence, the banks are funding the crisis -- serving as a shock absorber for the budget process."
Bank officials said the Bank of America had accepted about $220 million of the $892.4 million worth of i.o.u.'s that California has issued. State officials said California had paid about $10 million in interest since the beginning of July.
Bankers have become increasingly unhappy with their role in the budget crisis in recent weeks and have quietly been applying more pressure for a quick end to it.
 
Facing $10 Billion Deficit
 California ran out of cash on July 1, as the fiscal year ended, and State Controller Gray Davis sent out the first of 12,000 i.o.u.'s after the Democratic-controlled Assembly failed to reach agreement with the Republican Governor on how to erase a $10.7 billion deficit in the new state budget.
Although the i.o.u.'s pay 5 percent annual interest to banks that accept them, bankers have grumbled that they are not profitable because they present an administrative nightmare and require extra hours for processing.
Officials at First Interstate Bank said that they would continue to honor the i.o.u.'s from their customers but that they would monitor the crisis day by day.
Mr. Davis proposed a short term plan to pay back $922 million in i.o.u.'s on Wednesday, saying his office would begin redeeming them on Aug. 3 with money that the state had saved from payments it is not making during the budget crisis.
But banking industry officials said the Controller's action would only delay a resolution of the budget impasse. "This may just prolong the whole crisis," said Nancy Badely, a spokeswoman for the California Bankers Association. "The banks are being put in a tough position."
At the Bank of Walnut Creek, in a suburb east of San Francisco, officials said that they had placed a $10,000 limit on i.o.u.'s its bank would accept and that they are reviewing higher amounts case by case. "I don't want to turn down the poor clerk who works at the Department of Motor Vehicles," said Leland Wines, the bank's chief financial officer. "That person depends on the warrants to pay their mortgage or their groceries."
Since the state began issuing i.o.u.'s -- for the first time since the Depression -- the crisis has had a variety of adverse effects. Standard & Poor's Corporation stunned the municipal bond market last week by lowering its ratings on debt securities issued by the State of California by two notches, to A+ from AA.
State officials said they were concerned that more delay in agreeing on a budget would further damage the state's credit rating and cause serious harm to the California economy.
"This will have a domino effect on the economic health of businesses and individuals in California," said State Treasurer Kathleen Brown. "The consequences aren't like an earthquake; they are much more subtle and long term."
Ms. Brown said her office had already been forced to hire nine staff members to help process the i.o.u.'s and had logged 3,800 hours of overtime since July 1.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Deficit Politics;
White House Prods Congress on Deficit

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 23

 BODY:
In a midyear recalculation apparently motivated by election-year as much as economic considerations, the White House asserted today that President Bush's economic program could eliminate the Federal deficit by 1998 if Congress were to pass it.
The revision comes only six months after President Bush sent Congress a budget projecting the deficit's being reduced to $200 billion a year in five years' time. In Mr. Bush's tenure, the deficit has doubled, to about $350 billion a year, from $155 billion in 1988; in the month that he took office, the Administration forecast that the deficit would be just $32 billion this fiscal year. 
 The new projection is based on Congress's approving a cap on Medicare and other entitlement programs and passing Mr. Bush's economic proposals. The White House said the cap on entitlements would bring 1998 spending down by $169 billion, while the economic package, including a long-sought cut in the capital gains tax, could spur growth enough to reduce the deficit by another $104 billion in 1998.
The budget document said the cap would limit spending increases on mandatory programs to the inflation rate and population growth plus 2 percent in the first year. In the second year it would be inflation, population growth plus 1 percent, and in subsequent years it would limit spending increases to inflation and population growth.
 
Harsh Words for Congress
 As he presented the new figures, Richard G. Darman, the President's budget director, castigated Congress for not acting yet. In a seeming effort to shift the blame for the stumbling economy, which has badly hurt Mr. Bush's re-election prospects, he declared, "Over all, Congressional inaction has made the deficit very much worse than it would have been had the President's program been enacted.
In the document itself, the Administration revised its growth forecast for this year to 2.7 percent, up from 2.2 percent in January, right after the fourth quarter when growth had virtually stopped. Today's forecast, which projects growth of 3 percent in the second half of the year, is in line with that of most economists, as the January forecast had been.
The Administration predicted that the unemployment rate would fall from its current 7.8 percent to 6.9 percent in the fourth quarter. The forecast is more optimistic than that of many economists, but Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, said the projection was made before June's sharp jump in unemployment. Mr. Boskin said that if he were making the calculation today, he would estimate a jobless figure of 7.1 percent at year's end.
"We've been in a slow recovery for some time," said Mr. Boskin. "We do expect that to pick up some. And the probability that it will pick up some and the pace that it will pick up some would be enhanced substantially by passage of the President's short-term stimulus program."
The White House also revised its 1992 deficit projection, to $333.5 billion, down $66.2 billion from the January estimate of $399.7 billion.
The main reason, Mr. Darman said, is the refusal of Congress to pass an anticipated $69 billion to bail out failed savings-and-loan institutions. Economists say such spending will merely be pushed into future years, and that the delay could increase the cost of the savings-and-loan problem.
"Congress has failed to act in a timely and responsible manner," Mr. Darman said.
Alice Rivlin, an economist at the Brookings Institution who was director of the Congressional Budget Office from 1975 to 1983, said that while the White House program over all sounds simple and straightforward, "it doesn't tell you anything about how you do it."
"One thing it has to mean is drastic cuts in Medicare and Medicaid, because those are the programs where spending is growing the fastest," she said.
 
'An Act of Faith'
 Mr. Darman also asserted that passage of the President's growth package would help push up growth. His report added that annual growth of 4 percent would be needed for several years to balance the budget in 1998.
Ms. Rivlin countered: "It would be nice to have 4 percent growth, but the connection between anything in the growth package and 4 percent growth is an act of faith.
The Mid-Sesson Review, as the document released today is known, was 421 pages long. Last year's review was a more traditional 55 pages. This year's version contained hundreds of pages of proposals from the budget the President sent Congress in January, including ones to beef up research and development and improve education.
Democrats expect the Administration to use today's report to argue that it has a more comprehensive economic program than the 22-page program Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas issued last month. "The mid-year economic report is more of the samae trickle-down economics from the White House," Governor Clinton, the Democratic nominee, said in a statement. "Instead of a serious and constructive plan for economic change, the President has recycled his old and meager tax package and sought once again to blame Congress for his failed leadership."
Administration officials say that over the next few weeks they will press Congress to enact the President's economic proposals, which include a tax credit for first-time home buyers and the capital gains tax cut.
President Bush outlined a seven-point economic program in his State of the Union Message in January, calling on Congress to pass those proposals by March 20. Congress ceremoniously met the deadline, but the economic package, while including several of the President's proposals, also included tax increases, and he vetoed it.
Democrats reacted angrily today to Mr. Darman's attacks. "Under 12 years of Republican rule, we have the largest deficits, the worst growth record, the longest recessions and biggest declines in middle-class incomes in the post-World War II era," Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the majority leader, declared.
Meanwhile, Representative Leon E. Panetta, the California Democrat who is chairman of the House Budget Committee, introduced a bill that would obligate the President and Congress to eliminate the deficit within five years. If a balanced budget is not approved, tax increases and across-the-board spending cuts, including Social Security, would automatically take effect.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Clinton's Policy Test;
On Accord With Mexico, He Can Be Free-Trader or Critic of the President

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 23

 BODY:
The trade agreement the Bush Administration is about to conclude with Mexico will present Gov. Bill Clinton with one of his first important policy decisions of the general election campaign.
If he endorses the agreement, he will alienate labor unions, some environmentalists and other legs of his political base. But he will be praised by most academic experts and business interests and will burnish his argument that economic growth is the most important issue in the campaign. 
 Mr. Clinton must decide, in short, whether it is to his advantage to close off an area of debate with President Bush and paint himself as an enlightened free-trader, or whether it would be better for him to seize the opportunity to attack the President's competence and say, "I could negotiate a better deal."
 
Clinton Able to Buy Time
 Until now, Mr. Clinton has been able to buy time, saying he believes in free trade in principle while withholding judgment on the pact with Mexico until he sees the details -- particularly the ones involving labor standards and environmental protection.
Few people doubt that in the long run an effective trade agreement would promote economic growth, jobs and wealth throughout the continent, allow consumers to buy a greater variety of goods at lower prices and help solve the problem of illegal immigration into the United States from Mexico.
But there is also little question that some communities and some people would be hurt at first. Some American businesses will surely move their operations and jobs to Mexico to take advantage of cheap labor and lax pollution rules.
What is being discussed is an agreement and not a treaty. That means it must be approved by a simple majority of both houses of Congress rather than a two-thirds majority of the Senate.
The negotiations are likely to be concluded this fall, if not before, but Congress will not vote until next year. Many of Mr. Clinton's advisers say that allows him to continue to straddle the issue. But others say it is too important a matter for him to dodge.
The top trade negotiators from the United States, Mexico and Canada will resume talks in Mexico City this weekend.
Many of Mr. Bush's political advisers say it is important that the trade negotiations, which have been under way for more than a year, are completed before the Republican National Convention begins on Aug. 17.
"One of the points we are trying to drive home is that there are domestic benefits to Bush's skills in foreign affairs, and this would be exhibit No. 1," an adviser said.
The Bush campaign also relishes the issue because it puts Mr. Clinton on the spot. If Mr. Clinton sides with the Administration, the Republicans can accuse him of me-tooism. If he opposes the agreement, the Bush camp will paint the Democrat as a tool of the labor unions -- a lobby the Republicans believe is politically unpopular in most places of the country.
Representative Robert T. Matsui, the California Democrat who sits on the trade subcommittee and favors the North American Free Trade Agreement, said he thought Mr. Clinton "in good conscience could say, 'I want to reserve judgment because I may want to reopen the negotiations once I become President.' "
But one of the Democratic candidate's chief economic advisers said he thought Mr. Clinton would have to take a firm stand because he could not afford to have the Republicans accuse him of dodging an issue involving economic growth.
 
Clue to Clinton's Thoughts
 A clue to Mr. Clinton's thoughts may lie in a speech to be delivered on Monday by Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader and an important Democratic voice on labor issues. Until now, Mr. Gephardt's public position has been the same as Mr. Clinton's -- that he was withholding a commitment until he saw how labor and environmental standards were handled.
Unlike Mr. Clinton, Mr. Gephardt has had official access to details of the agreement that have already been settled. He has told associates that he will say in his speech that the drafts he has seen do not meet his criteria for supporting the agreement.
Mr. Gephardt campaigned in St. Louis with Mr. Clinton on Wednesday. The prevailing view among Democrats is that Mr. Gephardt would not take such a public stance on the trade agreement unless he had cleared it first with Mr. Clinton. But some Democrats say they believe Mr. Gephardt might be trying to make the point that he is an independent power who will not be hidden by Mr. Clinton's shadow.
Political positions on trade matters tend to break along regional lines rather than partisan ones.
 
Strongest Supporters
 The strongest supporters are in the states along the Mexican border. A free-trade pact would allow businesses there to offer more goods and services to the Mexican market. And growth in the Mexican economy would mean that fewer immigrants would try to cross the border illegally. When the House of Representatives voted last year to allow Mr. Bush to negotiate with Mexico, 23 of Texas's 27 House members supported the President.
So Mr. Bush would probably be helped in California and Texas by a dispute with Mr. Clinton over trade with Mexico.
But he might be hurt in the Midwest, where the fear of lost jobs is greatest. During the Democratic primaries, support for former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California surged in Michigan and Wisconsin because of his opposition to the trade pact. The official position of Mr. Clinton's campaign is that he will decide how to respond once he sees the details of the final agreement.
Asked if he expected a response from Mr. Clinton soon, a Democratic Senator said: "Right in the middle of a Presidential campaign? Sure."

HEADLINE: Kidnapping and 'Taxes' Transform Guerrilla Inc.

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, July 23

 BODY:
Hunched over computers confiscated from a guerrilla group here, detectives recently discovered a surprising electronic file: a list of 239 Peruvian businessmen forced to contribute "war taxes" and a directory of 2,500 additional candidates for extortion or kidnapping.
With the collapse of the Soviet Union and the near-bankruptcy of Cuba, South America's orphaned guerrilla groups survive by honing their skills at local fund-raising. Several groups in Peru and Colombia might rightfully be named "Guerrilla Inc." And the sophistication of their intelligence-gathering apparatus testifies to the seriousness of their pursuits, with some keeping detailed files on the finances, personal lives and movements of local executives. 
 "The guerrillas lose their ideological coloring and become a bureaucracy," said Gene Mastroangelo, manager of risk information service at Pinkerton's Security and Investigation Services in Van Nuys, Calif., which tracks politically inspired incidents around the world and advises companies on such risks. "They take on a corporate structure and have to finance it."
In Colombia, guerrillas are considered responsible for a third of the 375 kidnappings that took place in the first three months of 1992. In the last year, multinational companies paid guerrilla ransoms for the release of one American geologist, two Japanese engineers and three American oil engineers. Natco, an oil services company in Tulsa, is reported to have paid $1 million for the release of the three engineers.
The guerrillas' refusal to release 300 kidnapping victims -- largely ranchers and rural businessmen -- was a big reason that peace talks with Colombia's Government broke down in June.
Originally supplied by Cuba, Colombia's two main guerrilla groups, the National Liberation Army and the Revolutionary Armed Forces, have been fighting the state for more than 25 years. Today, to keep their fighters fed, clothed and armed, the groups extort "war taxes" from rural businesses and provide armed guards for cocaine laboratories and plots of opium poppies.
In Chile, police officers investigating the arrest this week of two central committee members of the Lautaro Youth Movement, a leftist guerrilla group, announced that the pair received salaries five times Chile's minimum monthly salary of $100, a level that allowed the urban guerrilla leaders' families to maintain middle-class life-styles.
 
Double Drag on Peru's Economy
 In Peru, guerrilla activity by the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement and by the more radical Shining Path cost Peru's economy about $500 million in the first half of 1992, according to Senator Enrique Bernales, who tracks the human and financial cost of the violence. In a second drag on the economy, guerrilla violence is frightening foreign investors away from an ambitious Government plan to privatize most of Peru's state enterprises, from telephone companies to copper mines.
A recent series of police raids against the Tupac Amaru here laid bare the modern financing techniques of this largely middle class, pro-Cuban guerrilla group.
Cellular telephones, facsimile and photocopying machines, American and South Korean computers, and a basement "people's jail" in a comfortable neighborhood were all part of a smoothly efficient Tupac Amaru kidnapping and extortion operation uncovered by the police.
"They had files on most Peruvian businessmen, where they lived, where they worked, where their children studied," said Julio Favre Carranza, a leader here of business resistance to extortion demands. According to Mr. Favre's group, the Confederation of Peruvian Industries, companies here spend more than $150 million a year on security protection against terrorists.
Working on a tip from a Lima businessman forced to pay Tupac Amaru "war taxes," the police on April 15 arrested Peter Cardenas Schulte. Described as operations director for the guerrillas, Mr. Cardenas had $237,500 in United States currency in his apartment at the time of his arrest.
In June, the police arrested the group's top leader, Victor Polay Campos, while he was dining in a restaurant in an upper-middle-class neighborhood here. The police have issued an international warrant for the arrest of the group's financial director, Maria Luisa Benza Pflucker, who may have fled to the Netherlands, her mother's native land.
 Studying documents and more than 50 computer diskettes seized at Optimisa S.R.L., a front company run by Miss Benza, detectives pieced together details of a well-organized kidnapping and extortion ring.
"We found information relating to economic and financial movements, company directories, addresses and telephone numbers of different public and private businesses -- all designed to be used for extortion and blackmail for subversive activity," said a spokesman for Peru's National Anti-Terrorism Police Directorate.
The police said that bank clerks either sold or supplied free of charge financial and personal information about bank executives and holders of large accounts. Police officials found photo albums filled with newspaper clippings and snapshots of potential kidnapping victims. A small library of private school yearbooks provided more photos and residential addresses of potential victims.
Studying computer printouts, anti-terrorist police officers said that the 239 companies that regularly paid "war taxes" included mining companies, pharmaceutical makers, soft drink bottlers and printers. To prevent double billing by common criminals, Peru's guerrilla extortionists gave printed receipts, which they call "war bonds."
The police speculate that the Tupac Amaru hid millions of dollars in overseas accounts. But when a judge in late June asked Mr. Polay to list his assets, the guerrilla leader responded defiantly, "All I own in the world are the clothes on my back."
 
 
Grenades and Phony Passports
 At one news conference here, the police displayed materials purchased with extortion money: falsified passports and passes for official cars, immigration stamps, infrared binoculars for night vision, sophisticated radios, pistols, grenades, antitank weapons and ammunition for automatic weapons. The police said they also found plans to dynamite the Camino Real, Lima's largest shopping center and the site of several multinational companies' local offices.
Peru's more radical guerrilla group, the Shining Path, is thought to finance its activities through the collection of as much as $40 million a year in "war taxes" from Peruvian coca leaf growers and Colombian cocaine traffickers.
In early July, the anti-terrorist police released a document that they said was seized during a recent raid on a Shining Path cell in Lima. According to this document, the Shining Path committee in Peru's principal coca leaf-growing area, the Upper Huallaga Valley, promised to turn over to the party half of the protection money raised from coca leaf growers and laboratory operators.
Addressing landing fees collected from planes arriving from Colombia, the documents' signers promised to devote 5 percent to the maintenance of airstrips and to deliver the rest to the central committee of the Shining Path, formally known as the Communist Party of Peru.
 
 
Big Profits From Drugs
 Analyzing this and other documents, Caretas magazine, Peru's largest-selling news weekly, estimated this month that the Shining Path earned $250 million from the drug trade over the last six years. The magazine speculated that most of the money had been spent on domestic operations or had been deposited in overseas accounts.
Recognizing that continued terrorism is preventing Peru's economic revival, President Alberto K. Fujimori issued an emergency decree in May that establishes life sentences for most major terrorist crimes.
But with guerrillas firmly established as extortionists in the public mind, businessmen are now plagued by freelancers trying to piggyback on the guerrillas' fearsome reputation.
In Peru's second-largest city, Arequipa, the police in late June freed a kidnapped textile executive, breaking up a gang that had extorted "war taxes" from local businesses since 1985. These "guerrillas" turned out to include one active-duty policeman and two retired police officers. Their leader, Carlos Corso Portocarrero, was a well-known businessman who frequented the city's most exclusive club, Club Arequipa, apparently to select his victims.

Newspapers Start To Rebuild Profits

BYLINE: By Alex S. Jones

 BODY:
SECOND-QUARTER earnings reports from newspaper companies paint a picture that seems so rosy as to be hot pink.
For instance, the Gannett Company's earnings per share increased 13 percent; net income at The Washington Post Company was up 35 percent; Knight-Ridder Inc. reported an 11 percent increase in earnings; net income at The New York Times Company jumped to $15.2 million from $5.4 million, and Dow Jones & Company said net income for the quarter rose 25 percent. 
 But while such solid increases may suggest a return to the fat and happy newspaper profits of the mid-1980's, they actually reflect a toughened industry able to wring profits out of a business environment that is still flat.
In most cases, the profit increases come from significantly reduced newsprint costs, bare-bones cost controls and advertising rate increases.
For many newspaper companies, advertising volume -- the key indicator of the industry's fiscal health -- actually decreased for the quarter compared with a year earlier.
And the quarter's profit gains, though certainly welcome, represent only a first step in recovering ground lost during the last several years.
"The best way to show strong earnings growth is to climb out of a deep hole," said John Morton, a newspaper industry analyst at Lynch, Jones & Ryan in Washington. "We're trying to get back to 1990's earnings levels, for God's sake, and 1990 wasn't a great year."
Indeed, in advertising linage, many papers would be pleased to get back to 1991's weak level. Advertising at The Washington Post fell 3.8 percent for the quarter, compared with a year earlier. Advertising for The New York Times declined 2.4 percent, and total linage for the Gannett chain declined 1 percent, though USA Today's linage increased 3 percent.
Analysts said display advertising, like that from department stores, continued to be depressed, reflecting the slow economic recovery.
In most areas, help-wanted classified advertising has also showed little improvement, because hiring usually lags behind any recovery, as companies generally prefer to pay overtime until they are certain a recovery is under way.
Among the few bright spots has been automotive advertising, because the American passion for new cars is usually one of the first cravings to be satisfied when consumers have money to spend. In some areas, a second passion -- home buying -- has led to more vigorous real estate advertising, particularly in the Midwest and South.
But in general, newspapers have raised advertising revenues through rate increases, a move that probably demonstrates the essential strength of the industry better than anything else.
For two decades, most newspapers raised their advertising rates every year, generally by a percentage higher than the rate of inflation, and advertisers were willing to pay the price because newspapers were regarded as the best way to reach a community's consumers.
In the last couple of years, newspapers have become more timid about raising rates for fear that advertisers would defect to other media, like direct mail and cable television, or significantly reduce the newspaper advertising they would buy.
This year, newspapers have generally gone back to raising their rates somewhat more than the inflation rate. And though this has hurt advertising volume, overall advertising revenues are generally higher.
Kevin R. Gruneich, an analyst of newspaper stocks at the First Boston Corporation, said newspapers generally increased rates by 4 to 5 percent this year. He noted that the inflation rate was expected to be about 3 percent.
"Newspapers are still dominant as to local print media, and there is still no better place to put help-wanted ads or an ad for a sale at a big retailer," Mr. Gruneich said.
Should the economy improve, increased advertising volume would probably follow, and the new advertising would be purchased at the higher rate.
But such a potential windfall would be offset somewhat by higher newsprint costs, as more paper would be needed to print the ads and as increased demand would undoubtedly prompt newsprint companies to increase their very depressed prices.
Mr. Gruneich estimates that newsprint is selling at a discount of about 40 percent from the list price of $685 per metric ton.
Newsprint companies had announced that they would raise rates Aug. 1 by about $35 a ton, but such an increase now seems unlikely.
Labor negotiations this summer at the newsprint mills in British Columbia had been expected to reduce the oversupply of newsprint, creating a chance for newsprint companies in the United States to make a price increase stick. But the negotiations were concluded earlier this month and the prospects of a shortfall have declined.
This means that any increase in newsprint costs will probably be driven by increased demand, which in turn will be prompted by more advertising. And if advertising increases, newspapers will be delighted to pay for the added newsprint.
Newspaper stock prices, which moved sharply higher earlier this year, have since leveled off. Yesterday, Gannett was up 12.5 cents, to $46.25; The Washington Post Company was up $1, to $220.50; Knight-Ridder was unchanged at $60.875; The New York Times Company was up 37.5 cents, to $28, and Dow Jones was up 50 cents, to $33.

Weak Economic Data Lift Treasuries

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Another jolt from more pessimistic economic data gave the bond market a strong lift yesterday, pushing the price of the 30-year bond up almost a point and bringing long-term yields down toward the levels of January.
The rally also provided some needed support for a difficult issue of notes from the Tennessee Valley Authority and may provide a good background for a first-of-its-kind issue by the American Express Company that will be priced today. 
 The impetus for the rally, which sharply raised the value of notes and bonds with maturities of five years and longer, was the unexpected report that initial unemployment claims jumped by 19,000 in the week ended July 11. The surge in claims was the largest since December and higher than most forecasts, some of which assumed a decline.
 
More Sluggish Signals
 The claims data and incomplete numbers on weekly auto sales added to a recent string of data showing that the recovery, if it is there at all, is very slow. This means there is no threat of rising inflation and, possibly, still another reduction in interest rates by the Federal Reserve.
"This is confirmation that we are in an atypical recovery that will be weak for some time," said Joseph Liro, senior vice president at S. G. Warburg & Company in New York. "This is not the kind of growth that will put any pressure on inflation."
James S. Fralick, senior economist at Morgan Stanley & Company, said, "The July data are still on the soft side, and it won't be until August that we may see any activity."
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 29 1/2-year bonds were offered at a price of 105 15/32, up 31/32, to yield 7.53 percent.
Among outstanding Treasury note issues, the 6 3/8 percent five-year notes were offered at 10 17/32, up 27/32, to yield 6.15 percent. The 7.5 percent 10-year note was offered at 105 22/32, up 31/32, to yield 6.69 percent.
Three- and six-month Treasury bills were unchanged, while the one-year bill declined slightly. In the auction for one-year bills, the average discount rates was 3.37 percent, down sharply from the 3.93 percent at the last auction on June 25. The drop reflects the impact of the cut the Federal Reserve made in both its discount rate and the Federal Funds rate at the beginning of July.
 
Bolster T.V.A. Issue
 The sudden rally on Wednesday and yesterday apparently gave a nice lift to the underwriters of $1.25 billion in Tennessee Valley Authority notes that were issued Tuesday and were not selling briskly.
The 7- and 10-year notes were priced at relatively narrow spreads over the comparable Treasury securities, making the deal very attractive to the T.V.A. but apparently not that attractive to investors.
Several underwriters involved in the deal said the issue did not move well on Tuesday.
But the rally in the market meant that the difference between the interest rate offered on the T.V.A. notes and comparable Treasury securities widened sharply in the last two days, making them much more attractive.
"It would have gone well despite the rally," said a trader at Goldman, Sachs & Company, the lead underwriter. "It is a matter of timing, but with a rally like this the bonds sell faster."
In late trading yesterday, both issues were selling at 98.875. When they were issued, the price was 98.47 for the 7-year note and 98.585 for the 10-year note. The 7-year note yielded 6.45 percent, about 29 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, more than the comparable Treasury security. The 10-year note yielded 7.03 percent, about 24 basis points more than the 10-year Treasury. When issued, the 7-year note yielded 15 basis points over Treasuries, and the 10-year notes were 19 basis points over Treasuries.
 
American Express Offering
 The rally could also help the reception for the $1 billion in five- and seven-year notes that American Express is offering. And it will lessen American Express's cost. The notes, which are expected to be priced today, are the first ever issued that are backed by the payments of charge card bills. In the past, such asset-backed offerings were backed by credit card receipts -- cards that charged interest on outstanding balances.
One key in the design of this security was compensating for the fact that the American Express green, gold and platinum charge cards do not have finance charges. In a security backed by a credit card, the revenue from the finance charge provides a cushion for investors against larger-than-expected defaults or nonpayment by card users.
In this new issue, in which the lead underwriter is American Express's own Lehman Brothers unit, the fund to back the securities is designed so that 3 percent of every dollar is set aside in a way that makes it similar to the flow of money from a finance charge.
Based on talk in the market yesterday, the negotiated deal for the five- year note should be priced about 42 to 44 basis points more than the five-year Treasury note, which was yielding 5.58 percent in late trading in the secondary market yesterday. The seven-year note was expected to be priced at 45 to 47 basis points more than the seven-year Treasury, which yielded 6.15 percent late yesterday.
As the rally in the Treasury market continued yesterday afternoon, the Bush Administration, as part of its midyear economic review, released an estimate for the budget deficit for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30. The revision cut the estimate by $65.5 billion, to $333 billion.
While traders said the market showed little reaction, the decline in Government borrowing should be positive for bonds because it would decrease the supply.
The Federal Reserve money supply figures released near the close of trading also seemed to have little impact. The $3.6 billion decline in M-1 and the $2.5 billion drop in M-2, after sharp increases in the previous week, were a little disappointing, Mr. Fralick said, because they did not fall more.

HEADLINE: Stocks Up; Dow Gains 12.43 Points

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks closed moderately higher yesterday in listless trading as investors combed through earnings reports looking for fresh direction.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 12.43 points at 3,290.04 after hitting a low of 3,267 and a high of 3,291. 
 Volume on the New York Stock Exchange slipped to 180.1 million shares, from 190.1 million on Wednesday. Issues that advanced outnumbered those that declined by 962 to 758.
The stock market's performance stood in sharp contrast to bonds, which surged on a higher-than-expected weekly jobless claims report. Claims posted a rise to 422,000, from a revised 403,000 the previous week.
The Treasury's benchmark long-bond rose 31/32 to 105.13, pushing its yield to a seven-month low of 7.54 percent, from 7.62 percent on Wednesday.
The weak jobless report, suggesting the economy is still crippled, stirred hope of lower interest rates, which would make bonds a more attractive investment.
But over all, the stock market's interest was muted, said Jon Groveman, president of Ladenburg Thalmann.
 
Investors Seek Direction
 "People don't know whether to react to the strength in bonds or the potential weakness in the economy," he said.
Politics were also playing havoc with the market, analysts said.
Gerald Simmons, manager of institutional trading at Interstate/Johnson Lane, said investors were worried about earnings, the election and the possibility of war with Iraq.
"I think portfolio managers are really looking for direction: Is it growth or cyclicals or will we continue this slide?" he said.
Strength in oil stocks, including Exxon and Texaco, gave blue chips a leg up after the energy giants reported earnings that were roughly in line with Wall Street projections, analysts said.
Exxon closed up 1, to 63. The nation's biggest oil company said earnings slipped because of lower profits on refined petroleum products.
Texaco, the No. 3 oil company, said it too had lower profits than a year ago. Texaco rose 1, to 63 1/2.
Jack Solomon, a Bear Stearns technical analyst, said the stock market was showing signs of trying to stabilize. He also noted the broader market had been improving.
"Within a week or so, we should see the bottom," he said. "Then we should start the summer rally."
 He said it was encouraging that the Dow industrials did not match the performance of the Dow transportation index, which fell 1.15 points, to 1,269.74.
Among other stocks, shares of Immunex added 1 3/4, to 34 3/4. The company settled suits with the Hoechst A.G. affiliates Behringwerke A.G. and Hoechst-Roussel.
Monsanto lost 1 1/2, to 54 1/2, after reporting second-quarter results.
The stock of General Dynamics rose 1 3/4, to 75 5/8. Berkshire Hathaway acquired 15 percent of the company.
Shares of a new issue, Pyxis, topped the Nasdaq volume list. It ended at 18 1/8 after being priced at 14.
Surgical Care Affiliates slumped 2, to 28, after releasing second-quarter results.
The Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks rose 1.15, to 412.08. The American Stock Exchange index fell 0.67, to 382.50.
The New York Stock Exchange Composite index of all listed common stocks rose 0.53, to 226.66.
The average share rose 8 cents.
The Nasdaq index rose 1.36, to 565.24. The Wilshire Associates Equity Index, the market value of Big Board, American Exchange and Nasdaq issues, was 3,969.783, up 8.909, or 0.22 percent.

HEADLINE: Initial Jobless Benefit Claims Rose Sharply in Early July

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 23

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing first-time claims for unemployment benefits rose sharply in early July, the Government said today. The increase will make anything more than a minimal improvement in the unemployment rate unlikely this month.
The Labor Department said initial jobless claims for the week that ended July 11 hit 422,000, up from 403,000 the week before. 
 It was the largest rise since late February and the level of claims was at its highest since the week that ended on May 2.
Economists had been expecting a smaller increase but cautioned against reading a great deal into weekly fluctuations in the claims number. Still, they said, it suggested there was little prospect of an immediate improvement in the nation's unemployment rate, which last month hit an eight-year high of 7.8 percent.
"The evidence is we are just holding our own in the labor market," said Robert G. Dederick, economist for the Northern Trust Company in Chicago. He said the unemployment rate might edge down a tenth of a percentage point or two because of statistical adjustments for seasonal job patterns. "But fundamentally we have an economic growth rate that isn't going to bring any meaningful decline in unemployment," he said.
A four-week average of claims, considered a more reliable indicator of the labor market than the weekly number, rose as well. It hit 415,250 for the four weeks ended July 11, up 250 from the period ended a week earlier.
In the first three months of this year claims averaged around 450,000, then fell to around 410,000 in April and May. But since then they have edged higher.
Mr. Dederick said part of the latest increase probably occurred because unemployment offices closed a day during the week before for Independence Day, causing some unemployed people to delay filing their claims until the next week.
Economists at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, the New York securities firm, predicted that claims will head even higher later in the month because the General Motors Corporation began a two-week companywide shutdown on July 17.

HEADLINE: Trade Center Overcharge Found Again

BYLINE: By JANE FRITSCH

 BODY:
A second cleaning company has overcharged the Port Authority thousands of dollars for work at the World Trade Center, a spokesman for the agency said yesterday. The overcharges, which have not been fully calculated, represent the third instance of overbilling on Port Authority contracts disclosed by the agency this week.
The firm, Prompt Maintenance Services, holds a $3.5 million contract to clean Buildings 4 and 5, two nine-story structures adjoining the twin towers of the World Trade Center, which is owned and operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. 
 Agency officials disclosed earlier this week that another cleaning service, the Ogden Allied Services Corporation, overcharged tenants at the World Trade Center by almost $1 million over the last year, and that the Port Authority may also have overpaid as much as $500,000 over the last two years to a company that provides security at the center.
Allen Morrison, a spokesman for the Port Authority, described the overpayments to Prompt Maintenance Services as a "relatively minor matter" that is being resolved between the agency and the contractor.
 
'Inadequate Supervision'
 But Mr. Morrison said that taken together, the three incidents reflect a pattern of "inadequate supervision of contracts" that has emerged recently in a series of audits. As a result of the findings, two top agency officials were reassigned this week. They are Frank Garcia, who oversaw World Trade Center business operations from May 1990 until January, when he was named director of economic development, and August K. Preschle, who oversaw the Trade Center's maintenance and daily operations. Both were reassigned after the first cleaning overcharges were disclosed.
The center's construction manager was demoted in January after an internal audit turned up inadequacies in contract oversight, officials said. But they have refused to release that audit or discuss its specific findings.
Prompt Maintenance Services, which has its headquarters in Rockland County, is cooperating with agency auditors and has agreed to "do everything possible to make restitution," Mr. Morrison said.
A telephone message left at the company's office in Rockland County was not returned yesterday. Noel Roman, the company's maintenance supervisor at the World Trade Center, said he knew nothing about the overbilling.
 
Withholding Part of Payments
 Under the terms of its two-year contract, granted in January 1991, Prompt Maintenance was supposed to bill the Port Authority each month for the amount of square footage its workers cleaned, Mr. Morrison said. Instead, the company submitted bills each month for one twenty-fourth of the contract limit of $3.5 million, regardless of the actual work done, he said.
Auditors are now reviewing the records of the last 18 months to determine the amounts that should have been paid, Mr. Morrison said. Until the matter is resolved, the Port Authority will withhold 15 percent of the company's future monthly payments, he said.
Prompt Maintenance is one of two smaller companies granted cleaning contracts by the World Trade Center in 1990 as part of an effort to open contracts to smaller businesses. An audit of a $4.3 million two-year contract awarded to the other small company, Maintenance Services Inc. of Yonkers, showed no irregularities, Mr. Morrison said. The cleaning contract held by Ogden Allied is worth $24 million a year.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Exxon, Texaco and Occidental Earnings Fall in Quarter

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, July 23

 BODY:
The Exxon Corporation, Texaco Inc. and the Occidental Petroleum Corporation today reported lower earnings for the second quarter, reflecting troubles in refining and chemical operations that suffered from weak demand in sluggish global economies.
Exxon, the world's largest oil company, said profits fell 15.1 percent in the quarter. Income at Texaco declined 8.9 percent and Occidental's earnings plunged 49 percent. A large independent refiner, Ashland Oil reported a 52.2 percent drop in earnings. 
 The results were no surprise. George F. Friesen, an analyst at Deutsche Bank Capital Group, said most major oil companies would post moderately lower profits for the second quarter, down an average of 15 percent.
The exception will be companies like ARCO and Unocal, which sell much of their gasoline in California, where retail prices and refining profit margins were higher than a year ago, he said. Unocal reported a twelvefold increase in profits last week. ARCO will report earnings on Monday.
"The third quarer will not be too different," Mr. Friesen said. Crude oil prices will be higher, but profit margins in refining and chemicals will continue to be squeezed by weak demand in the United States and Europe, he said. "In the aggregate, profits will be about flat with last year," he added.
Following are details of the companies' results:
 
Exxon
Net income declined to $955 million, or 76 cents a share, from $1.125 billion, or 90 cents a share, in the corresponding quarter last year. The total for the recent quarter included a one-time charge of $75 million for cutbacks in domestic oil and gas operations.
Revenues for company, based in Irving, Tex., rose 1.8 percent, to $27.8 billion from $27.3 billion.
Earnings from refining and marketing in the United States plunged to $47 million, from $113 million in the period a year ago, and to $133 million, from $419 million, in foreign refining and marketing operations.
The refining units had higher costs to buy inventories of raw crude oil, but could not raise prices at the same rate because of tepid demand, the company said. Profit margins in the period a year ago were unusually high because crude costs were low.
Profits in global chemical operations fell to $66 million from $79 million in the United States, but increased in foreign markets, to $51 million, from $31 million in the corresponding period last year.
Earnings from exploration and production activities rose slightly in the United States, to $181 million from $179 million, while the international exploration unit earned $544 million, compared with $463 million a year ago.
Exxon's share price rose $1.125, to $63.125, in trading today on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
Texaco
 The nation's fourth-largest oil company said net income declined to $245 million, or 85 cents a share, compared with $269 million, or 94 cents, a year ago. Revenues rose by 4.4 percent, to $9.4 billion from $9.0 billion.
But Texaco's share price rose $1, to $63.50, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
James W. Kinnear, president and chief executive, said Texaco had reduced spending programs and other expenses because of "generally weak industry conditions," and expected to reduce 1992 budgets from original levels to conserve $700 million by the end of the year.
"As of midyear, our progress towards meeting these goals is on target," he said.
The company, based in White Plains, said earnings from oil and gas exploration and production in the United States rose to $113 million from $111 million and increased to $94 million from $78 million in foreign operations.
Crude prices in the United States rose to an average of $16.70 a barrel in the quarter, from $16.48 in the corresponding period a year ago. Natural gas prices rose to $1.51 for 1,000 cubic feet, from $1.48 in the quarter a year ago.
Profits in domestic refining improved to $80 million, from $65 million in the quarter a year ago, mainly because of higher profit margins in California gasoline sales, lower refinery costs and higher gasoline output. For Texaco refineries and service stations along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, profits declined. Refining profits outside the United States fell to $94 million, from $129 million in the corresponding quarter last year.
 
Occidental
 Net income plunged to $75 million, or 25 cents a share, from $147 million, or 49 cents a share. Sales for the Los Angeles-based company declined 8.3 percent, to $2.2 billion from $2.4 billion.
Weak chemical prices overwhelmed improvements in oil and gas production and natural gas pipeline operations that came mainly from favorable results in tax and legal issues. Profits in chemicals dropped to $35 million, from $127 million in the period a year ago. Ray R. Irani, chairman and chief executive, said chemical sales had risen recently.
Profits in oil and gas exploration and production, mainly outside the United States, rose to $82 million from $54 million. Results for the quarter ended June 30 included a $35 million gain from a legal settlement.
A favorable ruling that reversed a previous legal judgment resulted in a pretax gain of $75 million for the pipeline unit, including the Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America and United Texas Transmission Company. The 1991 results included a one-time gain of $26 million from a rate case refund.
Occidental's share price fell 25 cents, to $19.50, in trading on the Big Board.
 
Ashland Oil
 Net income fell to $32 million, or 54 cents a share, from $67 million, or $1.19 a share, in the second quarter last year. Revenues rose slightly, to $2.6 billion from $2.4 billion.
The refining unit, based in Ashland, Ky., earned slightly less than $1 million, compared with a profit of $79.5 million in the quarter a year ago. Profits also fell in gasoline marketing, chemicals and exploration. The Valvoline motor oil unit earned $17.1 million, a 10.3 percent gain from $15.5 million in the period last year.
Ashland Oil's share price rose 87.5 cents, to $24.75, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Sales Up by Ford and Japanese 'Transplants'

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 23

 BODY:
Sales of vehicles built in North America by the Ford Motor Company and the Japanese "transplant" auto makers rose 9.4 percent in mid-July, but analysts said the figures showed that consumers remained cautious.
Ford and the seven Japanese manufacturers with American assembly plants said they sold cars and light trucks at a daily rate of 14,365 from July 11 to 20, compared with a daily rate of 13,127 in the similar period last year. There were eight selling days in the 1992 period, compared with nine in 1991. 
 The General Motors Corporation, which is in the midst of a two-week vacation shutdown, did not report mid-July sales, and Ward's Automotive Reports said the lack of data from G.M. had prevented it from providing estimates for the Chrysler Corporation, which reports only monthly.
 
Rental Fleet Sales
 Based on about 44 percent of the market reporting, domestic cars sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of about six million units. Analysts said that figure was likely to change when G.M. and Chrysler sales were added, but they said the rate indicated a cautious level of consumer demand.
In the early July period, cars sold at a 6.5 million rate, and in late June they sold at a 7.5 million rate.
"The higher sales of the last few periods were boosted completely by the rent-a-car business," said Michael Luckey, an analyst with the Luckey Consulting Group. "It's not surprising that we fell back down to a six million level, with the dip in consumer confidence we've experienced."
He said recent increases in unemployment data were having a negative effect on consumers.
Sales of the Ford and American-built Japanese cars rose 3.5 percent over last year's levels, to 8,950 a day. But sales of light trucks rose 20.8 percent, to 5,414 a day.
Over all, Ford sold 40,826 cars, up 4.9 percent on a daily basis. In the July 1-10 period, Ford sold 49,188 cars domestically, an increase of 16 percent on a daily basis.
Ford has attributed the early July surge to advance orders from rental businesses.
In early July, Ford's light-truck sales, hurt by the July 4 holiday, were up only 1.3 percent over a year earlier, to 32,394. But in mid-July, they rebounded to 37,071, an 18.8 percent daily increase.
"Ford seems to be outperforming the major Japanese nameplates," David Garrity, an analyst for McDonald & Company, said. "That's representative of the pricing advantage they now enjoy.
Sales of domestically built Japanese nameplate cars and light trucks fell 10.5 percent on a daily basis, to a total of 31,336.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
MCI Earnings Climb 9.3% On Higher Calling Volume

 BODY:
The MCI Communications Corporation, citing business from newly won residential and business customers, said yesterday that second-quarter earnings rose 9.3 percent, to $141 million, as revenue rose 10.6 percent.
Despite the favorable news, the stock market bid MCI's stock price down slightly. In over-the-counter trading yesterday, MCI closed at $32.50 a share, down 37.5 cents. 
 Analysts said the profit, up from $129 million in last year's second quarter, was in line with expectations, and they expressed surprise that MCI's stock had declined. "Maybe people were focusing on expenses, which were higher than my model predicted," said Charles W. Schelke, a telecommunications analyst at Smith Barney.
Sales, administrative and general expenses rose 9.7 percent, to $687 million.
Revenues were $2.6 billion, up from $2.35 billion in the comparable period last year.
MCI's earnings per share rose to 53 cents, from 50 cents a year earlier. In the 1992 second quarter, MCI had 266 million shares outstanding, up 6 million from a year earlier because of a newly formed employee stock ownership program.
Like its major competitors in the long-distance market -- the top-ranked A.T.& T. and the third-place Sprint Corporation -- MCI, No. 2, has had to cope with a sluggish economy in which residential customers have tried to reduce their calling and corporations have laid off thousands of office workers, who account for the great majority of calling during daylight hours.
MCI said the number of minutes of customer use had grown 14.6 percent, but was not more specific. Earlier this month A.T.& T. reported traffic growth of about 6 percent, and the Sprint Corporation reported 3.3 percent growth. But minutes of use, while generally more reflective of the actual level of business growth than revenue, is sometimes calculated differently by each company, making comparisons difficult.
MCI has pursued large corporate accounts with extensive services and low prices, while offering a popular residential counterpart in its Friends and Family program. The company has won major contracts with Citicorp, Holiday Inn, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Minnesota state government.
Under the residential program, customers get a 20 percent discount for their calls by encouraging up to 20 other people in a "calling circle" to join MCI.

HEADLINE: David Wojnarowicz, 37, Artist in Many Media

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN

 BODY:
David Wojnarowicz, one of the most individual artists of the 1980's, whose impassioned and outspoken work about AIDS thrust him into the center of the recent debates involving the National Endowment for the Arts, died on Wednesday night at his home in Manhattan. He was 37 years old.
He died of AIDS, said his companion, Tom Rauffenbart. 
 Mr. Wojnarowicz (pronounced voy-nah-ROH-vitch) worked in many media, often mixing them together, to produce an art that was distinguished by its rage and its spirit of personal longing. His paintings, photographs, installations, performances and writings railed against the status quo as they also mourned death. He dealt not only with AIDS but with many other issues, both public and private. His art could be simplistic and preachy. Yet it could also be unnerving, wry and very moving.
Like the artist himself, his art never pulled punches. Mr. Wojnarowicz gained the national spotlight in 1989, when the National Endowment for the Arts decided to rescind money for a catalogue to an exhibition about AIDS because of an essay in which he attacked various public figures. The endowment reversed itself. It also supported a 10-year retrospective of his work that was organized at the University Galleries of Illinois State University in Normal, Ill., which included a catalogue that reproduced the essay.
Mr. Wojnarowicz was in the news again after the American Family Association of Tupelo, Miss., an antipornography lobbying group, and its leader, the Rev. Donald E. Wildmon, issued a pamphlet criticizing the endowment. The pamphlet included photographs cropped from works by Mr. Wojnarowicz that included sexual images. The artist sued the organization for misrepresenting him and damaging his reputation. In 1990, a Federal District Court judge in New York ruled in his favor and ordered that the organization publish and distribute a correction. Mr. Wojnarowicz was the only artist to challenge Mr. Wildmon in court.
 
The East Village Scene
 An abused child and a teen-age street hustler, Mr. Wojnarowicz made much of his personal history in the social margins in his art and writings. He was born in Red Bank, N.J., ran away from home, lived on the streets, and eventually graduated from the High School of Music and Art in Manhattan. One of many artists of his generation to achieve recognition in the boom-and-bust East Village art scene of the early 80's, Mr. Wojnarowicz was first known for stenciling images of burning houses and falling figures onto the sides of buildings. He typified the approach of artists from the East Village who felt free to explore various media, to mix high and low art.
In his writings, which moved from the shrill to the elegiac, he often recounted the goings-on of those on the sexual and economic periphery. In 1990 he published "Close to the Knives" (Random House). Another book, "Memories That Smell Like Gasoline" is to be published by Artspace Books in San Francisco.
In his paintings and photographs, which sometimes incorporated texts, he borrowed from popular culture and created images that could be darkly surreal. One concocted photographic image, of buffaloes toppling over a cliff, became the cover of an album by the band U2. The death from AIDS of his friend Peter Hujar, the photographer, in 1987, and the diagnosis in 1988 of his own illness, prompted Mr. Wojnarowicz to bear witness in his art to the disease and its social and psychological impact.
He is survived by his mother, Dolores Voyna of Manhattan; two sisters, Pat Bernier of Paris and Linda Zaccaria of East Brunswick, N.J.; and two brothers, Peter, of Englishtown, N.J., and Steven, of East Windsor, N.J.

Next Season at Second Stage
Carole Rothman, the artistic director of the Second Stage, has announced her new season. First up is "A . . . My Name Is Still Alice," the topical musical revue that recently played six weeks at the Old Globe Theater in San Diego. The show was conceived and directed by Joan Micklin Silver and Julianne Boyd, who created the original "A . . . My Name is Alice" in 1984. Among the numbers in the new version, Ms. Rothman says, are "The Clarence Thomas Home for Unwed Mothers" and "It Ain't Over," about sex and the older woman. Contributors to the revue include Steve Tesich, David Zippel, Carol Hall, Amanda McBroom, Lucy Simon and Susan Birkenhead. 
 Next up will be a new, still untitled play by Tina Howe, about two couples and a third man, and the difficulties of fidelity in marriage; Ms. Rothman is to direct. Then, Gary Sinise is to direct "Sticks and Bones," by David Rabe, starring Peter Weller and Ethan Hawke. These plans may sound familiar because they were announced for last season but fell through. A fourth play is still to be announced. Subscriptions: (212) 787-8302.
 
Casting 'My Favorite Year'
 Don't look for Victor Garber to star in "My Favorite Year," the musical-comedy version of the 1982 film about an aging matinee idol and a young television writer. Although word was favorable from the recently completed workshop in which Mr. Garber played the actor, Bernard Gersten, the executive producer of Lincoln Center Theater, says Mr. Garber withdrew for economic reasons. "None of the theaters can compete financially with movies or television," Mr. Gersten says. "We're sorry to lose him. But he is shooting Nora Ephron's new movie in August, and he has a recurring role on a Canadian television series." Mr. Gersten says Andre Bishop, the artistic director of the theater, is in London auditioning actors. (Peter O'Toole played the role in the film.) Mr. Gersten adds that the casting office at the Royal National Theater is helping with the search. Evan Pappas is to play the writer.
 
The Public's Library
 Among the seven pink slips recently issued at the New York Shakespeare Festival were a few for the Archives Department, which has documented the history of the theater since Joseph Papp founded it in 1954. Serge Mogilat, its director, has been given a year to find a new home for the staggering amount of material that has been collected, everything from ticket stubs to videotapes, of which there are 900. They contain interviews given by Papp and television reviews, which feature clips that in most cases are the only record of a show.
"The collection will logically end with Mr. Papp's death," Mr. Mogilat says. "Right now, we are considering two options. The Library of Congress approached us first to start a Joseph Papp wing in its manuscript division, which documents the lives of famous American personalities in different fields. And the performing-arts library at Lincoln Center approached me about putting in a bid to keep the material in New York City. We have already given them our news clippings on microfilm, dating from 1954. But our problem is that one library might not be able to take everything, and we don't want to decimate the collection."
Besides copies of all of Papp's speeches, memos and correspondence, the collection includes everything from the scripts for plays he optioned but never produced to production books, which are working versions of a script with complete sets of cues for new productions. There are also numerous versions of scripts from their initial submission, when Papp first showed interest in them, through to their final performances, documenting the entire play development process. Complete music files contain the original score of every show Papp produced, including "A Chorus Line"; full sets of blueprints for original set designs; audio tapes of radio interviews and commercials, and one-of-a-kind photographs. And, Mr. Mogilat adds, that's not even half of it.
 
Autumn Openings
 The first wave of theatrical activity for the new season is starting, including the announcement of a bona fide Broadway opening. "The Woman in Black," a thriller that has been playing in London since 1989, is to open at the Music Box Theater on Oct. 29, at a cost of $1.3 million. The play was adapted by Stephen Mallatratt from Susan Hill's horror novel about an aging lawyer, haunted by the memory of a woman in black, who hires a young actor to help him exorcise his past. Robin Herford, a former artistic director of Alan Ayckbourn's theater in Scarborough, England, will direct.
Off Broadway, you can expect to see "Remembrance," the well-reviewed drama that had an extended run at the Irish Arts Center two seasons ago. The love story, set in Belfast, Northern Ireland, is to open at the John Houseman Theater on Sept. 24 starring Milo O'Shea, Frances Sternhagen and Mia Dillon.
And on Sept. 8, just in time for the campaign season, a tour of -- you guessed it -- "Camelot," starring Robert Goulet, begins in Detroit.
 
Two for Summer
 The John Drew Theater at Guild Hall of East Hampton, L.I., is offering two theatrical events to watch for this summer. Spalding Gray will perform his work in progress, "Gray's Anatomy," a monologue about his search for a cure for a vision problem, next Thursday and Friday. And in case you missed Roger Rosenblatt's well-received one-man show at the American Place Theater last season, he will perform "Free Speech in America" on Aug. 14. Information: (516) 324-4050.
 
In Print and on Disk
 Also in the summer pleasures category, Applause Books has just published "13 by Shanley," a collection of plays by John Patrick Shanley, who also wrote the Oscar-winning screenplay for "Moonstruck." . . . "You're the Top: Cole Porter in the 30's" is a collection of three compact disks that you can find in most stores or order from the Indiana Historical Society. The set, which commemorates the centenary of Porter's birth in Peru, Ind., includes recordings by Fred Astaire, Ella Fitzgerald, Ethel Merman and Porter himself. The album also has a biography of the composer by Robert Kimball, the music theater historian. Information: (317) 232-1882.

HEADLINE: Review/Architecture;
Steel and Backbone in Hard Times

BYLINE: By HERBERT MUSCHAMP

 BODY:
LEAVE it to the Municipal Art Society to mount a tasteful political protest. Last week, when the Democrats were in town, the members of this century-old organization of civic do-gooders didn't surround Madison Square Garden with bullhorns or scrawled posters. Instead they occupied the decorous Urban Center Galleries and opened a dignified rally of a show. Its theme is New York's tradition of great public works; its purpose is to stimulate ideas for reviving that tradition.
"Steel, Stone and Backbone," which runs through Sept. 19, is a protest against recessionary thinking. It's a strike against the idea that in hard economic times people should lower their expectations about what kind of city they want to live in. In fact, the point of the show is to offer historical proof to the contrary. When the going gets tough, the tough get ambitious about architecture. Much of the New York that is most admired -- its water and transportation systems, housing, cultural institutions -- emerged from periods of economic crisis. 
 The show, put together by Laura Rosen, an archivist with the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, offers a look at six of these periods and the public works they produced. Many viewers will already be familiar with one of them: the Great Depression and its astounding record in projects for housing, recreation and transportation. With segments devoted to such projects as La Guardia Airport, Orchard Beach in the Bronx and the Queens-Midtown Tunnel (with a video presentation on the "sand hogs" who built it), the 1930's takes up most of the exhibition space.
But the real news of the show is that the building boom of the 30's wasn't the exception. It was the rule. Such booms have frequently coincided with financial busts, or as they were termed in the 19th century, "panics." The Panic of 1837 saw the building of the Croton Water System, including the monumental Egyptian Revival reservoir that used to stand on the current site of the New York Public Library. After the Panics of 1873 and 1893, work began on the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the American Museum of Natural History and the New York Zoological Society, later known as the Bronx Zoo. What a panic.
"Steel, Stone and Backbone" deals more with economics, politics and labor than with architectural esthetics. Still, the works on view convey the power of buildings to create strong images of public service. When Government officials are holding fire sales on urban properties, it's instructive to review the monuments left by periods when serving the public was a noble end that called for noble forms. The design of the Orchard Beach bathhouse, for example, equals the Rainbow Room in Art Deco elegance.
These examples of urban bootstrapping are inspiring, but it would be helpful to have something more than inspiration. What is the key to these success stories? Does history offer a pattern we can follow today?
Sorry. There is no key. The motives behind these works are as varied as the projects themselves. Disastrous fires and a cholera epidemic prompted the building of the Croton Water System. Social ambition -- the oblige of would-be noblesse -- spurred wealthy collectors to erect the Metropolitan Museum to "educate and better the lot of the working classes." And the record of the 30's would be a good deal skimpier if it hadn't been for Robert Moses' rabid lust for power. Since history doesn't hand us a key, however, the implicit message of this show is that we will have to invent one for ourselves. And perhaps invention is the key we're looking for.
This political speech of a show has visual as well as polemic appeal. Among the curiosities on view are two panels prepared by Calvert Vaux and Frederick Law Olmsted for the 1857 competition to design Central Park. Combining cartography, photography and painting, each panel features a map of the park site and "before" and "after" images showing how Olmsted and Vaux proposed to transform different portions of the landscape. These forward-looking mixed-media works (photography was a recent invention) should jolt us out of the habit of equating Olmsted with the sweetly picturesque. If he were alive today, this pioneering artist would be dazzling us with holograms.
Ms. Rosen offers some smart image mixes of her own. Pictures of the Bronx Zoo, for instance, are set beside William Holbrook Beard's 1879 painting of vicious bears and bulls rampaging on Wall Street. The juxtaposition brings to mind the financial predators of a more recent day who have done time behind bars.
"Steel, Stone and Backbone" goes soft at the end, with strained attempts to declare the present a time of maintaining the "basic infrastructure" of a "mature cityscape." It would be great indeed if the kind of energy that went into building these projects could be applied to maintaining them. But clearly the Municipal Art Society has its sights set on bigger things than rustproofing. And there's an ulterior motive here as well: a bid by the society to refurbish its public image. Just as the Democrats are seeking more mainstream appeal, the Municipal Art Society wants to cast off its image of upscale gentility. That's why, instead of potted palms, they've adorned the galleries with such tough-guy paraphernalia as hard hats and rubber pylons.
Actually, this organization outgrew its tea-party image long ago. In recent years it has shown its well-developed political muscle in major projects all over town. Sometimes it flexes its biceps publicly, as when it brought suit to halt a development proposal for Columbus Circle. More often its members have worked behind the scenes, political equivalents of the sand hogs toiling beneath the East River. "Steel, Stone and Backbone" is one of several events that will honor the society's centennial. What better way to ward off recessionary blues than to toast the vigor of this venerable group?

 	 	 		. . .	 	"Steel, Stone and Backbone: New York Builds in Hard Times" remains at the Urban Center Galleries, 457 Madison Avenue, at 51st Street, through Sept. 19. Tomorrow afternoon at 1, John Kriskiewicz, the architectural historian, will lead a four-hour bus tour of major New York City public works. Tickets are $22 for Municipal Art Society members; $30 for nonmembers. Reservations: (212) 935-3960.

PEROT WARNS OF ECONOMIC CATASTROPHE

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, July 23

 BODY:
Ross Perot says the country is near a severe recession or depression that could bring an "avalanche" of bank and savings institution closures far beyond the ability of the Federal agencies to salvage. 
 The Texas billionaire, who dropped out of the Presidential race last week, said in an interview in today's issue of The Los Angeles Times that he was considering running television advertisements warning the American public of an impending economic catastrophe. He has said his economic plan, which he plans to publish soon, would force the Republican and Democratic parties to detail their economic policies.

HEADLINE: Democracy Denied in Algeria

 BODY:
When Algeria's army staged a coup in January, heading off an anticipated Islamic electoral triumph, Washington, like other Western governments, winked.
Apologists for the coup warned of frightening consequences if Algeria's Islamic Salvation Front had been allowed to compete. Though the Front's official leadership had promised conciliation and economic reform, apologists argued that radicals would soon have swept aside these moderates. Further elections would have been banned, foreign policy radicalized, market reforms diluted, human rights of non-believers abused. 
 It is of course impossible to know what would have happened had democracy been permitted to run its course. Given the record of Islamic rule in Iran and the Sudan, such fears can scarcely be dismissed.
But there is no need to speculate about what's happened since Algeria's coup. Elections remain suspended; elected local councils have been disbanded. Human rights have been trampled; thousands of Islamic militants spent weeks in desert prison camps. The army's strong-arm tactics have embarrassed, even discredited, Islamic moderates. And the Salvation Front has been radicalized.
Last month Algeria's provisional President was assassinated, perhaps by Islamic militants, perhaps by army dissidents. His successor has just installed a Socialist economic planner to run the Government. The new Prime Minister is known for his vocal criticism of free-market economics and of the International Monetary Fund.
In sum, the coup has accomplished almost everything the West did not want to see happen. Yet Western democracies remain silent. The new Algerian regime still welcomes foreign investment. The Islamic militants it persecutes are unlikely to seek refuge in Europe, as the Westernized elements might have under Islamic rule.
The West's attitude is remarkably shortsighted. Algeria's Islamic majority won't go away, nor will it become more democracy-minded when its electoral majorities are treated with contempt. Meanwhile, political instability is increasing.
The surest way out is an early return to the ballot box, with all parties free to compete. America's Algeria policy needs to be revisited.

HEADLINE: Time to Punish Hussein -- Again

 BODY:
Saddam Hussein continues to flout the authority of the United Nations, most recently by interfering with its arms inspectors. The U.N. Security Council cannot allow his repeated and flagrant violations of international law to go unpunished.
Devising appropriate and effective punishment won't be easy. But the U.N. cannot rule out military action -- including air strikes.
That action has a clear objective: to disarm Iraq in a way that bolsters the U.N.'s authority and undermines President Hussein's. Unilateral action by the U.S. won't do that.
U.N. implementation of the cease-fire resolution has been chipping away at Saddam Hussein's authority. He has reacted with calculated desperation, defying the U.N. wherever he can. He has just turned away U.N. arms inspectors from Iraq's Ministry of Agriculture, where Iraq was believed to have filed records of its arms purchases. These records could document Iraq's continuing non-compliance with the disarmament provisions of the cease-fire resolution.
That's not all. He has bullied U.N. personnel, even threatened them with hand grenades and car bombs. He has barred participation in U.N. efforts to draw Iraq's frontier with Kuwait. He has refused to renew the memorandum of understanding by which international humanitarian agencies have been conducting relief efforts in Iraq. And he continues to wage war on Shiite refugees near Basra. These provocations put President Bush under pressure to take military action. But acting unilaterally, or blindly bombing Baghdad, won't shore up the U.N. Even a punitive raid on the Agriculture Ministry building would simply scatter, if not destroy, evidence of illegal Iraqi arms.
Mr. Bush would be wiser to encourage the U.N. to take a number of steps that, together, would bring home to Iraq the costs of Mr. Hussein's continued defiance.
The Iraqi Air Force has breached the cease-fire accord by resuming flights of fixed-wing aircraft. Its air bases and planes can be put out of action. Selective attacks on military targets would show Iraq's armed forces that keeping this dictator in power is suicidal.
Mr. Hussein is trying to intimidate U.N. humanitarian workers and guards and force them out of Iraq. One has already been slain. The U.N. needs to protect its people in Iraq and punish those responsible for the slaying.
And Iraq continues to circumvent the economic embargo by way of Jordan. If Jordan cannot enforce the embargo, it can admit armed U.N. monitors to patrol its border. If it is unwilling to do so, it too could be liable to sanctions.
Saddam Hussein cannot defy the world with impunity. Stern punishment is required if the U.N. is not to emerge weaker, and a desperate dictator stronger, from the present confrontation.

HEADLINE: Break the Political Stranglehold

BYLINE: By John B. Anderson; John B. Anderson is visiting professor at Nova University Law School.

DATELINE: FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.

 BODY:
When Ross Perot suddenly quit the Presidential race, he left millions of supporters without a candidate. Frustrated with a two-party duopoly, many feel they are without real choices or real voices; they wonder what to do next. It doesn't have to be this way. We could easily make it simpler for new candidates like Ross Perot to run and allow supporters of these new candidates to vote their true beliefs.
In 1980, I ran for President as an independent. I had my name put on the ballot in all 50 states and for a time my standing in the polls was over 20 percent, showing that millions of Americans supported my platform. Yet in the end I only received about 7 percent of the vote. It wasn't because all those voters stopped supporting me. It was because many calculated that I couldn't win and that a vote for me would be wasted. 
 A system called majority preferential voting could eliminate the chilling effects of this "wasted vote" syndrome. Used in Australia since the 1920's, preferential voting both insures that a winner has majority support and sensibly allows voters for losers to have a second chance.
Here's how it works. Rather than simply vote for one candidate, voters rank candidates in order of preference, putting a 1 next to their first choice, a 2 next to their second choice and so on until they no longer want to support any remaining candidate.
After voting is completed, first choices are counted. If a candidate receives more than 50 percent, he or she wins. But if no candidate has a majority, the candidate with fewest first-choice votes is eliminated, and the ballots of voters who indicated that candidate as their first choice are redistributed to their second choices. This process continues until a candidate gains over 50 percent.
As with runoff elections, majority preferential voting insures that the winner has majority support but has several additional advantages over runoffs.
It is cheaper, as no second election is required.
It increases the likelihood of having a high voter turnout in the determining election; in runoff elections, supporters of eliminated candidates often do not vote.
It promotes positive campaigning: Because candidates may need votes transferred from eliminated candidates, they will not want to alienate other candidates' supporters.
Would preferential voting have changed the 1980 result? Probably not. However, I might have received 20 percent of the vote, as my candidacy would have been treated more seriously, and more people might have voted. Ronald Reagan likely would have been forced to explain his economic program more thoroughly with me as a serious contender. His mandate as President also would have been clearer if his victory had depended on a significant number of transfer votes from my supporters -- people who wanted change, but not Reaganomics.
Most important, the two-party duopoly's stranglehold on political discourse would have been broken. More candidate voices and voter choices would improve our political process, just as a free market in economics results in products more suited to consumers' tastes. We would have a revolution if people were forced to choose between two cars; why should we be forced to choose between only two parties?
Watching the distraught Ross Perot volunteers react to his withdrawal, I was struck by the tragedy that so many Americans want to be involved, want to make a difference, yet keep being disillusioned by broken promises and Teflon bureaucracies. Don't we owe them the right to have as much of a voice as possible? Don't we owe them consideration of a simple, sensible reform like preferential voting? I believe we do. A vote is a terrible thing to waste.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Getting Saddam Hussein

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL; Anthony Lewis is on vacation.

 BODY:
By God, we have to teach that Saddam Hussein a lesson. Bomb Iraq.
Great idea, sir. The only thing is, then what? Do we go on bombing him until he resigns or something? 
 Well, no, that has not seemed to work before. But maybe he will back down after all. Maybe then he will be good, and disclose all his nuclear secrets to U.N. inspectors.
So we give him another chance?
No, that hasn't worked either. Let's pray hard that one of our bombs sends him to hell.
That would be nice. But then, his family and his top command would take over. Himmler-Goring leading the post-Hitler reform movement; doesn't seem right, somehow . . .
Well, of course -- none of these great ideas will work. The debate in the U.S. Government about what to do about Saddam is largely puerile and evasive because it does not confront the basic truth.
By keeping Saddam in power after he lost the gulf war, the U.S. made a historic error from which there is no one-track way out short of another all-out war.
But unless he is insane enough to make his own second historic error -- another direct act of aggression -- the coalition cannot be recreated nor public support mustered to support another Desert Storm.
So some of our bureaucrats and commentators are pushing an entirely different Grand Strategy. Do nothing! That would really catch him off guard! We could then just let sanctions squeeze him into exhaustion!
Relying on sanctions alone would extend the smuggling license for Saddam's ally, everybody's pal, the King of Jordan. Then, how many years before Saddam Hussein rebuilds his nuclear base -- five, six?
And if anybody cares, there is the additional point that without fear of reprisal he will wipe out tens of thousands more Kurds and other Iraqi rebels.
But, if we face reality, it is in those very people that the answer lies.
Both the basis and the base for the strategy against Saddam exist already, inside Iraq. A Kurdish government is in place in northern Iraq, chosen by election, not imposed by tyranny, and should be recognized by the U.S. No law or self-interest ties us to continued recognition of Saddam and his killer regime -- the contrary.
With U.S. help, all anti-Saddam Iraqi exiles could convene in Northern Iraq to form a new resistance government including Kurds, and Sunni and Shiite Muslims, and a unified army of liberation. '
But let's face it plain: To survive against the tanks and weapons we so kindly left with Saddam, the resistance forces would need economic assistance -- plus antiaircraft and antitank batteries. Also needed would be air support -- a euphemism for bombing, for specific military purpose, not political show.
And there'll be times when feuds among resistance groups will make American officials wish they had never heard of any of them. But the Kurds and the others say they can come together for the fight against Saddam. They need the chance, as the U.S. needs them to rid itself of Saddam's perpetual threat to Mideast peace.
To bring it off, the U.S. will also need the support of Turkey. Washington must free itself of the ludicrous thought that it must preserve the "territorial integrity" of Iraq.
The country was carved from the Turkish empire by the British in the 20's -- with a fine eye for British oil interests. Now there are new struggles, new values, new interests important in the area -- including those of friends of the U.S. like the Kurds and the Turks.
And it is naive to believe that the present Bush Government could do it -- that all those experts who gave us the appeasement of Iraq, the strange loans and the decision to desert the Kurds would be able to think straight, clean and strong enough. If Mr. Bush is re-elected, he will have to be tough-minded enough to bring in people with fresh minds, tough enough to do some rethinking himself, or Saddam will remain in power.
Governor Clinton says he will back U.N. action against Saddam -- and that is as far as he will go now.
But he should demand full intelligence briefings right away. And if his advisers are as good as they should be, they will tell him that the removal of the Saddam gang is essential but will be hard and complex to work out. That's the price of the U.S. retreat from victory after Desert Storm, and no use pretending it isn't.

HEADLINE: Time for U.S. to Rediscover Philippines

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Corazon Aquino's triumph over Ferdinand Marcos in the Philippines six years ago, with its inspiring slogan of People Power, was headline news in the United States, avidly followed by millions of Americans. In sharp contrast, Fidel Ramos's recent assumption of the Philippine presidency received very little attention, in Washington or on Main Street.
Undoubtedly, this is partly a reflection of this country's general fatigue with international affairs -- given our domestic economic malaise and this being an election year. But I suspect it also has to do with the specific unhappiness of Washington over having been booted out of our military bases in the Philippines, plus considerable official disappointment over what Mrs. Aquino's once-promising people power failed to achieve. 
 The Philippines clearly remains the sick man of East Asia -- left in the dust by Korea and Taiwan in the 1960's and 70's, and by Thailand and Malaysia in the 80's -- and it has one of the worst poverty profiles in the third world.
As a consequence, the much-proclaimed special relationship with our former colony now finds itself on a not-so-special back burner. Interest in the multilateral aid initiative, for example, which was originally championed by the United States, is clearly flagging, with the White House scarcely lifting a finger to resist additional Congressional cuts in our own contribution.
The irony of all this is that we are threatening to pull away at the very moment in history when the opportunity for real change in the Philippines is probably greater than at any time in the past.
You saw hints of hope in Manila in a June 1 editorial, and President Ramos's initial pronouncements since having taken over indicate a realization that the hour is late and an intention to shake his Government loose from the amiable passivity of the Aquino years. Moreover, the potential for United States influence on the quality of Philippine policies remains large, despite our own budgetary limitations.
Indeed, the absence of an agreement on Philippine bases and the related end of an aid program widely interpreted as rent payment provide a more favorable setting for an objective discourse on policy, accompanied by arm's length, if lower level, financial flows.
Linking substantive reforms to hard-nosed generosity is never easy, but, as illustrated by the East Asian experience of the 1960's, it is the only way. President Ramos is not a member of the traditional elite that has consistently ruled the Philippines. The country's entrepreneurs, its working people and its technocrats remain unusually strong. Its powerful vested interest groups are temporarily on the defensive.
This is likely to be just the time when renewed United States engagement with the Philippines and a reinvigorated multilateral aid initiative are likely to have the best chances for success.

HEADLINE: Economic Memo;
Yeltsin Walks Path That F.D.R. Once Trod

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
President Boris N. Yeltsin, as did Franklin D. Roosevelt, has only a layman's knowledge of economics. Yet like F.D.R. he is presiding over a historic economic reorganization. And like Roosevelt, Mr. Yeltsin is groping for the right mix of free markets and government intervention to make Russia's economy function and prosper.
Yevgeny Yasin, director of the Russian League of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, sees considerable similarities between the leaders. "Where the two men converge is on the question of how much government help any market-oriented, capitalist economy must have," he said. 
 Mr. Yeltsin would recognize in Roosevelt's experiences in Depression America similarities to his own efforts to steer the Russian economy through hard times.
They come at the problem from opposite directions. When Roosevelt became President in 1933, the United States economy was mostly a free-market system. But the marketplace had broken down. Roosevelt's challenge was to enlist the state in reviving consumer demand. He eventually did this through deficit spending, in effect printing money and putting it into people's hands to spend.
Roosevelt acted reluctantly, inveighing frequently against unbalanced budgets. He always felt more at home promoting a second, safety-net role for government; to protect Americans from the ravages of the Depression, he created programs like Social Security, Federal bank-deposit insurance and workers' compensation.
 Mr. Yeltsin's task is the opposite -- creating free markets, and cutting back governmental systems. While pursuing his task, the burly, white-haired Russian President is using the same tool, deficit spending, that so preoccupied the smiling and debonair Roosevelt. Should the Yeltsin Administration continue to print money to subsidize big state companies, keeping them afloat while they try to make the transition to private corporations in the new marketplace?
Like Roosevelt, Mr. Yeltsin inveighs publicly against deficit spending, but is giving in. And like Roosevelt, he seems more comfortable in a different sort of government role, also creating safety net features like unemployment insurance for a nation certain in the future to have major layoffs or new regulations for the new commercial banks.
As Roosevelt did initially -- even upon hearing the advice of John Maynard Keynes, the great British economist -- Mr. Yeltsin has resisted the notion of deficit spending to stimulate the economy. But not recently. Last week, with Mr. Yeltsin's acquiescence, Parliament raised the ceiling for 1992 deficit spending, mostly for subsidies to state-owned enterprises, to help them preserve jobs.
Sergei Ignatyev, a vice chairman of the Russian central bank, has also considered the Yeltsin-Roosevelt comparison and its implications for Russian policy. One form of deficit spending in Russia is done through the central bank, which can create new credit.
"The American Depression was brought about by the Federal Reserve, which allowed the money supply to shrink," Mr. Ignatyev said, alluding to the tight-money policies of Herbert Hoover and, at first, Roosevelt. "We are not making that mistake. We are increasing the money supply by 10 percent every month -- very fast."
 
No Lack of Demand
 Unlike in Depression-era America, with consumer spending so moribund it had to be revived with public works spending, Russians are eager to buy right now. There is no lack of consumer demand. Instead, there is a lack of supply from the state companies that the Yeltsin Government persists in subsidizing, in the process feeding money into workers' pockets. The concern is that with so much money and so few goods, inflation, now nearly 20 percent a month, will skyrocket.
As a lesser evil, some of Mr. Yeltsin's advisers argue to cut off deficit spending and let enterprises fail. The millions of unemployed Russians will in time find work, these advisers say, as new private companies emerge to satisfy the desire for goods. Roosevelt got similar advice to let market forces take their course, and he generally heeded it, until 1937. After all, the economy was recovering slowly, and unemployment had fallen to 14 percent from 25 percent in 1933.
Then the bottom fell out again. Unemployment jumped back to 19 percent and Roosevelt turned to deficit spending.
In Russia, with unemployment just beginning to rise, and the state enterprises clamoring for help to survive the transition, Mr. Yeltsin might be throwing in the towel faster than Roosevelt.

HEADLINE: White-Black Disparity in Income Narrowed in 80's, Census Shows

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 23

 BODY:
The long-standing income gap between black and white households in the United States remained wide in the 1980's, narrowing only slightly. But data from the 1990 Census released today show there were also sharp regional disparities.
The new data provide the most comprehensive state-by-state picture of the range of incomes among racial and ethnic groups. In the Northeast and on the West Coast, where many households did well, black households generally fared better than others. In New York State, for example, among whites the median household income, adjusted for inflation, increased 19 percent to $35,811; among blacks it increased 29 percent to $24,089. 
 But the slumping economy of the Midwest hit blacks harder than any other racial group. Income disparities between blacks and whites widened sharply along a belt of states from Ohio to Minnesota, as the automobile-manufacturing and metal-bending industries, which attracted thousands of rural Southern blacks to urban jobs two generations ago, closed their doors on the migrants' children and grandchildren.
Indiana's numbers tell the story: median household income for whites dropped 1 percent; for blacks it dropped 16 percent.
 
Gap Is Slightly Smaller
 The 1990 Census asked people how much income they had during the previous year. Since then, the nation's economy has been set back by a recession that has been particularly severe in the Northeast and West. Nevertheless, economists and demographers say that the detail offered in these Census numbers will be crucial to the continuing debate over how fairly income is distributed in the United States.
Nationally, the 1989 median household income was $31,435 for whites and $19,758 for blacks. Put another way, a black household typically brought in 63 cents for every $1 that went to a white household. In 1979, it was 62 cents for every $1.
These were among a wealth of new data measuring, by racial group, educational attainment, income, labor-force status and poverty in states and the District of Columbia. The Census Bureau had released overall figures in these categories this year but without racial breakdowns.
Among other things, the data revealed that New Jersey and Maryland were areas of relative prosperity for all racial groups in the 1980's and that Asians in New Jersey had a median household income of $52,846, the highest level for any group in any state.
The lowest was for American Indians in South Dakota: $11,017.
Among blacks in Maryland, the median household income was $30,746, higher than any other state with a black population of more than 200,000. People who identified themselves as Hispanic, who can be of any race, make up only 2.6 percent of Maryland's population, but they fared better there than in any other state, with a median household income of $37,300.
 
Asians Are Prospering
 The data provided new evidence that Asians, the nation's smallest and fastest-growing racial minority, generally had higher household incomes than the population as a whole. Overall, the nation's median household income was $30,056. For Asians, who represent 2.9 percent of the population, the figure was $36,784. For Hispanic households, which now represent 9.0 percent of the population, the figure was $24,156.
The data also confirmed earlier surveys showing that Asians were the nation's best educated racial group. Among all people ages 25 and older, 75.2 percent are high school graduates, and 20.3 percent have college degrees; among Asians, 77.5 percent are high-school graduates, and 36.6 percent have college degrees.
 
'The Door Has Been Shut'
 With the exception of Wisconsin, the states where blacks lost the most ground were those with high out-migration of both blacks and whites. The states that showed the greatest income gains among blacks, like Maryland and Washington, were also states where the black population increased far more than the national rate of 13.2 percent. Maryland's black population rose 24 percent; Washington's rose 42 percent.
"In the past, for the blacks to get good incomes, they had to move from the rural South to the North," said William Frey, a researcher in the University of Michigan's Population Studies Center, which did a preliminary computer analysis of the data for The New York Times. "Now we're seeing the areas blacks are moving from are not only in the rural South but also in the urban North."
In much of the South, where income disparities between blacks and whites have traditionally been highest, the gaps widened. But the continuation of this trend was less surprising to demographers than the extent to which the impact of Midwestern industrial decay had fallen disproportionately on black households.
"The Midwest has taken its hits in general, but the economy took a particular hit at the black population because these were entry-level, labor-intensive kinds of work," Professor Frey said. "They were important ways to get in the door to the middle class. Now the door has been shut."
Illinois was the exception as black households lost economic ground to white households in Ohio, West Virginia, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, Missouri and Minnesota. A decade earlier, most of these states had been national leaders in closing the gap between black and white incomes.
In 25 states, including New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Maryland, California and Washington, the income gains of black households outpaced those of whites.
 
Focus on Ethnic Groups
 Other Government surveys permit some regional comparisons on income, poverty and employment among blacks and whites, but the new Census data provide a sharper focus on less-numerous racial groups, like Asians and Indians, and smaller regions.
For instance, they reveal that Asians in Rhode Island have been left out of the general trend of Asian prosperity; they have high rates of unemployment and low household incomes. Nearly 28 percent of 18,000 Asians in Rhode Island had incomes below the poverty level, and nearly 13 percent of Asian men were unemployed in 1990.
The data that tracked employment status and poverty, which are the focus of several other surveys, revealed no new trends, but they did offer stark evidence of the degree of economic disparity between blacks and whites. Forty-four percent of all black children under age 5 lived in poverty in 1989; for whites the figure was 13.8 percent.
In the industrial Midwest and in the western half of the Old Confederacy, the poverty and employment data offered different views of the same bleak economic story for blacks. While the percentage of black children under age 5 living in poverty topped 60 percent in Louisiana, Wisconsin and Michigan, the number of black women working or seeking work fell below the national average in these states and many others in the central region of the country.
Across the Midwest and in states that bordered the Mississippi River from Minnesota south to New Orleans, the unemployment rates among black women were higher than the national average of 12.2 percent. The unemployment rates for black women in Louisiana (18.7 percent), Michigan (18.4 percent) and Wisconsin (17.3 percent) were the highest in the nation.
The same states also had the highest unemployment among black men: Michigan led with 22.1 percent, followed by Louisiana with 19.1 percent and Wisconsin with 18.8 percent.
Seven of the 10 states in which the disparity in household incomes between blacks and whites grew fastest were in the Midwest: Wisconsin, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio and Missouri. In the South, where the gap between the races was already widest, it generally widened even more. In both 1989 and 1979, six of the 10 states with the largest gaps were Southern: Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas, South Carolina and Georgia. In Georgia, the gap decreased somewhat during the decade; in the other states it widened.
The figures for Wisconsin are likely to revive a contentious debate over whether the state's generous welfare programs serve to attract poor blacks from nearby Chicago. From 1980 to 1990, the percentage of blacks in poverty rose from 27.8 percent to 40.8 percent. While white income was stagnant, black household income tumbled faster than anywhere in the country, dropping 21.8 percent in constant dollars from $20,711 to $16,189.
Yet while black population growth was anemic in other economically hard-hit Midwestern states, Wisconsin's black population increased by more than one-third, far faster than the national average of 13.2 percent.
In Arkansas, the home state of Gov. Bill Clinton, the Democratic Presidential nominee, white median household income rose by about 2 percent during the decade, while for blacks it fell by about 2.5 percent. In 1979, 41.4 percent of blacks were in poverty; in 1989, the figure was 40.9 percent. The total black population (374,000) and the number in poverty (154,000) remained virtually the same.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Black Voters;
In 2 Diverse Neighborhoods, Blacks Are Drawn to Clinton

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITHONIA, Ga., July 24

 BODY:
It is 23 miles in distance and a few light years in ambience from the ragged cottages of Atlanta's inner-city Fourth Ward to the $275,000 homes in the all-black Hunters Pace subdivision in this densely wooded suburb at the edge of metropolitan Atlanta.
But when it comes to Presidential politics these days, there is no difference at all. From McGruder Street in Atlanta, where the only sign of prosperity is the new Cadillacs driven by young crack dealers, to the swimming and tennis club here, black voters seem to be solidly in the Democratic fold. 
 In a topsy-turvy year, there is no guarantee that their feelings will not change if, as expected, Gov. Bill Clinton comes down from his current jolt of favorable publicity after the Democratic convention in New York. And there is certainly no guarantee that the views from the Fourth Ward and Hunters Pace mirror those of black America.
But interviews with blacks in these two entirely different neighborhoods indicated an enthusiasm for the Democratic ticket that seemed potentially in peril in recent months as Mr. Clinton feuded with the Rev. Jesse Jackson and risked offending the Democrats' most loyal constituency.
"A few months ago, I would have said my vote was more a vote against Bush," said Karen Walker, who is building a home here and wrote in Jesse Jackson's name in 1988 rather than vote for George Bush or Michael S. Dukakis. "Now I'd say it's more a vote for Clinton. I've seen a lot of him in the last month, and I like what he has to say."
Back in Atlanta, where Marvin Reed was inspecting his parents' sagging home in an area full of abandoned buildings only a few blocks from where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. grew up, the sentiment was about the same.
"I like Bill Clinton," Mr. Reed said, sipping on a Budweiser in the mid-day heat. "He wasn't born with a silver spoon in his mouth. He was raised without a father and stayed with his grandparents while his mother learned to be a nurse, and he came all the way up. I think that gives him an understanding Bush will never have."
In a New York Times/CBS News poll conducted July 8-11, 75 percent of blacks supported Mr. Clinton, 13 percent President Bush when the two were matched one-on-one. No polls with a broad enough sample to isolate black voters have been taken since the Democratic convention, but poll takers say it is certain that the surge of support in the overall electorate was reflected among blacks.
Motivating black voters has been a concern because of their relatively low turnout in Democratic primaries. In 1988, when Mr. Jackson was a candidate, blacks made up 21 percent of Democratic primary voters. This year, without him in the race, blacks made up 14 percent of the Democratic primary vote. In the 1988 general election, 86 percent of black votes went to Mr. Dukakis.
As in the electorate as a whole, many black voters interviewed voiced skepticism about politics and politicians, Mr. Clinton included.
"Not a one of them's worth three cents more than any other," said Mary Mattox, a housekeeper who was sitting on her porch, smoking a Winston and drinking coffee, across the street from Mr. Reed's parents' house.
But in the next breath she said she always voted and knew she was not going to vote for President Bush.
"The Democrats are for poor people and the Republicans are for the rich," she said. "Now Bush is even hurting the rich. Even the rich people are crying."
To some, the Democrats' post-convention hoopla has not obscured what they see as a failure of anyone to address the nation's most fundamental problems, particularly the Federal deficit, realistically.
"They're all a bunch of spineless wimps, from the President on down to Congress," said Marion Fye, a 46-year-old accountant who lives at Hunters Pace. "No one has the guts to say what it will take to get the budget under control. I want someone to tell me the truth, and no one's doing it."
But Mr. Fye, who said he usually votes Democratic in national campaigns but could not bring himself to vote for either Mr. Dukakis or Mr. Bush four years ago, plans to vote for Mr. Clinton.
It is clear that in addition to whatever short-term benefits the Democrats have gained, at least two more substantial long-term factors explain the positive responses here.
The first is the ailing economy. If change is this year's inescapable buzzword, no one wants it more than black voters who figure they will get the sourest portion of a sour economy.
 
Democrats to Get First Vote
 Allen Jones, a disabled 42-year-old former marine, and Robert Shorter, a 32-year-old with AIDS, sat on Mr. Jones's porch in Atlanta, as if in a grim snapshot of America's urban problems. Mr. Jones was animated and Mr. Shorter mostly silent as he sucked on cherry-flavored crushed ice, but both said they were sure to vote.
"I've never voted before," Mr. Jones said, "but I'm going to vote Democratic this time. You got all these kids that want to make something of themselves, and now they don't have a chance. I think Clinton wants to change things."
In Hunters Pace, where the world of Mr. Jones and Mr. Shorter seems far away, Beverly Perry sees it the same way. "Bush can't be the only one who can do this job," she said. "We need some fresh blood."
The other is that many blacks, both rich and poor, seem receptive to the more moderate message Mr. Clinton is voicing.
Ms. Mattox, the housekeeper, turned from the candidates to a lengthy criticism of welfare. She said she was not familiar with Mr. Clinton's views on the subject, but it was clear his call for welfare reform that would force recipients to work and limit eligibility would not trouble her.
"I work," she said. "I'm not on welfare, and I'm not on food stamps. You've got to cut some of these people off, so they don't think they can stay on welfare forever, and find a way to get benefits to people who really need it."
Similarly, Brent Wilson, a lawyer who lives in Hunters Pace, said the Democrats need a winner more than they need a candidate wedded to traditional liberal positions.
"I think traditionally the Democrats have had what has been considered a 'liberal agenda' and as a result, they haven't been in the White House," he said. "The values of the people who vote are leaning toward the middle, fiscally conservative but socially responsible. My leanings are that way, and I think the majority of black people who vote are leaning toward those kind of middle-America values."
Of 25 people interviewed, none brought up Mr. Clinton's squabbles with Mr. Jackson or Mr. Clinton's criticism of the rap performer Sister Souljah. None saw much significance on either count.
"I respect Jesse Jackson, but I try to form my own opinions," said Jackie Thurman, 39, who was supervising children at the Hunters Pace swimming pool. "I respect his opinion, but I don't think Jesse is 100 percent on the same wavelength as anyone."
Of those interviewed, only one, Alexander Jones, a 35-year-old butcher at a neighborhood market in the Fourth Ward, said he planned to vote for Mr. Bush.
"Clinton's a showboat," he said. "He's running around offering a chicken in every pot. When a man makes a lot of promises, you've got to watch him."

With her was her husband, Olson. (Photographs by Alan S. Weiner for The New York Times) (pg. 8)

HEADLINE: Brooklyn Leaders Back Beaten Woman

BYLINE: By CRAIG WOLFF

 BODY:
Police officials in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, met with more than two dozen angry and concerned community leaders yesterday, a day after a member of the 81st Precinct's Community Council accused several officers and a sergeant of beating her and her three grown children.
The officials called the meeting to address community outrage and defended the officers, saying they were simply responding to a fight between two sons of the council member, Ann B. Dodds. They added that all of the officers were injured in the dispute and that one had a broken shoulder. 
 Their account came as the two men whose fight led to the incident offered a sharply different account from the police version after they were released from jail last night.
Mrs. Dodds's sons, Harold Dodds and Tyrese Daniels, portrayed the events as Mrs. Dodds had, saying they were struck and arrested without provocation. And Mr. Dodds said the sergeant, Peter Viola, used a racial slur and said black families should handle their own problems.
"If you wouldn't call us out here, we wouldn't have to tame you like animals," he quoted Sergeant Viola as saying.
Mrs. Dodds's family is black. The officers and the sergeant are white.
Many of those who attended the meeting called by the police yesterday said they were satisfied with the officials' quick response and their pledge to investigate the dispute. But they said they were inclined to believe the account of Mrs. Dodds and her family.
"She speaks out," said Frances Hobson, president of the 81st Precinct Community Council, who was at the meeting. "She tells what's what. She tells the truth."
"Something bad happened," Mrs. Hobson said. "More than anything, this points to the need for better sensitivity training for white officers."
The Brooklyn District Attorney, Charles J. Hynes, has started a separate inquiry and had investigators in the neighborhood yesterday.
The meeting in the 81st Precinct station house at 30 Ralph Avenue was closed to reporters, but those who attended described what happened.
Police officials said they told the community leaders that many details were still unclear.
The commanding officer of Brooklyn Borough North, John J. Hill, an assistant chief, said that when officers first arrived, they saw Mr. Daniels holding a metal pipe and that he hit Mr. Dodds with it. Then, he said, as they tried to handcuff Mr. Dodds, they became involved in a struggle and that four officers, the sergeant and Mr. Dodds flipped over the fence. That is how, he said, one of the officers broke his shoulder.
 
Account Detailed
 City Councilwoman Annette Robinson, who was at the meeting, said Chief Hill was right in calling together religious and civic leaders, particularly, she said, after the recent disturbance in Washington Heights. But she said that her longtime relationship with Mrs. Dodds made her skeptical of the officials' story.
Mrs. Dodds, 57 years old, filed charges of excessive force on Thursday with the Civilian Complaint Review Board, as did several neighbors who said they saw the incident in front of Mrs. Dodds's home at 999A Lafayette Avenue. They said the officers repeatedly kicked and struck Mr. Dodds while he lay on the ground face down in handcuffs.
They also said that a sergeant became angry when Mrs. Dodds tried to read his badge number and when Mr. Daniels tried to take photographs. Mrs. Dodds said the sergeant pushed her, punched her in the head and threw the camera into the street. She and her daughter, Trina Daniels, 22, were treated for bruises at St. Mary's Hospital in Brooklyn.
Police officials said yesterday that Sergeant Viola sprained his neck and cut his mouth when he was "hit in the mouth with a camera." Of the officers involved, Jerome Bonser's left shoulder was broken, Kenny Paccio had a sprained back and Michael Sandano and Richard Ponzini had sprained wrists. All were treated at Wyckoff Heights Medical Center and released.
Mr. Dodds, 34, and Mr. Daniels, 29, complained of injuries but refused medical treatment, the police said. They were charged with resisting arrest and misdemeanor assault. Mr. Dodds was also charged with possession of marijuana.
Mr. Dodds said that he had been charged with resisting arrest before, but added that he had had no trouble with the police in the last five years. "I'm not a little angel -- nowhere near it," he said. But he added, "The way they were treating me and my family wasn't fair."
Mr. Daniels, an unemployed carpenter, said last night that he and his brother had worked out their disagreement with each other, but not with the police.
"I told the cops in the car, 'You all don't know what you just did. We aren't no average black family. They didn't believe me."
 
Community Support
 Mrs. Dodds is a member of the 81st Precinct Community Council and has lined the wall of a first-floor vestibule in her home with awards from the precinct honoring her work. She is the chairwoman of Community School Board 16 and a community planning board member.
Yesterday, community leaders offered support for Mrs. Dodds.
Representative Edolphus Towns of Brooklyn said he had been friends with Mrs. Dodds for 20 years and that she had always worked to improve police relations.
"Now for her to be the victim of police brutality, it's disturbing," Mr. Towns said. "This is a clear signal that there's more brutality out there than one would realize."

HEADLINE: Montana Wilderness Battle: Apportioning Pristine Acres

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BIG TIMBER, Mont.

 BODY:
Beneath a sky bruised by thunderstorms, the Crazy Mountains rise from the high plains of central Montana, a battleground without landmark status.
To the Crow Indians, who live on a reservation just southeast of here, the Crazy Mountains are a sacred place for feasting and spiritual journeys. To the Brand S Lumber Company, the largest employer in Livingston, 30 miles to the west, the Crazies hold valleys brimming with potential 2 by 4's. And to weekend warriors from places like Bozeman and Billings, these mountains are a backyard playground. 
 The fight these three groups are waging over the Crazies is but a skirmish in the grand struggle over Federal land in the Big Sky state. But it is typical of what is happening throughout Montana this summer as state residents and Congress try to settle one of the biggest and most drawn-out wilderness battles of the 20th century.
Nearly six million acres, most of it in the alpine heights of the Rockies, are at stake. The area, larger than Massachusetts, is not just the forest home of grizzly bears, wolves, elk and dozens of other big animals; it also represents the dreams of people who moved to this state believing it to be, as they say here, "the last best place."
 While copper used to fuel fortunes and political careers in Montana, these days scenery is the resource of consequence.
After a dozen years of furious argument over Montana's Federal lands, the state's senior senator, Max Baucus, a Democrat, introduced a bill last year that would designate 1.2 million acres as formal wilderness while freeing up four million acres for potential logging, mining, oil drilling and road building. Another 495,000 acres would be protected under special management, and 500,000 acres that were set aside in 1977 for study would remain pristine.
All six million acres are managed by the Forest Service, which has declared them off-limits to development pending the resolution of the wilderness debate.
In 1988, Congress passed a Montana wilderness bill involving much of the same land, but it was vetoed by President Reagan in one of his last acts in office. This year, the Senate passed its version of the bill by a 75-22 vote. It is now under consideration by several committees in the House.
The White House has deferred judgment on the new bill until a final version is ready. But recent polls suggest that the Bush Administration may have a tough time playing the Montana wilderness issue as a jobs-versus-environment debate -- the tack taken by the Administration in the fight over old-growth forests in the Pacific Northwest. In a poll conducted for the state's largest newspaper chain, Montanans approved of the wilderness bill by 55 to 29 percent, with 16 percent undecided.
 
A Political Football
 And when asked, "Should we protect the environment even if it means that people may lose their jobs," 57 percent of the state residents who were polled picked the environment, versus 36 percent who picked the economy and 7 percent who were unsure, The Billings Gazette reported.
The Crazy Mountains would not be protected under the bill -- one of many aspects of the measure that may keep it bottled up in the House this summer. But House leaders say the boundaries are likely to be redrawn to include such popular sites as Cowboys Heaven northwest of Yellowstone National Park and part of the Crazy Mountains. Critics say that under the Senate bill, too much of the land that would be protected is "rock and ice."
The Montana wilderness bill may be about fish and forests, but it is tied up in politics.
After Montana lost a congressional seat as a result of the 1990 Census, two of the state's enduring political figures, Representatives Pat Williams, a seven-term Democrat from the western side of the state, and Ron Marlenee, an eight-term Republican from the eastern prairies, ended up running against each other. The wilderness bill is a central issue in the race to determine who will represent the largest congressional district outside of Alaska.
Mr. Williams has backed the bill with some reservations. His support has alienated some of his conservationist allies who had urged him to fight to expand the boundaries of protected wilderness. Mr. Marlenee, who has ridiculed environmentalists as "prairie fairies" and "fern feelers," has decided not to fight the bill, but he has also threatened to request a Presidential veto if too much wilderness is included in the final measure.
 
'Vignette of Primitive America'
 Environmentalists, joined by a host of Hollywood celebrities who have recently made Montana into a sort of Malibu with mountains, are urging that the bill be killed unless more land is set aside. If no legislation is passed, they argue, the entire six million acres would remain pristine, protected by the cloud of indecision.
But the bill's backers contend that if Senator Baucus's bill dies in the House much of the land now under consideration for wilderness could eventually be opened to development.
Some of the environmental groups want to create a much larger wilderness area, covering several states -- an area sometimes called the American Serengeti for its abundance of wildlife.
"Much of this area is still a vignette of primitive America," said Lee Metzgar, chairman of the biology department at the University of Montana.
Backed by recent economic studies, Mr. Metzgar and others argue that only a handful of jobs would be lost by introducing a much more ambitious bill that would set aside as much as five million acres of new wilderness in Montana and Idaho.
"If we lose the wilderness, we've lost our economy," said Mike Bader, executive director of the Alliance for the Wild Rockies, based in Missoula, Mont. "The only way we can control our future is to hold on to our wild lands."
While acknowledging that timber, mining and oil jobs have been disappearing, those opposed to more wilderness say there is room enough in Montana to give everyone a piece of the Rocky Mountain pie.
"We want to end the civil war over wilderness," said Russ MacPherson, a forester with the Brand S Lumber Company in Livingston. Rather than wait and risk losing more land to wilderness, an alliance of industry leaders is pushing for passage of a scaled-down version of the Baucus bill, stripped to about 700,000 acres of wilderness.
The company gets an ever-increasing share of its timber from private lands, so a large new wilderness area would not kill its business but would make it harder to stay profitable, Mr. MacPherson said.
The Crow Indians also have a keen interest in how the wilderness lines are drawn. They want the Crazy Mountains to remain untouched.
"Those mountains are sacred to us," said Jerome White Hip, a cultural affairs leader with the Crows. "We use them for feasting and vision quests. We want to keep things as they are."
At the base of the Crazies, Big Timber, with 1,600 people, has the defeated look of a lumber town on a down-slide. Though there is not much big timber left around here, signs in small shops support the industry, proclaiming: "No wilderness, no wolves, no Williams."

HEADLINE: Orders for Durable Goods Rose 2.3% in a June Rebound

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
Factory orders for cars, computers and other durable goods recovered in June from a late-spring slump -- just as Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, predicted in testimony to Congress a few days ago.
Orders, which zig-zag from month to month, rebounded 2.3 percent, to $122.5 billion, after a 2.2 percent drop in May, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. The rise -- the fourth in the last six months -- suggests that the May decline in industrial production is not apt to continue. 
 "We're not going down," said Rosanne Cahn, an economist at First Boston. "This is more like a plateau than a triple dip."
But the backlog in order books continued to shrink, a sign both that executives remain cautious and that no significant revival in factory hiring is imminent.
"A new pickup will have to wait for housing and consumer spending to react to lower mortgage rates, probably in August or September," Ms. Cahn said. "Manufacturing will reflect that activity a month or two later."
Orders for all types of durables headed higher.
Military goods, a particularly volatile category that accounted for about one-third of the rise in durables orders, jumped 17.6 percent in June after a 27.6 percent slide in May.
More important, orders for capital goods -- an indication that business is determined to invest to raise efficiency -- increased nine-tenths of 1 percent in June after a 1.7 percent rise in May. The latest increases followed two back-to-back declines.
Apart from military goods, the largest leap was for industrial machinery, a top United States export, which increased 4.5 percent after a small decrease in May.
"Capital goods are on a bit of a rising trend," Ms. Cahn said. "It reflects some of the strength of the economy early this year plus the introduction of new computer mainframes."
Primary metals like steel, copper and aluminum shot up 2.8 percent after a small gain in May. Electrical equipment grew 2.4 percent after a small loss the prior month. Transportation orders -- including aircraft -- were up 1.9 percent, but they had plunged 6.6 percent the month before.

HEADLINE: Newspaper Theft Charged at Daily News

BYLINE: By RONALD SULLIVAN

 BODY:
A two-year investigation of organized crime's penetration of New York newspaper deliveries has uncovered evidence of the theft of about 20,000 newspapers each day at The Daily News last year, state prosecutors said in Manhattan yesterday.
An Assistant District Attorney, Sean Dwyer, said the investigation showed that the theft was organized by members of the Colombo and Lucchese crime families and that it followed the pattern of similar thefts at The New York Post last year by a third Mafia crime family. 
 The District Attorney's office said last month that the Lucchese crime family had also stolen papers from The New York Times and the Metropolitan News Company, which has since been acquired by The Times.
In the News thefts, an affidavit filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan by an investigator for Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan District Attorney, says the paper estimated that the thefts cost it more than $1 million a year at a time when it was in bankruptcy, losing money and seeking a buyer. Articles about the affidavit were published yesterday by The Daily News and by New York Newsday.
Virtually all of the stolen papers were taken from News delivery docks in Brooklyn.
The affidavit by Sgt. Daniel Wiese said, "Information provided by certain employees of The Daily News has shown that The News is the victim of wide-scale, highly coordinated theft, and that the perpetrators of the scheme are other high-ranking employees of The Daily News."
 
Elaborate Circulation Fraud
 Sergeant Wiese also said in the affidavit, submitted to the court in January, "The investigation thus far has also revealed that certain high-level members of The Daily News management are involved in a sophisticated fraud that involves the inflation of circulation figures in order to withhold millions of dollars in rebates from advertisers."
John Campi, a spokesman for The News, denied that the paper's circulation figures had ever been inflated.
"We are cooperating fully with the investigation," said Mr. Campi, adding that The News had previously taken steps to make sure that the stolen papers were not included in its circulation figures.
Officials in the District Attorney's office said they were investigating Donald Nizen, who resigned last week as circulation manager of The Daily News. The officials said they were investigating whether Mr. Nizen was involved in opening the door to the theft, which they said was similar to thefts at The Post when Mr. Nizen held a similar position there until early last year.
Investigators said the stolen newspapers, at both The News and The Post, were sold to distributors.
Reached by telephone at home, Mr. Nizen denied the allegations, threatened to sue those who made them and said he had promised to cooperate with the investigation.
The investigation also turned up evidence suggesting that Post officials had inflated circulation figures by 50,000 a day.

HEADLINE: Supercollider Regaining Its Support in Congress

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 24

 BODY:
Five weeks after the House voted to scrap the $8.25 billion Superconducting Supercollider, prospects for the Texas particle accelerator are sharply improving as it moves through the Senate.
The Senate Appropriations Committee on Thursday allocated $550 million for the project as part of the appropriations bill for energy and water development, setting the stage for a probable floor fight in the next several days. 
 That vote, coming at a time of mounting deficits and expanding domestic social needs, will offer another crucial test for a costly Federal science project. Another such vote, on the $30 billion space station, faces a floor fight in the House next week.
Senator Dale Bumpers, Democrat of Arkansas, promises to lead the fight to cut the Supercollider out of the appropriations bill. But today he expressed doubt that he could overcome a powerful coalition of Senators who back the project. That coalition is led by J. Bennett Johnston of Louisiana, the Democratic chairman of the Energy Committee, and the two Texas Senators, Lloyd Bentsen, a Democrat, and Phil Gramm, a Republican.
"This may be like one of those weapons systems that have nine lives," said Mr. Bumpers, who noted that Mr. Bentsen had just succeeded in persuading Senator Alan Cranston, Democrat of California, to reverse his opposition.
Mr. Johnston predicted today that his side would win the Senate vote and would then reinstate the money in a House-Senate conference committee later this summer. "The feeding frenzy of the balanced-budget debate has faded into an afterglow," he said.
 
Some Support Is Shaky
 Mr. Bentsen's staff estimates that 50 Senators favor the Supercollider, but not all of them are solid supporters of the project, which would be built in Waxahachie, 25 miles south of Dallas.
President Bush invited five undecided Republican Senators to the White House on Thursday to lobby for their support, telling them the project was vital for future developments in cancer diagnosis and other technologies. In the past, many scientists have said that it is difficult to predict if practical applications will come out of the project.
"He tilted me from leaning no to the other direction," said Senator Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who also attended the meeting, said, "I think he made a pretty persuasive case and that's why I'm leaning in his direction."
With the concerted support of scientists in high-energy physics, the Administration and Senate proponents argue that the Supercollider holds out the hope of discovering the fundamental forces that make up the universe. Using 11,000 superconducting magnets, the Supercollider would make subatomic particles collide at close to the speed of light to reproduce the conditions that prevailed just after the birth of the universe.
The project is a boon for the state's faltering economy and could permanently employ 2,000 scientists by the year 2000.
 
Close Vote Is Expected
 Last year, Mr. Bumpers's efforts to scuttle the Supercollider failed by a 62-to-37 vote. But this year he will probably get more support, especially since an Energy Department audit released last week warned that inadequate oversight could mean more than $250 million in cost overruns for construction.
"My guess is this year the vote will be closer," said Senator James M. Jeffords, a Vermont Republican who opposes the project. "The dynamics of the deficit this year makes the expense of that kind of money hard to defend."
After a vociferous debate leading to the narrow defeat of the balanced-budget amendment, the House voted 232 to 181 last month to eliminate $484 million earmarked for the Supercollider.
Although much opposition came from concern about the budget deficit, several California Republicans opposed the project to punish Representative Dick Armey of Texas for challenging Representative Jerry Lewis of California for the post of chairman of the House Republican Conference.
The project's supporters hope that if an Appropriations conference committee reinstates the financing for the project, it will be next to impossible for House opponents to remove the particle accelerator from the total energy and water appropriations bill for a separate vote on the House floor. Lawmakers could then argue that they were not willing to cut off financing for dozens of other worthwhile projects by voting against the bill.
Representative David R. Obey, a Wisconsin Democrat who is a leading opponent of the project, acknowledged that the House opposition to the project was not firm.

HEADLINE: Dinkins, Respected by Foes, Seeks to Pacify Crucial Friends

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
Slightly more than a year before the New York mayoral primary, Mayor David N. Dinkins finds himself at a critical, if unexpected, pass. He has appeased many of his enemies, but now he has to win back his friends.
Mr. Dinkins in recent months has won the sometimes grudging respect of many of his harshest critics, including business leaders and fiscal experts, for his handling of the city's financial problems. His political future, though, will depend on how well he can rebuild the coalition that elected him three years ago. 
 Many politicians and political analysts suspect that support for the Mayor is fragile among many of his core constituents -- black and Hispanic New Yorkers, gay voters, liberal whites and union leaders -- in part because the city's fiscal distress caused him to reduce programs and lay off city workers and made it impossible for him to satisfy his supporters' large expectations.
The Mayor, clearly concerned, has stepped up the effort to revitalize his base. He has pushed broad proposals, like his calls for 20 new community health centers and an all-civilian police review board, and myriad smaller acts, like appointing several Hispanic people to senior posts and achieving changes in the Democratic Party platform to promote economic development in Puerto Rico.
 
Reuniting Diverse Coalition
 But many political leaders say Mr. Dinkins faces a formidable challenge in reassembling the unusually diverse coalition that enabled him to defeat his Republican opponent, Rudolph W. Giuliani, by just 3 percentage points in 1989.
The Mayor himself acknowledged during the Democratic National Convention last week that as recently as six months ago many New Yorkers viewed him as politically dead, overwhelmed by the city's enormous fiscal problems. In a sense Mr. Dinkins has spent two years trying to overcome the image of disarray created in a single week in October 1990 when he agreed to a big raise for teachers and a large increase in the police force, and then said he may have to lay off 15,000 other city workers.
But Mr. Dinkins contended that a string of recent successes -- from his adept stewardship of the budget to his handling of the disturbances in Washington Heights to the Democratic Convention itself -- constituted a kind of political rebirth. He has benefited in part from somewhat more stable finances and better management.
Speaking at a luncheon last week honoring women in politics, the Mayor sought to encourage the Democratic candidate for Senate in Illinois, Carol Mosely Braun, who if elected would be the nation's first black female Senator. "They told me I wouldn't get re-elected, too," he said. "But you watch."
The next day, talking with reporters in City Hall, Mr. Dinkins noted that his approval ratings had gone up in two recent polls. He also said he was aware that many politicians and pundits still thought that he would be unable to rebuild his coalition.
"Well, I think they are dead wrong," the Mayor said. "I think that I will be able to -- not only that, I hope to broaden that coalition."
The elected officials and political analysts who doubt Mr. Dinkins point to two critical groups in which they think he is especially vulnerable -- Hispanic and gay New Yorkers.
"His great trouble is with the Hispanic community, and I don't know if he can repair that," said Richard C. Wade, a professor of urban history at the City University Graduate Center.
Mr. Dinkins's likely opponents -- Mr. Giuliani, a former United States Attorney, and City Council President Andrew J. Stein, who is expected to challenge Mr. Dinkins in the Democratic primary next year -- are already working hard to exploit these perceived vulnerabilities.
On Wednesday, for example, Mr. Stein and Mr. Giuliani joined the leaders of several Hispanic civic groups at a City Hall news conference in which they called on Hispanic political leaders to unite beyond a single candidate in a new Congressional district in Brooklyn and Queens. The district was fashioned to make it possible for a Hispanic candidate to be elected, but at least four have already emerged and Representative Stephen J. Solarz of Brooklyn says he also will run in the district.
Many Hispanic elected officials and civic leaders say that Mr. Dinkins's standing among New Yorkers with roots in Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Colombia and other Latin American nations has plummeted since 1989, when he won the votes of 65 percent of Hispanic voters in the general election, according to a New York Times/CBS News poll. He also captured 91 percent of the black vote and 27 percent of the white vote, according to the poll.
 
Rectifying a Perception
 Analysts offer many explanations for the perceived decline in support for the Mayor from Hispanic people. Mr. Dinkins himself said last month, while he was traveling in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, that there was clearly a perception among Hispanic New Yorkers that he had not done enough for them.
The Mayor maintains that the perception is incorrect, but he has worked hard in the last two months to rectify it, in ways including the Carribbean trip.
He has begun meeting regularly with the eight Hispanic members of the City Council. He supported, as did Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Stein, a proposal for the creation of another Congressional district that would be favorable to Hispanic candidates, in addition to the two devised earlier this year. He visited twice last month with the companion of the Hispanic writer and editor, Manuel de Dios Unanue, who was killed in March by a masked gunman in a Queens restaurant.
And he seldom misses an opportunity to boast of the many Hispanic New Yorkers he has appointed to senior positions. When he mentions the most senior, Cesar Augusto Perales, who was named a deputy mayor last November, Mr. Dinkins almost always recites Mr. Perales's complete name and even attempts the proper Spanish intonation.
It is uncertain, of course, whether Mr. Dinkins's efforts have improved his standing among Hispanic New Yorkers, or even whether it had ever sagged at all.
 
'He Still Has a Year'
 "As I walk the streets, the Mayor is not doing very well," said Councilman Adam Clayton Powell 4th, a Democrat of East Harlem. "The administration just doesn't seem concerned about the feelings of the community. That's the bad news. The good news is that he still has a year."
Mr. Powell said the Mayor should place more emphasis on programs that help Hispanic communities. Some officials argued that the Mayor was in trouble with Hispanic New Yorkers because he had not hired enough of them for mid-level jobs.
"I'm a great believer in the patronage system, the qualified patronage system," said Councilman Israel Ruiz Jr., a Bronx Democrat. "The people who worked for you should be rewarded somehow. But Dave doesn't believe in that. Dave is a peculiar sort of fellow. He feels that everything has to be done on the merits."
Mr. Ruiz and some other Hispanic officials said they suspected that the Dinkins administration had hired blacks at the expense of Hispanic New Yorkers -- a charge that the Mayor denied.
 
Washington Hts. Leadership
 Several people said the leadership that Mr. Dinkins displayed in helping to quell the violence in Washington Heights two weeks ago may serve him well when Hispanic voters decide whom to support next year.
"I think the Washington Heights incident could become a turning point for the Dinkins administration," said Luis Miranda, the president of the Hispanic Federation of New York City, a coalition of 50 nonprofit social-service agencies.
"His presence, his involvement day to day -- people felt he cared," Mr. Miranda said. "Service to Latino constituents is ultimately what is going to make a difference. Do people feel they are better off today than they were four years ago?"
The same is true for many gay New Yorkers, in the view of political analysts. A litmus test for some is whether Mr. Dinkins will give gay municipal workers the same benefits -- including health insurance coverage for a domestic partner -- that heterosexual employees receive.
 
Hard Line With Unions
 "We believe he promised us that, and he has to get that accomplished this year," said Thomas K. Duane, a Manhattan Democrat who is the first openly gay Council member.
The Mayor's standing with union members will rest largely on contract negotiations that began last month. The city is taking a hard line, saying it will grant raises only in exchange for productivity gains, but labor leaders insist the city already has enough money for raises.
The Mayor said in an interview that the city's budget crisis had made it impossible to do many of the things he would have liked to have done. He also emphasized the huge expectations that accompanied his election as New York's first black mayor.
Basil A. Paterson, a former deputy mayor and Secretary of State and one of Mr. Dinkins's oldest friends, said that "more realistic goals have taken the place of what our idealistic expectations were."
Mr. Paterson said he was confident that despite the obvious difficulties, the Mayor would reassemble the coalition that put him in office. "I've got news for you," he said. "Don't bet against David Dinkins."

Begone to Sags and Zits At Wonderland of Skin

BYLINE: By Douglas Martin

 BODY:
TODAY, at the Waldorf-Astoria, the Summit of Skin Care begins. Experts from around the world will discuss the care and coddling of the human body's largest organ, the one that would cover some 20 square feet if it were spread flat.
Arguably, this is not the most important summit meeting at the Park Avenue hotel where heads of states often stay. But to people with sagging skin, wrinkles, facial scars and pimples, it is a tad more immediate. It is also of some interest to folks in the beauty trade, which claims $17 billion in annual sales and shows no sign of slowing down -- particularly with new products for men and even babies. 
 "The beauty business has never known a recession," said Ron Renee, publisher of the Dallas-based Dermascope magazine, the self-described "encyclopedia of esthetics" and sponsor of the summit, also known as Esthetics World Expo '92.
Yesterday, Bonnie Day, the magazine's exhibits director, was scurrying about wrestling with big and little snags as she helped more than 75 exhibitors representing 125 lines set up their booths in a chandeliered ballroom. It was the Texan's first trip back to the Big Town since 1945 when she was a vocalist with Harry James.
"This is show biz," she said exultantly. "It's a trade show, but it's still show biz."
Many exhibitors at the four-day affair hadn't yet shown, including the one peddling an ancient Egyptian technique of using sugary syrup to remove body hair. But the early arrivals provided ample flavor of things to come. There was a paint brush manufacturer that had adapted its process to makeup application; a company with something like 100 products made from seaweed, and an enterprise offering "permanent cosmetics" -- tattoos, really -- for the unlikely woman content with never altering her lip color.
Despite such sights as photographs of naked women smeared with green wax, serious purposes are said to be afoot here. These include declaring war against suntans, seen in these precincts as nothing but an invitation to melanomas. Skin experts are also fighting to be recognized as separate from people who do hair and nails. Moreover, the conference is striving to deepen new links between estheticians, as skin mavens call themselves, and plastic surgeons.
A few of them yesterday appeared before the beauty press corps, mainly women with quite nice skin who applauded speakers. They were most gracious in accepting shopping bags of free product samples.
First up was Dr. Francis R. Palmer, a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon. He said he is eager to tell estheticians about his "30-minute lift." He characterized it as "a little bit of micro-liposuction."
Maurice Stein, founder of a company in California called Cinema Secrets, let it out that he has created "the ultimate makeup foundation." To prove it, he showed a photograph of how it completely obscured the artwork on a tattooed woman's back.
Barbara Salomone, who operates a number of skin-care studios, recited the statistic that 58 percent of Americans still believe a suntan is attractive versus 19 percent who believe it looks like incipient cancer. She said estheticians must educate people to reject suntans as unattractive and out of style.
"We're not just talking about saving someone's skin," she declared. "We're talking about saving someone's life."
It might be only skin deep, but there seems to be just so much going on in the beauty game. A Paris doctor said his acne treatment is so good it is "stupefying." A Beverly Hills dentist said he is "expanding on the idea of the total look." A London esthetician noted that her "manual lymph drainage technique" violates no state laws.
But nobody had a better story than Norman Taver, who has two booths. He designed missiles in the former Soviet Union. When he applied to emigrate to the United States, he was assigned to paint pictures of Lenin for five years, enough time for his military secrets to lose significance.
After arriving in 1980, he landed a job designing a part of Florida's Epcot Center, then one building a wind tunnel for a NASA contractor. He was laid off when the wind tunnel work was finished. What to do but begin designing skin potions for his wife's salon?
He now has patents on 50 skin-care products, two Los Angeles factories totaling 20,000 square feet in floor space and a giant belief in America's promise. "Our prices are the lowest, and our quality is exactly like the French," he boasted.
If any of this catches your interest, admission is $45. Or maybe it is enough to know that each day special, almost unimaginable things are happening here.
"I love New York," said Mrs. Day, the exhibits director who was last here almost a half century ago. "It's just so big, and there's just so much energy."

HEADLINE: Bentsen Tax-Incentive Bill Pits Him Against Bush

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 24

 BODY:
Senator Lloyd Bentsen, chairman of the Finance Committee, said today that he would propose a package of tax incentives to spur development in inner cities and other poor areas while excluding a reduction in the tax on capital gains.
The proposal puts Mr. Bentsen, a Texas Democrat, at odds with the Bush Administration and the House, which passed an urban-aid package that would halve the tax on capital gains within so-called urban enterprise zones. 
 Besides altered enterprise-zone provisions, the bill would restore tax incentives for individual retirement accounts, which were removed for upper-income workers in the Tax Reform Act of 1986, and would provide penalty-free withdrawals for those who lose their jobs, for those buying their first home and for the costs of education and medical treatment.
 
Passive Loss Provision
 It would also restore the deduction for passive losses on rental real estate, a provision sought by the real estate industry, which has suffered huge losses since the 1986 law severely limited such deductions.
Senator Bentsen, giving reporters an advance look at his tax proposal, said he opposed reducing capital gains taxes within enterprise zones because he did not want to turn them into tax shelters for investors.
His proposal is scheduled to be voted on Tuesday by the Finance Committee, if drafting is completed by then. Some provisions, including cost provisions, were still being worked out today.
The measure would extend for 18 months several expiring tax provisions also approved by the House, including low-income housing credits and mortgage revenue bonds. As the House has done, it would repeal the luxury tax on certain high-cost items, including boats.
The Bentsen enterprise-zone plan would cost about the same as the House version -- $2.5 billion over five years. But it is substantially different in form, providing for increased benefits to fewer areas. He proposed that 25 areas be established as enterprise zones, qualifying for special tax incentives for business, with 15 targeted in poor urban areas, eight in rural areas and two on Indian reservations.
The House version provides for 50 zones, evenly divided between rural areas and cities.
Instead of providing a break on gains from investment within the zones, his bill would provide a credit to employers of 40 percent of the wages of employees who live within the zone. The House bill included a 15 percent credit on the first $20,000 of wages for such workers.
 
A Test of Usefulness
 Other tax incentives would be provided for accelerated depreciation of equipment and buildings, tax-exempt bonds for small businesses and targeted jobs and job training.
Senator Bentsen said he had reservations about the effectiveness of enterprise zones and viewed the bill as providing a test of their usefulness in bringing economic opportunity to poor areas. His bill would establish stricter poverty tests for areas to qualify for enterprise zones.
His I.R.A. proposal would restore the tax deductibility of account contributions by all workers, a popular feature. Senator Bentsen said his intention was to encourage an increase in savings.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Increases as Traders React to a Few News Events

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose against leading currencies yesterday on the strength of news of stronger United States durable goods orders, heightened tensions with Iraq and indications that the German discount rate might drop.
Gold prices rose on the New York Commodity Exchange, up 70 cents an ounce from Thursday's close, to $359.30. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid of $359.50, up $1.50 from Thursday's close. 
 Traders spent the day reacting to news, said Jack Stapleton, vice president and senior corporate dealer at Standard Chartered Bank P.L.C.
The Commerce Department announced that orders for durable goods jumped 2.3 percent in June, higher than analysts' expectations.
The other news moving the market, analysts said, was a statement by the German Finance Minister that his country's inflation rate was moving lower. Traders heard him say there could be a lessening in the discount rate, Mr. Stapleton said, even though that remark was omitted from the official statement. Either way, traders expect lower German interest rates, he said. Lower foreign interest rates would make the dollar more attractive by comparison.
Also being watched was President Bush's reaction to Iraq's refusal to let United Nations inspectors into an agricultural ministry building in Baghdad in their search for Saddam Hussein's nuclear arsenal. Investors tend to seek the safety of the dollar during international crises.
In New York, the British pound fell to $1.8945, from $1.9160 late Thursday. In London, the pound fell to $1.8980, from $1.9125 late Thursday.
The dollar rose against the German mark in New York to 1.5035, up from Thursday's close of 1.4820.
The dollar rose to 128.10 Japanese yen in New York from 126.70 at Thursday's close. Overnight in Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 126.90 Japanese yen from 126.40 yen at Thursday's close. Later, in London, it rose to 127.65 yen.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.3325 Swiss francs, up from 1.3155; 1,140.00 Italian lire, up from 1,124.00; 5.0770 French francs, up from 5.0030; 1.19125 Canadian dollars, up from 1.18935.

HEADLINE: Canada Beer Dispute Flares on Eve of Trade Talks

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 24

 BODY:
On the eve of top-level talks on a North American free-trade agreement, a long-running dispute flared anew today as the United States and Canada imposed taxes on each other's beer shipments.
The United States this morning imposed a duty of $2.60 to $3 on each 24-bottle case of beer from the province of Ontario, which in May doubled its tax on aluminum beer cans. Canada responded within hours by imposing a similar duty on shipments of Heileman and Stroh's beer from the United States to Ontario. 
 Both sides minimized the effect on negotiations this weekend in Mexico City aimed at resolving as many details as possible of a continental free-trade accord. "We do what we have to do," said Julius Katz, the chief American negotiator. "I don't think it will poison the atmosphere."
 
Ontario Is Hit Hard
 Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, said this weekend's negotiations would focus on the automobile, agriculture and service sectors and on foreign investment and government rules, but she provided no specifics of issues to be resolved. The frameworks of these and other agreements have been mostly worked out but not the specific numbers for how much access each country will have to each other's markets, she said.
Ontario has suffered more than most Canadian provinces during the current recession, and many residents blame Canada's 1988 free-trade agreement with the United States. The provincial government, which is run by the left-leaning New Democrat Party, has called for Canada to demand broad trade concessions from the United States or pull out of the current free-trade talks entirely. Bob Rae, the Premier of Ontario, today renewed his call for Canada to withdraw from the talks.
But Canada's federal Government, led by strong free traders from the Conservative Party, has rejected Ontario's complaints and does not appear likely to let the beer dispute interfere with the North American trade talks. Other Canadian provinces have controls on beer sales that the United States contends discriminate against imports, but they are taking steps to remove these restrictions.
The 1988 free-trade pact between the United States and Canada does not affect the current dispute because both countries agreed to argue it before special panels of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The panels issued two long reports that both sides cite as supporting their positions.
 
Formal Investigation Sought
 In 1990, the G. Heileman Brewing Company and the Stroh Brewery Company successfully petitioned the Administration to begin a formal trade investigation of Canadian provinces' sales regulations for alcoholic beverages. That investigation was largely settled in April. But on May 25, Ontario doubled an environmental tax on aluminum beer cans to 10 cents a can, prompting the American action today.
Most Canadian beer is sold in bottles, while most American beer is sold in cans. So American officials say the higher tax discriminates against United States breweries, particularly because soft-drink cans are not covered by the tax.
Ontario produces nearly two-thirds of the 28 million cases of Canadian beer that Americans drink each year. This includes three-quarters of the Molson's beer and half the Labatt's beer, said John Barnett, the president and chief executive of Molson Breweries USA Inc.
Another Canadian brand popular in the United States, Moosehead, is brewed and bottled in the provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia and will not be affected by the duties on beer from Ontario.
 
Molson Guards Market Share
 Mr. Barnett said Molson had already been negotiating with its wholesalers not to charge consumers for the new duty until the company's three- to four-week supply of beer in the United States was exhausted. The wholesalers and Molson will try to share the loss so as to preserve the company's market share, he said.
If the dispute is not settled by mid-August then retail prices for Molson will rise by $1.25 to $1.50 for each six-pack, as retailers and wholesalers pass along 75 cents worth of tax and add a markup of 50 cents to 75 cents, Mr. Barnett said.
Mr. Katz, who has handled the dispute with Canada, said the United States would track shipments from other Canadian provinces. The United States might impose taxes on their cross-border sales too if they sharply increased shipments as Ontario's exports slackened, he said.
Responding to criticism this week that a free-trade agreement is being concluded with little public consultation, Mrs. Hills and Mr. Katz held an unusual pair of news briefings today. Mrs. Hills's office has also quietly lowered the security classification this week on some negotiating texts so that more Congressional aides with limited security clearances will be able to read them.
These texts are now classified for "limited official use" instead of being stamped "secret," a person close to the negotiations said.
People with access to classified information provided some detailed examples of the participants' negotiating positions. Mexico's state-owned enterprises currently reserve virtually all their contracts for domestic companies, which often have powerful political connections.
Mexico wants to reserve 70 percent of the contracts at first and 40 percent after 10 years. The United States wants only half these contracts to be reserved once a free-trade accord takes effect next year, with none of the contracts reserved after three years. This would allow American companies to compete better in Mexico, where most of the large buildings, for example, are built by state companies.

HEADLINE: Accounting Proposal Softened, Pleasing Museums

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

 BODY:
Much to their relief, museum officials will not be compelled by their accountants to place monetary values on everything from moon rocks to Archie Bunker's armchair.
For two years, the museums have been involved in a nasty dispute with the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the private body that sets most of the nation's accounting rules, over how they account for the treasures in their collections. It now appears that the museums have won. 
 In a decision that occurred earlier this month but was not previously reported, the board agreed to tone down the rules it was considering for nonprofit institutions. This means that the museums have accomplished something that many of the nation's mightiest companies and banks have often failed to do: making the accounting profession's chief standard-setters back down on rules that would have been costly to adopt and could have made them look bad.
"It's remarkable how much influence these nonprofit organizations have," said William D. Grampp, a University of Chicago professor who favored the proposed rules.
 
 
Contributions on the Books
 In the case of museums, the board had wanted nonprofit institutions to show on their books, under the headings of assets and revenues, a variety of contributions ranging from the rarest Rembrandt to the lowliest forms of insect life.
The rules, which the museums' trade group contended would have cost them $50 billion in appraisal fees alone, would have taken the greatest toll on museums, zoos and other organizations whose vast collections are nowhere on their books. Had the rules been adopted, the organizations would have had to report big spikes in revenues whenever donors made large gifts and would have watched their assets balloon by the amount of all past gifts.
Both changes could have turned off donors by making the organizations look richer than they think they are. In addition, the museums argued that they would have been hard pressed to come up with dollar values for such one-of-a-kind assets as the giant pandas at the National Zoo in Washington and the chair that was used in the television series "All in the Family" that sits in the Smithsonian Institution.
To make their case, the museums mounted a formidable letter-writing campaign and made considerable use of their well-connected board members during public hearings last year. Particularly effective was the field trip they arranged for some high-level officials of the accounting standards board to the American Museum of Natural History in New York, which houses more than 40 million objects. The visit was intended to demonstrate firsthand the ordeal that lay ahead if the museum had to put a value on its attractions.
 
 
Watered-Down Version
 The intense lobbying paid off last week when all seven members of the standards board indicated that they now support a much-watered-down version of the proposal. Previously, four of the seven members backed the original proposal.
The board's chairman, Dennis R. Beresford, said the board still thought that a museum's assets belonged on its financial statements but was unconvinced that the benefits of having more comprehensive financial statements would outweigh the costs of compliance.
Ronald J. Bossio, the board's staff member in charge of the project, was a bit less philosophical in explaining how the museums won their case. "When you're setting standards for that sector, they act like you're picking on them," he said.
While many museum officials were delighted with the decision, a handful of economists and Government officials expressed disappointment that the board had backed down. "I'm glad to see that the F.A.S.B. has not denied the essential nature of these assets," said Professor Grampp, who believes that current accounting rules make it hard for the public to know whether museums are using their resources efficiently. "It's a pity it doesn't see the essential necessity of reporting them."
Joellen McCormack, an assistant director of accounting in the financial management division of the General Accounting Office in Washington, said her agency had also backed the earlier proposal in the belief that it would improve accountability. She said she hoped the standard-setters would at least require museums to include some of the missing information in the footnotes to their financial statements. "There are a lot of items out there, and nobody is aware of what they are and what they're worth," she said.
 
 
Values Are Already Estimated
 John Michael Montias, a Yale University economist, said he thought the valuation problems the museums complained of were overblown, especially since museums often approximate the value of their collections for insurance purposes anyway. In his view, the museums resisted the change because it would have highlighted the true social cost of providing those services.
"They think they're producing something of a priceless service, something so prestigious and marvelous that no matter how much it costs, it's worthwhile," he said. "But many economists would say no, the services these paintings produce are like any other."
The board also said Thursday that all seven of its members now favored requiring companies that issue stock options to executives to value the cost of the options at the time they are granted, so that they can spread the cost over the life of the option. Currently, stock options are the one form of compensation that has no impact on corporate earnings.

Ah, .500! Mets Find Land of Promise

BYLINE: By JACK CURRY

 BODY:
After 43 days in which the $44 million Mets stumbled and searched for victories in the land of defeat, a treacherous area they were not supposed to inhabit, they finally found the .500 mark again last night. Sid Fernandez carried them across the threshold.
Fernandez spun a three-hitter as the rejuvenated Mets cruised to a 3-0 victory over the San Diego Padres last night at Shea Stadium and evened their record at 48-48. It was their sixth victory in seven games and marked the first time since June 11 that their triumphs have equaled their losses. 
 The Mets expected to leap back to .500 sooner or later, but did they really expect Fernandez to dominate the best hitting team in the National League?
Even with four-time batting champion Tony Gywnn resting a strained back, the Padres still presented a formidable lineup, but Fernandez mowed through it. He was powerful, precise and patient as he turned the Padres into patsies with his changeup and helped the Mets move within four games of the first-place Pittsburgh Pirates, who were beaten in Atlanta, 4-3.
"I don't remember pitching as good a game as that in a long time," said Fernandez, after registering his first shutout since April 22, 1990. "It would be nice if they could all be like that."
San Diego had three runners reach second and Fernandez emerged unscathed in each instance. With Fred McGriff on second after an infield single and error in the second, Fernandez struck out Darrin Jackson, got Benito Santiago on a lineout to right and whiffed Jerold Clark. After Tony Fernandez's two-out double in the sixth, he struck out Kevin Ward. And after Clark doubled with one out in the seventh, Fernandez retired Kurt Stillwell on a groundout and induced pinch-hitter Tim Teufel to fly out to left.
 
'Fun to Catch'
 "He did a great job," said Todd Hundley, the rookie who has caught all 10 Mets shutouts. "That was fun to catch."
Fernandez, who also singled and scored a run, increased his scoreless streak to 20 2/3 innings and won for the fifth time in his last six starts. The chunky left-hander has now allowed three runs or less in 16 of his last 17 starts and has a 2.10 earned run average over his last 103 2/3 innings. He retired the side in order in six innings, did not walk a batter, struck out nine and faced only 30 hitters in notching his second complete game and improving his record to 9-8.
Would you believe Fernandez was even economical on the mound? The game was played in two and a half hours and Mets infielders praised the usually plodding Fernandez for working swiftly. Huh? Slow-hand Sid is now speedy Sid.
"I think he has sped up his game," Dave Magadan said. "He's one of our quickest pitchers."
With all Fernandez had clicking for him, did Brooklyn's Frank Seminara have a chance? Seminara, who was graduated from Xaverian High School and Columbia University, had his five-game winning streak snapped close to home. The Mets nicked the 25-year-old right-hander for runs in the third on Magadan's single, in the fifth on Howard Johnson's single and in the sixth on Dick Schofield's long double. All of the run-scoring hits came with two outs.
The Mets rubbed their eyes last night to make sure they were not dreaming. As poorly as they have played this season, they are surprisingly close to first place. One stretch of stellar play has them talking like a contending team.
"I think we always had confidence," Magadan said. "Now I think we're playing like we have confidence. It's one thing to say it. It's another to go out and do it."
 
INSIDE PITCH
 The Mets denied any knowledge of HOWARD JOHNSON and BOBBY BONILLA undergoing off-season surgery, which was intimated in Friday's editions of the Daily News. Johnson was said to need surgery on his left shoulder and Bonilla on his left knee, but Manager JEFF TORBORG and General Manager AL HARAZIN claimed they were unaware of it. "I don't know where that one came from," said Torborg. . . . Harazin conceded he had spoken to the Philadelphia Phillies about the availability of center fielder LENNY DYKSTRA, but added the two clubs discussed 15 players in all. "His name came up in conversation," Harazin said. "I wouldn't say anything beyond that." . . . VINCE COLEMAN's strained left hamstring will be tested tomorrow and he may play Monday. MACKEY SASSER did not start because of a groin injury. JOHN FRANCO (stiff left elbow) threw for 15 minutes yesterday and was encouraged. DWIGHT GOODEN (inflamed right shoulder) soft-tossed for the third straight day and felt no pain.

HEADLINE: BARCELONA;
The Future Is Now for the Unified Team

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BARCELONA, Spain, July 24

 BODY:
This is the eve of the 25th Summer Olympic Games. The buzz has been growing for weeks, intensifying in the last few days. In a multicultured city of 1.7 million and a metropolitan area of more than twice that number, so many people seem eager to start celebrating 16 days of athletic achievement and themselves.
Yet, as always, the sharper reality of life beyond the moment intrudes. The leader of the Unified Team of the Commonwealth of Independent States today painted a bleak picture for the future of sports in what was once the Soviet Union, the mightiest of Olympic powers. 
 Citing harsh economic times, ethnic conflicts, limited access to medical treatment and nourishing food for athletes and the steady emigration of leading coaches and trainers, Nikolai Rusak, the chief of the delegation, predicted that by the 1996 Games in Atlanta, his athletes will be unable to match the performances of the United States, Germany, China and other countries with more stable economic and political conditions.
 
Once an Olympic Powerhouse
 In the nine Summer Games that the Soviet Union competed in from 1952 through 1988, it was the leading medal winner in six and second in the other three.
Yet what made Rusak's outlook more alarming were remarks earlier in the day by Juan Antonio Samaranch, the president of the International Olympic Committee, who defended commercialism as a way of life for the Olympics, saying it had become essential for the Olympic movement to survive.
"Commercialism is not a danger," Samaranch said at a news conference. "Sponsorship in the world today is very common. There are sponsors in museums, sponsors for big symphony orchestras. I remember one trip with the Pope had a special sponsor. This is a way inhabitants of a country do not have to pay more taxes, because of the organization of important sports events like the Olympic Games."
Samaranch, who has been criticized for expediting the commercialism trend, touched a variety of issues as final preparations for Saturday's opening ceremonies continued. The three-hour show, a tribute to Barcelona, the region of Catalonia, Spain and the Olympic ideal precedes 16 days of competition in which the Unified Team will likely emerge again, but for the last time, as the leading medal winner, among a record 172 nations, followed by the United States and Germany.
But while Atlanta may match the bells and whistles of an opening ceremony and Americans, Germans and Chinese may pile up medals, the economic trends inside disadvantaged nations and the Olympic movement seem headed toward a collision in 1996.
Once the 1984 Los Angeles Games changed the nature of financing a sports extravaganza, by using private funds, the I.O.C. moved rapidly into the corporate world, to the point that 12 multinational companies will pay at least $20 million to sponsor the Barcelona Games and world television rights will generate another $635 million.
Those are lofty numbers and concepts for officials like Rusak, who once helped manage a state-run system that provided everything the athlete needed. Now, the former Soviet system is neither state-funded nor functional. This "farewell appearance" of the 648-member team, as Rusak called it, features athletes from 12 former republics that will gain individual recognition for their Olympic committees by the 1994 Winter Games in Lillehammer, Norway.
"Once everybody is dispersed, it will be very difficult," Rusak said of the future when today's teammates become tomorrow's rivals. "Without well-known athletes, sponsors may not give as much to individual athletes. We are aware of the value of our methods, but they must be transmitted to the different states. We must try to convince the sports leaders there, ask them to keep up a system of competition and joint training."
 
Modest Funding
 For now, the Unified Team is sustaining itself through modest sponsorship arrangements and an I.O.C. program called Olympic Solidarity, which supports developing or impoverished countries. State support ended three years ago, and one could only imagine Rusak's reaction to walking around the Olympic Village, which houses athletes and officials.
"I've seen 17 coaches from the Soviet Union, who are now from other states: Italy, India, Mexico, Spain," Rusak said. "It will take eight to 10 years for Russia or Ukraine to be on the same level as the United States, Germany and China."
The process could be hastened, paradoxically, only if the I.O.C.'s revenue streams are slowed by economic downturns. Samaranch noted that in some countries, including the United States, the I.O.C. might have reached a financial ceiling with current television partners and, thus, needs to seek new income sources.
The only areas restricted from commercial sponsorship, he said, would be stadium interiors and athletes' uniforms, which in non-Olympic competitions are generally major billboards for advertisers. Otherwise, anything goes.
"It is quite important that sport is organized by this type of funding," Samaranch said, a pronouncement that could hardly have cheered Rusak.
When these Games are over, so is an era.

HEADLINE: Major League Heavyweights

BYLINE: By Leonard Koppett; Leonard Koppett, a former sports reporter with The New York Times, is editor emeritus of The Peninsula Times-Tribune.

DATELINE: PALO ALTO, Calif.

 BODY:
If you feel that multimillion dollar salaries for ballplayers have gotten out of line, there is at least one objective measure that confirms your impression.
Remember the old saying, intended as high praise, that someone is "worth his weight in gold?" 
 Well, Babe Ruth and Joe DiMaggio were paid almost exactly that in their peak years, and so were many other star players until the early 1980's.
In 1928, Babe Ruth was in the second year of a three-year contract worth $70,000 a year, by far the highest salary ever up to that time. The year before, he had set his record of 60 home runs, and his fame transcended baseball. He was a world figure in the Jazz Age.
In 1927, the average price of gold was $20.67 an ounce. Gold is measured in troy ounces, defined as 480 grains. Ordinary ounces have 437.5 grains. Therefore, an ordinary pound equals 14.6 troy ounces. To get a person's weight in gold, you multiply the price per ounce by 14.6, and that result by the person's weight in pounds.
Ruth played at 215 pounds, so he was worth $64,883.13 in gold -- not out of line with his $70,000 salary. In 1930 and 1931, Ruth's salary peaked at $80,000, which was $5,000 higher than President Herbert Hoover's. This prompted Ruth's much-quoted remark, "I had a better year than he did."
But in 1934, under President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the price of gold was fixed officially at $35 an ounce. That meant (using round numbers for simplicity) a 200 pound man would be worth $102,200. No player made that much until 1949, when DiMaggio got the first $100,000 contract. Since he actually weighed only 193 pounds, worth $98,623, he was a few bucks ahead.
Through the 1950's and 1960's, mild inflationary times, salaries kept rising slowly while gold remained fixed. Only in 1972 was the official price raised to $38, and by then Hank Aaron of Atlanta, on his way to breaking Ruth's career record for home runs, was making $200,000 -- at a playing weight of 176 pounds. That was more than double his gold value of $97,644.80. This imbalance may have contributed to the Government's decision to let the price of gold float on the open market.
The accompanying chart shows what happened since then, with lots of rounding off, averaging of multi-year contracts with bonuses and approximations.
Gold's present level is around $350 per ounce while a 1993 salary commitment for $7 million (to Ryne Sandberg, the Chicago Cubs' second baseman) has already been made.
Three points should be noted:
1. In 1975, player salaries, like gold, were allowed to "float" as a form of free agency replaced the old reserve system.
2. Gold fluctuates day by day, while a top salary in a five-year contract remains unchanged for five years.
3. If you want a hedge against inflation, don't buy gold, adopt a nice young ball player.

HEADLINE: America's Virtues Perceived as Faults

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Why Don't They Like Us?" (Op-Ed, July 3), Paul Hollander perceptively argues that the United States poses a threat as "the major form and carrier of modernity in the world today." But he errs when he considers the resulting anti-Americanism well founded because our "unqualified openness to change" implies "personal and social instability and moral confusion." 
 The change we experience and that traditional societies fear derives essentially from our egalitarianism and our respect for individual rights. These traits define us and derive from the founding and building of the republic by immigrants unencumbered by the baggage of feudal structures, from which they often fled. We witness the growth of ideas and of groups seeking to push the frontiers of individual rights, challenging the restraining norms of traditional, hierarchical societies. This is most evident for the rights of minorities, women, gays and lesbians.
These American ideas and movements have a universal and powerful appeal. Spreading everywhere, they threaten to upset the restrictive and exploitative social order in more traditional societies. They naturally prompt anti-Americanism.
This is no different from Vice President Quayle's cries against "cultural elitism" and for traditional "moral values," which these ideas elicit inside the country. At home and abroad, America's strength is decried as its weakness.

HEADLINE: Companies Prepare for New Law on Disabled

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

 BODY:
A law banning discrimination against disabled people that takes effect tomorrow finds corporations sharply at odds over what they must do to comply.
Some, like Pioneer Hi-Bred International Inc., a seed company in Des Moines, say that holding management training sessions, reviewing the duties of jobs that become open and issuing some explanations over the computer system will just about do it. Others, like Nike Inc., are developing new recruiting programs and rewriting all their job descriptions -- often changing hours, responsibilities and pay -- to accommodate disabled people. 
 And at some companies, like the Tanenbaum-Harber insurance brokerage firm in Manhattan, managers say they have hardly begun to think about how to comply.
The confusion among corporations contrasts with the certainty among government officials and experts that the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 requires vast changes in employment practices as extensive as those made for women and blacks.
Linda Laarman, a lawyer in Washington with the William M. Mercer consulting firm, said that while most companies understood the law's general principles, few had adequately put them into practice. "Most companies haven't thought through the implications in detail," she said.
The provisions forbid companies with more than 25 employees to discriminate against the disabled in hiring, compensation or advancement, and require reasonable accommodations for them at work.
Only about 30 percent of the 14 million working-age Americans with disabilities are employed. Labor specialists say that millions more could be brought into the workplace with only limited adjustments.
Some larger companies are already in the forefront of compliance. Telephone companies, whose jobs often require no heavy labor or travel outside the office, have long sought to expand their hiring pool by recruiting the disabled.
The American Telephone and Telegraph Company, in fact, helped shape the new law. It has been holding sensitivity sessions for managers for more than 25 years. Several hundred "job accommodation specialists" help disabled employees, including long-distance operators and telephone repairmen, get specially designed chairs, braille keypads or other equipment and adjustments needed to perform their jobs.
For its customers, A.T.& T. has designed "text telephones" that allow the deaf to type messages to each other, and computer systems for the blind that read aloud what appears on a screen.
Such computerized devices to overcome impairments are now in widespread use. T.W.A. has installed special computers, some of them voice-activated, so that several reservation agents with multiple sclerosis can work from their homes. The airline's reservation office in New York has special computers designed for agents who have vision difficulties.
Smaller companies say they lack the time and staff to turn their attention to the disabilities law. "We're only vaguely aware that it's out there," said Walter L. Harris, president of the Tanenbaum-Harber Company, an insurance broker with about 100 employees. "I suspect that's true of most small businesses. Given the pressures of the economy and the New York marketplace, an act like that is the least of my worries."
 
Few Jobs Anyway
 In the current economy, Mr. Harris and some other employers say, job openings are so few that hiring practices are almost moot.
Many companies, like Pioneer Hi-Bred, say their longstanding practices toward disabled employees leave them with little more to do. "We think we're in good shape," said Gary Walljasper, the planning and development administrator.
Some companies, however, have underestimated what they need to do, said Henry von Wodtke, a Buck Consultants specialist in employee benefits in New York: "Most employers, when asked if they are nice to disabled people, would say, at first blush, 'Of course. We're in compliance.' Those who thought a little more about it were less sure."
To check compliance, Buck Consultants sent surveys to 2,800 employers around the nation in January. Only 385 responded. Of these -- evidently the ones most aware of the law, Mr. von Wodtke said -- only 47 percent said they had reviewed their hiring standards.
He took some encouragement from the number of companies that had at least taken some steps, including the 68 percent that had provided training or written guidance for managers.
 
Details of Law
 Consultants say that many companies may not recognize the need for such tasks as seeing whether their health insurance plans discriminate against specific categories of the disabled. Companies should also define in writing the essential duties of each job so that disabled applicants are not turned away merely because they cannot perform marginal duties. Employers also must avoid asking for medical histories or examinations before they make job offers. But the law does not require companies to set hiring or promotion goals
Those that have not met the law's requirements are unlikely to hear from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission right away. As in matters of racial and sexual discrimination, the commission will act once it receives complaints. But it may not have the money to hire new officers meant to investigate complaints from the disabled, according to commission officials.
Still, Mr. von Wodtke advises slack companies not to wait for any nudging. "They are well advised to look at their situations right up front and make sure nothing is going to be embarrassing," he said yesterday. "We've got two days left."

HEADLINE: When the Mob Delivered the Goods

BYLINE: By Ralph Blumenthal; Ralph Blumenthal, a reporter on the metropolitan staff of The New York Times, often writes about organized crime.

 BODY:
ON A COOL MORNING IN JUNE, AS TRUCKS CHURNED through the parked-up side streets of New York City's garment district, a taxicab pulled to a stop on West 35th Street, across from Macy's. Stepping out into a maelstrom of rolling racks of dresses and hampers piled with cutwork and piece goods, the three passengers made their way across the busy sidewalk and into the maw of a trucking warehouse.
One of the visitors -- tall, gaunt and impeccably tailored -- was Robert J. McGuire, a former Federal prosecutor and New York City Police Commissioner. President of Kroll Associates, one of the nation's most sought-after private investigative firms, he was accompanied by Alice T. McGillion, a former First Deputy Police Commissioner who was Kroll's director of communications, and Michael Slattery, a former agent of the F.B.I. and one of the firm's managing directors. 
 Their host upstairs at the warehouse, Thomas F. Gambino, was the president of his company, Consolidated Carriers Corporation, the largest and most influential trucker in the garment center. According to Federal and state prosecutors who often pasted his photo on charts of the underworld, Gambino was also a caporegime, one of 21 crew chiefs, or captains, in the Mafia family that bore his name and that law-enforcement officials generally regard as the largest and most potent Mafia clan in the nation. The Gambino boss since 1985 had been John Gotti, who would be sentenced the next day to life in prison for murder and racketeering.
Last February, the 62-year old Gambino and his 55-year-old brother, Joseph, facing extortion and enterprise-corruption charges in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, had interrupted their trial to plead guilty to a single felony count of illegally restraining trade. Under the plea bargain, they were spared jail in exchange for a $12 million fine, an agreement to cease anti-competitive practices and to get out of the segment of the business they had long controlled -- the trucking of shipments from the Seventh Avenue manufacturers to and from the sewing shops where the garments are actually produced. The Gambinos, through their lawyers, contended that the long-established system not only was not coercive but worked to the benefit of many small entrepreneurs. The prosecution claimed that this control was a choke hold, enabling the Gambinos to dominate a key trucking operation and reap enormous profits by imposing what amounted to a 5 to 7 percent mob tax on finished garments.
To oversee compliance with the agreement, and the sale or liquidation of Gambino interests by next March, the court appointed McGuire. As the so-called special master, McGuire was empowered over his five-year tenure to issue rules and orders to restore industry competition. McGuire, his partners and his counsel, Elkan Abramowitz, a former prosecutor and leading criminal lawyer, had to learn everything they could about garment-center trucking and the company assets being disposed of. And where better to start than with Thomas Gambino himself?
Reclusive and elegantly if conservatively tailored, Gambino cut a patrician figure. He lived not in one of the blue-collar neighborhoods of Queens or Brooklyn favored by his mob compatriots, but off Fifth Avenue on East 68th Street, in an 1881 mansion once owned by banking princes. His fortune was estimated at $75 million. Last year, the Gambino name was affixed to a unit of Schneider Children's Hospital of Long Island Jewish Medical Center, to which the brothers had donated $2 million for the construction of a bone-marrow transplantation center.
The eldest son of the late Carlo Gambino, perhaps the last true boss of bosses of the American Mafia, Thomas cemented ties to another powerful mob clan with his marriage to the daughter of Thomas Lucchese, boss of his own Mafia family. After graduating from Manhattan College in 1951, Gambino went to work in his father-in-law's dress factory in Peckville, Pa., according to a 1958 Senate report. In 1966, Thomas joined his brother Joseph at Consolidated, founded in 1957 by a group of shareholders including Hyman Ruff, later one of the Gambinos' trucking partners. As partners died or retired, the Gambinos acquired a controlling interest. Prosecutors do not list Joseph as a Mafia member.
By the end of 1989, according to charts compiled by the Manhattan District Attorney's office, the Gambinos controlled at least a dozen trucking concerns, which in the previous three years had grossed about $70 million. Of this, nearly $50 million was generated by shipments into and out of the sewing shops. Some $22 million of this was profit, a return of about 40 percent. In contrast, the Gambinos' over-the-road trucking generated a far more modest 15 percent return.
Also significant was the fact that the Gambino profits were built on pennies: a dress that retails for $160 would cost the store itself about $80 to buy and the manufacturer about $40 to produce -- of that, the trucking cost was perhaps only 40 cents. Thus do the Gambinos exemplify what prosecutors called "the importance of being unimportant."
Gambino appeared to be sharing some of his proceeds. In 1986, a state bug had captured a loose-tongued Gambino soldier, Angelo Ruggiero, reporting to Gotti: "This guy gave me a stack of [expletive] tens last night."
"Who?" Gotti asked.
"Tommy Gambino. I just cashed them in here."
Gotti must have been impressed, as the tape documented: "It looks like you have $50 million there."
The purpose of McGuire's visit to the Consolidated office at 141 West 35th Street on June 22 -- an office that had been cleverly bugged by the State Police (Box, page 34) -- was to learn the nature of the business and how the routes were assigned. The Kroll people had made the appointment with Gambino's lawyer, Michael Rosen. They hadn't necessarily expected Gambino to be there.
As the bemused Slattery fixed a tight smile on his face, Gambino, in a blue double-breasted suit and red tie and accompanied by his lawyers, showed the visitors around the office, answering questions about trucking operations. "We were not off in the realm of organized crime," McGuire said later. "Our focus was vertical pricing and markets."
Afterwards, Gambino showed them around Consolidated's freight terminal on 11th Avenue at 23rd Street and then turned them over to Raymond Buccafusco, the company's manager for Chinatown, who had pleaded guilty in the same case to criminal solicitation, a misdemeanor. Buccafusco guided them to a Chinatown sewing shop served by the Gambinos and recommended a favorite Chinese restaurant for lunch.
TO OUTSIDERS, THE garment center can be a perplexing place of seasons out of sync, where summer dresses sprout amid winter snows and summer heat brings forth winter woolens, where manufacturers do not manufacture and transport is governed by arcane rules underwritten by custom and fear.
It is, in fact, less a center than an agglomeration of offices, showrooms and trimming shops along Seventh Avenue in the 30's and low 40's where sample garments are designed, orders are taken and fabrics are cut. Then, along with the "trimmings" of buttons or zippers or lace, the cutwork is trucked to Chinatown shops, where immigrants often toil in miserable conditions at piecework rates, or to other outlying sewing shops and factories where the garments are stitched together. Finally, the finished garments are trucked back to the manufacturer or directly to a customer. Because the seasonality of fashion makes the shipment of garments in some ways as time-sensitive as that of food, anyone in a position to monopolize -- or thwart -- timely delivery gains enormous leverage. For more than half a century, since Seventh Avenue opened its doors to racketeers to oust Communist unionists, prosecutors say, the mob has built up that leverage.
Virtually every sewing shop was allocated, or "married," to one of several large truckers linked to a cartel dominated by the Gambino and Lucchese families. The truckers sold or traded shops among themselves, with no say on the part of the often-reluctant brides. If a manufacturer wanted to move goods in his own trucks or hire a "gypsy," or independent hauler, he had to pay his regular trucker anyway.
A few unwritten rules governed. If a shop changed hands, the existing trucker automatically serviced the new business. If a shop closed and lay empty for six months, a new trucker could claim it when it reopened. If that closed shop had sewing machines inside, it was claimable by a new trucker only after 12 months.
The cartel's dominance was so entrenched that violence was all but unnecessary. A glance, a whispered name -- "Gambino" -- and would-be renegades tended to fall quickly into line.
Some manufacturers insist they have no quarrel with the system. What they fear more than organized crime, they say, is disorganized chaos. Aaron Freed, president of a company called Ms. Interpret Inc., which sells women's sportswear and coordinates to major department stores, said in an interview that the Gambinos helped him find sewing shops to do his work. When he had trouble meeting bills, he said, they let him go months without paying. As for having to pay Consolidated even when he used a gypsy trucker, Freed acknowledged: "It cost me, but I put it in the price of my garment."
But more typical are industry veterans like Richard Wallace, until recently a production manager at Nicole Miller, who testified in court earlier this year that the first thing he learned when he entered the business was that garmentmakers had no say over who moved their cutwork to and from the sewing shops. Complaining was futile, he testified, bending his nose aside with a forefinger in a gesture signaling organized crime.
In 1987, Wallace related, he was working at a since-closed dress manufacturer called Lu'elle, where garments were being prepared for shipment to New Jersey via a gypsy trucker. A Consolidated salesman came in and sought to block it. An argument ensued. The salesman made a call and within 15 minutes, Wallace testified, "four or five guys showed up who just came in and stood around in trench coats with their hands in their pockets" until the gypsy trucker fled. It later developed that there were only two, but the enforcers -- known in the garment center as "the Blues Brothers" -- were apparently sufficiently menacing to be remembered as many more.
A manufacturer named George Schneider, now retired in Florida after a 50-year career in the garment business, recalls once arranging to lease a truck to haul his own shipments. Staying in a Manhattan hotel room that night, he got a call from a trucking salesman. As he remembers it, the conversation went this way:
"I understand you're going to be going into trucking for yourself?"
Schneider said, yes, he was considering it.
"George," the caller went on, "you want to be smart, don't do it. I wouldn't advise it. There are too many accidents on the road."
Schneider says he got the message. "If you found out I'm in a hotel already, forget it," he recalls answering. He quickly dropped his plan. "It scared the pants off me," he says.
The Gambinos declined to be interviewed for this article. Thomas Gambino's lawyer, Michael Rosen, explained that Gambino was still under Federal indictment, having earlier been severed from a racketeering case against John Gotti and Frank Locascio. Rosen said the Gambinos held it "absolutely not true" that manufacturers were unable to choose their own truckers. Rather, he contended, sewing shops that were set up in business by the Gambinos were obligated to use Consolidated.
ELIOT SPITZER took a different view. An earnest Princeton-educated assistant district attorney, Spitzer worked in a narrow office off an elevator shaft on the seventh floor of the monolithic Criminal Courts building in lower Manhattan. Twenty-eight years old in 1987, when the Gambino investigation began, he had joined the prosecutor's office out of Harvard Law School the year before. As he wrote in an internal memo in January 1988, an extensive "foundation of information" existed on the Gambino family's domination of the garment center. From 1979 to 1982, Manhattan State Senator Franz S. Leichter released three staff reports documenting the proliferation of sweatshops and the influence of gangsters over the garment industry.
To Spitzer, Thomas Gambino was a target more prized than the so-called Teflon Don. Gotti, Spitzer thought, was where the mob had been -- in rackets, drugs and murders. Gambino was where it was going -- into legitimate businesses where it could dominate by subtle intimidation while picking the pockets of the public. To Spitzer, the future seemed more frightening than the past. With Gotti, at least you knew where you stood.
Yet, Spitzer wrote, "Despite the fact that 'everybody knows' that the mob controls the industry, there have been no cases brought against the primary figures and no real efforts to loosen the mob's grip on a critical New York industry."
More than a year before, Spitzer's boss, Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan District Attorney, had vowed to throw the weight of his office against mob elements he believed were sapping key segments of the city's business economy. Rather than targeting individuals, Morgenthau said, he would seek to "retake the industries." Thus began a series of probes into the construction trades, mob-infiltrated unions at the convention center, the newspaper delivery unions -- and the garment center.
Even before writing the memo, Spitzer had launched a preliminary probe. A 30-year-old undercover police officer posing as a gypsy trucker named "David Chan" was driving around Chinatown with a truck marked Lok Kee, wearing a body wire and seeking business from sewing shops with the aim of bumping up against the Mafia. He quickly found that each shop was claimed by a big trucker, in many cases by Consolidated. When one shop owner told him that he had to pay the regular trucker even when he used his own truck or a gypsy for a rush order, Chan acted surprised. Then the manufacturers had to pay twice?
"That's right," the shop owner said. "As you know, Gambino has a lot of power."
"Gambino?" Chan asked.
"Gambino's uh . . . whatever, the Mafia," came the answer.
What about independent truckers? Chan wanted to know.
"They run into problems," the shop owner said. There were no secrets on the street, he warned. The big truckers had people going around checking.
"What kind of people?" Chan asked.
"Company people."
As Chan was making his rounds, another undercover police officer loading garments at the Gambinos' trucking warehouse at 202 11th Avenue learned that the allocation system was policed by roving company "salesmen" who spied and reported on movements of garment-center goods. Before being hired, he was interviewed by Joseph Gambino, who he said laid out two rules: no drugs and no stealing. If he was caught stealing, he said Gambino told him, "We don't call the police -- we take care of it ourselves."
By early 1988, Spitzer was pressing for a more ambitious initiative. To gather further evidence, he wrote in a second memo, "we will need to control a sewing contractor being victimized by the Gambino family's extortionate scheme." With no existing contractor willing to cooperate or in a position to be forced, Spitzer said, "I believe it is worth purchasing a sewing contractor in the garment district."
FROM THE OUTSIDE, Chrystie Fashions looked like any other of the hundreds of sweatshops in lower Manhattan -- an open 1,500-square-foot shop crammed with sewing machines, one of four similar lofts sharing the ninth floor of an old building at 195 Chrystie Street.
But although the work force was real enough -- men and women hired from state unemployment lists -- the operation was a part of an elaborate sting that included hidden video cameras and telephone taps. Running the shop was a muscular, pony-tailed undercover State Police trooper who went by the name of Maximo Rivera and who -- knowing the business from years spent moonlighting in a garment-industry shop in the same building, as it happened, as the Consolidated offices on West 35th Street -- had answered an ad in El Diario and arranged to purchase the shop from its owner for $10,000. The shop's previous trucker was Consolidated. By the 12-month rule, it should still belong to Consolidated.
Within several months of opening in August 1988, the shop was sewing orders for a number of manufacturers, including Allison Tracy, Jeffrey Craig and M & B Sportswear, that had been persuaded to use Chan's Lok Kee and other gypsy truckers to augment Consolidated. Deliveries were sometimes fouled up, and a policeman who operated the button machine did a terrible job. Some of the buttons, one customer complained, dangled "like drop earrings." But there was plenty of business. In all, the shop would sew 43,000 garments.
One October morning, Rivera got his first visit from a Consolidated salesman, a middle-age man with a moustache and graying hair who gave his name as Roger Kunka. He was angry about the gypsy truckers. "I want you to come say hello to my boss," he told Rivera. "I want you to say hello to Mr. Gambino." Rivera, who thought the Gambinos might recognize him, took a pass.
The following spring, Kunka, accompanied by another Consolidated salesman, Sam Andrew, a balding grandfatherly figure, visited Chrystie Fashions again. This time, using one of the shop's tapped phones, he called one of the manufacturers who was using gypsy truckers to carry his cutwork to and from the shop. "Hear me out," Kunka told the nervous manufacturer, Baruch Rabinowitz. "We are the truckmen of this stop here. O.K.?"
Rabinowitz called Rivera in a panic. "I know that they are connected with the Mafia," he said. "I don't want to start with them."
On April 12, 1989, Andrew visited the shop to deliver a blunter warning. "This is a Consolidated stop, you know," he told Rivera. "We bring it in and we like to take it back out again." When Chan left the office, Andrew spelled it out more clearly. "I don't want to say he's gonna get his [expletive] kicked," he said. "But he will sooner or later. . . . Maybe my guys won't do it, but somebody will. One of the [expletive] truckers will take him apart. He'll be spending the next six months in the [expletive] hospital."
Chan never did get hurt, perhaps because the Gambinos suspected he might be an agent or perhaps because he wasn't much of a commercial threat. In fact, Kunka seemed to make a point of saying that Rabinowitz was entitled to use Lok Kee: "It's a free country."
Several months later, in a further effort to test the system, Rivera visited another trucker, I.M.C. He wanted to switch from Consolidated, he said. "You have to use him," said I.M.C.'s Shelly Sussman, a large man with a cigar, referring to Consolidated. "We're not interested." Two days earlier, Rivera had been similarly rebuffed in a visit to another big trucking company, Triple A. 
The shop had served its purpose. On Aug. 11, 1989, after a year of operation, investigators staged a phony arrest, bursting in with guns and seizing Rivera and a package of flour made up to look like cocaine. Seeing Rivera wrestled out in handcuffs, many of the workers cried.
Three months later, a bug planted by State Police technicians and the District Attorney's squad in Consolidated's West 35th Street warehouse recorded the Gambinos making day-to-day decisions that, Spitzer argued, showed them enforcing their trucking cartel and gave the prosecutor the last pieces needed for a search warrant.
The search yielded four truckloads of company records, including a special prize, Roger Kunka's notebook documenting the double-billing of manufacturers who did their own trucking. Kunka himself, confronted with the detailed evidence, reluctantly agreed, like Sam Andrew, to become a prosecution witness. Kunka was so disoriented he initially believed that investigators had conspired with his dentist to plant a microphone in his teeth -- otherwise, he asked one of the undercover agents, how did they know so much?
The office bug caught Joseph Gambino's bravado reaction to the search. "They're gonna say to themselves," he announced, " 'Do you wanna know something? These [expletive] Mafia guys really run a solid business.' "
KROLL'S ROBERT McGuire was not ready to go that far in his own assessment. But as an agent of the court charged with overseeing the Gambinos' surrender of trucking into and out of the factories, and with issuing orders to foster competition, he wanted to be sure that he wasn't crippling the garment industry in the process. Manufacturers had all kinds of arrangements in place to move their garments. Would independent truckers service their routes and customers reliably day in and day out, as the Gambinos had? Would gypsies help finance sewing shops and other small contractors, as the Gambinos claimed, with some justification, to have done? Or should the financing of sewing shops by truckers be banned or sharply limited?
Thomas Gambino and Rosen, McGuire felt, had made some reasonable arguments why garment-center trucking operated as it did and why precipitous change could disrupt a vulnerable industry, buffeted by foreign competition. With all the different moving operations -- cutwork and trimmings in, finished garments out -- it was easier to bill by the garment than by the trip, they maintained: hence the single round-trip price whether or not a manufacturer chose to do any part of his own trucking.
Although McGuire agreed with the District Attorney's "creative approach" in achieving a settlement that aimed to reform an industry, McGuire was also concerned that the agreement may have been widely misunderstood. It did not call for the Gambinos to get out of trucking, only the shipment of cutwork to the factories and finished work out. They could continue to haul garments from manufacturers to stores around the city and out of state. If the Gambinos swapped routes with other truckers, building up their other business in the process, would the outcome be ridiculed as a debacle? Who could forget that a similar effort to oust the mob from the Fulton Fish Market had foundered? Then, too, he worried, if the special master was pledged to restore free competition, why would anyone pay for the Gambino routes? And who would buy into an industry whose rules were yet to be formulated?
If the Gambinos had been gripping the garment district in a choke hold, and that choke hold was now loosened by the plea agreement, did it follow that the system would automatically open to competition? Or would someone or something else come along to dominate it? Would garment prices really drop? Most of all, he didn't want to launch a failure.
Eliot Spitzer voiced confidence that reform would work, although he wouldn't be around to monitor it -- after six years he was leaving for private practice in a large Manhattan law firm. Over-the-road trucking, where the Gambinos would now have to concentrate their business, he believed, was more competitive and thus resistant to domination. As for crippling the garment district, he said, "the goods will get from the manufacturers to the contractors, I'm not worried about that. You could always put them in a station wagon or van the way contractors have been doing for years -- only now you won't have to pay the Gambinos for the right to do it."
 
 
 
SECOND-STORY JOB
 THE BUGGING OF THOMAS GAMBINO'S garment-district trucking office was a commando-style operation, according to State Police Sgt. Daniel Wiese, a veteran undercover trooper and senior investigator. On Halloween night 1989, State Police officers using blue and white Consolidated Edison trucks sealed off West 35th Street between Seventh Avenue and Broadway. The phones had already been tapped by experts who had knocked out the lines and posed as repairmen to gain entry. Others sent in as city fire inspectors had reported back on the types of locks they would need to pick.
The break-in team included Jack Breheny, a retired detective and expert lock-picker now working for the state's Organized Crime Task Force. After Breheny picked the first of some 13 locks, using a six-inch-long stick of spring steel with a point filed to a flattened diamond shape, the team disabled one visible alarm and discovered a second -- hidden -- motion-sensing alarm. Because this could not be immediately disabled, the investigators were withdrawn and the entire operation was aborted. Ten days later, on a Sunday night, it was mounted all over again from the beginning, complete with Con Ed trucks. This time, the experts defeated the silent alarm by hooking it up to their own power source.
In the Gambinos' inner office, an enclosure suspended within the trucking loft, they blasted into the concrete ceiling to install a power line for the bugs. To Wiese's dismay, however, a cell transmitter didn't work through the walls. And by oversight, they had brought with them only a single Brady bug, an inch-square wafer with an open microphone that would transmit sounds via a phone line to the District Attorney's office two miles downtown. They planted it in a hollowed-out ceiling tile midway between the desks and brazenly snaked the exposed wire down along a door frame, hoping no one would notice.
No one did. When arresting officers, a year later, made a show of standing on a ladder and removing the bug, Wiese recalled, Joseph Gambino's jaw dropped. Just seeing that, Wiese said recently, "was worth a year's salary -- mine, not his."

HEADLINE: Lizzie Borden Took an Ax

BYLINE: By Mary Cantwell; Mary Cantwell is a member of The New York Times editorial board. Her small-town childhood in Rhode Island is the subject of a memoir, "American Girl," published last month by Random House.

 BODY:
TODAY THE narrow clapboard house is painted pale gray trimmed with deep green. A small print shop is shoved into one side of it, and a big air-conditioner pokes incongruously from a parlor window. I know it is a parlor window because, like a lot of people who grew up near Fall River, Mass., I am conversant with the floor plan of this house.
It is a house with no corridors and rooms that open awkwardly off one another. Because its former residents were much given to locking their bedroom doors, half the rooms on the second floor were once accessible only by the front staircase. The other half were accessible only by the back staircase. The maid slept in the attic; there were no bathtubs, and the water closet in the basement was seldom visited. It was easier to empty the morning slop pails in the backyard. 
 It was also easier, if one felt one's stomach coming up in one's throat, to vomit in the backyard. There was a lot of vomiting preceding the day that made this house famous, presumably because of the heat (though one resident mentioned poison) and the menu. Truly, this house's backyard does not bear thinking about.
On Aug. 4, 1892, the younger daughter of this house discovered a body sprawled on a settee in the sitting room. A short time later the maid and a neighbor found a second body face down on the floor of the guest room. Death in both cases came at the hands of a person, still officially unknown, wielding a small, sharp hatchet.
 ANDREW JACKSON BORDEN, WHOSE HOME this was from 1874 to 1892, was a tall, thin 70-year-old with hooded dark eyes and a long mean mouth. His relatives had lived in what is now southeastern Massachusetts since 1638 -- in 1714 two Borden brothers literally owned Fall River -- but they were not born equal. By 1892, some Bordens were high on the social ladder, some were Swamp Yankees, which is New England's word for rednecks, and most were in the middle. Andrew Borden, who began as an undertaker and ended as a bank president, was rich enough for a high perch but too stingy to claim it.
Andrew Borden's second wife, Abby Durfee Gray Borden, was short, fat and 63. She, too, had relatives in high places -- several Durfees, like several Bordens, had reaped fortunes from Fall River's cotton mills -- but her father had peddled tin from a pushcart.
There were two Borden "girls," Andrew Borden's daughters by his first wife. The elder, Emma, 41 years old, lived a long life without so much as occasioning an adjective; and in the only certain depiction of her, a drawing, she has covered her face with her left hand. Her younger sister, Lizzie, 32, was of a far more public disposition: active in the Christian Endeavor Society and the Ladies Fruit and Flower Mission, a Sunday school teacher and member of the Women's Christian Temperance Union. Several photographs of her exist, and a novelist named Victoria Lincoln, who lived up the street from her in childhood, left a vivid description. Lizzie Borden, she wrote, was "tall, stocky, jowly, dressy and unremarkable." Except, perhaps, for her eyes. "Photographs assure me that her eyes were as I remember them . . . huge and protruding, their irises an almost colorless ice-blue. . . . I have heard many people speak of them as dead eyes, but the eyes of the dead are dull; Lizzie's had the shine of beach pebbles."
On the very hot morning of Aug. 4, the Bordens' maid, Bridget Sullivan, whom the family called Maggie, and who, feeling ill, had just vomited in the backyard, was told to wash the windows. She did, pausing only to chat over the fence with a neighbor's maid. Everyone in the house -- but for Emma, who was out of town -- had been retching for days. Only Mrs. Borden consulted a doctor. On Aug. 3 she told Dr. Seabury W. Bowen she suspected poison. He suspected warmed-over fish (meals often made repeat appearances at the Borden table) and offered to take a look at the rest of the family. Mr. Borden, angry because his wife had been wasting money on a doctor, ordered him away from his door.
When Bridget started on the windows, Mrs. Borden was dusting. Mr. Borden had gone to the business district, as had John Vinnicum Morse, the brother of his long-dead first wife, who was visiting. Lizzie, who'd been drinking coffee, had left the kitchen.
Once she had finished washing the windows from the outside, Bridget came indoors to a seemingly empty house. Still scrubbing, this time from the inside, she heard Andrew Borden struggling with the locked front door. Bridget went to open it and, also struggling, uttered an impatient "Pshaw!" As she did, she heard Lizzie, who was at the top of the front-hall stairs, laugh. Given the house's peculiar geography, she could have been coming only from the guest room or her own bedroom.
Andrew Borden went into the sitting room to nap. Lizzie went into the dining room to iron handkerchiefs. First, though, she told Bridget about a sale on yard goods, and added that Mrs. Borden, summoned by a note, was out on a sick call. Bridget said she'd go to the sale later, but for now she was taking a nap. Then she climbed the back stairs to the attic. About 10 minutes later, Lizzie called out.
"Maggie, come down!"
"What is the matter?"
"Come down quick! Father's dead! Somebody's come in and killed him."
Bridget ran to Dr. Bowen's house and told his wife the news. She was then dispatched to get Alice Russell, a friend of the "girls." Meanwhile, Mrs. Churchill, a neighbor, noticing the alarums and excursions, came over to see what had happened. On finding out, she sent her handyman for help.
By now, Bridget was back from fetching Miss Russell, along with Dr. Bowen. On the chance that Mrs. Borden was at her sister's house, she asked, should she go there and tell her Mr. Borden was very sick?
"Maggie, I am almost positive I heard her coming in," Lizzie replied. "Won't you go upstairs to see."
Mrs. Churchill went with her. Before they got to the landing, they could see Mrs. Borden, partly hidden by the bed, lying on the floor of the guest room.
Mrs. Churchill rounded the bed to get a better look, then raced downstairs. Alice Russell said, "Is there another?"
"Yes, she is up there," Mrs. Churchill replied.
On Aug. 11, 1892, Lizzie Borden was arrested for the murders of her father and stepmother. Ten months later, she went on trial in New Bedford. The jury waited for what they perceived to be a decent interval, just over an hour, before freeing her. "It will be with a certain relief to every right-minded man or woman who has followed the case," crowed the editorial page of The New York Times, "that the jury at New Bedford has not only acquitted Miss Lizzie Borden of the atrocious crime with which she was charged, but has done so with a promptness that was very significant."
Those are the facts. The rest -- a notorious jingle ("Lizzie Borden took an ax. . . ."), countless books and magazine articles, plays, a ballet, a television drama and, from Aug. 3 to 5 in Fall River, the first Lizzie Borden Conference -- constitute a century of suppositions.
 IN 1892, FALL RIVER WAS A MILL TOWN -- no, more than that, a textile colossus -- and the mills are still the first buildings one sees on crossing the bridge from Somerset. Most are dinosaurs. The Depression came to Fall River five years before it arrived in the rest of the United States and never really left. The unemployment rate -- officially 13 percent -- is the highest in Massachusetts. "Fall River is a city of hills," Bernie Sullivan, the editor of The Fall River Herald News, says, "and we always seem to be going up them."
In 1892, the rich lived on the Hill, actually a steep drop from highland to the waterfront, and the poor lived below them, near the mills. Downtown, where the Bordens lived, must have had an interior logic, but it is gone now, lost to demolition, fires and the intrusion of Interstate 195. Even so, the city has a curious charm. What's left of the old breaks the monotony of the new; and once out of the business district, the streets are bosky. Because the vast majority of its citizens are of Portuguese descent, there's no better Portuguese food outside Lisbon. The Cambodians, the newest, fastest-growing immigrant group, have yet to make a culinary dent.
When the mills failed, the textile millionaires took their money and ran. Even in the good days, they'd never given much of it back to the city in which it had been made. But Lizzie Borden, descendant of Fall River's founding family, has. Tote bags and calendars printed with that famous face are hot items at the Fall River Historical Society's gift counter. And the Lizzie Borden Conference will surely attract tourists as well as scholars eager to debate, among other theses, "The Gertrude Stein/Lizzie Borden Connection" and "Lizzie Borden, Victim of Incest?"
Jules R. Ryckebusch, the conference chairman and an English and communications professor at Bristol Community College, where the conference is to be held, came to Fall River in 1966. A writing instructor, he assigned a paper on the Borden murders to his freshman class. "It was amazing! There was Bordenalia all over the place. One kid was able to get Lizzie's high-school record because her mother worked in the school office. Did you know Lizzie never graduated? And a kid whose father was on the police force got him to run off a complete set of the autopsy photographs, the ones that have never been published because they're so grisly. God, I wish I'd done an oral history! Because in those days there was still someone who knew someone who knew someone who knew something."
Professor Ryckebusch has his theories. So have legions of others. The Borden murders have been ascribed to Bridget, to a presumed illegitimate son of Andrew's and to passers-by unknown. Some amateurs of crime have kept a keen eye on Emma, despite her absence, and John Vinnicum Morse is thought by many to have been a very odd lot indeed. Jules Ryckebusch is sticking to Lizzie:
"It was money. The motive was money. But this wasn't planned. And Lizzie did hate her stepmother. My guess is she saw Lizzie doing something in her bedroom -- masturbating for all I know -- and Lizzie was enraged. There's an almost erotic association with that kind of violence. Nineteen or 20 ax blows! She got a kick out of continuing to slaughter her.
"Lizzie knew her father would know what happened, so she had to kill him. The killing released something, something like an orgasm. By the time the police arrived, she was fairly relaxed.
"Just for the hell (Continued on page 42)
of it, I sometimes mention Fall River -- and people say either 'Never heard of it' or 'Wasn't that where Lizzie Borden . . . ?' "
IF IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO divorce Lizzie Borden from this city, so it is impossible to separate this city from Lizzie Borden. "I'm just staying around long enough to tell people we had something in Fall River besides Lizzie Borden." The speaker is Florence Brigham, a former curator of the Fall River Historical Society, and she may as well forget about her mission in life. Not only do visitors make a beeline for the society's Borden memorabilia, but Mrs. Brigham is herself a splendid talker about these murders and their motive. The daughter-in-law of a character witness for Lizzie, she is, at 92, the last of the someones who knew someone who knew someone who knew something.
"I might have found out so much about this, and so could a lot of others, if only it hadn't been a closed subject," she says. "Why, Alice Russell was my sewing teacher at the Highland School! I could have asked her. When I think of it! I had so many ties to the story, and I never asked. Nobody did, out of respect to the name, out of respect to the other Bordens who still lived here. When my son was a little boy, he asked his grandmother if Lizzie did it. She said, 'Lizzie Borden was tried, and she was acquitted, and we don't talk about that anymore.' "
As she speaks, Mrs. Brigham, who is the size and speed of a cricket, is moving briskly about the kitchen of the Brayton mansion. The Brayton mansion houses the historical society, and its kitchen houses the contents of the hip bath.
The hip bath. Yes.
Once Lizzie's trial was ended, her lawyer, Andrew J. Jennings, dumped his notebooks, the minutes of Lizzie's inquest and assorted souvenirs into a hip bath, covered it with an awning and never spoke of the matter again. Seventy-five years later, his daughter gave the hip bath to the historical society. Barbara Ashton, then a reporter at The New Bedford Standard Times, was there when it arrived.
"I can remember sitting out in the office," she says, "opening the package and going 'Oooooooh.' "
Small wonder. The hip bath held not only the expected written material, but Abby Borden's dustcap and switch. The Marseilles spread and pillow shams with which she had been making up the guest room bed, each spotted with minute drops of blood. Locks of the victims' hair and two paper tags neatly labeled "Mr. Borden's stomach" and "Mrs. Borden's stomach." A handleless hatchet. The hatchet, probably, though yet another book is soon to proclaim its innocence.
Lizzie's lunch bucket, the bucket that was brought to her every day she was held in the Taunton jail, is on the side of the soapstone sink. The stool on which she sat to eat that lunch is near a window, and an ironing board, said to be hers, is beside it.
"Of course, it didn't have legs then, but don't you think that board is too heavy for a woman to lift?" Mrs. Brigham asks. "No," I answer, remembering the ease with which my short, stout grandmother, who was 15 years old in 1892, hefted her own legless ironing board. I am caught in the web. Two days in Fall River and I, too, am opining.
Leaving that ghastly kitchen (photographs of the Bordens' skulls hang above the sink), we speak of the dress Lizzie burned the morning after the murders, the dress some claim was bloodstained and that she claimed was soiled. "That family would never have burnt a dress just because it had paint on it," Mrs. Brigham says. "They would have torn it up for rags, or used it for quilt squares." And I, remembering my grandmother's ragbag, can only agree.
SOON AFTER HER acquittal Lizzie Borden and her sister, Andrew Borden's only heirs, left the purgatory that was that poky little house downtown and entered heaven. She bought a house on the Hill.
It was a big house with four bathrooms -- there would be no noisome backyard here -- and a world away from the spinning machines and the barefoot boys with old men's faces who worked them. This was the kind of house her friends at the Ladies Fruit and Flower Mission lived in. ("Why were there so many old maids among the group?" Mrs. Brigham asks rhetorically. "It was because they never married outside their own social set. The boys got out and fell in love with their college friends' sisters. But the girls were stuck here.")
They lived quietly, Lizzie and Emma, but not quietly enough for a society that would have liked Lizzie to perform some equivalent of suttee. A jewelry store in nearby Providence accused her of shoplifting; she had a crush on an actress named Nance O'Neil, and one night she gave a party for a theatrical troupe. Emma moved out soon after.
"My mother-in-law finally gave up on Lizzie," Mrs. Brigham says, "and I always thought it was those theater people. I can just imagine her and all those other Yankees saying: 'Now what does she want to do this for? Disgrace herself -- and us -- because we accepted her back.' "
Lizzie Borden died on June 1, 1927, and was buried after sunset in Oak Grove Cemetery. Only the undertaker's assistants were present for the interment.
"IF SHE'D BEEN CONVICTED, she'd have been hanged. And they didn't want to hang a woman." So says John C. Corrigan, Jr., a Fall River lawyer, who is in the Quequechan Club sipping a cold drink and munching hot peanuts. The Quequechan has a long porch and a dark mahogany bar and was established around 1894. Now it has both male and female members of varying professions and ethnicity, but then it was a hangout for well-off Yankee males.
John Corrigan says he thinks the jurors did the best they could with what they had. Lizzie's inquest testimony, which was a mass of contradictions, was excluded; so was the testimony of a pharmacist who swore that she had tried to buy prussic acid, a poison, from him the day before the murders, and the judge's charge to the jury was a virtual order to acquit. Even without all that, however, there would still have been that reluctance to execute a female.
Massachusetts hadn't executed a woman for centuries, Corrigan recalls, not since one Bathsheba Spooner was found after her death to be, as she'd protested, five months' pregnant. I recall a photograph of the hanging of Mary Surratt, who kept the boardinghouse in which Lincoln's assassination was planned. A guard's umbrella had shielded her from the summer sun, and before the trap was sprung someone had tied a rope around her skirts so no one could look up them as she dangled from the noose. Presumably Lizzie would have received similar courtesies.
Being chairman of the Legal and Forensics Panel at the Lizzie Borden Conference may well be fun for John Corrigan. He is, after all, a lawyer with an interest in the case. But he is ambivalent about the conference itself: "How the hell do you celebrate a gruesome ax murder?"
You don't, especially when you are standing in the Borden plot at Oak Grove Cemetery. A stele in the center is engraved:
 
Andrew Jackson Borden
 His wife
 Sarah Anthony Borden
 His wife
 Abby Durfee Borden
 Children of Andrew J. and Sarah A. Borden
 Alice Esther
 1856-1858
 Lizbeth Andrews
 1860-1927
 Emma Lenora
 1851-1927.
In truth, it isn't Lizbeth Andrews Borden who's buried here, because there never was such a person. Lizbeth Andrews was a figment of Lizzie Andrews's imagination: a woman with a lovely name and, if names confer magic upon their possessors, a lovely life.
A handful of friends, the books about Lizzie Borden say, attended a funeral service at the house on the Hill, during which a hymn was sung by the soloist from Central Congregational Church. Not exactly, Florence Brigham says.
"Mrs. Turner -- Vida Pearson to me -- was asked if she would sing 'My Ain Countree' at 306 French Street at a certain time. 'So I rang the bell,' she told me, 'and a gentleman said: "Follow me. You're to stand beside the fireplace." So I stood there and sang that song to an empty room. I never saw a soul but that one man.' "

HEADLINE: CULTURAL VIEW;
You Can't Please All of the People . . .

BYLINE: By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN

 BODY:
Stung by three years of controversy, the National Endowment for the Arts recently produced a nine-minute video explaining its mission and achievements. Walter Cronkite, once the most trusted talking head on television, begins by noting that the endowment represents one of the smallest parts of the Federal budget; it is allocated just 68 cents annually for every American.
The rest of the video demonstrates how much that sum has bought. There are brief shots of orchestras, ballet companies, circuses, children's festivals, pottery making, the Vietnam Memorial, theater performances, museum galleries, folk dancing, an American Indian ritual -- images punctuated by Ray Charles singing "America." The video stresses two aspects of the endowment's labors: television (a "medium of collective experiences") and community (where the N.E.A. helped "make multiculturalism a reality long before it became a catchword"). 
 Missing from the video is any hint of the controversies that have raged since 1989, controversies so familiar they can be summarized by a list of names -- Mapplethorpe, Serrano, Frohnmayer, Helms -- and a list of words -- censorship, outrage, decency, quality. Publicly financed exhibitions of artworks that included images of a jar of urine, a bullwhip and various bodily parts were attacked and defended with principles far more important than the works themselves.
Somewhere between the video's celebratory vision and the recent debates, the underlying reason for the founding of the endowment seems to have been lost. "Art is a nation's most precious heritage," Lyndon Johnson said upon signing the law that created the National Endowment for the Arts in 1965, "for it is in our works of art that we reveal to ourselves, and to others, the inner vision which guides us as a nation."
But what is that inner vision today? Why, after 27 years and more than 90,000 grants, have the controversies increased? What conception of the arts does our country have? And what vision does the endowment serve? The answers tell us much about the status of contemporary culture and its discontents, and much, too, about our "inner vision" or, as I think, the lack of it.
A few years ago, a corporation used an advertising slogan at its sponsored cultural events: "It takes art to make a company great." The reason for founding the National Endowment for the Arts was similar; it began as one of Johnson's Great Society programs. But opponents of the legislation questioned whether the Government should be involved. The argument was that political interference in the arts is repugnant; the arts should be spared the typically deadening hand of the Federal bureaucracy.
The fear of political interference still haunts the debate today. An agency whose chairman is appointed by the President (with the advice and consent of the Senate) and whose managing body, the National Council on the Arts, is composed of 26 citizens, also selected by the President, is bound to be a political institution (the advisory panels of artists and other citizens who make grant recommendations, notwithstanding). And why not? Since the patron is the Government, perhaps the grants should be somewhat political, reflecting the country's view of itself and its arts.
The questions to ask then are, what sort of patron a Government can be, and what sort of patron our Government has become.
 
Expansionism
Culture Becomes A Growth Industry
 The endowment's philosophy is easy enough to discern from its recent publications. Among the most revealing about how the agency sees itself and its role and how it justifies itself politically to Congress and the public is a 106-page book entitled "Program Accomplishments." It was submitted to the House Appropriations Committee in April 1991 by the endowment's chairman, John E. Frohnmayer. President Bush dismissed Mr. Frohnmayer from his post last winter because he did not satisfy the most conservative critics of the endowment. Under his successor, Anne-Imelda Radice, who was appointed acting chairman in May, the fundamental philosophy appears unchanged.
The N.E.A. has consistently seemed to treat culture almost as if it were an economic system that had to display steady growth; every achievement is measured in terms of numbers and "expansion." There is the expansion of dollars given and dollars matched, of number of events and attendance. There is even an Expansion Arts Program, whose goal is to "expand programming" to assure, as the 1991 report puts it, that "the maximum number of Americans have access to excellent art." Expansion of access is admirable and important. But as American orchestras have learned, it can also be harmful, leading to out-of-scale expenses and a larger but less committed audience.
There are even times when the goal of expansion seems to become an obsession. The N.E.A. boasts, for example, that in 1989 the Cleveland Opera presented the premiere of "Holy Blood and Crescent Moon," the first opera by Stewart Copeland, a rock composer: "It outsold the company's productions of the A-B-C of opera, 'Aida,' 'La Boheme' and 'Carmen,' as well as its 1987 production of 'Porgy and Bess' by more than 61 percent." There was no word about the work's critical failure, only about attendance. There is actually no direct relationship between numbers and artistic achievement. Pop culture, which needs no patronage, will always draw the largest audience.
 
Drive for Diversity
An Artistic Soup Of 170 Varieties
 There is another, even more important aspect of the N.E.A.'s role as a Government agency: it is preoccupied almost as much with constituencies as with products. This means, in particular, racial and ethnic representation. The agency claims that it serves 170 ethnic minorities. It even has a Folk Arts Program that "helps insure that every American can find somewhere in the endowment a place where his own people's artistic voice can ring loud and clear." The N.E.A. has financially assisted: "Hmong needlework, coastal sea-grass basketry, southeast Alaska native dance, American Indian basketry and woodcraft, Pacific Island canoe building and Appalachian banjo playing."
Wonderful things come out of this diversity even though many grants amount to just a few thousand dollars. But the endowment effectively declines to let its own voice ring loud and clear. It argues that it "must not, under any circumstances, impose a single esthetic standard." It even states that "each traditional group has its own internal criteria for success." This means that each culture can be judged only by its own rules.
So the agency's priorities are established demographically. The N.E.A. seems to see its central mission as that of a democratic disburser of funds. Its independent judging panels are analyzed geographically to within a tenth of a percentage point. This year, 14 percent of panelists are from New York, 13.3 percent from the Central Plains.
Breakdowns are also racial. In 1991, 33.4 percent of the panelists were "minorities" -- American Indians, Asians, blacks or Hispanics -- and 48 percent were women.
The emphasis on diversity is increasing. In the 1987 fiscal year, 11.8 percent of the budget went to "multicultural" programming; last year, 15.2 percent did. In the 1991 fiscal year, 22.3 percent of all grants went to support arts associated with minority communities. Geographically, since 1989, the proportion of panelists from New York has declined by 36 percent (radically undervaluing the city as an arts center); California, the country's other major center for the arts, also was subject to rationing.
In all these cases, there are political arguments to be made for percentages: the arts must serve an entire country; there may have been neglected areas in past years. But the result is that a distribution curve becomes the determining factor, supplanting esthetic judgment.
Given this cultural policy, the Mapplethorpe case and its descendants, with their disputes over public sponsorship of material deemed offensive by some, take on a different character.
There have been incidents throughout the endowment's history when grants were objected to; in 1972, for example, Jesse Helms opposed the support given Erica Jong's novel "Fear of Flying." But now the stakes have been raised. There is more aggressive monitoring from political conservatives; objections have even increased since the end of Ronald Reagan's Presidency. This is partly out of conservative anxiety over the Bush Administration's less ideological stance. Simultaneously, some segments of the arts world have become more radical and explicitly political.
In addition, the endowment has aggravated tensions with its own apparent inconsistency. Generally, the agency has declined to establish universal criteria for judgment or to assert some idea of shared community; it has instead been preoccupied with just the opposite, with giving each subgroup and interest group an apportioned slice of the arts pie.
According to this view, the avant-garde arts lobby ought to be just another one of these groups. Performance artists like Karen Finley or Tim Miller, who have had grant applications rejected by the N.E.A., believe they speak for political or sexual minorities. Once the endowment has taken the position that no standard can be applied to all, that each minority group has its own culture and should be judged by its own criteria, how can the agency suddenly assert standards that transcend special interests? These artists intend to provoke; by their terms, they succeed.
Their rejection has been labeled "censorship," as if freedom of speech were being abolished simply because the Government declined to finance a particular project. This view exists because of the common belief that the Government is obligated to sponsor differing and provocative views. It is also precisely how the N.E.A. has acted -- as if all varieties of expression were entitled to equal time. The endowment has thus effectively abolished its own right to make judgments, while factions in the arts community lobby for their causes with increasing fervor.
 
Art and the Schools
Culture as Therapy, Not Enlightenment
 When it comes to arts education in the schools -- which is already in a bankrupt condition -- the problems multiply. In its 1991 report, the N.E.A. treats education as an extension of its general populist philosophy, implying that anybody can produce art, that no system of standards and values has more validity than any other.
But art involves a study of techniques, a mastery of a body of knowledge. What about meter and form in poetry, score reading and listening in music, brush strokes and perspective in painting? What about the discipline of art? The 1991 report bypasses all this. In March, the endowment announced a major initiative in arts education with the Department of Education; the question is whether their call for "world-class standards" will mean real change.
The critic Robert Hughes has argued that in the United States art is often treated as if it were therapeutic, as if it were meant to heal rather than enlighten. This may indeed be the key to the endowment's democratic esthetics. Here is how the N.E.A. describes a program designed to create an "in-depth arts-in-education program" for schoolchildren in Augusta, Ga. It is aimed at "improving general academic achievement, the general learning environment, student self-esteem, attendance, creative thinking and social equity among students." Everything for everybody, except world peace.
 
Government Patrons
Does a Democracy Allow for Elites?
 The great patrons of the past were usually individuals of enormous wealth and authority who asserted personal taste in granting commissions. This produced much that was meretricious but nearly all that was magnificent as well. The artworks commissioned by the Roman Catholic Church were really commissioned by individual popes like Julius II and Clement VII, who employed Michelangelo. In this country individual patronage has given us institutions ranging from the Boston Symphony Orchestra to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum.
Governmental patronage has a very different character. In countries with a clear consensus about culture, where traditions are deep and uniform, large quantities of money are available and often disbursed with great confidence. In France, culture high and low is a Cabinet-level concern. Public arts support in West Germany before unification traditionally amounted to more than a billion dollars a year; the 1992 N.E.A. budget was $176 million.
But problems still arise. In Italy, getting a job in an orchestra can be a matter of political party membership. In the Netherlands, there was, until recently, a program under which visual artists received higher benefits if they donated works to the state. By 1983, almost half a million works had been donated, most accumulating in warehouses. A policy revision involving stricter judgments of "quality" was finally introduced.
So confusion about taste, art and allocation is not American alone. But it is aggravated by aspects of our culture. There is a tension between the elite character of the fine arts and the American traditions of egalitarianism. In the 19th century, Alexis de Tocqueville predicted that American democracy would change the character of art itself. The emphasis, he said, would be away from the soul and toward the body; the arts would prefer motion and sensation to sentiment and thought. In a democracy, he wrote, "the productions of artists are more numerous, but the merit of each production is diminished."
The N.E.A. seems to be fulfilling this prophecy. Its promotional video focuses on the body, on motion, on sensation, on quantity. Moreover, the agency, even while supporting important projects in the fine arts, has followed the now regnant belief that notions of "high" and "fine" are matters of aristocratic snobbery. This is, of course, an extension of de Tocqueville's prediction: esthetics has become egalitarian and even irrelevant.
 
Redrawing the Portrait
What Should The Endowment Be?
 The N.E.A. has had its triumphs, but it continually stumbles over its own philosophy. The conservative critic and publisher of The New Criterion, Samuel Lipman, who has served on the National Council on the Arts, has argued that the endowment's policy of giving matching grants has stifled diversity in private patronage. In a series of provocative essays he has suggested that the agency's populism has distorted audience attentiveness and that Federal financing has created a "formidable bureaucratic class of administrators and advocates," many of whom may have less discernment than artists or donors. The result is an arts industry, intent on growth and self-preservation, supported by Government largesse.
What, then, should the endowment be? For the N.E.A. to be a more important patron it would have to become even more controversial. It would have to jettison its gerrymandering of funds according to geography, race, ethnicity, style and idea. It would have to argue that some things may be worth financial assistance that do not offer a social return on investment. It would have to be democratic in its inspiration but elite in its tastes. It would have to give priority to a national high culture that should provide a unifying frame for our rich multiplicity of folk and popular cultures. Finally, it would have to aggressively represent these positions in arguments for serious arts education.
Unfortunately, in our fractured culture, not much of this is possible. A majority of the public (and perhaps many readers) may agree with the endowment's approach to art; that is why the endowment boasts about it. Any N.E.A. that exercised strong contrary convictions would be cut to pieces for its elitism or narrow tastes. It may even be that the only National Endowment for the Arts we can have is the one that already exists. In its occasional triumphs and desultory character, it is a creature of the culture it supports. It is also, I fear, a portrait of ourselves, a disconcerting reflection, not of "inner vision" but of its absence.

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURE VIEW;
Beyond Organic Architecture: The Office as Oasis

BYLINE: By Herbert Muschamp

 BODY:
Recessions are hard times for architects, but they can be enriching times for architecture. In the early 1970's, a lull in real estate development offered a chance to absorb new ways of thinking about urban context. When building resumed toward the end of the decade, architects had largely abandoned the modernist view of the city as a messy slate to be rubbed clean. They had come to value the mess as history: a rich heritage of ideas.
Yesterday history, today biology. Now we've got a real mess on our hands: the environmental crisis that summoned the world's leaders to Rio last month. It's time architects were summoned to address this issue as well. Cars and factories aren't the only big polluters. Homes and office buildings consume energy, release toxic fumes, send mountains of garbage out into a world that is short on dumps -- or fast becoming one. How can design protect the environment from the impact of urban growth? There may be no more pressing question for architects to ponder. 
 Randolph Croxton and Kirsten Childs, partners in the Croxton Collaborative, a New York firm, are wizards at making something worthwhile out of a mess. They are taking a wreck of a building at Broadway and East Fourth Street and converting it into a $24 million showcase for ecologically sound design. The new building, which will be called Audubon House and will serve as headquarters for the National Audubon Society, has already aroused wide interest for its innovative techniques dealing with lighting, refuse treatment and climate control. Mr. Croxton and Ms. Childs aren't just renovating a building here. They're turning pollution control into an art form.
One of the beauties of Audubon House is the ease with which it joins the lessons of the 1970's to the solutions needed today. Lodged in a century-old Romanesque loft building designed by George B. Post, architect of the New York Stock Exchange, this is no space-age Biosphere. It is a tribute to the preservation movement that gave old buildings new life. And it is "recycling" on a giant scale.
Mr. Croxton, an architect, and Ms. Childs, an interior designer, tried out some of their ideas three years ago in another loft renovation, the New York offices of the Natural Resources Defense Center. The main goal there was to reduce energy consumption. Many of Mr. Croxton's energy-saving techniques rival in ingenuity those of the Gothic builders in their resourceful use of light. Clerestory windows admit natural light into private offices. Artificial lighting is shut off by motion detectors when offices are unoccupied. Pendant fixtures eliminate the loss of overhead light into ceiling recesses. Pale wood and painted surfaces magnify ambient light without creating glare. Files are placed near windows.
Two sets of judges have tested the results. Consolidated Edison, which awarded N.R.D.C. a grant to implement these methods, has monitored the offices for three years. Power consumption for lighting has been cut to less than a quarter of the level classified "energy efficient."
But the toughest judges are the people who work there. Not all of them looked forward to becoming Croxton guinea pigs. Some feared having to endure winter chills, summer heat, and eyestrain from peering over dimly lighted desks. They are breathing easier now in more ways than one. The air they inhale is free of formaldehyde and other chemicals that commonly pollute office interiors. And comfort has not been sacrificed to environmental correctness. With their neutral palette of off-white walls and soft green carpets, washed by the natural light that cascades from skylights down a central stairwell, these offices are an urban oasis.
Audubon House expands the oasis to the scale of a small green island. Although the National Audubon Society will occupy only the top five of the building's eight stories, it owns the entire property. This has allowed Mr. Croxton and Ms. Childs to overhaul the building from the ground up. Actually, from below the ground: a central recycling depot in the building's subbasement is the renovation's most imposing feature. With chutes running from the floors above, the system collects and separates four types of refuse, from organic matter (dispatched as compost to a rooftop garden) to paper (some 42 tons will be bundled for recycling each year).
Organic material and paper will also be used to insulate the building. Walls are injected with a thick pink foam based on whipped sea water. Floors are lined with cellulose made from recycled newsprint. It would take a small truckload of unrecycled newsprint to list the building's other features. Yet even a complete inventory could overlook the point of this design. What counts here is the design methodology -- how the parts fit together. This design is about connections: between the gas-fired heating and cooling system and the sun's transit overhead, between the thermal resistance of glass, the moisture content of air, and the height, placement and colors of office partitions.
The unity of this design surpasses the organic architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright because it unifies a far more complex set of parts. Most of those parts are invisible. They consist of information rather than tangible forms. What we will see at Audubon House is one stage in a comprehensive planning process that begins with research into each material used and continues as materials leave the building to be recycled. Mr. Croxton and Ms. Childs carry this kind of thinking to an extreme degree. They not only want to know what materials are made of, and how well they function, but they've also looked into the environmental standards of their suppliers' factories, their impact on local economies, even how they treat their workers.
It's tempting to ridicule an approach that differs so radically from conventional design. Is this architecture, or is it plumbing? Design or economics? Building or evangelism? Mr. Croxton's lighting may relieve headaches, but his puritanical philosophy can bring on a migraine. Who left the lights on? Save the tin foil! It's hard enough to separate the trash. Do we have to analyze it also?
Yet if this is an obsession, it is a magnificent one. And its benefits aren't limited to lower Con Ed bills, cleaner air and a more robust ozone layer. Audubon House also enlarges our conception of history. Some designers boast of the rare woods used in fancy marquetry. Ms. Childs boasts that her wood comes from "nonendangered" sources. Yet she turns humble wood into a precious material by reminding us of its rich history: the people, land, energy, ideas, and time it takes to grow a tree and fashion it into tables or pencils. History, in other words, isn't just a matter of landmark buildings and period styles. It is also a record of the ordinary objects that circulate through daily life.
Mr. Croxton takes the same approach with the building's exterior. The old brick-and-terra-cotta walls will retain the marks of age. Yes, Mr. Croxton is reluctant to commit the energy it would take to remove them -- but also to rub out the history those marks represent. If the walls look the worse for wear, fine. That will make the point that what he advocates is conservation, not restoration.
The result is that many people will walk past Audubon House without realizing that something revolutionary is going on inside. Indeed, if this project is any indication, there's a good chance that as the revolution spreads, few of us will even see it. But we will breathe it.

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
Spring's Air Deals Mean a Crush in Summer

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.; JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., based in the Washington bureau of The Times, covers aviation and transportation.

 BODY:
CLUTCHING their cut-rate tickets and dragging the kids, this summer's vacationers are descending on airports in record-breaking numbers, turning the hubs into hubbubs where an unprepared traveler might get a rude shock at the start of an intended trip to tranquillity.
The result of the half-price fares that the major airlines offered in late May and early June, the crowds are expected to last through mid-September with airlines carrying at least as many people each month as they did in June, when the low fares took effect. In June, air travel suddenly jumped 10 percent compared with last June, with nearly 39 million boardings, according to the Air Transport Association.
When Edward R. Book, president of the Travel Industry Association of America, recently passed through O'Hare Airport in Chicago on a flight from Washington to Phoenix, he found the nation's busiest airport was "wall to wall people." Airport executives say that O'Hare may well handle a record quarter of a million passengers on its busiest day this summer. But for bad weather and flight cancellations, that day probably would have been over the Fourth of July weekend. In the first 12 days of July, American Airlines, which started the summer fare wars and funnels many of its travelers through Chicago, recorded five of the busiest days in its history.
Although the airlines say they aren't making much money with their fire-sale prices, the rest of the travel industry is reaping a bonanza, Mr. Book said. But he and other travel experts cautioned that the traveling public had better be aware of the side effects of the crowding, which has meant spot shortages of rental cars, traffic jams in some national parks and a heightened risk of unpleasant surprises for those who don't leave extra time to catch their planes and make connections.
 
First-Time Fliers
 Adding to the confusion is the fact that many of the families packed cheek by jowl in the tourist cabins of jetliners are flying for the first time and may be unfamiliar with even the simplest airport procedures. Nancy Muller of American Express Travel Related Services said that one of the company's Atlanta offices had questioned every customer ordering plane tickets during the two weeks when the half-price specials were being offered. Thirty percent of them said they had never traveled by air before.
American, like other airlines, has posted extra service representatives around airports to search out the disoriented and speed them toward their departure gates. The airline, in a sign of how little some of its fledgling customers know, also published a sheet of a dozen tips for holiday travelers. "When asked to board the plane, do it!" urges Tip No. 11, pointing out that standby customers will be put into empty seats.
That's good advice, said Ed Perkins of Consumer Reports Travel Letter. "It isn't just get to the airport early," he said. "Make sure you get out to the gate early. And get on the plane when your row boards. Even having a boarding pass is no guarantee that someone else doesn't have the same seat assignment." (The airlines say that this is conceivable, but that in fact it almost never happens.)
Another tip: carry as little baggage on the plane as possible. On many days American's planes are averaging nearly 80 percent full, an extraordinarily high number that means many planes are completely full, with no room for carry-on bags in excess of the two-per-person limit.
And the most obvious tip, but perhaps the most commonly neglected, is to allow oneself plenty of time. Arriving at the airport an hour ahead for a domestic flight is cutting it close on a busy day. With parking lots full and traffic heavy, that hour can vanish quickly, especially for those who must pick up tickets at the airport. It's smarter to get tickets ahead of time, from a travel agent or ticket office, which allows passengers to check luggage at curbside and go directly to the gate.
And don't count on finding a car to rent at the other end. Travel agents and car rental agencies say that there are spot shortages of cars, and that prices may be unusually high for those who don't reserve vehicles long in advance.
"The industry probably is going to be sold out in July and August," said Brian Kennedy, executive vice president of Hertz. In almost every city in the country, rentals are up by double-digit percentages, and in some cities rentals are twice as high as usual, he said. More than a third of the Hertz fleet has been reserved for the rest of the summer, an extraordinarily high percentage given that so many cars are rented not by vacationers but by business travelers who do not reserve long in advance.
Mr. Kennedy said that because of the tight supply, travelers were likely to pay higher prices this summer.
Marilyn Kessler, manager of Belair Travel-Carlson Travel Network in Olney, Md., said that in Orlando, Fla., during the week of Aug. 9 the big rental companies were charging up to $150 a week for economy-size cars, while smaller companies off the airport premises would charge as little as $75. Florida's rates are lower than those in other states, she noted.
"If you are planning to rent a car, do it as soon as possible," she said.
Then brace yourself for a traffic jam, especially if your trip is taking you to one of the popular national parks, like Yosemite, Yellowstone or the Grand Canyon.
 
Logjams at National Parks
 The number of visitors to the Grand Canyon is up 35 percent over this time last summer, according to George Berklacy, a spokesman for the National Park Service. He expects the rate to continue, which would mean as many as 900,000 more visitors this summer than last. At the more popular parks, it is too late to reserve a campground or lodging within the park, though accommodations may still be available not far from the park's gates, he said.
Back-country campers won't have problems with crowds in the wide open spaces, of course. But the vast majority of visitors stay firmly on the beaten track -- the paved roads that wind through scenic vistas like those in the central valley of Yosemite, or the Skyline Drive in the Shenandoah.
"If you can time your arrival in the park to sunrise, you're in good shape," he said. "But if you get there after lunch, you are in serious trouble at Yosemite. It is like a commuter run into any large city, a virtual parking lot."
Mr. Berklacy said many visitors to the most famous parks were unaware of alternatives that lie a short distance from the logjams.
"At Mount Rushmore, over the years, we have had to close down the parking lots over 50 times in the summer months," he said. "Yet 10 miles north of Rushmore is the Wind Cave National Park. Outside of Yellowstone, this offers more abundant wildlife than any other national park.
"It is a magnificent, scenic park, with a very adventurous cave, yet we find that less than 10 percent of the people who go to Rushmore make that half-hour drive," he said.
Similarly, travelers interested in seeing the Grand Canyon might be best advised to visit the north rim rather than the hectic south rim.
As in any summer, it's too late now to get lodgings in the biggest national parks. But hotels are still available not far away. Indeed, the best news for travelers is that hotels are still not bursting at the seams. In fact, hotels are heavily promoting package deals to draw tourists who may have already bought plane tickets but not made room reservations.
Many travel agents were so busy during the airplane ticketing boom at the start of the summer that they did not make room reservations for their clients. In some cases, now that things are quieter, agents are calling their customers back to see if they need hotel rooms.
Randy Smith, whose Smith Travel Research tracks the hotel industry and publishes Lodging Outlook, said that demand for hotel rooms was up about 4 or 5 percent this summer, but not enough to wipe out the bargains, especially for travelers who made reservations.

HEADLINE: Perspectives: Regional Planning;
A New Chief, With an Rx in the Wings

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
REGIONAL planners must think globally these days. H. Claude Shostal, the new president of the Regional Plan Association, is in the mold.
"For the first time people are beginning to question whether this region is going to manage competitively on a global scale," said Mr. Shostal, a 52-year-old alumnus of Nelson A. Rockefeller's gubernatorial administration who has worked on development issues in and out of government. "They are beginning to question whether we'll lose out to Paris or Tokyo or some other region." 
 Mr. Shostal who took over as president from Richard Anderson in June, comes to the Regional Plan Association as it reached the halfway point in the preparation of its third Regional Plan. The first was completed in 1929. The second came in 1968.
The influence of the global factor on the third plan was underscored just last week by Robert D. Yaro, executive director of the Regional Plan Association, on his return from a trip with other urban professionals to Tokyo. He came back with a fresh appreciation of the regional transportation network that serves Tokyo. And that in turn called attention to a major component of the third plan, its call for an integrated regional transportation network for the metropolitan area.
The planners give it a name -- Regional Express Rail, or Rx -- and if it came to life as they propose, the course of office leasing and development and investment in the metropolitan area could be profoundly affected. As an example, the downtown Mahattan office market would get a considerable lift, because executives living in Westchester would be able to travel there directly by train, without changing trains.
Indeed, the success of the Regional Plan Association in nudging the great transportation bureaucracies and the state legislatures of the metropolitan area toward greater integration may the the test by which the plan's contribution is some day measured. The institutions are the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and its operating components in New York State and Connecticut; the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and New Jersey Transit, the state agency that runs New Jersey's buses and trains.
"Berlin has a single regional transportation system," Mr. Yaro said. "Paris has a system, a joint venture with the French National Railways. Tokyo does a much better job than we do." Tokyo and surrounding areas have three closely integrated systems running buses, subways and regional rail lines.
As matters stand in the New York metropolitan area, said Mr. Yaro, it's too hard to get from Long Island to Westchester, from Connecticut to New Jersey, from Westchester and Long Island to lower Manhattan.
HE tempts the layman to hope, for example, that Harlem Line trains may be run on city subway tracks, connecting lower Manhattan directly with the Hudson Valley via the Hellgate Bridge and the Sunnyside Yards in Queens, with no change in train. And that Hudson Division cars may run into Penn Station on Amtrack tracks.
A commuter should be able to get on a Harlem Line train in Scarsdale, for example, and ride to Wall Street in about 45 minutes without changing trains. Another commuter should be able to board the Hudson Line in Tarrytown and make the same trip in about the same length of time.
The possibilities involve many interregional trips that have destinations outside Manhattan. The traveler should be able to board at Tarrytown and ride to Freeport, L.I. Or board at Stamford, Conn., and ride to Princeton, N.J.
These and other similar trips would mean that the trains of one metropolitan-area transportation agency would have to run on tracks controlled by another, which so far is done only in a limited way.
The central hub of this integrated system would be Penn Station in Manhattan. It would need a major improvement, or possibly an annex. Another important investment would be a link between the Sunnyside Yard and the never-opened upper level of the 63d Street subway tunnel, allowing commuter trains to find their way on to city subway tracks.
The association's senior transportation planner is Jeffrey Zupan, who left the Regional Plan Association in 1981 to become senior planner for New Jersey Transit. He returned to the association last year.
Senior planners from the association have already met with their planning counterparts at the M.T.A., the Port Authority and New Jersey Transit. Mr. Yaro describes them as "intrigued and interested" in the planners' ideas.
The problems in implementation are essentially governmental and political, according to Mr. Yaro. Financial investment is required. The M.T.A. already has a huge capital investment program under way, and is having trouble getting it implemented in the Legislature even new investment for the Regional Express Sysem.
Commuter transportation planning is only one element in the third plan. There will also be a section on bringing more immigrants and inner-city minorities into the workforce, for example, and on waste management and freight movement. There will be a proposal for a "highlands greenbelt" that would amount to a boundary for urban growth and protect the water supply.
A FAMILIAR theme in regional planning, sounded once more in the third regional plan, will be that development should be concentrated near mass transportation hubs. "We assume there will be decentralization but we want development around the transportation network," said Mr. Yaro.
Violations of the principle are not hard to find in the metropolitan region. In and around Princeton, N.J., development is occurring along Route 1 instead of along the rail corridor that parallels Route 1. West Windsor Township was mistaken, Mr. Yaro suggested, in using its zoning power to exclude office development in the vicinity of the Princeton Junction railroad station. Similarly, South Brunswick Township has been mistaken in resisting proposals for office development in the vicinity of a station that is to be built, he said.
On immigrants and inner-city minorities, the association sees its task as defining the dimension of the problem and seeking answers almost on a neighborhood by neighborhood basis. It should be possible to develop or expand institutions that link employers with the community groups that are close to immigrants and minority populations, Mr. Yaro said.
On waste management, the advice will be to go slow on big new resource recovery facilties and work instead to reduce the creation of waste.
OVER ALL, the approach of the third plan contrasts interestingly with those of the first and second, which were addressed to a younger region more concerned with implementing growth than protecting the region competitively.
The 1929 plan dealt mainly with growth. It spoke of long-range plans for highways, bridges, tunnels, parks and open space, and where to put them. It opted for a tunnel to Brooklyn from the tip of lower Manhattan rather than a bridge, and won the point.
The 1968 plan is remembered largely for its emphasis on the need to nurture the growth of employment subcenters throughout the region and to revitalize the central cities. The growth of corporate centers in Stamford, White Plains, New Brunswick and downtown Brooklyn are considered expressions of that idea.
In the 90's the emphasis is on the need to improve the basic structure of regional life, thereby helping it to compete both internationally and with other regions for economic growth. To Mr. Shostal, the new president, it is no disaster if Merrill Lynch moves some of its facilities from Manhattan to Jersey City, or Bankers Trust shifts some operations to Hoboken.
"We're all in this together," he said.

HEADLINE: Divorce Logjam Leads to Alternatives

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
THE increasing number of divorce cases filed in recent years has created a severe backlog in many of the state's family courts despite concerted efforts by court officials to ease the problem.
In some counties, divorce lawyers say, the wait for a trial in a contested divorce can last up to four years, resulting in personal and economic strains on the parties. Psychologists say that such protracted divorce proceedings often adversely affect the court's ability to make accurate decisions on the issues of child custody and visiting rights. 
 And while officials are attempting to address the backlog by assigning more judges to the family courts and by creating divorce mediation panels in every county, some lawyers say that more radical changes are necessary if the divorce caseload is to be reduced to manageable proportions.
As a result, an increasing number of lawyers seem to be taking matters into their own hands by asking other lawyers to serve as what one called "rent-a-judges" and act as arbiters of their pending cases.
 
'The System Has Stalled'
 "We are suffering from a crushing backlog in the matrimonial courts," said James P. Yudes, a Springfield divorce lawyer. "The system has stalled."
Alice Stockton, the assistant director of the Family Division of the Administrative Office of the Courts, said that from July 1987 to June 1991 the total number of divorce cases filed in the state's courts rose 41 percent -- to 49,226 from 34,938. And as the number of filings rose, Ms. Stockton said, so too has the backlog in the busier counties.
"There are probably a million reasons why some counties have backlogs," Ms. Stockton said. "Some might have a high volume of very complicated cases. Others simply don't have enough judges. Unfortunately, there are just too many people getting divorced."
Yet another reason for the backlog, Ms. Stockton said, is the fact that judges in the Family Part of the State Superior Court have jurisdiction over 13 different types of cases, including juvenile delinquency, termination of parental rights, child abuse and domestic violence.
 
Judges Must Divide Attention
 Consequently, the judges must divide their attention between the typical divorce cases and the more pressing cases in which someone's health or safety may be in danger.
During the 1991 court year, for example, there were 36,054 domestic violence cases filed statewide, a 35 percent increase over 1987. Such complaints are heard almost immediately in every county, resulting in backlogs of other types of cases, particularly divorce.
In some counties, the backlogs cause in huge delays between the times when the divorce complaints are filed and when they are finally scheduled for trial.
"Bergen County has a four-year wait," said Mr. Yudes, who has been practicing matrimonial law since 1975. Other counties with substantial backlogs include Essex, Middlesex, Morris, Passaic and Somerset.
Such delays, Mr. Yudes said, can contribute to increased frustration, anger and even violence between the parties.
"In abuse cases, part of the husband's violence is tied to the frustration with how long it takes to get through the system," Mr. Yudes said. Some women, he said, will settle for less than they might be entitled to just to get out of the marriage.
"They say, 'Cut me a cheap deal, give him what he wants, and let me get out of this before he kills me,' " Mr. Yudes said. As a result, he said, "the timing in the system becomes a bludgeoning tool."
 
Custodial Parent's Advantage
 Other effects of the backlog were described by Dr. Richard A. Gardner, an Englewood psychiatrist who is considered a national expert on child custody issues in divorce cases.
"Time is on the side of the custodial parent whether that parent has a justified position or not," said Dr. Gardner, who is also a clinical professor of child psychiatry at the Columbia University Medical School. The longer a custody battle goes on, he said, the more likely it is that the court will award custody to the parent with whom the child is living.
"Even if that parent is the less desirable one, the child will become more bonded and won't want to change," he said. As a result, he said, "the court will be less willing to order a change."
Protracted divorces can have other effects as well, he said. "The longer the case takes, the more money people spend on their lawyers," Dr. Gardner said. "It's an abomination and a legal form of exploitation of the public."
 
Mediation Panels Established
 Over the last few years, the State Supreme Court and court officials have attempted to address the backlog by assigning additional judges to the Family Part in some counties and by establishing divorce mediation panels in every county.
"We still have a lot of big backlogs, but we're starting to make inroads," said Judge Robert W. Page of the State Superior Court, who is presiding judge of the Family Part in Camden County.
The scope of the problem became evident, Judge Page said, with the issuance of a survey of the state's family courts in 1989. The report, known as the Pathfinders Report, was compiled by a State Supreme Court committee headed by Judge Page.
"It's been four years now, and we're seeing some improvement," Judge Page said.
Part of the improvement, he said, is attributable to the increased use of early settlement panels in each of the state's 21 counties. The panels, which are staffed by experienced, volunteer matrimonial lawyers, attempt to resolve disputed economic issues in contested divorce cases at no charge to the parties.
 
'Day in Court' Still Available
 "We look at it as a complement to the court system, not as an alternative," Judge Page said. "The parties will always have their day in court if they want it."
The early settlement panel program is administered by the New Jersey Bar Association, working in conjunction with officials in each county. In Hudson County, for instance, 16 volunteer lawyers meet in teams of two several times a month to mediate contested divorce cases.
"The way I look at it is if we settle one case, that's one less case that clogs the court docket," said Maureen P. Sogluizzo, a Rutherford matrimonial lawyer who serves on the Hudson County panel.
And while the majority of the cases that come before the early settlement panel ultimately end up back in court, most lawyers agree that the process is valuable because it helps define the issues and gives participants a sense of the reasonableness of their positions.
"It can be used as a barometer to give clients an idea of how a judge might rule," Ms. Sogluizzo said. "And if it doesn't prolong people's agony or make them incur any additional attorney fees, then we've done them a service."
Some lawyers, however, say that while the early settlement panels might be effective in some cases, they are not really useful in the hotly contested cases that are most responsible for the backlog.
"What's happening now," Mr. Yudes said, "is that matrimonial lawyers themselves are beginning to look for alternative ways to get their clients through the system more efficiently. What we're doing is using each other as blue-ribbon panelists to arbitrate our cases. Sometimes, we're even using each other as rent-a-judges to hear each other's cases."
 
Arbitration for Colleagues
 Typically, he said, fellow matrimonial lawyers will arbitrate a colleague's case free, knowing that they will be extended the same courtesy when the circumstances are reversed.
"It's good for the lawyers, and it's good for the clients," Mr. Yudes said.
In fact, the "rent-a-judge" concept seems so promising to several matrimonial lawyers that they have pooled their resources and formed a company to provide private divorce arbitration services for a fee.
"The feedback from attorneys has been tremendous," said William Laufer, a lawyer who is a principal of the New Jersey Divorce and Family Arbitration Institute, a Morristown-based company.
Mr. Laufer's company provides divorce lawyers with a list of 10 qualified matrimonial arbitrators to choose from, he said. The arbitrators are paid for by the parties at rates generally similar to what they pay their own lawyers.
The major advantage to such a system as opposed to the early settlement panels, Mr. Laufer said, is that while the panels simply mediate a dispute -- hoping to get the parties to agree -- an arbitrator makes a ruling that the parties stipulate beforehand will be binding.
In the long run, Mr. Laufer said, paying a private arbitrator would be less expensive than taking a case to trial because of the manner in which most divorce trials are now conducted.
 
'Calendar Calls'
 In most counties, he said, when a case is nearing trial there are "calendar calls" when both parties, their lawyers and their witnesses must be at the courthouse ready for trial. More often than not, however, the case is not reached on that day and everyone must return on another date. The lawyers and expert witnesses, however, still get paid for being in court.
Once a case actually gets to trial, Mr. Laufer said, the expenses continue to mount.
"You try the case for a day and then have to come back a month later for another day," he said, adding that at the subsequent hearing, issues dealt with at the previous hearing are typically revisited. "It can take you six months to try a simple divorce case," he said.
One of Mr. Laufer's clients offered firsthand testimony of such frustrations.
"I filed for divorce in December of 1989, and I'm still not divorced yet," said Christine Corigliano of Watchung.
"You want to get the divorce over with so you can start a new life," she said. "But you can't do anything during this time. It's unfair to everyone."
Ms. Corigliano said her divorce trial started in April of this year. "We had two days in April, three days in June, and now we have two days scheduled in August," she said. "It will probably take another year to finish this. And the only ones who win are the lawyers."

THE ECONOMY
 
A Fed Chairman in Search of His Economic Leviathan 

When Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, addressed the Senate Banking Committee last week, he sounded like an economic Ahab, searching for the recovery, his Moby Dick. The economy is still struggling against a "head wind," Mr. Greenspan said. "Today its speed is decidedly less, but still appreciable." He said the Fed, which has cut short-term rates to their lowest levels in 29 years, is contemplating easing the ratio of capital to assets that banks are required to meet as a way to spur lending. But robust economic growth continues to elude the chairman. Senators listening to his testimony turned testy: "I speak to people across the country, and you're about the most optimistic person I've talked to," said Donald W. Riegle, Democrat of Michigan. The Fed-watcher Allan Meltzer, professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon University, said, "For these head winds, monetary policy cannot do much."

Finally, Perot Gets Specific
 
Before dropping out of the Presidential race, Ross Perot was criticized for not releasing an economic plan. Now he's being criticized for having a plan but not being in the race. The 50-page plan, which surfaced last week, would have reduced the budget deficit by phasing in a 50-cents-a-gallon gasoline tax, slowing increases in Social Security benefits, raising taxes on the wealthy and cutting the military. The Perot plan proposed a bullish-on-business five-year moratorium on taxes for startup businesses and a permanent research and development tax credit. Economists praised it for pro-growth business savvy while politicians argued the plan had no political pull. "Each piece of this plan would probably be rejected by a large majority of the voters," said Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic poll taker.

A Recession in Triplicate?
 
Economists have been worrying lately that the nation could soon fall into a "triple dip" recession. Last week, the Commerce Department allayed those fears when it said sales of durable goods jumped 2.3 percent in June.

A Tax to Reflect Tuxedo Reality
 
Who says Congress is out of touch with the little people? Last week the House Ways and Means Committee took time to make 17 changes in the tax code. Those changes, which were sent on to the Senate, include a change in the depreciation law: Tuxedo rental stores will now be able to depreciate their fancy duds in three years instead of five. Why the alteration? A study by the Treasury Department showed that tuxedos don't last five years. Another measure nullifies the 11 percent tax hunters pay to have their cartridges reloaded. The measures would dispense $364 million in tax breaks to the little guy.

Caution From the White House
 
When it comes to the economy, President Bush has few fans: Only 18 percent of the people polled in the latest New York Times/ CBS News Poll approve of the way he's handling the economy. That poor showing could have tempted the White House into making its mid-year economic forecast a little rosier. But no one accused Michael Boskin, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, of giving in to temptation. Last week he said the economy would perk up, growing at a 2.7 percent rate in the fourth quarter with unemployment falling to 6.9 percent. "The forecast seems reasonable," said Richard D. Rippe, an economist at Prudential Securities.

Congress Reregulates Cable
 
Back in the heyday of Reaganomics, the cable television industry was deregulated. But without competition, all that happened was that the nation's 11,000 cable systems raised their prices at triple the rate of inflation. Last week, the House overwhelmingly voted to re-regulate cable. The measure requires the Federal Communications Commission to establish a rate structure for basic cable service. It requires basic service to include the broadcast networks, Fox, PBS and any independent, over-the-air broadcast stations in the area as well as public, educational and government-access cable stations. The Bush Administration favored a less-stringent competing bill.

A Shadow Over Blue Cross
 
The nation's 73 Blue Cross and Blue Shield health plans insure 63 million people. But recently regulators have warned that some of the plans have been engaging in questionable business practices, like destroying unpaid claims. Last week, a Senate committee headed by Sam Nunn, Democrat of Georgia, warned that at least 20 plans are in financial trouble. The National Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association acknowledged the problems. Fifteen plans "are being monitored because they don't meet our standards for financial reserves," said Bernard R. Tresnowski, the association's president.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
Huffing Up the Dollar
 
To prevent the dollar from slipping further -- it hit an all-time low against the German mark on Monday -- at least 13 central banks bought greenbacks last week. The dollar dropped because of "weak U.S. economic data, widening interest rate spreads between the U.S. and Germany and tight monetary policy in Germany versus a loose policy here," said Richard Honeck, a currency trader at Chase Private Banking in New York. It strengthened at the end of the week, closing at 1.504 marks. Though the world's central banks huffed and puffed, they only managed to ante up about $300 million to buy dollars, hardly a dent in a market that can trade $800 billion a day. "The dollar strengthened partly due to the jump in durable goods orders," Mr. Honeck said, "and because market participants just decided to go with the dollar."
 
Kevin Maxwell's Maxi-Fines
 
Robert Maxwell, the British media baron who died at sea in November, left his sons, Ian and Kevin, a portfolio of bankrupt companies complete with looted pension funds and debts far exceeding their assets. Last week, a British court ordered Kevin Maxwell to pay more than $778 million in fines for breaching his fiduciary duties as a director of an investment management fund that was the trustee of the Maxwell companies' employee pension funds. Kevin Maxwell, who was not present in court, said in a statement: "Had I the resources, I would have strenuously denied all allegations of breach of duty."

USAir Going British
 
British Airways said it would invest $750 million for a 44 percent stake in the USAir Group. The deal will create the world's largest airline partnership. Although the Transportation Department has opposed large-scale foreign investment in domestic airlines in the past -- it blocked KLM's proposed $400 million investment in Northwest Airlines three years ago -- it is thought to be favorably disposed to this deal. "The world's airline industry is clearly moving in the direction of cross-border alliances," said Transportation Secretary Andrew H. Card Jr. More international linkups are expected.

 
 
COMPANIES

 
G.E. Pays the Price -- Again
 
The General Electric Company was punished twice for conspiring with an Israeli general to defraud the American Government out of $26.5 million. The first time was a slap on the wrist from the Defense Department: G.E. was forbidden to do business with the Pentagon for five days. But last week, at a hearing in the United States District Court in Cincinnati, G.E. was fined $9.5 million to settle criminal charges, and $59.5 million to settle civil charges. G.E. was accused by Chester L. Walsh, a former G.E. employee, of billing the Government for fictitious parts and testing equipment sent to Israel. Under the provisions of a Federal law, Mr. Walsh may be entitled to up to 25 percent of the money recovered from G.E.

Intel Can Afford to Be Late
 
The Intel Corporation, whose chips dominate the market, is known for nifty designs and a fiercely competitive spirit. But last week it announced it would have to delay the release of its latest chip, dubbed P-5, the powerful successor to Intel's 486. The P-5, which was to be released this fall, won't come out until 1993. But even with this sluggish start, analysts are not worried. The P5 "will be the dominant player shortly after it begins shipping," said Michael Slater, of Microprocessor Report, an industry newsletter.

The Payoff for Compaq
 
The 42.9 percent increase in earnings at the Compaq Computer Corporation certainly suggests its new strategy is paying off. For a year, Compaq has been cutting costs and chopping prices. It earned $29 million in the quarter ended June 30, up from $20.3 million the year before. Sales were $827 million for the quarter. "They were making a bet-the-company change in strategy when they went to these real low-end products," said Rick Martin, a computer analyst at the Chicago Corporation. "It really looks like it is working well."

Playing Catch-Up at Boeing
 
When United Airlines decided to lease 50 Airbus A-320's and take an option on leasing 50 more last month in a deal worth about $3 billion, it sent the Boeing Airplane Company back to the drawing board. Last week Boeing said it was doing research to see if its venerable 737 -- a short- to medium-range jetliner -- could be reconfigured to give it range and speed equal to the A-320's. If Boeing can do that, it "could blunt United's willingness to exercise the option on the other 50 Airbuses," said Bill Whitlow, an analyst with Pacific Crest Securities in Seattle.

A Deal Proves Itself
 
Last year, the deal-making mavens at the BankAmerica Corporation promised big benefits from the acquisition of the Security Pacific Corporation. They said the $4 billion deal would produce major economies of scale and more marketing muscle. Last week they delivered the goods. BankAmerica earned $240 million. Without the non-recurring expenses stemming from the merger, it would have earned $421 million. "This is just a starting point, but it was a terrific quarter," said Ronald L. Mandel, a financial analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein in New York.

A Good Match for Spider Man
 
Even a child could understand the synergies of this merger. Last week, Marvel Entertainment Group Inc., publisher of soft-cover epics like the "Spider Man" and "Captain America" comic books -- said it planned to acquire the Fleer Corporation, which makes sports trading cards, in a deal valued at $265 million.
 
Another Challenge to Halcion
 
Earlier in the month, the Federal Food and Drug Administration said that the Upjohn Company's Halcion, the largest-selling prescription pill in the world, was safe to use. Last week, a consumer group, Public Citizen, challenged that decision in a petition to the F.D.A. The petition said Halcion was associated with dangerous side effects. Upjohn disputed those claims.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Hong Kong, Star of 1992, Begins to Dim

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
The world's major economic powers showed they could act together, for one day at least. And the world's stock markets showed they too could move in the same direction. They went down.
The carnage around the world last week was somewhat obscured in this country by the fact that Wall Street did relatively well. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 45.93 points, or 1.4 percent, to 3,285.71. Intervention by the world's central banks to support the dollar seemed to ease concerns over American stocks, but did not help shares in the rest of the world, where fears of slow economies combined with a host of local factors, not to mention the possibility of bombs over Baghdad, to produce selloffs. 
 Even Hong Kong went down, with the Hang Seng index losing 5.8 percent, its worst week since the fall of 1990. But it still is up 34 percent in 1992, and remains this year's craze among foreign investors, who now own about half the shares available for trading.
The news in Hong Kong that has justified that kind of performance has been the pending takeover, in 1997, of Hong Kong by China. To hear Hong Kong bulls tell it, what really is going to happen is the reverse, as Hong Kong's economic system takes over China, producing a wave of prosperity and a boom in consumer spending. "The potential growth of just changing China from an inefficient economy to an efficient one is staggering," says Victoria Goodwin, a Hong Kong watcher for James Capel Inc., the British firm.
Just three years ago, the prospect of a takeover of Hong Kong by the regime that brought the world Tiananmen Square was viewed as a reason to panic. But now investors are confident that, however repressive the politics, the movement to economic reform is irreversible. And Hong Kong is seen as the way to play China.
So what can go wrong? A significant part of China's growth comes from its rising trade with this country. The American trade deficit with China, at $5.7 billion for the first five months of 1992, is now larger than with any other country except Japan. And while the Japanese figure is up 15 percent this year, China's has soared 60 percent.
President Bush has been China's best friend in Washington, staving off Congressional efforts to mess with most-favored-nation trade status, and the House vote to tie trade to human rights issues will not change the situation. But what about Bill Clinton? "It's an issue where Clinton could be protectionist and wear a white hat at the same time," said David Shulman, the chief equity strategist for Salomon Brothers. "This could be a very big negative for the Hong Kong market," he said, adding that it also could hurt American companies that buy Chinese exports, ranging from Tyco and Toys "R" Us to Liz Claiborne and the Limited.
Occidentals have a way of applying straight-line forecasting to China, assuming that whatever trend is in place will continue forever. It won't, of course. Hong Kong stocks may have seen their highs for this year.

HEADLINE: A Coal-Burning Utility That's Trying to Paint Itself Green

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: CUMBERLAND, Ohio

 BODY:
Scimitar-horned oryxes browse amid the grass and wildflowers of the valley, as their ancestors have for millennia on the African savannah. But this is not Africa, it is eastern Ohio. And the oryxes are here not in their natural niche in the food chain -- eating foliage and falling prey to predators -- but in another role. They are helping to make coal look green.
The oryxes, a type of antelope, along with Hartmann's mountain zebras and other rare species graze on a reclaimed strip mine donated by the American Electric Power Company. They will soon be joined by elephants, rhinos and snow leopards, and the company proudly notes that at 9,200 acres the wild-animal preserve is the largest in North America. 
 More than perhaps any other North American utility, A.E.P. needs to show an environmental conscience. Of the one billion tons of coal that will be used in the United States this year, A.E.P. will use 45 million, more than anyone else, to serve seven million people in seven states from Virginia to Michigan. In this age of concern over acid rain and global warming, a coal-burning utility is a bit like a butcher shop in a village where the new religion is vegetarianism.
True, A.E.P. is refining a generation and transmission system that is already very modern and efficient, and plans to spend well over $1 billion to comply with the Clean Air Act amendments of 1990, primarily for control of emissions believed to cause acid rain. But it is looking ahead with dread to the debate over the greenhouse effect. Many scientists say carbon dioxide emissions, which are larger from coal than from other fuels, could bring catastrophic changes in weather.
Bruised by the Clean Air Act amendments, which imposed strict limits on sulfur dioxide emissions, and horrified at the idea of a tax on carbon dioxide emissions, like that proposed at the recent Earth Summit, A.E.P. is trying to demonstrate that it is an environmental good guy even if it does rely on coal for 89 percent of its fuel.
Not only is the Columbus-based company emphasizing to shareholders and customers a 40-year program of land reclamation and tree planting at old mines like the one here; it is also on the cutting edge of cleaner ways to burn coal, as evidenced by an experimental plant in Brilliant, Ohio, and better ways to use electricity, like an energy-efficient bulb.
Environmentalists praise many of these activities, but say A.E.P. has only dabbled in encouraging customers to use energy more efficiently through products like the bulb. While it has pilot programs for many kinds of efficiency improvements, utilities in New York, New England and California are spending heavily on large-scale efforts to promote efficient lighting, motors and refrigerators.
FOR years A.E.P. executives assumed that geology was destiny. With its service area astride the heart of the continent's coal fields, the company has become so attached to coal that it not only burns it but also mines and transports it. Its rates are low, about 6 cents a kilowatt-hour, and the supply is reliable.
But concerns about the greenhouse effect make the company wonder about its future. "Clearly, coal is following nuclear as being unacceptable to the public," said Dale E. Heydlauff, the vice president for environmental affairs, a post created by A.E.P.'s board last year. "It scares me as someone fairly young in the management of this company, trying to figure out what will be environmentally acceptable in the next decade."
The question faces the whole industry, because the United States has about 30 percent of the world's coal. And coal comprises the vast majority of the country's fossil fuel resources, and about 60 percent of utilities' fuel.
It is not clear what fuel A.E.P. could use instead. Nine percent of its power is from a nuclear plant, and it recently named E. Linn Draper Jr., who has a Ph.D. in nuclear engineering, as its president. But he said in a company newsletter, "Let me assure you that I do not have a set of reactor designs in my back pocket."
Two percent of A.E.P.'s supply is hydroelectricity, for which expansion prospects are limited. Executives say solar power is simply not feasible here. There is not enough wind to make much of a dent. Burning corncobs would work, one executive calculated, if A.E.P. planted land equivalent to three-quarters of Ohio in corn. Natural gas is a possibility, but like most of the industry, A.E.P. is reluctant to bet on the future price.
Meanwhile, A.E.P. has only a toe in the water in the most widely used strategy, increasing efficiency.
If not conservation or other fuel sources, how else can A.E.P. show its environmental commitment?
Enter the oryx and other image-enhancing programs, a kind of corporate verdification. The company recently won a patent on a mixture of water and coal ash (currently sent to landfills) that can be pumped like a liquid into street excavations, and hardens in a few hours.
THE reclaimed strip mine that is the oryxes' new home was donated by the utility in 1986, to a group called the International Center for the Preservation of Wild Animals. There are successes already: while fewer than 400 Cuvier's gazelles exist wild in their native north Africa, two were born here in early July.
Other reclaimed land has been set aside by the company as campgrounds and for fishing and boating.
The heart of the company's effort, however, is in technological advances toward more efficient generation and consumption. The company recently gained wide attention for financing the development of an improved compact fluorescent light bulb, called the electronic lamp, that illuminates with one-fourth the electricity of a conventional bulb. Unlike existing compact fluorescents, the "e-lamp" comes on quickly and without flicker; it lasts 20,000 hours, compared with 10,000 for existing fluorescents and 750 to 1,000 for standard bulbs. Smaller than existing compact fluorescents, the bulb will fit in many more fixtures.
The progress in the lamp had been widely anticipated. But the sponsorship was a shock, because A.E.P. has always been regarded as an extremely conservative organization. Pierre Villere, who is commercializing the e-lamp, said hundreds of potential investors had turned him down.
FINANCING the bulb would have been adventuresome for most utilities, but was a real departure for A.E.P.; the company's critics say that for years its environmental attitudes were more than simply conservative. "Neanderthal," said Jan Beyea, senior scientist at the National Audubon Society, recalling A.E.P.'s powerful lobbying against the Clean Air Act. "It's wonderful that they're doing this," he said of the e-lamp. "The shift has blown everybody over."
The e-lamp investment, at $6.5 million, is a symbolic act for a company with a market capitalization of $10.5 billion, revenues last year of $5.046 billion and net income of $497.9 million. "It's going to be years before it has a bottom-line impact that I care about," said Sanford M. Cohen, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, with considerable understatement.
The lamp is a departure for another reason: it represents a philosophy to which the company does not fully subscribe. In New York and California, utilities subsidize high-efficiency bulbs because if customers use less power, the utilities will burn less fuel and cause less pollution.
But A.E.P.'s chairman and chief executive, Richard E. Disbrow, doubts that light bulbs, motors and air-conditioners that use less power are any substitute for new power plants. And besides, he said in an interview, "the leading advocates of demand-side management are companies that are short of generation." His company has a growing surplus of power, because its neighbors have built plants and its customers are suffering from recession, so additional kilowatt-hours cost very little.
Instead of demand-side management, Dr. Draper, the president, stressed the efficiency with which the company generates electricity. A.E.P. uses less fuel to produce a kilowatt-hour than any utility in the country but one, Commonwealth Edison, which serves the Chicago area, because its plants are well designed and well maintained. Its transmission system is also highly efficient. The amount of power lost in transmission generally declines as voltage rises, and A.E.P. was the first to introduce 765-kilovolt transmission lines, the highest-voltage lines now in use in this country. Realizing that moving electricity is often easier than moving coal, A.E.P. years ago began putting its plants near its mines.
As for pollution, Mr. Disbrow insisted that the greenhouse theory has not been demonstrated to the point where use of coal should be limited.
But there is no blueprint for convincing Washington of that. There is also no clear alternative. "What do you do if you're sitting on 250 years of coal?" said Mr. Heydlauff. "If you look at our options, they are extremely limited."
 
 
FINDING A CLEANER WAY TO BURN
BRILLIANT, Ohio
Most power plants burn coal by pulverizing it and blowing it into a boiler, where it is burned to generate steam.
But here on the banks of the Ohio River, engineers have ripped the guts out of a 46-year-old generating station to install an entirely different system, called pressurized fluidized bed combustion. The initial results show that the process is so clean and efficient that American Electric Power executives hope the technology will dominate the market for new coal plants.
The plant, called Tidd, was retired in 1976 because it could not meet rising environmental standards. Engineers disconnected the old boiler and grafted on a smaller one in which coal is burned in a bed of limestone and ash; the process is called "fluidized" because the mixture bubbles like a fluid. The limestone absorbs more than 90 percent of the sulfur during combustion, and the operating temperature of 1,500 degrees is too low to allow much nitrogen oxide to form.
Running through the bed are tubes filled with water. That water boils into steam, which is used to make electricity. Because the heat is transferred to the steam tubes by a solid, the fluidized bed, not a gas, heat transfer is enhanced and efficiency raised. Boiler exhaust drives another turbine to make more electricity.
A quantity of coal that would make less than 37 kilowatt-hours of electricity in a conventional scrubber-equipped pulverized-coal plant makes more than 40 kilowatt-hours here, and carbon dioxide emissions from the pressurized fluidized bed plant total 1.89 pounds instead of 2.12 pounds, per kilowatt-hour. With a refined design, engineers think they can get 10 percent more kilowatt-hours out of the coal, and cut another pound of carbon dioxide per kilowatt-hour. Even before considering the greenhouse effect, the reductions in fuel and sulfur dioxide would make the system attractive, especially because construction costs may be lower than for a conventional plant.
But the carbon dioxide output is still worse than that in oil- or natural gas-fired power production, making pressurized fluidized bed, like everything else in the coal world, contingent on the greenhouse debate.

Now Mr. Jenrette Can Get Some Sleep

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

 BODY:
When Richard H. Jenrette set out 19 months ago to take the Equitable Life Assurance Society public in the largest conversion ever of a mutual insurer, he knew a tough selling job awaited him. He had no idea how tough.
As the economy faltered, investors grew increasingly skittish about commercial real estate, a concern fueled by the widely publicized woes of Olympia & York. With much of Equitable's portfolio in real estate, Mr. Jenrette, the insurer's chairman since 1987, found himself waking many mornings at 3, churning over how to make the deal happen. 
 "I never doubted it would get done," he said last week. "But there were some sleepless nights."
He's resting easier now after investors turned out July 16 for the $9-a-share offering of 43.5 million shares. Demand for the stock sparked an additional offering of 6.5 million shares, and Equitable finalized on Wednesday its so-called de-mutualization, raising $450 million.
The 63-year-old Mr. Jenrette said he is also happy to have his voice back. He had lost it at the end of a five-week, 28-city road show throughout the United States and abroad, trying to convince institutions that the New York-based insurer had no exposure to the "daily recitation" of Olympia & York's troubles, and that the Equitable was in fact growing out of its own real estate problems.
To break the tension, Joseph J. Melone, Equitable's president, once pulled alongside Mr. Jenrette's limousine, rolled down the window of his own limousine and asked, "Can you pass the Grey Poupon?"
Many analysts considered Mr. Jenrette a key player in making the deal work. As a founding partner of the Wall Street firm of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette -- which the Equitable bought in 1985 -- he spoke investors' language, and was seen as someone who could scrape away the Equitable's baked-in troubles.
"He comes across as a very effective salesman and an outsider who was able to acknowledge that mistakes had been made," said James Ramenda of Northington Partners, a research and investment banking firm in Avon, Conn., that specializes in insurance.
For Mr. Jenrette, the Equitable conversion marks the second history-making deal he has helped shepherd. In 1970, DLJ became the first American securities firm to go public, a move that forced the New York Stock Exchange to end its prohibition against public ownership of member firms.

Taking Over at America West

BYLINE: By DANIEL F. CUFF

 BODY:
"These things are never easy," said Michael J. Conway, talking of the resignation of Edward R. Beauvais, the chairman and co-founder of America West Airlines.
Mr. Conway, 47 years old, who is president and chief executive of the airline, has taken over the post vacated by Mr. Beauvais, 55, a little more than a week ago. The Phoenix-based carrier entered Chapter 11 proceedings 13 months ago and Mr. Beauvais said he was resigning "with the hope that it will improve the prospects for a successful emergence" of the company from the bankruptcy court. 
 Mr. Beauvais did not elaborate but he has gradually been relinquishing power; it was just last September that he turned over the chief executive post to Mr. Conway.
With Mr. Beauvais gone, Mr. Conway wasted little time. On Thursday, America West announced a round of cutbacks that it said was needed to obtain financing to keep flying and to get out of bankruptcy. The airline said it would cut 1,500 of its 12,000 jobs and drop 15 of its 102 planes by September. When it filed under Chapter 11, it had 15,000 employees.
Mr. Conway is no stranger to America West, having been a founder with Mr. Beauvais and others. The airline went into service in 1983. Mr. Conway was working for Continental Airlines in Los Angeles when he met Mr. Beauvais, who was doing consulting work for Continental.
Mr. Conway found his way to the airline industry through accounting. He is from the Flatbush section of Brooklyn and is a graduate of City College when it was known as C.C.N.Y. He worked for Price Waterhouse for 10 years, specializing in airlines, before joining Continental.
Mr. Conway is leading a company that quickly grew into a major airline with coast-to-coast service and annual revenues of more than $1 billion. Mr. Beauvais had even bigger expansion plans, but they ran afoul of the passenger dropoff during the Persian Gulf war and the recession, forcing America West into its current straits.
Now it will be Mr. Conway's job to get it out. "We will continue full speed ahead," he said in an interview last week. "We are looking forward to a speedy reorganization."

The Zip's in Communications

BYLINE: By STEPHEN C. MILLER

 BODY:
Now that local area networks have been installed just about everywhere, communications software is the new growth area. Communications applications include electronic mail (E-mail), sending and receiving facsimiles, and routing messages to and from other networks.
Forrester Research, a Cambridge, Mass., market research firm, predicts that the number of new network servers dedicated to communications will double this year to nearly 90,000, worth nearly $2.7 billion. The software for communications alone will generate about $148 million and that figure is expected to more than double by 1994. 
 Jim Manzi, president and chief executive of the Lotus Development Corporation, is trying to transform the company from a supplier of single-user software products to a supplier of global communications products.
"Communications is the key to the future of Lotus," he said during a recent interview. Lotus Notes is the cornerstone of that vision. Notes is a sort of super-organizer that, among other things, keeps track of incoming data, E-mail and faxes.
Compuserve Information Service, in Columbus, Ohio, is already in communications software, and Maurice A. Cox Jr., Compuserve's president and chief executive, sees more growth in what he calls "seamless communications." Compuserve has a new mail hub service that works with Novell's Message Handling Service to allow any Novell network to exchange E-mail not only with Novell sites but with Compuserve's 850,000 subscribers, A.T.&T.'s Mail and Easylink networks and other on-line services. Compuserve says that in less than a year it has signed up more than 500 corporate sites running Novell networks.
With the profit stakes so high, it is no wonder that a fight has erupted over what will be the new standard for transporting messages between systems. Three camps are vying to set the E-mail standard. For sending messages to other systems, Lotus prefers Vendor Independent Messaging, based on the way its CC:Mail and Notes handle messaging within networks that use Lotus software. Microsoft, with its Microsoft Mail, has a scheme called Message Application Programming Interface. Novell's Message Handling Service comprises the third standard, and with an estimated 64 percent share of the LAN market, Novell sets the de facto standard. Its M.H.S., with a "gateway" that routes E-mail from any system, is evolving into a standard for communications between all types of system and services, not just Novell networks.
"The Lotus and Microsoft products provide both the front-end and back-end solutions to messaging and that limits the market for third-party vendors," said Brett Warthen, president of Infinite Technologies in Owings Mills, Md., a supplier of network communications products. (Front-end systems interact with users; back-end systems handle the system-to-system connections.) Mr. Warthen said his company was is among 150 that provide front-end systems for MHS. "Actually, both Lotus and Microsoft support some form of MHS," he said. "If you wanted to connect a CC:Mail network with a Microsoft Mail network, they would talk via MHS," he added.

HEADLINE: At Work;
Keep the Work Place in Its Place

BYLINE: By BARBARA PRESLEY NOBLE

 BODY:
You know who you are, and you are not alone. You stay mentally Velcroed to the office long after you leave. You obsess and stew on the trip home and then replay the day minutia-by-minutia to your spouse or partner. "Sometimes, I put too many details in. I can see my husband's eyes glaze over," said Gretchen Park, the director of compensation and benefits at Residential Services Corporation, the holding company for the Prudential Home Mortgage. "I know he doesn't want to hear about the office for two hours."
Caught up in downsizing, streamlining and, in the case of Residential Services, the crush of work brought on by an expanding business, millions of Americans are working more, enjoying it less and experiencing firsthand the stern conclusion that Harvard economist Juliet Schor comes to in her recent book "The Overworked American." She wrote: "Excessive hours are unhealthy and antisocial, and ultimately erode the quality of life." 
 Because companies know that, stress reduction on the job has become a cottage industry with proliferating numbers of gurus du jour. But when Residential Services wanted advice, it chose Barbara Mackoff, a Seattle-based management psychologist who holds the contrarian view that employees suffer most not from stress at work but from an inability to detach themselves from work long enough to become refreshed and recharged. When she takes the stage in front of an audience of clients, she preaches a doctrine of renewal as a bottom-line, strategic skill.
"Companies are struggling to define what makes people productive," Ms. Mackoff said. "Some take the 'boiled-frog approach,' " in which managers turn up the productivity heat. "People get used to hotter and hotter water." But employees can only keep up for so long. One way or another, they will take time off, and it will cost the company as well as the employee. "Through mistakes, lack of creativity, illness, lack of follow-through with clients," Ms. Mackoff said. "You'll take time off, but not in a productive way."
Ms. Mackoff makes this observation on the basis of a decade of experience in organizations. A psychologist with training in anthropology, she does a cultural study of the company before she actually arrives for workshops or lectures. Once on site, her first job usually is to convince her audience that they will survive if they briefly turn off the treadmill. She may start with a simple story: Told that he is working with a dull saw, a workman replies that he is too busy to stop and sharpen the blade. "I get a lot of 'I'm too busy sawing to sharpen the saw,' " she said.
When when she begins to spin out her list of symptoms, she can see the looks of recognition -- and, often, relief -- on the faces in front of her.
* It's literally impossible to leave work. "You take your briefcase home and work," she said. "Or you take your briefcase home and don't touch it -- and feel guilty. You can't resist calling the office while you're on vacation."
* It's impossible to protect private time from work-related worries. "You can't fall asleep. You spend the whole night talking about work."
* Time away from work becomes an excuse for more work. "Every social occasion becomes a business-card occasion."
Managers may notice that employees come in on Monday looking more tired than they did on Friday. And they will surely notice a productivity decline.
One useful diagnostic is the first post-work encounter at home. "It takes about 40 seconds to ruin an entire evening," Ms. Mackoff said, just by continuing in the mode of the woes of the day. "Standing back from pressures of the day really is an accomplishment."
Like a good anthropologist, she advises developing some exit rituals to manage the work-to-home transition. One of her clients locks her appointment book in a drawer and backs out of her office shaking her finger, saying, "stay, stay." Another compliments one of his subordinates as he leaves each evening. Once home, she says, it is crucial to greet everyone before launching into a recitation of the day's horrors.
The trick over the long term is to use time away from work to get experience the job doesn't provide. Gretchen Park, who heard Ms. Mackoff's talk during a January sales meeting in Florida, said much of the message has stayed with her. Probably, she said a little ruefully, she should take up a hobby, but at least she tries to sit down and listen to music once a week. She really appreciated, she says, the message Residential Services delivered by bringing in Ms. Mackoff: "It was a recognition that this is a hard life we live."
 
 
HOW TO PUT LEISURE TO USE
 In her seminars and in a recent book, "The Art of Self-Renewal" (Lowell House), Barbara Mackoff suggests pursuing leisure activities that offer a sense of purpose, of self and of time completely different than anything available at work.
* Purpose: Stop thinking about having something to show for every activity. At the movies, don't think about how much the film grossed or how the popcorn stand is doing. Don't apply high strategic demands of jobs to the home -- e.g., lower your housework standards. Leave lists, and the inclination to make lists, at the office. Do nonprofessional reading. Don't think about any bottom line.
*Self: Participate in activities that express a dimension of personality or ability that doesn't come out on the job. It could be playing music, seeing friends or getting active in the community. . Stop using a work vocabulary to describe nonwork experience.
* Time: Resist the urge to overschedule and stop rushing. "One chief executive would take off his watch on Friday and put it back on Monday," Ms. Mackoff said. Do projects with a beginning, middle and end.

HEY, it's the 90's: Sometimes you have to brace for the worst.
"Whooooo-a-a-a . . . aph." Over at the new World Gym near Lincoln Center, where the earth-tone locker rooms are still under construction and the steam room is but a stack of tiles and exposed piping, Billy Billitzer, a 28-year-old gemologist, was working out last week on exercise machinery that looked like so many helicopter parts. 
 "Unghhhh." Mr. Billitzer may never have to do more than run out some rainy Sunday morning for a carton of orange juice and an extra bag of bagels. But his lats, delts, traps and quads are ready for anything. Three or four days a week, he runs through a 90-minute lifting, hoisting, pulling, straining workout that has left him tuned and tough.
"Haaooouup." There are rewards, of course. "I eat about five meals a day," he said with a guiltless grin. "I feel like a newborn."
He looked as if he could tear through a steel door.
THE neighborhood gym -- reworked, repainted and repackaged -- is making a comeback. Glitz is gone, along with the attendant who bends to every whim. In its place there is only a chorus of grunts and a pared-down mission statement. The new gym is not a club where one has one's psyche scrubbed and back rubbed. It's a no-frills, no-fools room in which to break a sweat and sweat the details: the Ikea of the health-club culture.
Open 24 hours a day and practically abutting New York's cultural Ground Zero, the new million-dollar World Gym will bring to body building what Lincoln Center has long brought to the arts. It promises the best equipment that money can buy, and even a hint of stardom. Macbeth himself could strut across Broadway to do a couple turns on the abdominal crunch machine.
The Terminator is far more likely to appear. Arnold Schwarzenegger owns the World Gym franchise and is carrying on the principles of Gold's Gym, that mecca of body building in the mecca of health, Venice Beach, Calif. It was Joe Gold, the master muscle builder, who developed the modern gym. And it is now Mr. Schwarzenegger who is carrying the principle forward.
If fads followed the calendar, the fitness boom of the 1980's should have gone the way of junk bonds. The garden came back; so did the frumpy slipcover; even Jane Fonda started to look a little silly on her eternal quest for youth. Then the doctors weighed in and said all those aerobics and all that going for the burn might actually be bad for you.
The health-club culture crashed and burned. Like other bad investments of the 1980's, those born of hope and slipshod banking crumpled in a withered economy, leaving scores of people holding long-term memberships to nowhere.
It seemed reasonable that the nation would come down from its mesomorphic high and return to its shuffleboards, tennis courts and garage basketball hoops: to a time when exercise was something you hardly thought about, much less made into a religion.
Trouble was, it felt good to feel good, and a lot of people didn't want to give that up. Faced with the AIDS epidemic and the psychological vulnerability engendered by a tenacious recession, people of all ages and all backgrounds in the 1990's find themselves wanting to be tough enough to face any disaster, real or imagined.
Call it fantastic disaster preparedness. What if a house were to fall smack on your shoulders and you had to heave it off in a nice, clean, steady movement without ripping the muscles sheer off your shins? Or what if you had to lie upside down and hoist a car out of a ditch with one hand (no cheating), or pull a drifting ocean liner into its berth and rope it down against a steady 10-knot wind?
At the new World Gym, the props may be missing (there is no ocean and no ocean liner) but the movements are roughly the same. And the faithful and the flabby have already started to pour in. A maze of sparkling white-and-blue machines that didn't exist even in concept a decade ago stand ready to meet even the worst of the wimps.
The gym will not be complete until early September. But starting tomorrow, the silent Cybex exercise machines will beckon morning, noon and dark of night with the perennial enticement of the perfect biceps, sculptured sartorius and trim abdominal. For fees of $15 a day to $700 a year, the gym offers equipment that can test-drive every one of the body's more than 400 muscles and help them fire like so many well-oiled cylinders.
It all began as a whim. While vacationing in California during the health-crazed late 70's, Anthony Schettino had a vision. There, during a workout, he met Joe Gold, the master of the modern gym and a close friend of Mr. Schwarzenegger. The two started talking, and suddenly Mr. Schettino, a bulky but otherwise unassuming policeman from Brooklyn, saw his future flash before him. He saw a big gym using California themes to capture the rapture of the West.
By 1982, the doors opened to the World Gym in Queens, with touches truly new to the New York muscle culture. "Everything used to be these small, dark, little neighborhood places with guys who'd yell and scream," Mr. Schettino said. "I wanted my place to be big and full of wood and plants and with the whole feeling of that California scene."
While the Queens gym prospered, Mr. Schettino (pronounced ske-TEE-no) eased out of the police force and stuck a pin in his map of Manhattan. By 1988, Wall Street was reeling, but he was ready for his second venture, a 30,000-square-foot gym at Lafayette and Fourth streets with rubber floors, ceiling fans, wall-to-wall mirrors and the best equipment money could buy.
By then, his was an official franchise of Mr. Gold's gym empire, which was recently bought by Mr. Schwarzenegger.
From the start, the humblest taxi driver could some days be found heaving deltoid to deltoid with the likes of Ivan Boesky, Jodie Foster and Gregory Hines. Against a background din of barely audible rock-and-roll, clanking barbells and muffled grunts, the mighty and the meek still twist and strain against Abdominal Crunch Boards, Upper Body Ergometers, Leg Presses, Hack Squats and Rotary Torso machines in a space that looks more like a factory floor than a haven for good health. Even the clothing is low key. No tortured fashion statements here.
For some, the experience is transporting. Gregory Hines comes in "like he's going to church," Mr. Schettino said, adding: "He's here every day. He's devoted."
Jodie Foster waltzed in once, plopped down her $15, caused a minor sensation, jumped on a bike, pedaled with ferocious focus, then walked out again. She was, Mr. Schettino said, self-conscious. She has not been back.
Lauren Hutton ranks a casual "pretty good" from Mr. Schettino. But she hasn't been in for a while, so heaven only knows what is happening to her gluteus medius.
The biggest sensation was Ivan Boesky. He worked out on work release, "looking like a homeless guy," said Karen Wong, 23, the gym's manager, who said she feels like the gym police, making sure no one spits or fights or drips without using a towel. "He had the shabbiest clothes," Ms. Wong said. "And this huge beard. His workouts were really intense." So was the media coverage.
The expansion of the World Gym empire uptown was complicated by the need to elevate the no-frills concept to upper-crust standards. The ultimatum was to have a gym, not a playground; to keep that lean, mean, focused style without alienating uptowners who, truth to tell, expect at least a little glitz with their grunts.
Concessions were made.
"They want towels," Mr. Schettino said, shrugging. "So, I'm giving them towels." The gym, at Broadway and 64th Street, will also have a massage room, a baby-sitting service, a cafe and a pro shop. There is even a rug near the entrance.
With or without towels, there is a purpose to the pain, and a method. If one plans to use one's brachioradialis, for example, there is no good reason to ignore the latissimus dorsi or to discount the sublime importance of the infraspinatus. Total health is total health.
In the 80's, when everyone bashed around on tennis shoes stretching and yelping and smashing their knees, "people went with the flow," Ms. Wong said. Now they are waking up in pain. "Those high-impact aerobics," she added. "Oh! They didn't realize what it would do to their bodies in 10 years."
That stuff could totally crush you.
In good gym workouts the pain is fleeting, but real. Faces flush and contort and the occasional moan rises above Bonnie Raitt's musings about the anguish of being in love. New members tend to be histrionic about the agony. The experienced hardly notice. It is common, weekday mornings, to see a trim man on a stair machine walking up the equivalent of the Empire State Building, reading his paper.
The difference between the burn of old and the strain of the moment is that people are more realistic about their physiques, said Emily Wagner, 26, an aerobics instructor at the World Gym on Broadway. "They are serious," she continued. "Before, you had these, like, aerobics neurotics who are just suffering now. But these folks are serious. They've got AIDS to worry about. So they come to work, not to chitchat. They really think about their bodies."
The work itself is only part of a broader change. Mr. Billitzer, the gemologist, described his physical training as starting with his diet and ending on the Cybex machines. Kevin McGrath, a trainer at the Lafayette Street gym and a student of exercise physiology at Montclair State College in New Jersey, provides nutritional advice, lectures about getting enough sleep and even makes occasional wake-up calls to clients trying to get themselves together.
True devotees spend around $50 an hour for private supervision. But the final appeal is often the same for those who spend as much as $300 a week on private sessions and those who just pop in on their own.
"I want to keep what I've got from turning into mush," said Valerie Brown, a trim 36-year-old who works on computer systems at the New York Stock Exchange.
There are, of course, some professional body builders, "steroid heads" and far-gone muscle men for whom the gym is a culture in itself. Mr. Schettino tries to discourage them from feeling too at home.
"They don't like us here," said a professional body builder who uses only his first name, Pierre. Flicking his long, dark ponytail and shifting muscles so large that they seemed almost to impede normal movement, he complained that the World Gym, at least, was less than welcoming. "Look at me," he said without even pumping out his shaved chest. "I'm big. People our size, we are very intimidating."
Among the most devoted clients are those who find obsessive exercise a good substitute for other vices. "A lot of us are basically reformed drug addicts and alcoholics," said Karen Ciatyk, 37, who works out six days a week and looks as if she could stop a car with one hand. "Myself, I was very heavy at one time. And I drank a lot. But I gave it up mostly for the calories." The exercise is more that just a means of weight control, she continued, adding: "It's a challenge. It's a you-versus-the-machine type thing."
Some regulars find a home. Romances of all types flourish, founder and re-form in endless subtle circles. "If you sit on a bike for an hour you get to see a lot," Ms. Ciatyk said. "I mean, you really get an overview."
At the new World Gym, romance may come and go but the day will never end. And while the tuned and trim come down off some endorphin high, towels wrapped lightly about their necks and bodies flushed and glistening, they will inevitably turn to that most compelling of all subjects: how they look.
Mirror, mirror on these walls. Who has the fairest form of all?
The answer is not always pleasing. The best body Mr. Schettino says he ever saw was that of a woman who walked casually into the Lafayette Street gym one day. He asked her how she had gotten into such great shape. She looked straight at him without coyness and uttered the most depressing words he ever heard. "Roping cattle," she answered. And then, by golly, she shrugged.

HEADLINE: HOME CLINIC;
If Water Floods Basement, A Sump Pump May Help

BYLINE: By JOHN WARDE

 BODY:
WHEN a basement is flooded because of water rising from beneath the floor, one solution is to install a sump pump. Aside from requiring modest excavation, including breaking through the basement floor, the task is not difficult.
But before starting, call the building inspector to ask about the requirements for installing sumps. Find out whether the pump may discharge into a municipal storm sewer. In many localities that is strictly forbidden, because sewers can be overloaded during heavy rains. The inspector will probably say the pump has to discharge onto the ground on the property, where it can soak into the soil. Never connect a discharge line to an ordinary sewer or a septic tank. 
 Two styles of pumps are available, pedestal or upright pumps and submersible pumps. Pedestal pumps have an electric motor attached to a hollow shaft about three feet long. At the base of the shaft are the pump parts. The unit stands upright in a sump pit, a hole dug in the basement floor, with the motor above the water level.
Submersible pumps are sealed, so that water cannot enter the motor. The entire unit is placed on the floor of the sump pit. Submersible pumps are more expensive than pedestal pumps because of their waterproof casing, but they operate more quietly.
Unless there is a convenient 240-volt circuit, choose a pump that operates on standard 115-volt current. When shopping, compare pumping capacity, horsepower and the amount of electricity needed. Most houses need pumps having about one-third horsepower, capable of pumping 50 gallons a minute to a height of five feet. That information is usually on the pump or packaging.
To compare power use, determine the wattage from the label or by multiplying the motor voltage by its amperage. Then divide the wattage by the pumping capacity. The answer indicates how much electricity is used by the pump. The model whose specifications yield the lowest number when divided is the most economical to operate.
Because conventional pumps operate on household electricity they will not operate during a power failure. If that is a concern, buy a backup pump that runs on 12-volt batteries. Both pumps are usually installed in the same pit, with the secondary pump higher than the primary. That way, if the primary pump does not operate, the secondary will automatically start when the water rises higher than normal.
To install a pump, the first step is to dig the pit. That should be at the lowest part of the basement floor. A drain usually marks the spot. If there is none, find the lowest area by noticing where flood water collects or stretch strings between the walls at floor level and measure under them. Use a pencil or chalk attached to a string to mark a circle on the floor around the spot 18 inches in diameter or as specified in the pump instructions.
Break the floor to remove the concrete in the circle. One way to do that is to rent an electric hammer drill. Bore holes around the perimeter and in the center. Break up the concrete with a sledgehammer and remove it. A faster way is to use a rented jackhammer.
After breaking through the floor, dig the rest of the pit with a shovel to the depth recommended by the pump manufacturer, usually 24 inches. Cover the bottom of the pit with two or three inches of gravel, or as the pump instructions specify. Then insert a plastic, fiberglass or metal sleeve called a sump liner in the hole to prevent dirt from entering and fouling the pump. Liners are available where sump pumps are sold. Also buy a removable sump cover.
Fill around the outside of the liner with dirt and cap the area with concrete troweled smooth and sloped toward the pit. Fast-setting concrete like Sakrete Fast-Set High Strength Concrete hardens fully the same day it is poured.
Assemble a discharge line using plastic, PVC, plumbing pipe. The standard diameter for sump pumps is one and a quarter inches. The layout will vary according to the location of the pump and the dimensions of the basement, but a common design consists of a vertical pipe that is attached to the pump and rises out of the pit. If a secondary pump is installed, it also can be attached to that pipe. To the vertical pipe, attach a horizontal pipe running along the floor to the nearest window. The vertical or horizontal pipe has to have a check valve to prevent water discharged by the pump from flowing backward toward it.
Another vertical pipe is attached to the horizontal section. That pipe can lead to the window or to a hole drilled through the basement wall above ground level. Attach an elbow fitting to the end of the pipe. Connect a long length of flexible drain hose to the fitting. The hose should extend at least six feet away from the house, and the open end should rest on a splash block.
The glass can be removed from the window and replaced with plywood through which a hole is cut to accommodate the pipe. Apply caulking around to seal the hole.
Plug the cord for the motor into a basement receptacle protected by a ground-fault-circuit interrupter. Close the pit with the cover.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Awash in Imports, the Oil Business Dwindles

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
The Soviet Union's collapse is claiming yet another victim: the American oil industry. Like the defense industry, oil is no longer as strategic as it had been, and in a time of fiscal stringency, Washington is no longer as enthusiastic about preserving the domestic supply.
The signs appear everywhere in the last few weeks: the number of exploratory drilling rigs hit a record low a few weeks ago, at 596; the oil companies announced another round of layoffs, and domestic production briefly fell to below the level of imports. Yet these indicators caused hardly a blip on the national political horizon. 
 The evolution is striking. After the 1973-1974 Arab oil embargo, Richard M. Nixon launched Project Independence in an effort to reduce oil imports to zero. In 1977, with imports at 44 percent, Jimmy Carter set a target of holding them to 30 percent. Now the country imports nearly 50 percent, with no apparent qualms. "Our notion of where the goal posts lie has changed over the years," said James R. Schlesinger, a former Secretary of Defense and energy czar. "We are being a little casual about it -- more than a little casual."
Even the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a security blanket during the Persian Gulf war last year, no longer attracts much interest. And the National Energy Strategy, a bill that took a major step toward enactment last week, has no provision for filling the reserve. A House committee had approved a fee on oil imports that would have filled the reserve in a few years to its authorized level, a billion barrels, but the White House declared that the fee was a tax and opposed it, so the idea died.
Coincidentally, the Energy Department made a purchase early this month, its first since just before Iraq invaded Kuwait, almost two years ago. But the addition of a few hundred thousand barrels is overshadowed by another trend, growing imports. With about 570 million barrels now in hand, and imports running over 7 million barrels a day, the reserve is equal to about 80 days of imports, a figure that shrinks every time the level of imports rises.
 
Multi-Polar World
 The demise of the Soviet Union lies near the heart of oil's new obscurity. Under the old scheme, most of the world's surplus oil production capacity was in the Persian Gulf with the Soviet Air Force a few minutes' flying time away. Now, nearly all the surplus capacity is in the Gulf but with little outside threat.
"The only strategic consideration is that the Middle East remains unstable," said John H. Lichtblau, director of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation.
In this new multi-polar world, producing oil counts for little among some of the fiercest economic competitors.
"Take a look at Japan," said Robert E. Lipsey, an economist and specialist in international competitiveness at the National Bureau of Economic Research, a private nonprofit organization in New York. "They seem to manage perfectly well. Look at all of the European countries." All are successful, he said, and only Norway and Britain have substantial oil.
Oil remains a commercial issue. America's net oil import bill last year approached $44 billion, an amount equal to two-thirds of the total national trade deficit. But another side to the commercial equation is less obvious. If, for example, the country resolved not to spend a cent on imported oil, the replacement cost would be far higher, comprising in part a mad rush to drill domestically and oil-saving measures like introducing more buses and trains and replacing oil-using equipment with more efficient models.
Another issue is domestic employment. Jobs in oil and gas extraction decreased by half, or 450,000, in the last 10 years. But here, too, the case is not clear cut, because technological change has reduced the number of rigs needed to find a field. Robert Z. Lawrence, professor of international trade and investment at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, said that even if there were a military or other non-economic reason to stabilize domestic production of oil at a certain level, "that's a different issue from how many workers we use to produce that; we should use as few as we can, as we should everywhere, to be as efficient as we can."
Another option for revitalizing the industry would be to put oil production ahead of environmental protection, by drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve and the outer continental shelf areas from which rigs have been banned.
New technology could encourage production, too. Prof. William L. Fisher, head of the Bureau of Economic Geology at the University of Texas in Austin, estimated that 80 percent of the country's oil "is still out there waiting to be discovered," or is in the ground in known locations, but is not recoverable with existing technology. Much of it lies in fields too small for the major companies to bother with, Professor Fisher said. However, exploration activity by smaller companies will still depend on the price of oil.
Despite the relative cheapness of imports, some experts still argue that such dependence is unhealthy and in time of war possibly fatal. "You only have to go back 50 years to see that running out of oil had an adverse effect on the team that lost it," said Peter Beutel, an energy trader at Pegasus Econometric Associates, a consulting company in Hoboken, N. J., referring to Germany's defeat in World War II.
Others, like Mr. Lichtblau, disagree. Even at a vastly reduced level of production, the United States has enough oil to run a military machine, according to Mr. Lichtblau.
The American oil industry hasn't died; it has simply moved away. Companies still spend heavily on looking for oil, but mostly offshore. The United States, which once exported Texas crude oil, now exports Texas oilmen. Today they encounter British, French and Norwegian competitors.
As the oil industry's fortunes dwindle, its base of skills and equipment disappears. "We're in a fairly severe situation," Professor Fisher said. "We're taking an infrastructure down probably lower than we want to."
Geology students still enroll in his program. "They are as bright as ever," he said, adding, but "their interest is somewhere else. They don't see oil as a future."

HEADLINE: The Rich Get Richer. True or False?

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
Stung by the assertions that the super-rich did extraordinarily well in the 1980's, the Treasury Department struck back last week. But its initiative flopped and the exercise turned out to be an embarrassment.
Treasury was taking aim at a calculation -- made by the M.I.T. economist Paul R. Krugman and embraced by Bill Clinton -- that shows that the richest 1 percent reaped 70 percent of the rise in average family income between 1977 and 1989. 
 To shoot down the report, Treasury fired off its own statistic showing that the top 1 percent got a mere 11 percent of total income gains between 1979 and 1988. The very rich, the Treasury said, "fared somewhat better than average, but not very much better."
But experts instantly spotted that the Treasury statistic was calculated in a way that all but guaranteed that the gains of the rich would appear modest. To come up with its politically correct 11 percent figure, Treasury had arbitrarily defined the top 1 percent as those with very high incomes in 1979. But, as Will Rogers would have appreciated, people at the top at the beginning of the period had nowhere to go, if they moved at all, but down.
A less biased approach would have been to calculate the gains of those who fell into the top 1 percent based on their average income over the whole period.
This analysis the Treasury has declined to provide, but some enterprising academic will surely do it for them.

Here is a pop quiz on the 1992 campaign. (TelePrompters are not allowed, but you may call your mother in Smalltown, U.S.A.) 
 Family Values are best exemplified by:
A. Vice President Dan Quayle extolling families with two parents, of different genders, who send their children to the drug-free school of their choice, where voluntary prayer is permitted.
B. Hillary Clinton rubbing Bill's back as they sit on a farm in their chinos and running shoes (plaid shirts added when appropriate) and Al and Tipper Gore beam approvingly from a nearby hay bale.
C. President Bush announcing in the Rose Garden that stopping drug abuse will "open more opportunity than ever for all Americans, preserving one nation under God."
D. Mr. Gore asking his wife, his four children, his father and his mother to join him on the platform at the Democratic National Convention, where he danced with Mrs. Gore and slapped five with his son.
Judging from how the Presidential contest has been going, the answer is: E. All of the above.
That the 1992 campaign has found its buzz phrase was abundantly evident last week as the two parties locked in a death grip over the "family values agenda."
Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore toured truck stops in the Midwest to continue a pre-emptive strike on the family front, traditional Republican territory that the Democrats are now trying to seize. Mr. Quayle, who began the whole discussion by criticizing Murphy Brown, stumbled by saying he would reluctantly support his daughter if she chose to have an abortion as an adult.
And Mr. Bush talked about almost anything that would let him connect with voters and change the subject from the economy and whether Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d will rescue his campaign. On Friday, he mentioned the death of his 3-year-old daughter from leukemia in 1953 to show hecklers at a conference of relatives of Americans lost in Southeast Asia that he too has suffered a family loss and was not insensitive to their problems.
But even with all this attention, it is not at all clear what the four candidates mean by family values. To what extent are they using the notion to point up what they perceive as their opponents' weaknesses -- Mr. Clinton's marital problems and appeals to gay and lesbian groups, Mr. Bush's air of detachment and poor record on the economy and racial issues?
Or perhaps the family talk is simply fodder for sound bites in a year when a politician feels safer with "Father Knows Best" than "Advise and Consent."
By Friday, even Regis Philbin and Kathy Lee Gifford, who have made a breakfast-television career out of being warm and fuzzy, had had just about enough. "Family values, family values, everybody's smothering themselves in family values," Mr. Philbin said. "I'm telling you, just before your eyes, Bill Clinton and Hillary became Ozzie and Harriet overnight."
Voters will know things are out of hand, Mr. Philbin suggested, when they "catch Clinton smoking a pipe."
Obviously, there are pressing issues evoked by "family values" -- child-raising, welfare, crime, drugs, faith and community, to name a few.
"The appeal of this vague phrase is that fundamentally it reminds people that good society depends not only, or even primarily, on their economic well-being, but also on this web of personal-social relationships that transcend the marketplace and transcend government," said Gary Orrin, a professor at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.
Mr. Orrin said "family values" is a "protean grab bag" of issues that Republicans began using in 1968, when Richard M. Nixon campaigned on a law-and-order platform. But after years of ceding that ground to Republicans, the Democrats are now trying to recapture it.
"You can't campaign as the anti-family person," Mr. Orrin said. "The battle is to see which candidate or party is associated in the public mind as the party or candidate of family values, of peace, of honesty."
The President was trying to do just that on Friday, at a picnic in Brookville, Ohio. "The opposition would have you believe that family values is merely a slogan, and I don't look at it that way at all," he said.
But finding a widely accepted definition is hard.
Is it family values when Mr. Quayle says he would counsel his daughter against an abortion, but would support whatever decision she made? Or when his wife, Marilyn, alarmed that he might be seen as softening his stand on abortion, says that if the girl got pregnant now, at age 13, they would make her bear the child?
Is it family values when Mr. Clinton says he wouldn't talk about such an intimate question with the press? Or when he told millions of people how he bonded with his 12-year-old daughter Chelsea by having her join him to watch a "60 Minutes" broadcast on his alleged infidelity?
Is it family values when Mr. Clinton suggests his wife is smart enough to serve in a Cabinet, or when he backs off to appease stay-at-home mothers?
Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School of Communication at the University of Pennsylvania, said months of focus groups with 100 voters on that very subject offered no answer. "People," she said, "say everything from 'People ought to love each other, people ought to take care of their children, people ought to obey their parents,' to 'The government should treat families with respect and not tax them to death and does the government have the same values we have about money or are they spending it irresponsibly?' "
One thing was clear, Ms. Jamieson said: people are certain that their idea of family values is the only right one.
And both sides are trying to exploit that. Mr. Clinton does it by saying the Bush Administration does not value families because it refuses to mandate child-care and parental leave benefits at work. The Republicans do it by drawing a distinction between their view of society and the Democrats'.
"On the right, you tend to have people who say we've got to get kids to start abstaining again, get the divorce rate down, get families being faithful, children with some reliable sense of right and wrong," said Gary Bauer, head of the Family Research Council, an anti-abortion group. "I don't think I'm being unfair to say that the other side is more inclined to say families are evolving, that there are different lifestyles and government ought to accommodate the changes, rather than tell people there is a right or wrong way to live."
Republicans have been accused of using "values" to divide the electorate and to stir ugly emotions like racism or xenophobia.
In 1988, Mr. Bush was accused of using racism against Gov. Michael S. Dukakis by raising, in the name of law and order, the Willie Horton case. This year, Mr. Quayle has been accused of anti-Semitism for attacking Hollywood and of racism for arguing that poor urban blacks did not have the moral fiber to withstand the post-60's upheaval.
 
'Values' as a Code Word

 Mr. Bauer and Ms. Jamieson disputed the suggestion that "family values" is a specific code word for these sorts of things. "In conservative politics, long before Bill Clinton came on the radar screen, these were very important themes," Mr. Bauer said.
But the debate clearly touches sensitive issues. "Clinton has learned the lesson well," Mr. Bauer said. "That means the Administration is going to have to get into some specifics they are uncomfortable with, like gay rights, to show the difference between Democratic rhetoric and their platform."
Mr. Bush, who questioned Mr. Dukakis's patriotism, his religious beliefs and even his mental health, is clearly aware of the danger of being on the wrong side of the family values ramparts.
On Friday, during a political swing through the Midwest, he took every chance to drive home his devotion to the family. In Columbia, Mo., at the Show Me State Games, Mr. Bush said: "When you take the time to teach your son to shoot a bull's-eye, or teach your daughter to throw a strike, you're teaching more than a skill, you're teaching values. Values like perseverance, sportsmanship, motivation, effort."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Campaign Memo;
Pressure Builds on President As Anxiety Mounts in Party

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 25

 BODY:
The soothing story line in Republican circles these days is that James A. Baker 3d is riding back to the rescue, just as he did in the summer of 1988, when George Bush was 17 points behind Michael S. Dukakis.
But even the prospect of Mr. Baker's return, which is still unannounced, can barely contain the Republican alarm. In a year of wild swings in the polls, almost nobody considers Gov. Bill Clinton's 27-point lead in a Time-CNN Poll conducted this week to be solid support. But almost no one expected the Democrat's post-convention bounce to be that big, or to be fueled by a cross-country bus tour that co-opted much of the Republicans' favorite Middle America, hay-bale-and-patriotic-sparkler imagery.
 
Deeper Problems
 Grim as the polls may be, the Republicans have deeper problems as they begin the buildup to their Aug. 17 convention in Houston. They are achingly aware of how hard it is to improve the image of an unpopular President during hard times. Jimmy Carter, once their favorite target, is now their worst nightmare. 
 The macropolitics of this year has some disturbing parallels to 1980. Few Republicans expected the economy and the national mood to be this dark this late in 1992. Moreover, for all of Mr. Clinton's vulnerable points, and Republicans find them especially comforting these days, many party strategists see him as a dangerous opponent -- much more dangerous than Mr. Dukakis.
In short, some Republicans suggest that the problems afflicting Mr. Bush this year make the great Republican comeback of 1988 look easy.
 
'Significantly More Difficult'
 "I'm firmly convinced that whatever margin we're down by now, it's significantly more difficult to overcome than the 17-point margin we were down by to Dukakis," said Neil Newhouse, a Republican poll taker handling numerous state and Congressional races this year, though he hastens to say that a comeback is "certainly possible."
Ed Goeas, another Republican poll taker, said: "I have felt all along that the campaign has to start on the part of the President, and it hasn't. You can't have the Democrats out there for a year being political and fall back on trying to be governmental." He added, "I believe that whether we win or lose, this race is going to be extremely close."
There are some analysts, notably the conservative Kevin Phillips, who argue that the zeitgeist is simply against George Bush this year. The old Republican coalition, bound together by anti-Communism, economic growth and social conservatism, does look decidedly strained, like a tripod teetering on one leg. "This is what you get in late stages of party coalitions," Mr. Phillips argues. "What knit them together is often 25 years old. You see Bush trying to recapture a lot of social issues that were critical in 1968 and 1972."
Mr. Phillips's thesis, which is revered by the Democrats, is that the country is headed for a backlash against the 1980's and a resurgence of economic populism, comparable to the periods after the Gilded Age and the 1920's. But even Republicans who dismiss his sense of sea change acknowledge that Mr. Bush faces a far chillier political climate today than he did four years ago.
In 1988, it might not have been the morning in America proclaimed by President Ronald Reagan, but it was still midday. The unemployment rate was 5.2 percent in June, a 14-year low, and only 5 in 10 Americans said the country was "on the wrong track," according to the Wirthlin Group, a polling company. This year, unemployment reached 7.8 percent in June, an eight-year high. And a key measure of the national mood shows an extraordinary level of pessimism as nearly 8 in 10 Americans say that the country is headed down the wrong track.
An incumbent President pays a price for that mood. Mr. Bush's approval rating, low most of the year, sank to 30 percent in the Time/CNN poll released today. The survey, based on telephone interviews with 855 registered voters, had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
 
Anxious Republicans
 These are the kinds of numbers that haunt Republicans on Capitol Hill, who sense their own political fortunes on the line. In recent days, there have been a wave of rumors and anxious pleas to do everything from replacing Vice President Dan Quayle to shaking up the Cabinet: calls, in other words, for big gestures to convince a skeptical public that the party in power has the energy to respond to the restless national mood.
"Some decisions in political life are very difficult; others aren't," said Representative Jim Leach, a veteran Iowa Republican. "The President needs to shift gears. He's going to have to do a little Cabinet reshuffling. And frankly, some early advertising -- substantial early advertising."
Mr. Leach added, "It's going to be extraordinarily difficult."
Stuart E. Eizenstat, who was domestic policy adviser under President Carter, agrees. "When you're embattled, as we were in 1980, everything you do is seen through the prism of politics and is perceived as simply a way of getting out of your current problems rather than a legitimate agenda for the future," he said. "We tried mightily to define a second- term agenda, but you can never break through the fog of criticism about your current record when things are going poorly."
 
Plenty of Advertising
 Eddie Mahe, a veteran Republican consultant, acknowledges the power of the fog. "The big thing that Bush, Baker and the campaign has to do, in my opinion, is jump the press, jump the interpreters, and remind the American people of what it is that this President has accomplished," he said. "I think they should put every dollar they've got on television, and I think they should not go off television until Nov. 3."
The Bush campaign is, in fact, planning television advertising before the convention, using money left over from the primaries. And the convention itself will obviously be an opportunity to highlight Mr. Bush's achievements and goals; he seized the moment four years ago, when he was widely thought to have given the speech of a lifetime at the convention in New Orleans.
But next month's convention could also highlight some of the tensions in the party, including the abortion issue. More broadly, Mr. Phillips asserted that Republicans ran the risk in the coming convention of seeming dominated by "two fringes, one cultural and one economic."
 
Missed Opportunities
 Many Republicans say they are haunted by a sense of missed opportunities for Mr. Bush, opportunities to convey his accomplishments on the world stage and pledge his commitment to a new domestic agenda. A prominent Southern Republican, who spoke on condition that he not be identified, said: "They have to give people a reason to be for him. We've spent seven months now, and there are lot of reasons to be for him, but they haven't focused the public's attention on those reasons."
This is where Mr. Baker can help, many Republicans say: by focusing the message, making decisions and making them stick. Mr. Baker is also renowned as a man who can talk to the President, and get him to do what needs to be done.
But many Republicans agree that the Bush campaign also needs to focus much of its effort on making Mr. Clinton an unacceptable alternative. "The challenge now is, how do you move a President who's sitting at 35 percent approval rating up to 50 percent in the polls?" said Mr. Newhouse, the poll taker. "And part of the answer is, you have to get voters to vote for him who don't approve of the job he's doing, by making Clinton less palatable to some of your swing voters than George Bush is."
Mr. Eizenstat recalls that the Carter strategy in 1980 was also "to make Reagan seem too risky to be a legitimate agent of change." But the former White House official added that there is a risk of backlash with that approach, saying, "People can accept negative campaigns from opponents to a much greater degree than they can from an incumbent President, from whom they expect a more elevated campaign."
Still, many Republicans believe that Mr. Bush can only prosper by a head-to-head comparison with Mr. Clinton on trust and leadership traits. The Democratic nominee's surge in the polls, some noted, has followed a period of unusually positive news coverage that is unlikely to be sustained.
In the meantime, the Republicans keep a wary eye of the Democrats, and what they see as copyright infringement. Having watched the Reaganesque imagery and pretty pictures of the Democrats' bus tour, Don Sipple, a Republican consultant, said: "They've been sounding some themes that frankly in the past have been Republican themes, and that should be of concern to our party. They've been sounding hope and optimism, which in the last three elections were Republican themes."

HEADLINE: Solutions on Welfare: They All Cost Money

SERIES: Rethinking Welfare/Last of six articles.

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

 BODY:
The court official who supervises child support in Grand Rapids, Mich., described a 26-year-old local man who had fathered eight children with five mothers. "Before you condemn him for moral laxity," said the official, William D. Camden, "look what he did for these women."
"He gave each one of them a safety net," Mr. Camden said, referring to the welfare the women and children can receive. "They will have a steady income and full medical coverage until their kids are 18. 
 "The system seems designed to encourage this kind of dependency."
If there is one thing that nearly everyone agrees on, it is that the welfare system needs changing. Its rules can sap the spirit, recipients are the first to say, and it often discourages rather than fosters work and marriage. Yet its payments, if reliable, offer a bleak standard of living at best.
 
Going Beyond the System
 The criticism is hardly new, but in the last few years, as a result of local innovation and a national change in philosophy embodied in a 1988 law, a flurry of reforms has been tried, all intended to make welfare a bridge to self-reliance. Proposals for more radical change, like Gov. Bill Clinton's call to limit time on welfare to two years, are receiving unusual attention in the Presidential campaign.
But a consensus is growing among those who study welfare dependency, from Harvard liberals to Heritage Foundation conservatives, that major progress would require two costly innovations reaching far beyond the welfare system itself: health insurance for everyone and large income subsidies for the working poor -- in effect, a minimum guaranteed income for those who work.
In any case, the attack on welfare dependency must fight uphill against some profound social trends. One is a long-term decline in wages on the bottom end of the labor market, a trend that runs much deeper than the recession and has made it less advantageous than ever to leave welfare for work.
"It's harder to earn your way out of poverty now than it was 20 years ago," said Rebecca M. Blank, an economist at Northwestern University.
Another is a spectacular rise in out-of-wedlock births, swelling the population of prime candidates for long dependence on the dole.
The recent changes in welfare rules vary by state. They include new requirements for schooling, job training or community service work, financial carrots to encourage marriage, financial sticks to discourage irresponsible childbearing, and stronger efforts to collect money from absent fathers.
President Bush, who is also campaigning under a banner of welfare reform, has given several states, including New Jersey just last week, special exemptions from Federal law, allowing them to experiment with stronger incentives to change marital, work and childbearing behavior.
 
Dollars Lag Behind Words
 But the flow of dollars has not soared along with the lofty calls for sweeping reform. The country spent little more than $1 billion last year on education and job training specifically for welfare recipients. The modest expenditures are working as expected: they are helping small numbers of people reduce their need for public assistance.
With the new slogans have come wildly unrealistic expectations. Helping society's most downtrodden people change their lives will take more money, not less, in the near term. Yet in many states the "reforms" have been accompanied by cuts in benefits that seem mostly intended to save tax dollars. If experience is any guide, the new behavioral carrots and sticks will at best alter the actions of a small proportion of recipients.
The startling finding that one-fifth of the nation's children, including more than two-thirds of all black children, spend time on welfare by the age of 18 is less an indictment of the welfare system than a symptom of vast social calamity. Changes in the welfare system alone cannot transform communities caught in unemployment, crime, drug abuse and family disintegration.
"Simply isolating a problem like welfare, independent of the need to create jobs and educational opportunities, won't get you there," said William Julius Wilson, a poverty expert at the University of Chicago.
 
Incentives
Trying to Make Work Worth It
 If more families are to stand on their own, society has to "make work pay," said David T. Ellwood, a welfare expert at Harvard University and a liberal who proposes using tax credits and other measures to achieve that end.
Robert Rector of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group, also said that those shifting from welfare to work must be assured access to medical insurance, and have their incomes bolstered.
"If we want mothers to work their way off welfare, we should make sure their earnings when they get a job are as high as we can make them," said Mr. Rector, who agreed with Dr. Ellwood about little else. "I don't go as far as a guaranteed income, but I am proposing rather substantial tax relief and government assistance for those who are working."
Views are converging on this part of the answer, at least, at a time of great yearning for a full-scale attack on poverty. Unfortunately, it is also a time of record budget deficits.
Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the main welfare program, now costs the Federal and state governments about $25 billion a year. Estimates of the extra cost of wage subsidies to help workers avoid poverty, combined in some proposals with new public jobs, range from $15 billion to more than $50 billion a year. Health insurance for the working poor would cost substantially more still.
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, recalls the fierce debate within the Nixon Administration in 1969 and 1970 over his ill-fated proposals for a guaranteed annual income. "Cost was not a concern back then," Mr. Moynihan said in a recent interview. "The question was whether it was a good idea."
The paralysis induced by today's budget deficit will take a toll in wasted lives. "I'd love to come out with a $50 billion program," said Mr. Moynihan, who this year has been unable to get an extra $300 million beyond the $600 million in Federal money already spent on training of welfare recipients. "But it would be dishonest."
The concern is not for the half of the women who start on welfare, use it as a crutch and within two or three years get on with their lives. The concern is with the chronically dependent. One of every four women who goes on welfare stays on it for 10 or more years, according to an analysis by Dr. Ellwood of Harvard. These tend to enter the program as younger women, often teen-agers, with children born out of wedlock. They are often poorly educated, and a majority are black or Hispanic. These long-termers account for a majority of those on the rolls at any point and for most of the public expenses.
Marriage and childbirth patterns are producing a plentiful population of new candidates for dependency. In 1989, 27 percent of all births were to unmarried mothers, compared with 11 percent in 1970. Nineteen percent of white births in 1989, and 66 percent of black births, were to unmarried mothers.
The rate of births to unmarried teen-agers, who are most likely of all to need welfare and stay on it, is higher than ever and climbing. Two-thirds of all 1989 births to teen-agers (including 92 percent among blacks, 55 percent among whites) were out of wedlock, up from one-third in 1970, according to data analyzed by Kristin Moore of Child Trends Inc., a Washington research group.
 
Some Things Won't Change
 No matter how welfare is structured and no matter what the job market, an 18-year-old girl from a broken family with two babies, no high school degree, no work experience and no husband is going to have serious trouble supporting herself. It is naive, experts say, to think that six months or a year of remedial education and job training, and a threat to cut welfare checks, would be enough to set many such recipients on a trajectory out of poverty.
"Something has got to restore family structure," Mr. Moynihan said. "The illegitimacy rate is going up every year. If you expect a government program to change that, you know more about government programs than I do."
Something needs to change in the workplace, too. "Whatever your moral failings, if you are unskilled the world is a harder, rougher place for you today than it was for the equivalent person in the late 1960's," said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution. "Your capacity to earn has declined."
The trend is worldwide, and involves more than the much-discussed decline in well-paying blue-collar jobs. Within most sectors, including the dominant service sector, pay for the less-skilled has fallen while incomes at the top have soared. Experts believe the trend may be linked to, among other things, global competition for jobs and technological changes that put a greater premium on advanced skills. Poorly educated younger men have lost the most ground, but women are still paid much less than men on average.
Though some experts disagree, Dr. Wilson of the University of Chicago argues that these two driving forces of dependency -- worsening wages and an increase in out-of-wedlock births -- are related. "The economic status of males is directly associated with the problem of marriage," he said.
In this disastrous synergy he sees a seed of hope. "I think that a sharp increase in employment opportunitites would certainly elevate the marriage rate," Dr. Wilson said.
But the rate of out-of-wedlock births climbed through the last decade's boom years, when unemployment was down, suggesting that more than work status is contributing to the decline in two-parent families.
 
Reforms
Huge Problems, Modest Gains
 Against this backdrop of poverty-spawning social and economic trends, Congress in 1988 made major changes in the welfare rules. The Family Support Act, written by Senator Moynihan and others, promoted by Mr. Clinton on behalf of the country's governors and signed by President Ronald Reagan, laid out more clearly than before the principle of mutual obligation: society would help the poor, but they had to strive for independence.
The actual targets were modest, if realistic: by 1995, states should push 20 percent of recipients into education or job training, with many recipients, like women with children under age 3, excluded. The law also required states to guarantee child care for women who needed it to work, and it strengthened enforcement of child support from absent parents.
If the ideas were sound, the timing was bad. In 1991, states used only $600 million of the $1 billion in Federal money available to them for education and training under this law because so many did not appropriate the required matching money.
The results so far suggest both the promise and the limits of this kind of change. An April evaluation of how the new law is working in California, by the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation, a not-for-profit group in New York, showed results that experts said were encouraging. In the first year, single parents entering the education and job training program earned an average of $1,902 a year, compared with $1,631 for a similar group that did not receive the services.
That modest difference masks greater individual successes; some recipients earned a lot more, and the gains are likely to be greater in subsequent years. Researchers estimate that California is spending up to about $1,500 per recipient in training.
Judith M. Gueron, President of Manpower Demonstration Research, said that giving comparable training and assistance to all eligible welfare recipients would take some $4.5 billion a year, compared with little more than $1 billion spent now. What results could be expected?
"If we could run the programs as effectively as some earlier demonstrations, we would save three times that much for taxpayers over time," she said. "It might reduce the welfare rolls by 10 percent. That would be an ambitious goal."
Mr. Moynihan cautions against impatience. "Anybody who thinks you can change something so huge in less than a generation is not telling the truth," he said.
 
States Experiment
 Several states have experimented with bigger changes, with some success. New York's Child Assistance Program, one of the most far-reaching, involved 1,650 families in seven upstate counties in its first year. Those who volunteered received lower monthly grants but could keep a much larger share of earnings than under traditional welfare -- 90 cents of every dollar until their incomes reach the poverty line. In contrast, welfare is often reduced dollar for dollar.
To receive any benefits, participants had to obtain a child-support order against the absent parent. In turn, the state paid benefits for each child whether or not the fathers actually paid.
As New York officials enthusiastically announced in June, between grants and earnings, participants in the experiment had total incomes well above the poverty line and well above those of traditional welfare recipients.
But the participants were a self-selected, better-off group to start with. The program is structured to be financially advantageous only for those who can earn at least $350 a month and secure child-support orders. These requirements "are likely to limit the program to a small part of the A.F.D.C. population," said the one-year evaluation report by Abt Associates.
In fact, only 6 percent of those who were given the option chose to participate. The evaluators said it was too early to determine whether the program would reduce the extent of welfare dependency.
Beginning in 1983, many counties in Ohio experimented with a "workfare" program far more stringent than most of the job-search or training programs carried out in the name of welfare reform. Many adults on welfare were required to work in community service jobs, for an average of about 25 hours a week, in return for benefits. The jobs were with public or not-for-profit agencies.
The results were intriguing. Over five years the welfare rolls in counties with workfare shrank compared with those in other counties, though not drastically. Among single-parent families, caseloads in the workfare counties stayed level while elsewhere they rose 11 percent to 14 percent. Among the smaller category of families with both parents present, and who received much stronger pressure to work, the divergence was more than 30 percent.
Researchers could not determine whether people left the rolls because they had gained useful contacts and experience or because they had simply found the work requirement too onerous. "We don't know why they left, or if they were better or worse off," said Bradley R. Schiller of American University, who studied the program and thinks it showed promise. "We just know their welfare behavior changed." The program ended in 1988 under opposition from labor unions and a shift in state priorities toward education and training.
 
Outlook
No Shortage Of Suggestions
 Even as they applaud the new efforts to foster independence, many welfare experts have concluded that the system needs more radical changes.
The solutions offered vary greatly in detail but have some crucial points in common -- above all, calls for assured health coverage and for large subsidies for the working poor. Concern about the design and especially the cost of these broader measures may make adoption of sweeping changes unlikely in the near future.
Dr. Ellwood's solution, parts of which resemble proposals of Governor Clinton, the Democratic Presidential candidate, has three main elements. First, he would subsidize the working poor by increasing refundable tax credits and raising the minimum wage, providing day care and insuring that all families have medical protection.
Second, he would combine much stronger enforcement of child support with an assured minimum support payment to single mothers of perhaps $2,000 a year for each of the first two children and less for additional ones.
And third, welfare benefits would be explicitly short-term, provided for two or three years to help people through a difficult time. No one could renew them by having another baby or claiming that work was unavailable.
With all these elements in place, he said, "single parents could realistically support themselves at the poverty line if they were willing to work half time, even at a job paying little more than the minimum wage." The Government would be an employer of last resort for what he predicts would be a small number who could find no private jobs.
"If we can make sure that when you go to work you are better off, then I think we can say that we don't have to provide welfare forever," Dr. Ellwood said. But he warned against putting time limits on welfare in the absence of the income and child-support elements. "We would put single parents in an impossible position," he said. He estimated that the tax credits, child support, child care and job training in his plan would cost an extra $15 billion to $20 billion a year. Health insurance for the working poor and the costs to business of a higher minimum wage would be additional.
 
Another Point of View
 Mr. Rector of the Heritage Foundation attacked Dr. Ellwood's plan as a disguised way of creating "a whole new welfare system," pointing to the assured child-support benefits in particular. Instead, arguing that the current combination of grants, food stamps, housing subsidies and other programs often makes welfare too attractive, he would begin by reducing benefit levels.
He would require able-bodied recipients, except mothers with small children, to work in community service jobs in return for their benefits. Women having babies out of wedlock would have to establish paternity to qualify for welfare; fathers would pay support or work in community jobs, too. Mothers on welfare who have additional children would not receive extra benefits.
If he would do more to make welfare unpleasant, Mr. Rector would also, like Dr. Ellwood and most other experts, try to ease the path to self-reliance. He supports a health care plan developed by colleagues at the Heritage Foundation in which low-income people would receive tax credits and vouchers for purchase of health insurance. He would implement a tax-relief plan that would eliminate all Federal taxes on working families near the poverty line.
"If you make people work as a condition of getting benefits, all of a sudden that makes getting married, or getting a real job in the private sector, look better," Mr. Rector said. "Plus, if you give people health benefits and tax relief, you make it more lucrative for them to do so."
Just the tax-relief plan, Mr. Rector said, would cost about $45 billion per year.
Another approach is offered by Mickey Kaus, an editor of The New Republic, in his new book "The End of Equality" (Basic Books). In an approach that he argues would gradually change the expectations and behavior of the poor, he would abolish welfare payments and food stamps for the able-bodied, replacing them with "a single simple offer from the Government -- an offer of employment for every American citizen over 18 who wants it, in a useful public job at a wage slightly below the minimum wage for private-sector work." The low wage would provide an incentive to seek private jobs.
Mr. Kaus would provide tax credits to raise the incomes of low-paid workers above the poverty line. After considering the idea of temporarily exempting young mothers with newborns from the work requirement, he concludes that it may be better not to, in order to deter reckless childbearing. He would provide "compassionate" aid -- homeless shelters, counseling, but no cash -- to those who fail to take the offered public jobs and fall into total destitution.
Mr. Kaus estimates the extra cost of providing several million public jobs, tax credits, day care and other aid at $43 billion to $59 billion a year. He acknowledges that the plan would be fiercely opposed by unions.
As the merits of various proposals are debated, some experts warn that radical change, too, has risks. It is one thing, for example, to decide to push people off the welfare rolls after two years but quite another to pay for the training, health care, child care and jobs needed to make that a humane alternative.
And even then, some people will not behave according to the legislated script. "I think that if we introduce time limits on welfare, we'll have more women and children living in Grand Central Station" said Dr. Gueron of the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation. "There are a great many welfare recipients who are very marginal in terms of their ability to work. Some are clinically depressed, or were abused as young women. This is not a group that just needs a good kick to get their act together.
"The costs of cutting them off would be very high, because there are children involved."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Democrats;
Polls Seem to Offer Respite, But Clinton Pushes the Pace

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SPOKANE, Wash. July 25

 BODY:
The calls to his Little Rock headquarters have tripled in volume, the campaign's advisers are locked in almost round-the-clock planning sessions, and Bill Clinton, the Democratic nominee for President, headed for the West Coast today as if the very devil were at his heels.
In many ways, Governor Clinton and his lieutenants are still reeling from weeks of good news, good polls and the soaring potential of a campaign that, only a few weeks ago, was happy to make it through seven consecutive days without a disaster. 
 Now, as the planning for a vigorous general-election campaign against President Bush begins in earnest, the Democrats are busily remapping their strategy for a two-way race by going on the attack before the Republicans can do it first at their convention.
When Mr. Clinton landed on the West Coast today, he hoped to spread his dramatic campaign comeback to another region of the country.
Speaking to a crowd of thousands in this city's Riverfront Park, Mr. Clinton pointedly used the word "change" more than a dozen times, attempting to sell the Democratic ticket as the solution to the nation's doldrums.
"I don't care what the polls say today," he said. "It will require more courage for you to vote for Bill Clinton and Al Gore. Because it always is difficult to change. We represent hope, not fear. We represent the promise of a better tomorrow, but we have to change."
Last week, in combination with his Vice-Presidential nominee, Senator Al Gore of Tennessee, Mr. Clinton reaped more than his share of success from their eight-state bus tour. The Governor was trailed all over the country by Republicans sounding Mr. Bush's themes -- from the party chairman, Richard N. Bond, to Vice President Dan Quayle -- but they made only halfhearted efforts to pierce the Democrats' new bubble.
 
Democrats Afraid to Relax
 "I'd much rather have my problems than theirs," said Paul Begala, one of Mr. Clinton's advisers.
But even as they chortled at the Republican parade, some Democrats admitted that they were still a little nervous at the beauty of it all.
"On the Wednesday night of the convention, I looked at all that silver confetti falling, and I thought, 'What the hell do we do tomorrow?' " said Ronald H. Brown, the chairman of the Democratic Party. "The balloons could be a big disappointment."
Similarly, campaign strategists are bracing for an end to poll numbers that show Mr. Clinton 20 to 30 percentage points ahead of Mr. Bush.
"If you watch Ross Perot or Michael Dukakis in 1988 or George Bush at the end of 1991, you see a lead that develops quickly can disappear quickly," said Dee Dee Myers, the campaign's press secretary. "You shouldn't go to the track and bet on these leads."
James Carville, an adviser who is putting together the campaign's attack-and-response team, has called the numbers a "souffle" that could easily fall. Others have been quick to follow his lead.
"Sure, it's soft," said Paul Tully, the political director for the Democratic National Committee. "People are just arriving. You can't go home and take a vacation and put it in the bank. You have to harden it up step by step."
Mr. Tully and others have been arguing that the Democrats will be able to break what has been a Republican lock on Electoral College votes by exploiting the advantages they gain by presenting themselves as the party of change at a time when many voters are unhappy with the economy and anything that resembles the status quo.
"Perot's disappearance freed up a set of voters who are the angriest and the most anti-Bush," Mr. Tully said. "They had operated on little information about Governor Clinton, and this last three or four weeks has filled in a tremendous amount for them. It has a geographic impact as well as an impact with various segments of the population."
 
Running as if He's Behind
 The first step for Mr. Clinton has been to set a breakneck pace. After less than 24 hours off the road and back home in Little Rock this week, he traveled to Houston to attack Mr. Bush on turf the President calls home. Next week, he plans to visit Washington State, California, Illinois, Missouri and Louisiana.
Later in the week, campaign planners expect Mr. Clinton to criticize the President about taxes in a speech from the Superdome in New Orleans, the site of the 1988 Republican convention, where Mr. Bush first said, "Read my lips: no new taxes."
Mr. Clinton previewed a bit of that attack here today, asking his supporters to reject Republican efforts to paint him as someone whose policies would raise their taxes.
"When we get into this campaign, our opponents will say, 'There they go again -- the Democrats, they're talking about taxing and spending,' " Mr. Clinton said. "Let me tell you something. We're spending 30 percent more on health care than any country in the world, and we're getting less for it."
Although Mr. Clinton and his aides insist that they are not fighting the last war, every step they have taken so far contrasts markedly with everything Michael S. Dukakis is now agreed to have done wrong in 1988.
After Mr. Dukakis won the Democratic nomination, he took time off to bask in a 17-point lead in the polls. Mr. Clinton, who spent his first week after the convention on his bus caravan, today scheduled a 20-hour campaign day, beginning with an early morning cross-country flight and winding up in Seattle at a televised "town meeting."
"We are absolutely determined to keep rolling," Mr. Brown said. "There is no rest period. You will see us very active. You won't see us taking a trout-fishing trip during the Republican convention."
Mr. Bush went trout fishing with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d during the Democrats' convention.
Some of the activity seems intended to ride the crest of the positive political wave for as long as possible before enthusiasm subsides and the negative Republican campaign expected by the Democrats begins.
 
Bracing for a Slump
 "There is going to be a sorting out," said Stan Greenberg, the campaign poll taker who has been helping to reformulate the Clinton campaign's priorities. "A lot of anti-Bush and a lot of Perot voters who want to vote for change are turned on," as well as many traditional Republicans. "We have to assume we're going to shed some of these votes."
Clinton strategists have become expert at reducing expectations for their candidate, but they have scarcely been able to conceal their glee at Republican missteps, whether it was Mr. Bush snapping at veterans' families on Friday or the talk of removing Vice President Quayle from the ticket.
"Our people around the country are smelling the scent of a winner," Mr. Begala said. "Not only are the Republicans smelling the scent of a loser, but of a disaster. They're going to be pining for Goldwater."
Mr. Clinton tells Democrats he is gearing up for a nasty campaign. In Texas, where Clinton workers say phones have been ringing off the hook since the convention with new offers of support, Mr. Clinton told supporters at a fund-raiser that he was ready.
"Everywhere I go, people say, 'Are you ready for one more Republican negative campaign?' " Mr. Clinton said. "There was a cartoon today of me walking out of the Democratic convention, and it was portrayed as a bathhouse. I had a towel on, and there's a Republican there with a wheelbarrow full of mud hiding around the corner."
The audience of partisan Democrats howled.
"I'll tell you that Al Gore and Bill Clinton believe in a strong national defense," he said. "And we believe in a strong political defense."

HEADLINE: Britain's Labor Party Names Shadow Cabinet

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, July 25

 BODY:
With Prime Minister John Major's Conservative Government stymied by the longest and most persistent recession of modern times, the British Labor Party has named a new shadow cabinet that hopes it will not be stuck in opposition for too many more years.
Less than four months after an election Mr. Major won on the promise of a British economic recovery, none is yet in sight. His Government is in the midst of the biggest political sex scandal in years, a liaison involving his close friend and Cabinet colleague David Mellor, the Secretary of State for National Heritage, and an actress. 
 A spell of warm, humid weather has also brought rioters out onto the streets of Huddersfield, Blackburn and other British cities with clashes between youths and the police that have led to the arrests of hundreds of people over the last two weeks.
With all this going on, some Labor supporters are saying that voters have already told them they're sorry they didn't vote for them on April 9, when the Conservatives won by a 21-seat majority in the House of Commons.
The last Labor Government left office in May 1979, but the shadow cabinet named on Friday by Labor's new leader, John Smith, hopes to succeed in the next elections.
Mr. Smith's deputy, Margaret Beckett, will run the party's election campaigns, while Dr. Jack Cunningham, a chemist who was the party's campaign coordinator before the election, will speak for the party on foreign affairs, filling the vacancy created by the resignation of Gerald Kaufman.
Mr. Smith said on Friday that his new team would "relentlessly expose" Government policies. More than 100 days after the election, there is still no sign of economic recovery. High interest rates have brought inflation down to about 4 percent, but the gross national product may fall this year for the second year in a row, exports are shrinking, and retail sales dropped a fifth of a percentage point last month.
With this glum background, Mr. Major's Cabinet decided this week on a four-year hold on spending that Gordon Brown, the new Labor spokesman on the economy, called "the fastest betrayal of election promises in history."
Mr. Major has not had smooth sailing since winning his election. His predecessor, Margaret Thatcher, has been criticizing his European policy since she joined the House of Lords last month, urging Conservatives to vote against the treaty on European union when it comes up for ratification.
This week, Mr. Mellor has been under daily fire from newspapers that have published transcripts of conversations that revealed he had been carrying on a relationship with a young actress, Antonia de Sancha. Mr. Mellor later acknowledged that he and his wife, Judith, had been undergoing "difficulties" in their marriage.
Since Mr. Mellor's responsibilities include deciding whether to recommend a law curbing press abuse of privacy, there have been calls for his resignation, but Mr. Major has made clear that he will stick with him.
Sporadic violence at a low-income public housing project in Huddersfield, in West Yorkshire, and in Blackburn and Burnley, in Lancashire, continued Thursday night, for the second night in a row. The police and Labor Party politicians said the violence involved rival gangs of Indian and Pakistani youths in Blackburn and occurred in areas of high unemployment.

He flies planes for a living, now as a commercial pilot after starting as a hard-boiled naval aviator, and attends Plymouth Haven Baptist Church, talks about "family values" and counts himself a rock-rib Republican.
His father-in-law, Dan Thomas, is cut from the same cloth. He is a retired Air Force major who flew B-52 bombers for a quarter of a century and then retired to the safe military haven of Pensacola, Fla., where he sells tractors and lawn mowers to young fellows in smart uniforms. Mr. Thomas is the sort of man who calls women "ladies," would not swear in front of them and blanches when anyone else does. 
 Mr. Baxter and Mr. Thomas never dreamed they would be speaking ill of the military establishment that nurtured and inspired them, never dreamed they would be writing impassioned letters to Representative Patricia Schroeder, a Democrat, of all things, begging her to hold the Armed Forces accountable for the sexual harassment of women.
 
Convention Changed Things
 But that was before last year's convention of the Tailhook Association, when the woman they love most in the world, Lieut. Comdr. Roxanne Baxter, Mr. Baxter's wife and Mr. Thomas's daughter, was one of at least 26 female aviators mauled by her male peers. That was before the Navy sought to whitewash the unseemly events in the Las Vegas hotel corridor, before one of the molested women decided to step forward by name and tell her story and before the subsequent public and political furor that has sent the Navy scurrying to burnish its image.
"I've watched Roxanne's hassles throughout her career, one straw after another, and I've finally gotten sick of it," Mr. Baxter said this week, explaining his decision to speak out, despite his wife's insistence that she wanted to "work through the system" and remain silent about the scandal at the convention of the private group of retired and active-duty naval aviators.
 
Speaking Up for His Daughters
 "I see speaking up as a way of helping to straighten out the Navy," he said. "It's probably too late for Roxanne, but I look at my daughters and it's them I'm concerned about. I'd like them to have a better shot."
Mr. Thomas, too, described a gathering sense that the time had come to take a public stand. Bit by bit, stingy in her details and insistent that she could take anything the men could dish out, his 37-year-old daughter only recently began telling him about the slights she suffered in a 15-year Navy career.
"She never made a big thing about it," Mr. Thomas said, "but with the perspective of history, it's clearer to me. I realize now the enormous hurdles she's had to overcome and the enormous amount of garbage she's had to put up with.
"It would not have occurred to me that these things could happen if they had not happened to Roxanne. I had tremendous faith in the system. I thought it would support the ladies and give them the same opportunities the men enjoyed. That it didn't is deplorable and makes me feel extremely disappointed."
Several times over the years, her husband and father say, Commander Baxter, was left behind from lengthy sea missions that would have furthered her career and given adverse fitness reports by superiors who did not hide their opposition to women in the armed forces, while other superiors gave her glowing assessments.
On Commander Baxter's one lengthy sea mission, in which she was the only woman among 500 men, she was the brunt of smutty skits, her husband and father say. And once, she was forcibly removed from an office by a man who did not want to take instructions from a woman, then told that if she pressed charges she would be removed as a department head.
The two men also wonder whether a recent promotion denied to Commander Baxter was because she had testified about the events at Tailhook.
In his frustration after the scandal, Mr. Baxter wrote to Representative Schroeder of Colorado, a senior member of the House Armed Services Committee and a longtime advocate for women in the military. Mr. Thomas, in a recent telephone interview, said he intends to do the same. Both men say they worry that the immediate fallout of the Tailhook scandal could be increased hostility toward the women, even if the long-term results are beneficial.
Mr. Baxter, who met his wife-to-be in flight school in Corpus Christi, Tex., said he often chats with current and former Navy aviators in his reserve unit and on the job as an American Airlines pilot. Some of these men, who do not know his wife in a pilot, grumble that women should not be aviators and that they are to blame for the recent tumult in the Navy, such as the dismissal and reassignment of highly placed officers and the end to nude dancing at officers' clubs.
 
Outrage of the Sexists
 "There are a lot of hardcore sexists out there and this only enrages them and encourages them in their conviction that women have no place in the Navy," Mr. Baxter said.
Mr. Thomas said that he, too, has seen examples of hostility. At the Sears store where he works, he often cannot resist bragging about his daughter to his customers, most of them Navy men. "A lot of them don't want to hear it," Mr. Thomas said. "Their egos are threatened and when I argue with them they huff out the door."
Ms. Schroeder's office keeps receiving letters of complaint about sexual harassment of enlisted women and officers. The majority of the two dozen letters come from fathers and husbands, not from the women themselves, who are presumably frightened that tattling will doom their careers.
Among the recent letters is a plea for help from a retired marine officer in Oceanside, Calif., whose daughter is an Air Force mechanic in Germany. She is being threatened with an unfavorable, career-threatening fitness report, he said, if she refuses sex with her commanding officer.
Another father, a 20-year Navy enlisted man and now a civilian employee at Fort McNair, Wash., wrote seeking justice for his daughter. He said that she celebrated the end of basic training in Orlando by getting drunk and wound up raped by a petty officer, abandoned in a dumpster behind the officer's club and then discharged against her wishes without an investigation into the assault.
 
Father Encouraged Her
 The rape victim's father, Frank Kochniarczyk, said he encouraged his divorced, unemployed and rebellious daughter to enlist in the Navy as a way of pulling her life together. "I believed she needed discipline and I believed the Navy would give it to her," he said during a coffee break at the Army base where he works. "I trusted them and they failed miserably."
This sense of betrayal permeates the comments of men who have beamed with pride when their daughters followed them into the military and then seen their hopes dashed.
"To see the system you dedicated your life to violate your trust is a crushing disappointment," said a senior Army officer in the Pentagon, who has had two daughters in the Armed Forces.
Carolyn Becraft, a military policy consultant in Washington and a former Army captain, agreed. "This is a system these men upheld all their lives; it is their calling, their church," said Ms. Becraft, whose husband and father are both Army officers. "Their daughter is an extension of them, a chip off the old block. When these things happen, it is a personal and painful epiphany."
For Mr. Baxter and Mr. Thomas, that epiphany includes understanding why aggrieved military women are loath to speak. It was loyalty and pride that kept Commander Baxter from publicly speaking out, her father said, adding: "She's reluctant to be a stool pigeon, so to speak. She doesn't like to gripe."
Mr. Baxter sees a more practical motive for his wife's silence: the risk to her career. "If her name is in print saying anything damaging, she could well find herself on a black list, with her next assignment on Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean," Mr. Baxter said.

HEADLINE: Income Gains Seen for Minorities in the New York Region

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
Despite the deep recession that has engulfed the New York region since the end of the 1980's, the boom that preceded it raised incomes faster than in most of the rest of nation and pared down the huge disparities in earnings among whites, blacks and Hispanic residents, new census data show.
The data, released last week by the U.S. Census Bureau, did little to dispel the broad belief that the 1980's, more than most decades that preceded it, was one in which the gap between rich and poor widened. But it provided a fresh demographic snapshot that suggests that wealth and poverty no longer conform to traditional patterns of race or ethnicity, and that more minorities have ascended the economic order in the New York region. 
 A major factor in the economic gains of minorities was an increase in their education. Although black and Hispanic people are still far more likely than whites to drop out of school, according to the census report, the proportion of people in all groups to obtain high school and college degrees nationwide grew in the 1980's.
The census data also underscored the gains that have been made by people of Asian descent in the New York region -- which includes New York, New Jersey and Connecticut -- and elsewhere. Asians had higher incomes and more education than people of any other ethnic or racial group in the 1980's.
 
Attributed to Service Sector
 Between 1979 and 1989, median incomes more than doubled in New Jersey and Connecticut. The census data show that residents of Connecticut, with median household earnings of $41,721 in 1989, were the highest-paid in the nation. New Jersey residents ranked third, behind those in Alaska, with a median of $40,927 for 1989. Under census definitions, a household can be a single person or a family residing under the same roof. The median income is the point at which there is an equal number of people making more and making less.
In New York, the report said, median household income rose by 95 percent during the decade, to $32,956 in 1989, or 10 percent higher than the national median. Ten years earlier, the median earnings for New York State residents had been slightly lower than the national median.
Economists attributed the income growth to rapid expansion, particularly from 1980 to 1988, in Wall Street brokerage houses, law firms, engineering companies, and a host of other technologically advanced, service-oriented companies.
Indeed, while the region continued to lose factory jobs in the 1980's, economic studies show, there were far greater losses before the decade began, and the region benefited from being less dependent than other parts of the country on manufacturing enterprises.
 
Gains for Blacks
 The New York region "took its biggest hits in manufacturing during the 1970's," said William Frey, a researcher in the Population Studies Center at the University of Michigan. "By the 80's, it had moved rapidly in service industries, and they did well for most of the decade."
But the decade's economic strength was not spread evenly across the region. While median incomes rose rapidly, experts said, the rise in the 1980's, more than in any previous decade, was influenced by the extraordinarily high salaries paid to a small number of executives in the securities industry, law and other fields.
"The rich got richer," said Rosemary Scanlon, chief economist for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. "For most people, real wages did not grow."
Still, the census data showed that black workers in the region reaped the economic rewards of the 1980's to a larger degree than in previous decades. Although the gap between the median incomes of blacks and whites has always been huge, and has remained so, it narrowed somewhat. In at least one part of the region, in Queens, the median income for black households has virtually matched that of white households, figures show.
 
Hispanic and Asian Residents
 The data showed that in New York State, black households had median incomes in 1989 of $24,089, or 73 percent of the median for all state residents. That is compared with a median of $11,150 for black households statewide in 1979, or 67 percent of the state's overall median.
In New Jersey, the median for black households rose to 71 percent from 64 percent of the state's median during the decade. In Connecticut, the median for blacks rose to 67 percent from 62 percent of the state's median.
The data showed that Hispanic residents fared worse, but their earnings gained slightly during the decade. People who described themselves as Hispanic in New York State made 66 percent of the state's median household income in 1989, compared with 62 percent 10 years earlier. In New Jersey, their earnings rose from 68 percent to 73 percent of the median, and in Connecticut they rose from 59 to 60 percent of the median.
The group with the highest earnings in the region, as elsewhere in the nation, was people of Asian descent. The 1989 median income among Asians in New York was $36,784: in New Jersey it was $52,846, and in Connecticut it was $48,560.
The income gains by minorities were also a result of gains in education. The data show that by 1990, 64.7 percent of black residents in New York State had a high school education, compared with 57.6 percent 10 years earlier.
In New Jersey, 67 percent of the black residents had completed high school in 1989, up from 56.4 percent in 1980; and in Connecticut, the percentage of black high school graduates rose to 67 percent from 56.8 percent.
