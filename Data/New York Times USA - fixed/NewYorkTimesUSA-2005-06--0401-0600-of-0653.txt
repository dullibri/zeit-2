 BODY:
The level of trust between the French and Americans is at its lowest in 17 years, according to a poll published by Le Monde. The survey of 1,000 people in each country, carried out by the polling firm TNS Sofres, found that only 31 percent of the French had ''sympathy'' for Americans, down from 39 percent in September 2002. About 35 percent of American respondents said they liked the French, down from 50 percent in September 2002. The survey also showed that both French and American respondents' views had changed on whether the two countries were partners or adversaries: only 39 percent of the French respondents believe that the United States and France are first and foremost partners, down from 50 percent in September 2002, while 45 percent of Americans see the two countries as partners, a sharp drop from 68 percent in September 2002.

HEADLINE: At Paris Air Show, Yachts That Fly

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: LE BOURGET, France, June 16 

 BODY:
Despite an hourlong wait under rainy skies, visitors flocked to see Bombardier's luxurious private jet, the Global 5000, which was on display this week at the Paris Air Show here, looking a bit like a Porsche parked among Volkswagens.
 Dry and cozy inside, potential buyers tried the wireless entertainment system, ran their hands over the polished wood trim and listened to Bombardier's sales representatives explain why the visitors just had to own this $35 million airplane. (Among other things, it is speedy, flying from Chicago to Paris in less time than it takes Gulfstream's rival G450 to fly from Chicago to London.)
 The market for business jets is booming again, after a steep downdraft following the collapse of technology stocks in 2000. Sales jumped 18 percent in 2004 over the previous year, and they are continuing this year at a double-digit pace, thanks to the buoyant American economy, which has fattened corporate profits and personal bank accounts. 
 ''This is a feast-or-famine business,'' said James Hoblyn, the vice president for Bombardier's business aircraft division, before dashing off to a customer meeting in search of his next meal.
 As the orders flow in, some entrepreneurs are trying to stretch the definition of private jets -- both upward and downward. The Texas billionaire Robert M. Bass was here to promote his plans for a supersonic corporate jet from his Aerion Corporation. Vern Raburn, a former Microsoft executive and the chief executive of Eclipse Aviation, was talking up his cheap -- well, $1.3 million -- private jet, which he says will be used as an airborne taxi.
 ''In some ways, our companies share characteristics,'' said Mr. Raburn, who says he has 2,200 orders for his plane. ''We're both trying to do the same thing, which is to save people's time.''
 Surprisingly, perhaps, some analysts give the supersonic jet better odds of success than the shoestring one. In recent years, sales of large jets, some costing close to $50 million, have been more robust than entry-level models. Like yachts, the size of cruise ships or resort-scale beach houses, fancy planes have become a totem of success among the extremely rich.
 ''It's the growing gap between the incredible, out-of-sight wealthy and the merely rich that drives this market,'' said Richard L. Aboulafia, vice president for research at the Teal Group, an aerospace concern in Fairfax, Va.
 Brian E. Barents, the vice chairman of Mr. Bass's venture, said the demand for supersonic jets would be driven, at least in part, by status and one-upmanship. ''We benefit from the 'my toy is bigger than your toy' phenomenon,'' he said.
 In this case, of course, the toy is not bigger but faster. Aerion's plan is to build a needle-nose, eight-seat aircraft able to fly 1.6 times the speed of sound while over water, and just under the sound barrier over land. That would permit it to fly within the United States, where regulations prohibit supersonic civilian planes because of their sonic booms.
 Aerion has tested its design and is seeking commercial partners to build the jet, with a goal of delivering the first one around 2011. The company thinks it can price the plane at close to $80 million, and still compete with slower jets from Gulfstream or Bombardier.
 Bombardier, which vies with Gulfstream as the largest maker of business jets, says it is not worried about losing buyers who yearn for their own Concorde, whose last flight was October 2003. ''A bunch of our customers would love to fly at supersonic speeds,'' Mr. Hoblyn said. ''But I have trouble with the business case.''
 Any supersonic jet, he noted, will have a cramped cabin not unlike that in the Concorde. The Global 5000 is spacious, with ample headroom and enough floor space to create two cabins, one with a divan that can be used for naps.
 Mr. Barents replies by quoting Bill Lear, a corporate-jet pioneer, who once said of his snug Learjet, ''You can't stand up in a Cadillac, either.''
 People are already willing to pay large premiums for faster versions of existing planes, Mr. Barents said, like the popular Cessna Citation 10. The Aerion jet will be able to fly from New York to Tokyo in 9 hours, 33 minutes, including a one-hour fuel stop in Anchorage. That compares with 14 hours, 21 minutes nonstop in a standard subsonic airliner.
 ''There's been a void in the marketplace since the Concorde retired,'' Mr. Barents said. ''We have an old saying in this industry: higher, faster, farther. Well, no one is going faster right now.''
 Mr. Raburn sees a void in the marketplace, too. But he thinks it is on the lower end, among people who would pay for the convenience of using a private jet from time to time, but do not want to own one, or even a share in one -- the fractional ownership model pioneered by NetJets.
 His company, Eclipse Aviation, based in Albuquerque, has built a six-seat jet that will sell for $1.3 million. In inflation-adjusted dollars, that is less than half the price of the first Learjet, introduced in the early 1960's. 
 Mr. Raburn says it will create a market for air taxis: services that send a plane to an outlying airport when a customer requests a flight.
 Last month, Eclipse signed its first deal with an air-taxi service, DayJet, for 239 planes over five years. DayJet says it will be able to charge people only slightly more than a full-fare economy ticket.
 Mr. Raburn, who helped Paul G. Allen, the Microsoft billionaire, choose the Boeing 757 he uses as a private plane, sees a limit to the hunger for extravagant jets.
 ''There isn't anything more ostentatious and extreme than a G550,'' Gulfstream's top model, he said,.
 ''Our market,'' he said, ''is the merely rich guys who are looking for convenience in business travel. They're the ones who will pay $500 more to take a corporate jet rather than a commercial flight.''

HEADLINE: Treasury Yields Rise Again, Spurring Talk of a Trend

BYLINE: By RIVA D. ATLAS

 BODY:
What goes down must come up. 
 That is the logic behind the hopes of many traders this week that a rise in yields on 10-year Treasury notes will stick, reversing a recent decline that has even Alan Greenspan scratching his head.
 Yields on the Treasury notes ended the week slightly higher at 4.07 percent, compared with 4.05 percent a week earlier. This is the second consecutive week of rising yields, reversing a long decline that culminated in yields sinking to a 52-week low of 3.89 percent on June 1. 
 The rising yields came amid a series of encouraging economic reports that also contributed to a surge in stock prices. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index ended the week up 18.85 points, or 1.57 percent, to 1,216.96. Yesterday's six-point climb erased prior losses for the index for the year, with the S.&P. now showing a modest 0.42 percent gain for the year. The Nasdaq composite index rose 27.11 points, or 1.31 percent, to close at 2,090.11, while the Dow rose 110.47 points, or 1.05 percent, to 10,623.07. The Dow and the Nasdaq continue to show losses for the year, 1.48 percent and 3.92 percent, respectively.
 But even as some analysts hailed the recent market shifts, skeptics said that lingering uncertainties about the economy could drive Treasury yields -- and stock prices -- back down over the next few months.
 Yields have been dropping on Treasuries, even as the Federal Reserve has been raising short-term interest rates. That has baffled traders, with many investment banks suffering trading losses last quarter amid the steep decline. Mr. Greenspan in a speech earlier this year referred to the depressed yields as a ''conundrum.''
 Prices for Treasury bonds, which move in the opposite direction from yields, fell this week amid several positive indicators on the economy, culminating in yesterday's bullish report from the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey. 
 A stronger economy generally leads to higher stock prices, and makes the safe haven of Treasury bonds less attractive to investors. Lower Treasury yields typically lead to reduced mortgage rates.
 ''The good news about the economy offset the bad news of short-term interest rates continuing to head higher,'' said Hugh A. Johnson Jr., chief investment officer of Johnson Illington Advisors, a money management firm based in Albany.
 ''The message is that this economic cycle has longer to go,'' a sign that stock prices are likely to rise, but Treasury yields will, too, he said.
 When Lehman Brothers reported its earnings on Tuesday, its chief administrative officer, David Goldfarb, predicted that Treasury yields would reach 4.7 percent by year's end.
 Still, analysts pointed to several lingering worries, any of which could cause the economy, and the direction of the markets, to reverse. These include a bursting of the bubble in housing prices, a significant slowdown in the Chinese economy, and the rising price of oil, which closed at $58.47 a barrel this week.
 The continued uncertainty about the direction of the economy, and bond prices, was apparent on Thursday, when the Federal Reserve's Philadelphia branch reported an unexpected decline in its manufacturing index. Yields on Treasuries dropped slightly to 4.069 percent. Yields were essentially unchanged at 4.07 percent yesterday, despite the positive economic report.
 Some large bond fund managers are still not confident that in the long term, yields will head much higher. 
 ''Everyone has been calling for higher yields for months, and they have all been wrong,'' said James Keller, who oversees $100 billion worth of government bond investments for Pimco, the giant bond fund manager. 
 Jeffrey Gundlach, president of the TCW Asset Management Company, which manages $80 billion in portfolios for pension funds and other institutions, said, ''We got to a situation where Treasuries were overbought.'' While yields could move higher in the short term, he says they will remain well below 5 percent.
 A year after the Fed began raising short-term interest rates, Mr. Gundlach says the Fed is two-thirds through the process. Sometime in the six months, he said, the Fed will stop raising rates, setting the stage for it to reverse course, and begin lowering rates, sometime next year. A decline in short-term rates would probably lead to a drop in longer-term bond yields as well, he said.
 Investors will also probably remain attracted to the Treasury market, despite the relatively low yields. A report this week indicating a lower-than-expected increase amount of debt purchased by foreigners was not significant enough to presage a long-term decline, Mr. Gundlach said. 
 He also pointed to weak returns this year for hedge funds, which are investment partnerships for wealthy individuals and large institutions like pension funds. Those funds on average are returning less than 1 percent so far this year.
 But other investors continue to anticipate a prolonged reversal in Treasury yields. Mr. Johnson said that, despite the uncertainties, he believes that yields will continue to rise. ''I believe we will muddle through,'' he said. ''But I have my fingers tightly crossed.''

HEADLINE: The Train! The Train!

BYLINE: By Gene Russianoff. 
Gene Russianoff is a lawyer for the New York Public Interest Research Group's Straphangers Campaign.

 BODY:
THIS week, in the wake of the failed West Side stadium project, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg agreed to help the Mets and the Yankees build new ballparks that could be used if New York City wins its bid for the 2012 Olympics. Those projects may have their good points, but Mr. Bloomberg has neglected a project that would have a far greater impact: the Second Avenue subway line. 
 The best way to revive Lower Manhattan -- and give a boost to Midtown -- is to build a subway line that carries people from Harlem and the East Side to work downtown. This would be a wonderfully appropriate way to spend 9/11 funds. 
 A Second Avenue subway line would better the lives of about 600,000 riders by giving them another transportation option and relieving crowded conditions on the Lexington Avenue line. Right now, the Lexington Avenue's three lines, the No.'s 4, 5 and 6, carry 40 percent of the 23-line system's riders. The crowded trains are an ordeal for rush-hour riders and a disincentive for businesses to move downtown. 
 The project would also make good economic sense. According to the Regional Plan Association, the new line would offer time and trip savings of $1.26 billion a year -- that's in addition to the 70,000 construction jobs it would generate. 
 Sadly, the project is in some financial peril. The ''minimum operating segment,'' as the federal government calls the first phase of the Second Avenue subway line, would attract hundreds of thousands of people. (This is the stretch that would go from Harlem to Midtown and then on to Brooklyn through an existing line.) But the $3.6 billion first phase needs about $2.5 billion to be completed in the next seven years, and unfortunately Albany didn't allocate enough money for the first phase in the most recent state budget.
 As a result, a dangerous idea is now afloat: additional borrowing. This would saddle the subway's seven million daily riders with higher fares and deeper cuts, resulting in more maintenance problems. 
 Thankfully, there's a smart way out. Instead of borrowing, let's use 9/11 federal funds for the Second Avenue line. And there's precedent. New centers for the PATH trains and the South Ferry terminal are already using terrorist recovery funds and work will begin soon on a federally financed transit center at the Fulton Street and Broadway-Nassau stations. 
 But for the Second Avenue subway to happen, Mayor Bloomberg and Gov. George E. Pataki need to become stronger champions for the project. 
 Here's what the mayor should do. The City of New York gives only $75 million a year to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's general repair program. For 20 years, the city gave $100 million to $200 million annually. The city is flusher today and more money could go to stations like two downtown Chambers Street stations, dropped from the authority's repair program. Other decrepit stations, including those in Bensonhurst and Forest Hills, could also benefit.
 The governor's first step should be to direct $80 million of 9/11 funds to the Cortlandt Street station. Although it was the only subway station destroyed in the collapse of the twin towers, its restoration would be inexplicably borne by the riding public, through the system's general repair program.
 Some argue that it would be hard to make the case in Washington for a Second Avenue subway getting Sept. 11 funds. But conventional wisdom is often wrong. 
 New York shows over and over again that victory can be snatched from defeat. Supporters of the Westway project, which would have created a highway through landfill under the environmentally sensitive waters of the Hudson River, lament its 1985 failure. But they neglect to mention the $1.4 billion its trade-in raised for new subway cars at a critical time. And for years, downtown was told that there was going to be a four-block, $860 million West Street tunnel next to ground zero, but after years of local protest and business objections, this boondoggle has been abandoned and some $500 million to $600 million of federal 9/11 funds are now up for grabs. 
 What more fitting recipient for 9/11 funds is there than a subway to downtown that helps New Yorkers get back to work?

HEADLINE: Quarterly Trade Gap Hits $195 Billion

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 17 

 BODY:
The United States hit a record deficit of $195.1 billion in the first quarter in trade and capital flows with the rest of the world, the Commerce Department reported Friday. The news reignited worries that the economy cannot sustain the growing level of global debt.
 If this pace continues, the United States' current account deficit could reach $780 billion this year, a sharp increase from last year's record of $617 billion.
 The United States continued to attract foreign investments at relatively low interest rates, and the rate of growth in the trade imbalance has slowed. But the direction remains the same, and the overall current account deficit now stands at a 6.4 percent of gross domestic product, also a record. 
 ''Clearly the current account deficit can't go on like this forever,'' said Daniel T. Griswold, director of the Cato Institute's center for trade policy studies, a conservative research group that has generally not worried about the United States' trade gap. 
 Economists agree that the drop in the value of the dollar is only beginning to help redress the trade imbalance, in part because China and Japan are enjoying what they see as significantly undervalued currencies. The Bush administration has been pressing China and other Asian nations to revalue their currencies. 
 The White House, in general, sees the widening current-account deficit as a sign of strength in the United States and weakness elsewhere. 
 ''It shows overwhelmingly that the United States economy is showing remarkable strength compared to our European trading partners and generating a lot more income for Americans to buy a lot more foreign goods,'' said Tony Fratto, a Treasury Department spokesman.
 According to this analysis, the responsibility for altering the trade imbalance lies with Europe and Japan, not the United States. Those foreign economies, officials argue, have to restructure their economies and start buying more American goods and consume more of what they produce domestically.
 Rob Portman, the United States trade representative, met with Peter Mandelson, his European counterpart, on Friday ahead of the United States-European summit meeting on Monday. Both men tried to shift the emphasis away from recent trade disputes, like the lawsuits over subsidies paid to Boeing and Airbus, and instead promote the effectiveness of the overall trade relationship.
 ''We have so much in common,'' Mr. Portman said.
 He was followed by Mr. Mandelson who said that the two men ''had not only a very constructive meeting but a very enjoyable meeting.''
 Both men said they were still open to a negotiated settlement in the long-simmering dispute over government subsidies to Boeing and Airbus. Formal discussions on an agreement broke down last month, and both sides filed cases with the World Trade Organization. While the two officials did not rule out a deal, they offered few specifics about any talks.
 ''The channels of communication between us are open,'' Mr. Mandelson said. 
 In the meantime, however, the United States borrows, in essence, $2.1 billion every day to keep the economy afloat, according to the calculations of Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC.
 Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, said the deficit figure was reaching ''dangerous levels that are hurting this country's future.''
 ''This deficit manifests itself in the lives of American families every day with the loss of jobs overseas, lower wages and a feeling of less security,'' Mr. Dorgan contended. 
 Several economists said that while the figures remain disappointing, one of the reasons for the unexpectedly wide gap was a $3.3 billion increase in aid to other countries, in part a reflection of the relief sent to Southeast Asia after the tsunami hit last December.
 ''It's nothing to be cheerful about, but the magnitude of the relief payments and donations holds the potential to distort these figures,'' said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at Wachovia in Charlotte, N.C.
 Many economists say the United States should save more and spend less, especially the federal government. Mr. Griswold of Cato said nothing in the budget should be immune from serious cuts, including the military budget and entitlements.
 But Robert E. Scott, senior analyst at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research group, said that it was ''ludicrous to think the deficit is caused by a shortfall in savings.''
 The deficit, he said, is caused by the nation's voracious appetite for foreign goods and its inability to sell enough overseas to balance those purchases. ''Just to keep the gap from growing, exports would have to increase 78 percent faster than they actually did,'' Mr. Scott said. ''That's the bad news; the wider the gap, the more difficult it is to turn this economy around.''
 The argument about the cause of these deficits is spilling over into the debate over the Central American Free Trade Agreement, the centerpiece of the administration's trade agenda this year. Representative Benjamin L. Cardin, the Maryland Democrat and ranking member of the trade subcommittee of the Ways and Means Committee, said on Friday that the soaring deficit showed the administration's trade strategy was failing.
 ''It says we are still hemorrhaging,'' Mr. Cardin said. ''We are still moving in the wrong direction and the size of the deficit raises serious questions about our ability to control our own destiny.''

HEADLINE: G.M.'s Small-Car Glass Is Now Half Full

BYLINE: By JEFF SABATINI

 BODY:
I HAVE yet to read the headline, ''Vultures Circle Renaissance Center,'' but as the bad news has multiplied with each passing week, certainly a member of the press must have been assigned to bird-watching duty at General Motors' global headquarters in Detroit. 
 Not a day has gone by in the past month that has not brought some pundit's proclamations of G.M.'s impending demise. A confluence of events -- from slowing S.U.V. sales to multiple debt-rating downgrades, the meddling of the financier Kirk Kerkorian and the announcement of more plant closings and layoffs -- has darkened skies over Detroit. But if a ray of sunshine exists, it is this: Despite the legions of truly awful products G.M. has built in the past three decades, its newest models are vastly improved and generally likable. 
 The compact Chevrolet Cobalt, for instance, hints at a brighter future. It will eventually replace the despicable Cavalier in Chevy's lineup (for the time being, 2005 models of both cars are crowding dealer lots), slotting between the subcompact Aveo and midsize Malibu. The Cobalt is a good car, if not a great one, and it is certainly a creditable competitor to the Toyota Corolla, Honda Civic and most other $15,000 cars on the market. 
 The Cobalt's base price, including shipping, is $14,190, although under G.M.'s current ''Employee Discount for Everyone'' promotion (which runs through July 5), this number drops to $12,471. As low as those numbers sound, it is possible to push the price of a Cobalt beyond $20,000.
 Available as a front-wheel-drive sedan or coupe, the Cobalt is powered by a 2.2-liter version of G.M.'s Ecotec 4-cylinder engine that produces 145 horsepower and 155 pound-feet of torque. Those are good numbers for this segment -- Toyota's standard Corolla has a 1.8-liter 4-cylinder with 130 horsepower and 125 pound-feet of torque -- and the Cobalt hustles around pretty well, even when equipped with an optional four-speed automatic transmission.
 There is a price to be paid for those horses, however, as an automatic Cobalt sedan is rated at 24 miles a gallon in the city and 32 on the highway by the Environmental Protection Agency. The Corolla's numbers are better by six miles a gallon in both situations, in large part because it is lighter; the Corolla weighs in about 275 pounds less than the 2,868-pound Cobalt.
 The Cobalt's suspension and steering are better than most cars in this class. G.M. has hit a sweet spot for cheap-car ride, achieving a nice compromise between cushy and responsive. The Cobalt did not sway me from my belief that the Mazda 3 is the best-handling compact car extant, nor was its steering as taut as that of the Ford Focus, but many drivers will prefer the Chevy's softer ride and slightly overassisted steering.
 Though both Cobalt body styles are attractive, the coupe is the shapelier car, just as it should be. Its long hood and short trunk lid recall classic muscle car proportions, but this is no exercise in retro styling, as its sloping rear window and wraparound fascias front and rear are thoroughly modern. While its round tail lamps do nod to Chevrolets past, the coupe's tough rear end could just as easily be mistaken for that of a Ferrari 360 Modena. Squint too long at the Cobalt sedan, however, and you might mistake it for a 2005 Volkswagen Jetta.
 G.M.'s design team has captured the essence of Chevy styling in the Cobalt, taking an inoffensively generic car shape, making its lines crisp and simple, then ornamenting it with just a few interesting details. The approach carries over to the interior, which is thankfully utilitarian, generally comfortable and only embarrassing when clad with chintzy accents of fake wood. Fortunately, metal-look trim is optional.
 Regardless of how the cabin is dressed up, the materials are of good enough quality and seem to be well assembled. All Cobalts have a good-looking gauge package with a display that reports fuel economy and outside temperature among other functions, a nice touch for a car in this price class.
 The Cobalt's safety rating is a concern, as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the sedan only two stars (out of a maximum of five) for its performance in front-seat side-impact testing. This was an improvement over the Cavalier, which earned only one star in the same test. 
 In other government tests, the Cobalt did better, scoring fours and fives. But basic safety features like antilock brakes and traction control are optional on base models and side curtain air bags cost extra on all levels of the Cobalt.
 My other issues with the car are less serious. Its exhaust tone could be improved; either quieter or louder would be preferable to sounding like a vacuum cleaner. The coupe's trunk opening is too small, a problem that could have been rectified, and should have been, by making the car a hatchback. 
 When all is said and done, nothing about the Cobalt is truly outstanding, just as nothing is egregiously wrong. In this competitive market segment, it stands as a solid effort, though it is not likely to win any car of the year awards. Still, G.M. has not sold a good small car since it last hawked the Prizm, a Chevy-badged version of the Toyota Corolla that disappeared in 2002. That the Cobalt is a true G.M. product says that this beleaguered company may indeed have a chance.

INSIDE TRACK: May Chevy never have to speak of the Cavalier again.

BYLINE: By Arthur Lubow. 
Arthur Lubow, a contributing writer, last wrote for the magazine about the Japanese artist Takashi Murakami.

 BODY:
Clive Gillinson transformed himself from musician into manager at a moment of crisis. In 1984, the London Symphony Orchestra was more than $600,000 in debt and sinking. The orchestra moved two years earlier into the Barbican Center, a mazelike modern-arts complex located in the City, the financial district, which in those days shut down after dark. In that confusing and out-of-the-way destination, the orchestra administration programmed unorthodox concerts (a festival of Berlioz and Michael Tippett, for example) in tightly clustered stretches. Each Barbican concert lost an average of $3,000. An orchestra that is governed by its players, the L.S.O. reacted to this desperate plight with an act of desperation. It forced out its managing director and, looking within the ranks, recruited Gillinson, a young cellist whose chief business credential was running an antiques shop with his wife in his spare time. Before accepting, the prudent cellist insisted that his chair in the orchestra be kept open for a year in case the new job didn't work out. Just as characteristically, however, he never looked back. 
 Within two years, the L.S.O. had balanced its books, and Gillinson was charging ahead. ''He's been one of the most decisive figures on the cultural scene generally, someone who has made a really distinctive change in the stature of his organization over the years,'' says Nicholas Kenyon, director of the BBC Proms summer classical music festival. Gillinson never lost sight of his long-range goals. Even while he was piling on lackluster commercial gigs to pay the bills, he periodically presented ambitious programs to secure the L.S.O.'s reputation. As the financial crisis abated, he raised the stakes. In the past few years, he has started an in-house recording label and opened a state-of-the-art education center. To do so, he needed to persuade the musicians to back financially risky undertakings that offered no short-term payoffs. In the hidebound world of classical music, the slightest deviation from traditional procedure is usually regarded as unsupportable heresy. Somehow, Gillinson got away with it. ''He was very inventive, and he was always finding money,'' says Pierre Boulez, who has been a regular guest conductor at the L.S.O. for more than 20 years. ''The musicians were very confident with him, because they knew he was a good man for ideas and intentions. Also, they were in safe hands for the money situation. They like to be adventurous, but at the same time, they like to be safe.'' Under Gillinson's leadership, the players have fought to establish the L.S.O. as the foremost British brand in classical music.
 On July 1, Gillinson, who is 59, will take over as executive and artistic director of an institution that carries the leading American brand name in classical music: Carnegie Hall. The match of the British orchestra manager and the New York concert hall makes immediate sense. In this country, Carnegie Hall is celebrated for its burnished sound and hallowed history, a combination that seems downright European; whereas in Britain, Gillinson's competitiveness and singlemindedness -- his ambition to leave his rivals shriveled and gasping in the dust -- often came off as aggressively American. ''When I first got to know him in 1985, Clive said, 'The U.K. needs one super-orchestra, and it's going to be the L.S.O.,''' says David Whelton, managing director of another prominent London orchestra, the Philharmonia. ''He's done a great deal, but if that was his objective, it hasn't been met.''
 In New York, Gillinson will find, along with a cultural climate that values victory over good sportsmanship, a brand of underdeveloped potential. Since it opened in 1891 with Tchaikovsky on the podium, Carnegie Hall has witnessed many great moments in American musical history. The premiere of Dvorak's ''New World'' symphony, the United States debut of the 16-year-old Jascha Heifetz and the return from retirement of Vladimir Horowitz are standouts. George Gershwin's ''An American in Paris'' made its debut at Carnegie Hall. Isadora Duncan, Ruth St. Denis and Martha Graham danced there. Judy Garland, Lenny Bruce, Frank Sinatra and Bob Dylan entertained there. Yet despite its venerable 114-year-old patina, Carnegie Hall is actually a young institution. In 1960, it narrowly escaped demolition, and it emerged from that near-death experience reborn. In its former life, it was a rental hall, a place for soloists or musical ensembles to hire out. On many nights it still fills that function, but since 1960 it has evolved from a landlord into a presenting institution, booking performers for a fee and then selling tickets to recoup costs. 
 The transition hasn't always been smooth. Until it completed a major renovation in 1986, Carnegie Hall, like the L.S.O. of that era, was worrying -- in its case, literally -- that the roof might fall in. When I asked Citigroup's chairman, Sanford Weill, the powerful head of the Carnegie board, if he had a vision for Carnegie Hall when he became a trustee in 1983, he said, ''I knew that it shouldn't be a place where the bathrooms leaked into the boxes.'' More recently, the growth of Carnegie Hall has been stunted by the deaths of its two most effective administrators. In 1998, Judith Arron died at 56 of breast cancer, after managing the hall for 12 years. Except for the violinist Isaac Stern, who led the fight to preserve Carnegie Hall and then served as president until his death in 2001, no one did more than Arron to forge the organization's modern path. By masterminding the creation of an intermediate-size basement space, Zankel Hall, which has 600 seats, she enabled Carnegie to present innovative artists who aren't mainstream enough to fill the 2,800-seat main auditorium (which is named for Stern).
 After a brief, bumpy interregnum, Arron was succeeded by Robert Harth, whose eclectic musical taste ensured that Zankel Hall would present jazz and contemporary and world music, as well as more traditional fare. Harth may be best remembered, however, for what did not happen on his watch. In the spring of 2003, Carnegie Hall and the New York Philharmonic announced a planned merger, which would have returned the orchestra to its former home. The philharmonic's elopement to Lincoln Center was what threatened Carnegie Hall's survival back in 1960. At that time, the City of New York came to the rescue, buying the building and leasing it to the nonprofit Carnegie Hall Corporation. More than four decades later, as the philharmonic faced a decision on renovating its aging and acoustically imperfect residence at Lincoln Center, both sides dreamed of erasing the past. As they negotiated, however, Harth and his board concluded that the abdication of the philharmonic, its linchpin tenant, had transformed Carnegie Hall so fundamentally that it made no sense to bring the orchestra back. Meanwhile, the New York Philharmonic was discovering that Carnegie's own programming and commitments would not allow the number of concerts and rehearsals the orchestra demanded. A few months after both sides abandoned the merger, Harth died of a heart attack. He was 47.
 As Harth's successor, Gillinson leads an institution that is pointed forward. Carnegie Hall has patched, scrubbed and expanded its interior. By closing the door on the philharmonic, it has reaffirmed its commitment to its own programs. In the music world, its board is unmatched for cash and clout, with trustees like Ronald O. Perelman, Jerry Speyer and Peter Jennings. Its endowment stands at $164 million or, if promised gifts are added in, at $210 million, which is about 25 times the L.S.O. endowment. At this point in its history, everyone can agree that Carnegie Hall is not just a building. But what is it? It comprises three halls -- Stern Auditorium, Zankel Hall and Weill Recital Hall -- which have distinctly different sizes but somewhat blurry individual presences. One-third of Carnegie Hall's endowment has been earmarked for education activities, which sometimes -- as with the popular, budget-priced Family Concerts -- are scheduled at the hall, but usually take place off-site in schools and community centers. However, what chiefly prevents Carnegie Hall from transmitting a clear identity is its split personality. Although no longer only a rental hall, it is still a rental hall. On a given weekend, the Berlin Philharmonic or the Chicago Symphony Orchestra might be playing in Stern Auditorium in a concert program presented by Carnegie. Just as plausibly, the hall could be hired out for a base fee of $12,250, more or less on a first-come-first-served basis, and the concert be given by the University Glee Club of Tokyo or the Grand Rapids Symphony. Two-thirds of the roughly 250 concerts in a season at Stern Auditorium are rentals. 
 Franz Xaver Ohnesorg, who ran Carnegie Hall in the interval between Arron and Harth, floated the idea of drastically reducing the number of rentals. The idea never took flight. ''I personally believe the rentals should not be thrown out,'' Klaus Jacobs, a longtime board member who became acting executive director after Harth's death, told me. ''They present concerts, orchestras, artists, which we would not present. I'm not saying it's a different tier.'' At this, he smiled: we both knew that the performers he spoke of belonged in a different tier, or even in a different arena altogether. He added, ''I think they have a certain right to present themselves in a city-owned institution.'' Ara Guzelimian, Carnegie's well-regarded artistic adviser, made a similar argument: ''It's a city-owned hall, and barring some extreme concern about the far edges of appropriateness, the hall is open and available for rental.'' Part of the hall's national reputation rests on the reports in local newspapers of the hometown orchestra or pianist achieving that pinnacle, a Carnegie Hall recital.
 Yet when I raised the question of whether there is too much rental programming with Gillinson, he allowed that it was something he had discussed with both Jacobs and Guzelimian. ''We've talked a lot about that,'' he said. ''Everyone there has a very strong feeling, which I understand and value, that one of the great strengths of Carnegie is, it belongs to the city. When other organizations want to present themselves there, to some extent this is a service that Carnegie gives to people who care about music. The other side is, you have less control over what is presented. On the face of it, I can see lots of strengths in the arrangement as it is. But like anything, you always have to keep challenging and testing yourself on your basic premises to see if they are really valid. I have no idea what the answer is, but the important thing is, you keep asking the questions.'' A handsome, articulate man with a ready grin and an affable manner, Gillinson displays the conservative plumage and speaks with the qualified equipoise of a politician or business executive. His corporate demeanor belies the quality that sets him apart in a typically standpat profession: his readiness, even eagerness, for change. 
In a highly atypical spell of ambivalence, Gillinson knew early on that he wanted to be a professional musician but studied mathematics instead. He attributes his reluctance to the influence of his Swiss-born mother, a cellist, who after World War II moved to India with his father, an officer in the British Army. Gillinson was born in Bangalore. Soon after, his father bought a 5,000-acre farm in the highlands of Kenya. By the time the Mau Mau uprising began, the marriage was already breaking up; his father stayed in Kenya, while the rest of the family left for England. There, Gillinson's mother tried to resuscitate her solo cello career, which had flourished before the war, but she banged up against many barriers as a female cellist, finding employment only sporadically on orchestral back benches. The experience embittered her and, for a while, discouraged Gillinson from following her lead. ''My mother was so adamant that I was seeing it through her eyes,'' he said. But after spending less than a year studying mathematics, he changed course and enrolled at the Royal Academy of Music, where he won the top cello prize and, upon leaving, secured a position in the cello section of the Philharmonia Orchestra. Strangely, it was where his mother worked, and they sat next to each other for three months, before Gillinson was offered an opening at the orchestra he yearned to join -- the L.S.O. He stayed for 35 years. 
 He intended to devote his professional life to playing the cello, until his flair for numbers and his air of competence led his colleagues to enlist him for a job that no one wanted. ''One of the things that suddenly hit me is the funny way fate works,'' he told me recently, over dinner at a Barbican Center restaurant. ''That morning, I went into the L.S.O. office because the orchestra was bankrupt, and I was going for three months while we looked for a new manager -- that irrational moment, which wasn't anything to do with my life, has turned out to lead to the job at Carnegie. Those little corners that you turn, that you don't realize at the time, can completely change your life.'' When Gillinson took control, the L.S.O.'s deficit stood at close to 15 percent of revenues. Within a few weeks of his arrival, the Arts Council informed him that unless that deficit was corrected within three years, the orchestra would lose its vital government subsidy -- an annual stipend, now about $3 million, that is matched by the municipal authorities of the City of London, where the Barbican is located. Eliminating the Arts Council money would have wiped out the L.S.O. Like a general, Gillinson roused the morale of the musicians for a long, slogging campaign, in which they chased after cheesy recording jobs and agreed to do one concert a year without pay. ''We cut holiday pay, we held our fees down,'' recalls Francis Saunders, a cellist. It was a punishing regimen, but it succeeded. Within two years, the L.S.O. had retired the deficit.
 Yet even while he was pursuing blatantly commercial work, Gillinson recognized that the L.S.O. had to take artistic risks to preserve its image and its soul. Apprehensively, he acceded to the insistence of Claudio Abbado, who was then the L.S.O.'s principal conductor, and went ahead in 1985 with an expensive festival of Mahler and fin-de-siecle Viennese music. By obtaining corporate sponsorship, which was still unusual in Britain, Gillinson financially floated the critically acclaimed festival. He followed it up with other costly but reputation-making events, like a 60th-birthday series for Mstislav Rostropovich in 1987. And no sooner had he stanched the L.S.O.'s financial hemorrhage than he was looking into the future.
 In 1987, Gillinson commissioned Saunders to initiate a six-month investigation of how the L.S.O. could further music education, which in Britain, as in the United States, has been increasingly neglected by the public schools. Rampant ignorance of symphonic music threatens orchestras directly. ''He had to talk to the players and get them to realize the way forward would have to include an educational dimension,'' Saunders says. ''Some of the players thought this was not the way we should be going.'' Raising pay scales for education work helped to sway minds. But what really won over most musicians was the education program's success, for which much of the credit goes to an astute hiring decision. Richard McNicol, a former schoolteacher and London Philharmonic Orchestra flutist, had been working since 1977 on finding hands-on ways for young people to experience music. (One technique was to have them compose their own music, using themes extracted from a piece they had never heard. They would then attend an orchestral performance of that piece and discover how the original composer had employed the same material.) In 1993, Gillinson offered McNicol a part-time engagement to develop concerts and other programs for children at the L.S.O. It was a new job category without even a name, so McNicol came up with ''animateur'' -- borrowed, he says, from a French term for ''someone who encourages people in activity in the arts or sports as a catalyst.'' Since then, virtually every symphony orchestra has established a participation-oriented musical-education department, many of them obviously inspired by the L.S.O. When Sir Simon Rattle arrived at the Berlin Philharmonic in 2002, he brought over McNicol to start an education program there. (After a year of commuting, McNicol relinquished the Berlin position, but the program he initiated continues.) At the Philadelphia Orchestra, its president, Joseph Kluger, says that he modeled his program directly on the L.S.O. template, down to the ''animateur'' name.
 More recently, many players grumbled when Gillinson's most audacious scheme -- the renovation of the derelict 18th-century St. Luke's church into an education center and rehearsal hall -- ran into construction difficulties, and the financial package he had painstakingly assembled from many sources, mainly national lottery funds and the banking giant U.B.S., no longer covered costs. To Gillinson's fury, the government balked at contributing much more, and so the players had little choice but to pitch in. Individually, they have forgone raises for two years. Collectively, the orchestra's endowment has suffered as fund-raising energy shifted to St. Luke's, and the L.S.O. ran up a deficit that reached $1.4 million last year. Fortunately, Gillinson eliminated the shortfall this spring. And notwithstanding all these problems, St. Luke's, inaugurated in March 2003, has been hailed as a colossal success, both as a technologically advanced education-and-rehearsal facility and as a very handsome architectural renovation. 
 Compared with managing the L.S.O., in which Gillinson seemed to pluck each string personally, running Carnegie Hall will be more of a conducting assignment: coaxing each section of the ensemble to play brilliantly and in balance. Although he will bear just as much responsibility for meeting a budget, Gillinson will not enjoy the same latitude in designing programs. Nor will he be able to exert artistic control as he did even in his final weeks in London, when he announced that Valery Gergiev, director of the Maryinsky Theater in St. Petersburg, would succeed Sir Colin Davis in 2007 as principal conductor of the L.S.O. However, Gillinson at Carnegie won't exactly be artistically powerless, either. For the concerts Carnegie presents, its administration negotiates programs with the orchestras it invites; if Gillinson has an overarching concept for a season, he can see it through.
 After the collapse of the merger with the New York Philharmonic, the Carnegie administration sought other ways to achieve continuity. An ambitious orchestra residency program, which Harth did not live to announce, will begin in the 2007-8 season with a visit of eight or nine days by the Berlin Philharmonic. Weill, the board's chairman, says that someday four orchestras may take up residencies, for a season total of four or five weeks. Carnegie Hall is now also spending close to $8 million a year on education. The magnitude of that sum probably attracted Gillinson to the job even more than his own salary increase: Harth was earning double the roughly $250,000 that the L.S.O. was paying Gillinson. Although he won't discuss it, Gillinson turned down an offer two years ago to be president of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. The timing was wrong -- his two youngest children were still at university -- and the position would have amounted to a more fettered version of his existing job. He says that he wanted the Carnegie Hall position as soon as it was offered to him last July, and that when he held a retreat with his wife, Penny, and their three grown children, his major worry was that his family might disagree. They unanimously endorsed the move.
In both the United States and Britain, classical music is confronted by long-range challenges that will not solve themselves. Recording contracts for orchestras have dried up. Audiences resist what is loosely called contemporary music (although some of it was written almost a century ago). The days when a couple would routinely buy a full-season subscription seem as quaint and remote as a cotillion ball. Although statistics are scarce, audiences in concert halls seem to be growing grayer. To cover rising costs, tickets keep becoming more expensive. In short, classical music is jeopardized and marginalized, and there's no easy fix. 
 At the L.S.O., Gillinson developed the approach to these problems that he will take to Carnegie Hall. For instance, he foresaw long ago that the symphonic recording business, following an upswing propelled by the new CD format as listeners replaced their vinyl albums with discs, would languish. Aside from the lost income to the players, this was an orchestra problem. Without recordings, how could the L.S.O. preserve performances with great conductors and soloists, and how could it expand its reputation and keep the pool of people who attended its concerts from stagnating? ''For about two years, from about 1996 on, I started talking to the orchestra at every meeting about what was happening in the recording industry,'' he said. ''It was hardly happening yet, but it was clear to me that they couldn't keep rerecording the symphonic repertoire. I deliberately made sure it was a conversation, and then the orchestra saw it happening. I said: 'What should we do about it? There is no money from the recording companies to make CD's, so if we want to record them, we will have to do it ourselves. The only way we can do it is if we share the risk. We will take the risk of financing the recordings, but you will have to take the risk of postponing the payment, and then, if the royalties come in, you will get most of them.''' 
 The upshot was ''L.S.O. Live,'' begun in 2000, a groundbreaking series of live recordings that includes a Grammy Award-winning performance of the Berlioz opera ''Les Troyens'' conducted by Colin Davis. Record companies have always released live performances, and on their in-house labels orchestras have issued historic recordings exhumed from their archives, but the self-produced L.S.O. series, designed as an orchestra-controlled alternative to a studio recording system, offers another business model. The label, which is nicknamed ''L.S.O. Clive'' by the musicians, now offers 32 discs. Its success has been influential. As part of a Mahler series, the San Francisco Symphony released its first new recording under its own label in 2002, and last year, the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra in Amsterdam inaugurated its own label as well. One decision that divided even the L.S.O.'s administrators was how to price ''L.S.O. Live.'' Here, too, Gillinson defied conventional thinking. ''It was one of the very rare occasions when I and the marketing department couldn't come to a consensus,'' he recalled. ''I was absolutely adamant that it had to be budget-priced and accessible to everyone. They were convinced that that would undermine the brand. I finally said, 'I'm very sorry, but I have to insist.''' He issued the ''L.S.O. Live'' discs at slightly under $10, or about half the cost of a premium CD in Britain. ''They now think it is the right decision, because we have sold so many,'' he said. Most ''L.S.O. Live'' titles sell 25,000 copies in the first year of release; with that volume, the slim profit margin is financially defensible. Moreover, as a megaphone to amplify the L.S.O.'s reputation, the series has succeeded brilliantly. And a number of recordings have won prestigious prizes, underscoring the democratic thrust of the pricing. ''I was absolutely certain in looking at the marketplace, where there are endless recording companies and recordings, there is no way the pressure won't be to bring the prices down,'' Gillinson said. ''It is much better to dictate to the market than to be dictated to.'' (Continuing to look ahead, the L.S.O. made its entire catalog available for download online on iTunes in April.)
Gillinson encountered similar resistance when he proposed reducing ticket prices for concerts at the Barbican. ''I'd been pushing for it for years,'' Gillinson told me. ''Each time the marketing department was adamantly opposed.'' For the centennial season of 2004-5, wanting the buzz of full houses, the L.S.O. made the leap and cut the cost of the top ticket from $66 to $47, with similar reductions down the line. Other orchestra administrators questioned its sanity. ''Why price a Rolls-Royce product on a Ford Mondeo level?'' argues David Whelton of the Philharmonia. ''One of our roles is to see that the brand is respected and exploited.'' Even Sir John Tusa, managing director of the Barbican Center, advised Gillinson that there was no advantage in reducing prices for patrons who could afford expensive tickets. But Gillinson said he thought that he needed to act boldly to change public perceptions. If only the lower-priced tickets were reduced, ''people will still look at the pricing from the top and think it's 35 pounds downward,'' he explained. ''You have to build up the audience.'' To cover the potential shortfall in ticket revenues, Gillinson reduced the marketing budget by some $190,000. So far, the policy has not conspicuously increased demand, but Gillinson says he hopes that, if maintained, it eventually will. 
 If younger and more diverse audiences are to be enticed into concert halls, the music itself, not just the ticket prices, must appear approachable. In recent years, the L.S.O. has backed away from contemporary music. Defending his predictable programs, Gillinson blames a conservative mood that has seized audiences since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the United States. ''Everybody got spooked and stopped going out,'' he said. ''It was very marked and very noticeable that autumn. People then started coming back, but they were much more selective, and they wanted to be sure they would enjoy the program.'' In the 2002-3 season, the L.S.O. presented a series devoted to the lyrical, rigorous music of the young English-born, French-trained composer George Benjamin. ''Five years earlier, that would have succeeded,'' he told me. ''I shouldn't say it was unsuccessful. It did very well critically. But in 2003, the attendances were 65 to 70 percent on average. That's a big, big drop. Either you say, 'I'm just going to go on, regardless,' or you say, 'We can't afford to.' You take a step back and make sure you've got your audience with you. There's no point in doing things that are interesting and challenging if people aren't going to hear it. It's a waste of time.''
 Even in relatively sanguine days, Gillinson strove to transform unusual programs into events. He staged a Shostakovich festival, in which Rostropovich conducted all 15 symphonies and some seldom-heard works, to full houses. An educator as well as a showman, he supported McNicol, the animateur, in the creation of the L.S.O. Discovery series, which uses the orchestra to illuminate the obscurities of modern music. In January, on a Carnegie Hall visit in honor of Boulez's 80th birthday, the L.S.O. performed a Discovery concert devoted to Stravinsky's ''Rite of Spring.'' Before the intermission, Boulez and his interlocutor, Guzelimian (filling the role McNicol had taken in previous European performances), used the orchestra to demonstrate how Stravinsky constructed the work in rhythmic chunks. Then the orchestra returned to perform the piece uninterrupted. Remarkably effective, it was the first event in what Carnegie has dubbed its Sound Insights series. As Guzelimian told the audience, ''This is, if truth be known, directly modeled on the Discovery concerts that the London Symphony Orchestra has been doing for 15 years.'' Before Gillinson's arrival, Carnegie Hall had already put in place a program that flattered him by copying him. 
 Unlike the L.S.O., Carnegie Hall has managed to press ahead with unusual programming even after Sept. 11. Next season, as part of a boundary-pushing series he designed, the conductor David Robertson, who is the new music director of the St. Louis Symphony, will perform a program of Luciano Berio, Gyorgy Ligeti and none other than George Benjamin (admittedly, in Zankel Hall). Demonstrating Carnegie's scope, the Senegalese singer Youssou N'Dour will also program a series.
 The stately dignity that Carnegie Hall embodies can be off-putting to new audiences. Although Zankel Hall seems to be drawing a younger, hipper crowd than the one that usually comes to Stern Auditorium, Gillinson recognizes the continuing challenge. ''Wonderful, extraordinary cultural palaces can be intimidating for people who have never experienced great music before and think that culture is for other people,'' he said. Sometimes even small things can be significant. The Carnegie Hall logo, unchanged since 1983, represents the name of the institution in a capitalized old-fashioned typeface, with a red bar below it. At the L.S.O., Gillinson commissioned a new logo, in which the three letters swoop in a ribbonlike arabesque. ''In the end, what we said was, 'Hang on, we see ourselves as vivid, exciting and energetic, and here we have a logo which has nothing to do with how we see ourselves,''' he explained. So he got one that did.
 Unlike his mercurial predecessor Ohnesorg, Gillinson knows that to institute change in a venerable institution, patience and clarity are required. ''If you try to sell too many ideas at one time, you can find you don't get any of them through,'' he remarked. In addition to considering a reduction in the number of rentals, Ohnesorg also proposed taking over the adjoining Carnegie Hall Tower studios, which Carnegie now leases out, and other expensive, ambitious schemes. He accomplished little except for antagonizing his colleagues. Gillinson has been seasoned by working for a self-governing orchestra that requires near consensus, in a British system that imposes thickets of bureaucracy and protocol. Reviewing his own record in London, he seems at once proud and frustrated. Earlier this year, he waged a frontal assault of lobbying for more financing for the L.S.O. from the Arts Council, which five years ago changed its policy and began distributing public money equally to the nation's orchestras. His campaign failed. The L.S.O.'s outsize ambitions would have to wait. ''Why bother to have an arts council?'' Gillinson complained to me. ''For our orchestra, it's shattering. For years they were thinking they were being rewarded for what they achieved.'' Gillinson may be better suited to working in New York than in London. ''In Britain, people are concerned that everyone be fair and no one be upset,'' he said. ''I've always felt really at home in the States. People love to applaud success and don't find it threatening. People are inspired by it. It's one of the things that I've found hardest with being in Britain. People are quite comfortable with failure, but they are much less comfortable with success. That's one thing I won't be sorry about leaving behind.''

HEADLINE: The Great Awakening

BYLINE: By SUKETU MEHTA. 
Suketu Mehta is the author of ''Maximum City: Bombay Lost and Found'' (Knopf).

 BODY:
AT a party on the Upper West Side in 2000, a distinguished American author, and longtime Manhattanite, asked where I lived.
 ''Brooklyn,'' I told him.
He snorted. ''Poor people live in Brooklyn.'' Then he turned away to get some meat.
 Shortly after the party, to see if I could move from my rented apartment in Boerum Hill, I went looking to see what I could buy in a part of Fort Greene where cars parked on the street were still regularly stolen. I told the broker that it would be nice for my kids to have a house by a park. ''We just sold a house by the park: $510,000,'' the broker said. But there was a catch. ''It had no walls or ceilings.'' 
 What happened, I wondered, to the distinguished author's ''poor people''? 
 Several years ago before, representatives of the giant warehouse shopping club Costco had approached the City Planning Department with a question: would it be worth it to open a Costco in Sunset Park, an area of Brooklyn that had lots of the aforementioned poor people? The economic data wasn't encouraging. Lots of Asian immigrants lived in the area, and their median income was not high. Also, the site was half the usual size, so the Costco store would have to be built in two stories, with costly elevators and escalators. 
 But the city's statisticians advised Costco to go ahead. There was money in those undistinguished apartment houses and wood-frame houses, they said, more money than met the eye. Being an immigrant area, the neighborhood has a thriving underground economy, they said, and official housing data doesn't account for illegally subdivided units. 
 The store opened in 1996 and turned a profit in its first year. Nine years later, according to company figures, it is among the nation's highest-grossing Costcos, earning upward of $150 million this year compared with $120 million for an average Costco. In fact, the store has been so successful, the chain is considering opening another giant warehouse in Brooklyn.
 It has become a cliche to say that Brooklyn is booming. But the change has become so broad -- sweeping up the yuppies of Fort Greene, the immigrant shoppers at Costco, the hipsters of Williamsburg -- that it looks for all the world like a difference not just in degree but in kind. Long seen by that distinguished author and by so many others as a poor backwater, Brooklyn now buzzes with a momentum that would have stunned residents of its sleepy streets not long ago. The change has effects salutary (a housing boom, thriving cultural life) and perilous (soaring housing costs, displacement), but the one constant is that it is huge. 
 With 2.5 million people, the borough is bigger than San Francisco, Boston, Atlanta and St. Louis combined. The population is approaching the historic high of 1950, when Brooklyn was home to 2.74 million souls. Turn around, and you will see the renaissance. There isn't a single vacant storefront along Fulton Street in Bedford-Stuyvesant, and hordes of shoppers throng Pitkin Avenue in Brownsville. After decades of disinvestment in Brooklyn, major projects are in the works, among them the development of 175 waterfront blocks, complete with 40-story luxury apartment buildings, along the Greenpoint-Williamsburg waterfront; the construction of an 800,000-square-foot sports complex for the Nets in the Atlantic Yards; and, in Red Hook, the return of cruise ships, including the Queen Mary 2 and the Queen Elizabeth 2, to a major new pier and passenger terminal. 
 And while housing is exploding citywide -- the number of housing permits granted citywide last year exceeded the permits granted in all of the 1990's -- the two boroughs with the most housing starts in this bustling market are Queens and Brooklyn. Why so many homes? Brooklyn's prime appeal is relatively low cost. Let's not kid ourselves. If rents in Manhattan fell, half the hipsters in Brooklyn would rush the bridges; they're a floating population. But it can't be just that; otherwise Staten Island and the Bronx would also qualify. 
 People are also moving to Brooklyn because -- who in the 80's could ever have guessed? -- it has become so much safer. From 1990 to 2000, according to the state's Division of Criminal Justice Services, car theft in the borough plunged by 75 percent, robbery by 67 percent and homicide by 69 percent. In terms of mass transit, it's the best-connected borough after Manhattan, with 167 of the city's 468 subway stations. 
 AS for me, I live in Park Slope because I'm a writer. It's in my union contract. Brooklyn has become the Iowa City of the East, an area chronicled and cataloged and celebrated in countless novels and poems, read and unread. The number of Brooklynites who identified themselves as ''authors and writers'' to the Census Bureau more than doubled to 3,111 in 2000 from 1,506 in 1990. By contrast, the number of ''cabinetmakers and bench carpenters'' dipped almost by half over the same period, to 334 from 602. 
 Because of all the creative types who call the borough home, the new Brooklyn is hip. One of the clearest signs of this was a 2002 cover article in Time Out New York that ran under the headline ''Manhattan -- The New Brooklyn'' and tried hard to make the case that Manhattan was cool again. ''The Upper East Side is just a dorm,'' I overheard a young Asian hipster say to a friend as they walked amid the milling crowds on Court Street. ''I like it here. There's so much life.''
 Sometimes all of South Brooklyn feels like a giant set for a sitcom about trendy young people. On plywood barriers at a construction site on Fourth Avenue in Park Slope, I noticed a series of desperate public pleas for a change of heart by a departing roommate: ''I 3/5sheart 4/5 You Scout Please Don't Leave''; ''Scout if you stay I'll be nice to you all the time. Even when I'm PMS'ing''; ''Kate says if you stay, you can spend another night in her bed.'' 
 It was not always thus. The unnamed young Irish hero of the Gilbert Sorrentino love story ''The Moon in Its Flight,'' set in 1948, returns to Brooklyn after a party with his sophisticated Bronx girlfriend in equally sophisticated Forest Hills. At the party, ''He skulked in his loud Brooklyn clothes,'' the novelist writes.
 ''When he got off the train in Brooklyn an hour later, he saw his friends through the window of the all-night diner, pouring coffee into the great pit of their beer drunks. He despised them as he despised himself and the neighborhood. He fought against the thought of her so that he would not have to place her subtle finesse in these streets of vulgar hells, benedictions, and incense.''
 But the new Brooklyn has more than one face. ''There are two Brooklyns,'' pointed out Arun Peter Lobo, deputy director of the population division of City Planning. ''At the very least.'' Indeed, anything you could say about Brooklyn, the fourth-largest city in America, is true somewhere within its borders. Yes, it's full of hipsters; Rhode Island School of Design students hop on the bus to Williamsburg as soon as they graduate. Yes, it's full of parents, marching their strollers down Union Street to shop at the organic foods co-op. Yes, it's also full of immigrants. 
 Although Queens, the borough most thought of as the new melting pot, is home to more than a million immigrants, Brooklyn is fast catching up, with 932,000. About 38 percent of Brooklynites are foreign-born; if you include their children, their numbers jump to more than 55 percent. 
 This isn't the Jewish Brooklyn of Woody Allen or the Italian Brooklyn of ''Moonstruck.'' There are people living in Brooklyn who have no idea what stickball is, what stoop-sitting is, who the Dodgers were or why they left Brooklyn. These people play cricket in Marine Park, barbecue suckling pigs in their backyards, listen to Russian matinee idols in Brighton Beach nightclubs, and worship not Kobe Bryant and Derek Jeter but Diego Maradona, an Argentine soccer player, and Sachin Tendulkar, an Indian cricket star. They are inventing their own Brooklyn, a Brooklyn their kids will be nostalgic about 20 years from now. 
 Willy Loman, too, still lives in Brooklyn. Desperate working folks, salesmen and otherwise, struggle to provide for their families, to make the commission; attention is still not being paid. Income disparities are as big as Brooklyn itself; in 2000, the median household income in the wealthiest census tract -- in Brooklyn Heights -- was $112,414. In the poorest tract, in Coney Island, the median income, at $7,863, was not even one-tenth of that. The housing crisis exacerbates this inequality, with the world divided between those who own and those who rent. 
 Another big division in Brooklyn is between neighborhoods close to the water, or to a park, and those away from the blue and the green. People live in the western parts of Brooklyn with their eyes fixed westward. There are people in Park Slope who can tell you where to get the best gelato in Manhattan but have no idea where to find the best roti in Brownsville. Well inland are the nonimmigrant poor, people who have been poor for a long time and aren't just off the plane from somewhere else, aren't hoarding hope for their children as they toil in sweatshops.
 The new Brooklyn has not cured poverty or solved related problems like inadequate schools. Low-quality schooling hits poor and immigrant families the most because it depletes the only substantial capital they have: their children. The children, with their great promise, are these families' Microsoft before Windows, their I.B.M. when it was just a typewriter company. When a public school succeeds spectacularly, like P.S. 321, in whose Park Slope district house buyers must pay a premium, parents storm the gates, with varying success. So it's private school for many Brooklyn parents -- at $20,000 a year. ''It's become punitive living here,'' says a writer friend who was trying to raise her kids in Park Slope. She couldn't afford a house, even though her husband is a corporate lawyer. Eventually she left Brooklyn to ride horses in a mountain village in Spain, and is happier for it. 
 MOREOVER, the various redevelopment plans, grand as they are, are being fought block by block by people who will be displaced by them. The Nets arena will sit in a spot that has among the best access to mass transit in the city -- ''every train but the F,'' as my landlord proudly said when I was renting an apartment near there in 2002. Traffic, already hellish on Flatbush Avenue, may get still more hellish as several thousand fans converge at game time.
 So there are downsides to the new Brooklyn, but there is the boom -- and beyond all the economic data, there is a very human pull to the borough. In the world's loneliest city, Brooklyn offers community. Everybody can find community in Brooklyn: the body-fluid artists in Bushwick, the Chinese restaurant workers in Sunset Park, the die-hard Marxists in the Park Slope food co-op. No matter how foreign or fringe you are, the borough has a support group for you. 
 One reason for this is that Brooklyn is famously a series of neighborhoods. Another has to do with the physical structure of that emblem of Brooklyn -- the brownstone. Adjoining rear gardens facilitate communal interaction, gardening tips exchanged over a backyard fence. Maybe what attracts the hipsters to Brooklyn isn't just cheap rents. It's the closest they can get to the families they left behind, in Kansas, in Vermont, in Tokyo.
 For me, Brooklyn became a neighborhood one steamy August night in 2003. It was the night of the great Northeastern Blackout. In Park Slope, volunteers were out directing traffic at every intersection, even if the drivers laughed at them and zoomed past. Other Brooklynites shared phones and flashlights, or helped the elderly down dark stairwells. 
 As night fell, the texture of the city changed. The street lamps were out, and people strolled about with flashlights and lanterns. There was a bright white moon high above the city competing with the red glory of Mars, the warrior planet, which hadn't been so close to Earth in 60,000 years. The ancient Brooklyn tradition of stoop-sitting enjoyed a sudden revival.
 At midnight, the bars were still dispensing ice for our whiskeys. We took our drinks out on the sidewalk; we'd make our own laws tonight. Everyone's face was illuminated in flickering, flattering light, and everybody looked beautiful and desirable. The floodlit megalopolis was transformed into a series of villages lighted by millions of small lights, in whose glow Brooklyn was revealed to be what we had forgotten it really is: an impossibly romantic, a 19th-century city.

HEADLINE: Market's Surge Erases Losses for the Year

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
The stock market surged last week, wiping out its losses for the year, despite an increase in the price of oil.
 Consumer confidence in June jumped from the previous month, according to a report on Friday by the University of Michigan, contributing to the stock market rally. 
Crude oil futures in New York reached a new high of $58.60 during the day on Friday. That set off a climb in energy shares, which accounted for a significant part of the stock market's overall gains. 
 The market shrugged off a government report showing that the current account deficit for the first quarter reached $195.1 billion, more than expected by Wall Street economists.
 The best performers among the Dow industrials included Alcoa, Honeywell and Exxon Mobil. 
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 110.44 points, or 1.1 percent, to close at 10,623.07. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 18.85 points, or 1.6 percent, to close at 1,216.96. The Nasdaq composite index rose 27.11 points, or 1.3 percent, to close at 2,090.11. 
 The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 4.07 percent from 4.05 percent the previous week. JEFF SOMMER

2nd Round of Charges Against Doctor's Killer
 He is serving 25 years to life for a highly publicized killing, but James C. Kopp may face life without parole if federal prosecutors have their way.
 In October 1998, Dr. Barnett A. Slepian was killed by a rifle bullet fired through the kitchen window of his home in Amherst, N.Y., a Buffalo suburb. Dr. Slepian, who was 52, had an obstetrics practice in Amherst and performed abortions at a clinic in Buffalo.
 Investigators quickly focused on Mr. Kopp, above, a longtime abortion opponent with ties to extreme anti-abortion groups. An international manhunt for him ended with his arrest in France in March 2001.
 In a nonjury trial on state murder charges in 2003, Mr. Kopp admitted that he had shot Dr. Slepian, but claimed he had meant only to wound him so that he could not perform more abortions. 
 But the judge, Michael L. D'Amico of Erie County Court, found that Mr. Kopp had intended to kill Dr. Slepian and was guilty of second-degree murder. Judge D'Amico sentenced him to the maximum, 25 years to life in prison. Mr. Kopp, 50, is appealing the verdict and sentence, under which he is eligible for parole after 25 years.
 Now, federal prosecutors in Buffalo are pressing their charges against Mr. Kopp, among them a charge that he violated a federal statute barring forceful interference with people who provide reproductive health services. If a death resulted from such interference, a conviction could lead to life in prison without the possibility of parole.
 In April, Magistrate Judge Hugh B. Scott of the Federal District Court in Buffalo recommended that Mr. Kopp's motion to dismiss the charges be denied. The magistrate rejected, among other things, the argument that the federal prosecution violated strictures against double jeopardy. The federal trial judge, Richard J. Arcara, can accept or reject the recommendation.
 Last week, Mr. Kopp's lawyer, John Humann, maintained that the federal prosecution was ''a waste of time,'' given the state conviction. 
 ''He's doing 25 to life, and even if he's alive after 25 years, the parole board would not release him,'' he said. He said he also thought that his client had ''no chance'' of successfully appealing the state conviction.
 Dr. Slepian's widow, Lynne Slepian, declined to comment. But her lawyer, Glenn E. Murray, who was Dr. Slepian's lawyer and friend, said that Ms. Slepian ''would like to be able to tell'' her four sons, now 14 to 22, ''that Mr. Kopp will spend the rest of his life in jail.'' 
 She can not say that with certainty under the state sentence because of the possibility of parole, he said, but ''she can say it if he's successfully prosecuted'' and gets life without parole in the federal case.
 Beyond that, said the prosecutor in the federal case, Kathleen M. Mehltretter, it is important to enforce the law safeguarding health providers.

4 Years Later, Steps Toward Science Park
 For years, critics said that city and state officials had not done enough to spur the growth of biotechnology and life-science industries in New York City. 
 The city responded in part by approving plans in 2001 for an East River Science Park, three buildings to rise on city-owned land between East 28th and 29th Streets off Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive in Manhattan. The complex, to be located between New York University Medical Center and Bellevue Hospital Center, would house companies involved in the research and development of products like pharmaceuticals and medical devices.
 Such projects move slowly, but last week aides to Andrew M. Alper, above, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, said the agency hoped to select a developer by the end of the summer from among five who recently submitted proposals for building the complex.
 William R. Fair, a corporation vice president, declined to disclose the contenders but said the one chosen would finance the ''vast, vast portion'' of the expected cost of several hundred million dollars.

HEADLINE: Who Hurts?

BYLINE: By BEN GIBBERD

 BODY:
HERE'S an exercise. Google the words ''New Brooklyn'' and see how many hits you come up with. 
 The answer: 15.7 million. 
 Even allowing for the insane inclusiveness of an Internet search, that number reveals something profound about the frenzy -- cultural, gastronomic, architectural and otherwise -- that has seized what is affectionately known as ''America's favorite borough'' in the past decade. Like the Boston Red Sox, Brooklyn has gone from a franchise that battened half-gleefully on its own sense of inferiority to that most dazzling and unexpected thing, an outright winner. 
 The question is, is this change all for the good? The answer, of course, depends on who you are. If you're a developer, a politician or a landlord, the answer is probably a resounding yes. Carpe diem, Brooklyn, you're becoming a world-class city and gaining those precious elements of glamour and sophistication -- new restaurants, cultural centers, maybe even a sports arena -- that have long been absent. What could be wrong with that?
 In the eyes of some, a great deal.
 ''The problem with calling Brooklyn 'new' is that it diminishes the value of all that's been here for a long time,'' says Elizabeth Yeampierre, the executive director of the United Puerto Rican Organization of Sunset Park, or Uprose, a group that represents the Latinos and other immigrants of that mostly working-class Brooklyn neighborhood. ''And words are a powerful thing.'' 
 Ms. Yeampierre, the New York-born offspring of Puerto Rican parents, does not mince words when describing what she sees as the price paid for urban makeovers. ''The most onerous, egregious effect of gentrification is actual displacement,'' she says. ''But before that happens, you start feeling the effect of gentrification. There's a heightened level of intolerance. You see more racial profiling. All of a sudden people can't sit on their stoops. They can't listen to their music.''
 Ms. Yeampierre has lived with her husband and teenage son in a rented brownstone apartment in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, for 16 years. But growing up, she experienced firsthand the destabilizing consequences of urban change. When the Upper West Side began its great transformations in the late 60's, her family was forced up to the South Bronx ''while it was burning,'' as she put it, followed by moves to Washington Heights, Harlem and various locations in Brooklyn. Between first and eighth grade, she attended five schools. ''I know what displacement does to a family, how it interrupts childhood,'' she says. 
 As Sunset Park, like other Brooklyn neighborhoods, has become more attractive to speculators, the cycle of displacement continues. Ms. Yeampierre's mother-in-law is among many elderly Latino residents who have been approached by men offering to buy their houses outright. The temptation to sell is one that many low-income Latinos and other poor people of color, often with meager job prospects and multiple dependents, find hard to resist. And those who rent, like Dyhalma Anaya, a 23-year-old youth organizer for Uprose, are in an even more precarious position.
 Ms. Anaya lives with her parents and brother in a two-family row house in Sunset Park stuffed with tenants (12, including three children under 3, in the upper-floor apartment alone) that is, she says, ''literally falling apart.'' ''There's a big hole in our bathroom, and hardly any heat,'' says Ms. Anaya, whose parents pay $1,000 a month in rent. ''We're just dying to move out.'' 
 The problem is finding a place to go. Ms. Anaya's father is a Police Department detective, her mother a deacon at El Calvario Church in Bushwick, Brooklyn. Even with two grown children contributing their salaries, the family can't afford any of the houses for sale in Sunset Park. ''Everything's $725,000,'' Ms. Anaya says. ''And that's on a bad block.'' 
 It's hard to put a figure on how many people have been displaced, but Ms. Yeampierre says that in Sunset Park alone, a significant number of Latinos have left within the past few years, the wealthier to Florida, the less wealthy to Staten Island, and even Georgia and Virginia. She sees the same pattern in Greenpoint and low-income sections of Williamsburg.
 Displacement of poor and low-income residents is one consequence of sweeping neighborhood change. Another is the departure of small manufacturers and with them large numbers of jobs that are often more stable and better paying than the service jobs that have replaced them. According to Randolph Peers, vice president for economic development at the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce, the borough has lost more than 50 percent of its manufacturing jobs since 1990, down to about 31,000 from more than 65,000. 
 Aurora Lampworks, a small company with 14 employees on North 11th Street in Williamsburg, is the sort of company that is threatened. Stepping inside Aurora Lampworks, which makes and restores period and modern lighting fixtures, is like stepping into a scene out of Dickens. Lights of every description, from Art Deco globes to belle epoque chandeliers, hang from the ceiling. Wooden molds, stacked high above one another, line the walls. Dorothy, the resident pit bull, licks outstretched hands. 
 The office of Dawn Ladd, the owner, is up a staircase in a corner. Through her window, Ms. Ladd can see a sign of changing times: half a vacant block surrounded by a chain-link fence bearing a sign that reads: ''For the best home mortgages, call. '' According to documents on file with the city, up to 260 units of housing in towers up to 12 stories high are to rise on the site.
 Ms. Ladd, who resembles Annie Hall in her dark pants and man's white shirt, is, like many small manufacturers, a refugee from Dumbo, forced out five years ago, unable to renew her lease. ''Now I'm seeing exactly the same story happening here,'' she says. 
 The industrial building next to hers is making way for luxury housing, and like Ms. Yeampierre's mother-in-law, she has felt personal pressure from developers. ''They call, they write,'' Ms. Ladd says. ''Cars pull up all the time, and you know they're scoping out the building. It's menacing.''
 Her building houses seven companies, including a moldmaker, a glassblower and a sheet metal fabricator; in some ways, the building is a microcosm of Williamsburg's creative industries. Aurora Lampworks, specifically, might be said to be in the business of maintaining New York itself. 
 A LIST of Aurora's recent restoration projects reads like a list of iconic details in the tapestry that is the city: the sconces outside the Dakota Apartments on the Upper West Side, the street lamps in City Hall Park, the lighting fixtures at First Presbyterian Church in Greenwich Village. ''If you want this beautiful, wonderful city that we all take for granted maintained, then you must have certain industries like these,'' Ms. Ladd says. 
 Loss of jobs and housing can be measured. But there is a third aspect in which critics of the new Brooklyn see a threat --the borough's vaunted quality of life. As newcomers flood in, and as the list of mega-projects grows, many people worry that Brooklyn's low-rise, low-density, neighborhood feel -- so much a product of its great swaths of brownstones -- is threatened.
 Michael McGinn, a graphic and merchandise designer in his 40's who lives with his wife and two children half a block from the Gowanus Canal on the edge of Carroll Gardens, is certain that what he describes as his scruffy, working-class neighborhood is about to change drastically. ''Gowanus Village, or whatever it's going to be called,'' he says, referring to the Leviev Boymelgreen development company's plans for several large strips along the canal, ''is going to change everything.''
 Mr. McGinn realizes the paradox of his position. He bought into the neighborhood 15 years ago as part of an earlier wave of gentrification by well-educated professionals, many of them involved in the arts, that was already carrying radical change to the largely working-class Italian-American population that had lived there for generations. ''Now it's more and more people like ourselves moving in,'' he says, laughing, ''except that in order to buy into the neighborhood now you have to be an investment banker.'' Mr. McGinn and his wife won't lose their jobs or their home, but they fear that their neighborhood is becoming both denser and less heterogeneous. 
 ''We moved in not just because it was close to the city, but because it was authentic and diverse,'' Mr. McGinn says. He likes the fact, for example, that letters to parents from the local Public School 261 were written in Arabic, Chinese and Spanish as well as English, a reflection of a highly diverse student body. ''You don't get that diversity when the economic strata starts to rise.'' 
 Such changes may simply reflect the way cities grow and evolve; gentrifiers may be doomed to become the gentrified. But for Mr. McGinn, these latest changes are disturbingly different. ''What makes a neighborhood work, is friction,'' he says. ''Friction between people with similar and different needs, friction between commercial and residential areas, between ethnicities and income levels. That's how New York's old neighborhoods developed. They evolved. 
 ''This stuff is different,'' he continues. ''It's top-down growth rather than bottom-up. It's about corporate interests coming up with a balance sheet that makes a profit. And no amount of building waterfront promenades or whatever can give it life.''

HEADLINE: The Coney Island Of Their Mind

BYLINE: By HUMERA AFRIDI. 
Humera Afridi is completing her first novel, ''Asymptotes,'' set in New York, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.

 BODY:
CONEY ISLAND is what they call it. ''Our new home -- Coney Island,'' they say proudly and flick their eyes toward the double-wide avenue lined with squat two- and three-story buildings huddled together like members of an ambushed army. 
 The short stretch of Coney Island Avenue from Avenue H to Beverly Road, along with the side streets leading off it, is home to an estimated 30,000 mostly working-class Pakistanis, occasioning the name Little Pakistan and making this one of countless immigrant communities that have made Brooklyn almost as rich an ethnic tapestry as Queens. 
 When I stepped off the Q train and stood on the outdoor platform, a giant mural of sky greeted me, and leaves bathed an incandescent green by bright sunlight fluttered in the breeze. I could have sworn I smelled the ocean. 
 Images of mythical Coney Island bounced wildly in my head (the bright lights of Luna Park; the cruel electrocution of Topsy the elephant) and collided with memories of Karachi (the pewter sands of Clifton Beach; fortune-tellers with their prescient parrots; streets thronging with the overworked and the unemployed, dreamers and the devout, cripples, transvestites and tourists).
 But all that greets the eye at the corner of Coney Island Avenue and Avenue H is a sleepy stretch of nondescript brick buildings interrupted by a newer concrete construction, awesome only in its ugliness. At the Five Star Auto garage, a bevy of pigeons pecked at discarded sweetmeats. And of course despite what they call it, this area is not Coney Island at all but Midwood. 
 When I asked to be directed to the heart of Little Pakistan, the attendant pointed me toward Makki Masjid, the unassuming mosque on Coney Island Avenue.
 I trudged past the shuttered storefront of Charlotte's Nik Nak Nook and the Urdu posters Scotch-taped to storefronts advertising halal meat and money transfer facilities. A funereal silence hung over the strip. It was hard to tell who was here to stay.
 I traipsed into one utilitarian store after another -- a nameless boutique with a clumsy display of shalwar kameezes that hung in plastic bags, like dolled-up corpses in body bags; Mashallah Jewelry, whose 22-karat gold dazzled and taunted the dilapidated surroundings -- in search of the elusive spirit of my homeland. My questions elicited terse answers, averted glances that glistened with fear. Nor was there anything familiarly Pakistani about the spirit of the place -- where were the humor, the camaraderie, the peculiarly South Asian form of idle chitchat known as gupshup?
 The few women who ventured out were immediately conspicuous in their bold shalwar kameezes, chiffon dupattas draped over their heads. Across the street, a 99-cent store bore the name Urdu Bazaar, invoking, in grim parody, the famous book market of Karachi. I loitered outside the mosque, mourning the loss of my melded fictional world -- Coney Island, which was actually three and a half miles to the south, and the urban frenzy of the port city of Karachi -- and waited for the imam's sermon to end.
 Since that visit, I have learned some hard truths. Little Pakistan, which sits on the fringes of Victorian Flatbush, in what was once Arthur Miller's and Woody Allen's turf, may not evoke the urban Pakistan of my experience, but it evokes powerful aspects of that world. The largest segment of this community is composed of Kashmiris who were among the tens of thousands of people displaced by the construction of the Mangla Dam in the 60's. Lured by the low rents and the mosque, which was founded in 1982, Pakistani immigrants steadily revitalized the area. In those early days, stores rented for $500 (today they're $3,000 and above) and houses were valued at $60,000 (now they sell for $450,000). 
 Little Pakistan is home to taxi and limousine drivers, food cart vendors, construction workers, store owners and, more recently, a professional class. Its women are primarily homemakers, and the spirit of chauvinism hovers at fever pitch. Men consider it demeaning for their wives to earn money; daughters are kept on a tight leash.
 Farhat Affreedi, managing editor of Sada-E-Pakistan, a weekly Urdu newspaper, grew up in Midwood, moved away for college and returned to find that her female peers had chosen to replicate the lifestyle of their mothers. Bold streaks of peroxide illuminate her black hair, and to the chagrin of her brothers, she wears only Western attire. 
 ''I AM a very rare person here,'' Ms. Affreedi says matter-of-factly from her office on Coney Island Avenue. Growing up, she knew of girls who ran away, unable to handle the severity of their parents' restrictions, and she often receives calls from counselors in local schools, asking her to intervene on behalf of distraught girls whose marriages are being arranged in Pakistan.
 An estimated 8,000 Pakistanis were deported or voluntarily left Midwood after the Homeland Security Department's Special Registration program began to be enforced, sharply diminishing the colony of Little Pakistan. Before Special Registration, 3,500 men attended the Friday sermon at Makki Masjid. Now, according to Imam Hafiz Sabir, the mosque's top floor is often empty.
 The subdued, lackluster aspect of the main drag belies the gems in this neighborhood. Ustad Khursheed, renowned maestro of the tabla, occupies a single room above the avenue where he plays host to musical evenings. The Rumi Center, a Sufi literary organization at 1064 Coney Island Avenue, organizes mushairas, traditional poetry readings. I stop at Kabir's Bakery for thick, milky tea that evokes nostalgia for Karachi. Signs along the avenue have a haunting echo -- ''Punjab Grocery,'' ''Punjab Sweets,'' ''Punjab Pharmacy'' -- as if repetition might recreate a distant and beloved province in the heart of Brooklyn.
 In 1904, among their many exhibits at Luna Park, the showmen Frederick Thompson and Elmer Dundy created a reproduction of a New Delhi marketplace, complete with ''natives.'' What would they say about the strange reversal, a century later, by which the commercial strip of Little Pakistan -- three and a half miles up the road -- calls itself Coney Island?

HEADLINE: Fund-Raising: Well-Paid Jobs That Sometimes Go Begging 

BYLINE: By ANN COLIN HERBST

 BODY:
Mary K. Vinton, director of development for the Greenwich Library in Greenwich, Conn., has a problem: she is looking for a fund-raiser -- specifically, a full-time development associate to join a two-person team. The most recent holder of the job stayed less than a year, and before that the position was vacant for three months.
 Why the high turnover? It is not an unpleasant job -- far from it. The salary is relatively high for an entry-level position -- starting around $40,000 depending on experience -- and the workload is not onerous. The library operates as a public-private partnership, receiving money from the town. In any given year, it raises $800,000 to $1 million. Yet in terms of retention, Ms. Vinton says, ''You could be looking at a two- to three-year stint but you might find that six months is your typical time frame.''
 In the New York area, Ms. Vinton is hardly alone in her frequent, and sometimes frustrating, search for development staff members. The Association of Fundraising Professionals reports that in 2003 the national turnover rate for fund-raisers in the United States was 25 percent. (In Canada, it was 34 percent.) 
 For nonprofits in the New York area, those figures suggest a problem that has gone from worrisome to critical. A recent scan of the job listings on the Web site of The Chronicle of Philanthropy (www.philanthropy.com), a biweekly newspaper, showed that nearly 100 groups in the region were looking for fund-raisers, grant writers, special events coordinators and other development workers -- and those are only the groups that have continued to place ads. 
 Adding to turnover is a phenomenon found in other professions like banking and advertising: when a popular boss leaves, she tends to take a team of important players with her. Linda N. Schapiro, who is in her fourth year as director of development and alumni affairs at the Dalton School in Manhattan, is a good example of this trend. 
 Two of her current development staff members are former employees from another New York City private school, where they worked together. She calculates that she and her two staff members have held a total of 8 jobs in the last 10 years.
 ''I have gone from school to school because, in each case, the head of school was someone I wanted to work for,'' Ms. Schapiro said. Demand for development staff members, as fund-raisers are called, has outpaced supply, even as thousands of potential employees poured into the field during the recession. ''There is a terrible dearth of good fund-raisers,'' said Naomi Levine, executive director of the George H. Heyman Jr. Center for Philanthropy and Fundraising at New York University. ''Every day I get three or four inquiries across my desk.'' Ms. Levine notes that there are 1.4 million to 1.8 million nonprofit organizations in the United States, and that they collectively raise more than $240 billion every year.
 Nonprofit organizations are an increasingly important segment of the national and local economy. According to the most recent figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment in the field grew 2.5 percent a year from 1997 to 2001, outpacing the growth rate for both business (1.8 percent) and government (1.6 percent). 
 But the fund-raisers needed to help support the swelling numbers of employees at nonprofit organizations have proved hard to find, and demand is pushing salaries up sharply, particularly in the New York area. The Association of Fundraising Professionals reported that the average salary for a fund-raiser in 2003 was $71,470, a 9 percent increase from 2002. 
 Benefits have been increasing, too. Employees of charitable organizations typically receive more generous benefits than employees in the private sector and government. Nonprofit workers in the Northeast get the richest packages, making them the most expensive to employ.
 In places like New York, where wage pressure is even higher because of the higher cost of living, some smaller charities cannot afford to hire a development staff. Equality Now, an international women's rights organization based in Manhattan, has no full-time fund-raiser, even though it must raise $1.3 million a year to maintain its current level of operations. 
 ''We're forever faced with a chicken-and-egg situation,'' said its executive director, Taina Bien-Aime. ''We can't survive without fund-raising, but hiring a fund-raiser is expensive.'' This year, she said, Equality Now's directors decided to hire a development director, even if it meant drawing down cash reserves. Ms. Bien-Aime said the organization was offering a salary of $60,000 to $75,000, hoping the cost would eventually more than pay for itself.
 Some organizations are finding it so difficult to find fund-raisers that they use headhunters to conduct the search, even though this raises the cost considerably. ''Now I'm seeing smaller groups using executive search services,'' says Sally-Ann Hard, a recruiter in New York who has 13 years of experience. Even bigger organizations are feeling the pressure. The Jewish Museum, which has a development staff of 18, has been looking for a director of institutional giving, a senior position, says Lynn Thommen, deputy director for external affairs. The museum, which celebrated its 100th anniversary last year, raises $9 million every year for its annual fund and has embarked on a $75 million endowment campaign. Ms. Thommen says that the creation of new wealth during the stock market boom of the 1990's encouraged existing institutions in the New York area to expand, and created new charities in fields like Jewish culture and heritage, which already had well-established museums and nonprofit groups.
 When she started at the Jewish Museum in 1989, the Museum of Jewish Heritage, the Jewish Community Center in Manhattan, and the Jewish Children's Museum did not exist, Ms. Thommen said. ''It makes fund-raisers a white-hot commodity and employers are upping the ante in terms of compensation.'' 
 Other factors affect the hiring and firing of fund-raising staff members, too. As in any field, the trick is to find not just a warm body but someone who is right for the job -- a challenge when so many other groups are competing for the same people. 
 Patricia Hynes, vice president for institutional advancement at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, who recently hired an assistant director of alumni relations, is looking for an annual fund director to join her 25-member development staff. She said there was often reluctance to dismiss a development staff member. 
 In all fairness, however, fund-raising is more difficult than it was only a decade ago, when Wall Street and private foundations were flush with cash and charities could practically enjoy one-stop shopping with large grants from the government or huge philanthropies like the Ford Foundation. 
 Nobody knows better how times have changed than Paula Kerger, the chief operating officer of WNET, Channel 13, the public broadcasting station, who is seeking a new deputy director of foundation and government grants. ''More organizations need to raise money because government has cut back,'' she said.
 Her development staff of 12 and membership department of 15 has not suffered from the high turnover rates that have plagued some other nonprofits -- Channel 13 employees stay an average of 10 years, she said -- and the station has worked hard to broaden its donor base and has even changed long-standing practices like accepting advertising to meet its budget. 
 Despite these challenges, Ms. Kerger says that nonprofit fund-raising is a great field to work in and offers psychological rewards the private sector cannot. ''The kind of person who gravitates to nonprofits isn't just looking for where they can make the maximum money,'' she said. ''They go home at the end of the day and feel they've made the world a better place.''

HEADLINE: A Place Apart Becomes a Place Discovered

BYLINE: By PATRICK O'GILFOIL HEALY

 BODY:
HERE is a spring afternoon in the East Side enclave Tudor City: Old women in nightgowns check the mail. Nannies eat lunch in a tiny, shaded park. Children stroll down the middle of the street. Workers scale Gothic apartment buildings, minding the leaky old casement windows. A toy-balloon shop closes for lunch.
 This verdant neighborhood of four brownstones and 11 apartment buildings is Brigadoon above the East River. It sits high on an outcrop from 40th through the north side of 43rd Street, fortified against the traffic, noise and constant change that define Midtown Manhattan.
 It is a place where tapestries of unicorns hang on lobby walls and nostalgia lives in the present tense. One main street runs through Tudor City, and it is one way. 
 ''We immediately fell in love with the place, just all the detail,'' said Lawson Harris, who recently bought a $385,000 one-bedroom with his fiancee, Maria Kelley. ''You're close to Midtown, but you feel removed because you're elevated.''
 But that placid scene is likely to change soon, as developers have discovered the area. The Consolidated Edison Company recently sold nine acres of riverfront land to developers who plan to knock down an old power plant and build luxury apartment buildings and office towers.
 It could be the most significant development near the 80-year-old Tudor City complex since the United Nations was built in 1952. Residents fear the development will add only congestion while blotting out their morning light and river views and casting shadows onto the community gardens.
 ''Con Ed is the most important issue affecting the community, and will be for a long time,'' said George Brown, president of the Tudor City Association, a neighborhood group. ''The whole area is going to be affected by all the new people, new businesses, new residents and new stores.''
 The developer, Sheldon Solow, recently submitted plans to the community board proposing four towers 79 to 85 stories tall that would add 5,000 residential units to the neighborhood and draw in another 14,000 people each day, said Jack Lester, a community activist and lawyer who is running for City Council.
 ''Right now, everyone's experiencing their worst fears,'' Mr. Lester said. ''It's not happening on my watch.''
 Mr. Solow would not discuss the details of the project, saying only through a spokeswoman that his development would ''complement, enhance and honor'' the neighborhood.

What You'll Find
 Tudor City is constantly being discovered.
 New residents tell similar stories. They stumbled onto the three-block neighborhood while heading to the United Nations or the East River. Or they answered an ad for a temporary studio, found this aerie hemmed in by Second Avenue and First Avenue and never wanted to leave.
 The ornate and imposing Windsor Tower, Prospect Tower and Tudor Tower sit on Tudor City Place, a short cul-de-sac that is the neighborhood's main commercial drag. The brick-and-stone buildings are filigreed with stained glass, neo-Gothic crowns and images of lions, pigs and coats of arms.
 But the grand buildings are packed with modest studios and one-bedroom apartments, ranging from 250 to 600 square feet. The buildings along 43rd and 41st Streets offer larger two-bedrooms, as does 2 Tudor City Place, built in the 1950's with few flourishes.
 Tudor City was built for middle-class renters, and many of the old tenants still live in their rent-stabilized apartments with Murphy beds, kitchenettes and views of the Secretariat building. As renters and studio owners move out, buyers are breaking through walls to combine apartments. For real space, look up, to Tudor City's few penthouse apartments. They have two bedrooms, two bathrooms and two stories of windows that gaze over the East River.
 But though 7 to 8 percent of the apartments in the neighborhood turn over each year, it has been three years since a penthouse has been on the market, said Louise Segallis, owner of Segallis Real Estate, which specializes in Tudor City.

What They're Asking
 Tudor City has long attracted first-time buyers and small-time investors with its small apartments, easy co-op boards and cheap prices. 
 But the days of $35,000 studios are over. The average selling price of a Tudor City apartment is $355,167 this year, up from $343,776 last year, according to data from the Corcoran Group. Studios, the most plentiful apartments, averaged $243,200, up from $175,549 a year ago.
 The top of Tudor City's market is modest by Manhattan standards, where the average apartment now costs more than $1 million.
 Two-bedroom apartments range from 700 to 1,200 square feet, depending on the building, and cost $600,000 to $1.2 million. Ms. Segallis said a two-bedroom apartment that was created by combining two one-bedrooms at 2 Tudor City Place recently got $1.8 million -- the highest price she had ever seen in the area.
 Right now, there are 24 apartments on the market, said Laurie Dietz, a broker at Corcoran.
 Brokers said the apartments usually sell within a week and close with few problems. Some buildings, like 5 Tudor City Place, have easy sublet policies and are larded with investors. Others, like the Woodstock Tower, allow only owner-occupants.
 Tudor City went co-op in 1985, and now, owners like Ron Baskin are putting the first generation of renovated apartments onto the market. After spending $100,000 to knock out walls and remodel his kitchen and bathroom, Mr. Baskin is asking $535,000 for his one-bedroom.
 ''They're not the biggest apartments I've seen, but once you live in there you become accustomed to the size,'' Mr. Baskin said. ''It's your own little neighborhood in New York. You don't have cars honking. You don't have people screaming at all hours.''

What to Do
 Midtown beckons, with its spread of restaurants, bars and boutiques just a few blocks away. Inside the fold, recreation is more sedate.
 After work and on the weekends, the Tudor City Greens -- the community garden -- fills up with dozers, readers, drawers and iPod-listening head-nodders. On community gardening days, residents gather to plant, tend and weed together. Young children run and play in the two playgrounds while older ones cross First Avenue to play baseball, soccer or basketball on the Robert Moses Playground near the United Nations. 
 Tudor City's tiny network of shops make it as self-sufficient as a medieval village. The ground-floor businesses include a cleaner's, nail parlor, salon, bike shop, two delis, flower shop, post office, toy-balloon store and pewter dealer.
 One of the newer arrivals is L'Impero, an upscale Italian restaurant at 45 Tudor City Place that serves $25 gnocchi and $31 pancetta, to the delight of Tudor City's newer residents but to the disappointment of some of the older ones.
 ''When we first moved in here, people were like, 'You should serve meatloaf or a chicken sandwich,''' said the owner, Chris Cannon. ''The people here have their own attitude. They're very proprietary about the place.''

The Schools
 Tudor City offers a preschool within a couple of blocks of any apartment in the neighborhood. The Preschool of America sits on the ground floor of 25 Tudor City Place, wrapped by walls of iridescent stained glass. It is full now, serving 30 children, but will have more open slots in September, said Joanna Fan, the owner.
 The neighborhood, though tiny, is cleaved into two separate school districts, forcing parents to buy apartments strategically.
 ''We're split between school districts,'' said Mr. Brown, the neighborhood association president. ''If you like one school over the other and you want to stay in Tudor City, you might have to jump between apartments. We decided we liked P.S. 59 more than 116.''
 Public School 59, the Beekman Hill School, at 228 East 57th Street, is the smaller of the two, with about 375 students. In last year's assessment tests, 68.5 percent of students met the English standards and 63.8 percent met the math standards.
 P.S. 116, the Mary Lindley Murray School, at 210 East 33rd Street, has 800 students and better test scores. Last year, 79.7 percent of students met the English assessment standards while 85.5 percent met the math standards. 
 The local junior high is the Simon Baruch Middle School, where 56 percent of students met state and city English standards while 67 percent met the math standards.

The Commute
 If you work in Midtown, put on your walking shoes. Lawyers and other professionals said they moved to Tudor City because they could walk to their offices on Park Avenue and in the East 30's. Grand Central Terminal is a five-minute walk from Tudor City, and crosstown buses stop nearby. 

The History
 In 1925, The New York Times called the plans for Tudor City ''the largest housing project ever undertaken in mid-Manhattan.'' The earliest residents in the complex paid $500 per year in rent for a modest apartment.
 Developers intended the community gardens to be the heart and focus of Tudor City, and positioned the apartments so as many windows as possible faced the wooded parks, rather than the slaughterhouses that once sat along the river.
 Advertisements at the time trumpeted the amenities of the microvillage, from its delis and restaurants to a bowling alley, library and babysitting service. The complex also offered mini-golf inside the buildings, as well as darkrooms for photographers on each floor, Ms. Segallis, the broker, said.
 All but one of Tudor City's apartment buildings went co-op, and struggled when the city's real-estate market foundered in the early 1990's. Studios and one-bedrooms were being sold at auction for ''crazy low prices,'' Mr. Brown said -- some as cheaply as $35,000.

What We Like
 Landmark status and territorial, devoted residents have preserved Tudor City's facades, grounds and character, giving it the flavor of an immaculate love letter to the past. The Ford Foundation's building on 42nd Street, with its 12-story atrium, is a pivot between the neighborhood and Midtown's high-rise buildings.

What We'd Change
 Still, the Henry VIII atmosphere can get a bit oppressive -- perhaps it's time to consider retiring the unicorn tapestries in 5 Tudor City Place.

HEADLINE: Durable Goods, the Thriller

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
THE monthly report on durable-goods orders is among the grayer items on the calendar of government economic releases, commanding far less interest than measures like unemployment and inflation that directly affect the man on the street.
 But the statistic matters to those better-fed, better-dressed people on Wall Street, and when the Commerce Department releases its report on May orders on Friday, it is likely to be scrutinized with more brio than usual for a reading on whether manufacturing is slowing. The latest monthly survey by the Institute of Supply Management, for instance, revealed more sluggishness in manufacturing than at any time since June 2003. 
 A Bloomberg survey of economists shows a consensus forecast of 1.5 percent growth in the durable-goods measure, which covers anything that is made in the United States and has an anticipated life span of at least three years. The report for the previous month showed more robust growth of 1.9 percent, better than expected but not enough to keep bond yields from falling.
 Changes in yields reflect expectations of long-term economic growth and inflation. Despite the strong number, on May 25, when the durable-goods report for April was announced, the yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury bonds briefly dropped to 4 percent for the first time since February. The yield fell to 3.89 percent in succeeding days, the lowest level in more than a year. It was as high as 4.69 percent about two months earlier.
 Yields have moved back up to 4.07 percent, though they could reverse course again if durable goods for May do not meet the consensus forecast, reviving angst about manufacturing. 
 But Henry Dickson, a portfolio strategist at Lehman Brothers, offers this advice to the anxiety prone: Don't worry and don't buy bonds.
 Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, has warned against reading too much into each number, and Mr. Dickson is inclined to agree.
 ''We have an environment where we're not so sure of the economy, and we're dealing with a lot of different things going back and forth,'' he said. ''We put a lot of emphasis on macroeconomic numbers, perhaps an overemphasis.''
 The durable-goods figure is notoriously volatile, Mr. Dickson pointed out. It can be skewed by a single big order, he said, typically for aircraft, as was the case in April.
 Mr. Dickson recommends that investors keep just 17.5 percent of their portfolios in bonds, a hefty 70 percent in stocks and the rest in cash. A neutral allocation at Lehman is 60 percent stocks, 30 percent bonds and 10 percent cash.
 And he does not like just any stocks. He prefers manufacturing sectors, those representing what he calls ''the back end of the economy,'' a sign of his faith in the ability of global industry to recover from recent sluggishness despite high oil prices and rising short-term interest rates.
 ''We're overweight the industrial sector,'' he said. ''The year started out a little weak, but things are starting to pick up.''

DATA WATCH -- No pickup in excitement is likely this week, at least not from other economic reports. The report on the leading indicators is due on Monday; despite its name, the report encompasses forecasts based on conditions in the previous month and so it seldom riles Wall Street. Home resales will be reported on Thursday and new-home sales on Friday.

HEADLINE: For Illegal Immigrants, a Harsh Lesson 

BYLINE: By SUSAN DONALDSON JAMES

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
ESTEBAN NAVARRO'S disappearance broke a lot of hearts at Trenton Central High School, where the dropout rate among Hispanic students is triple the state average. 
 Two years ago, Mr. Navarro, a quiet and gifted student, was headed for top honors. His teachers said he was a star soccer player who received a perfect score on the advanced-placement calculus exam and was named class valedictorian. By senior year, the long-haired teenager was being courted by Princeton, where he took advanced math classes.
But by spring 2003, when he was a senior, Mr. Navarro's plans to attend college unraveled. As the son of illegal immigrants, Mr. Navarro, who was born in Costa Rica, had no Social Security number. Had he been a citizen, his parents' meager income as a cook and a house cleaner might have qualified him for financial aid, but federal law barred him from receiving assistance. 
 Afraid to risk flouting federal law, Princeton and other leading universities could not process Mr. Navarro's applications, according to several people with knowledge of his situation. And at graduation, as the principal called on him to deliver the valedictory speech, Mr. Navarro had already dropped out -- his dream of becoming a mathematician dashed in a tangle of immigration laws.
 ''He just gave up,'' his 19-year-old brother, Julio, recalled. ''He didn't even put up a fight.'' 
 Mr. Navarro refused to talk about his situation for this article. Now 21, Mr. Navarro, who had attended school in the United States since the first grade, works in a pizza shop outside Philadelphia. 
 Nor is the plight of Mr. Navarro an isolated case. Currently, about 60,000 high school students who have spent nearly their entire lives in the United States are considered illegal immigrants, according to the Urban Institute, a research organization in Washington. And because 56 percent of them are from low-income families, the cost of college is out of reach. 
 One solution is embodied in the In-State Tuition Act, first introduced in the New Jersey Legislature in 2003, which would allow illegal immigrants like Mr. Navarro to attend public colleges at in-state tuition rates. Without legal status, these students, who currently number about 28,000, are charged out-of-state rates that are prohibitively expensive for most of their struggling families. 
 To qualify for in-state status, according to the legislation, students would have to prove that they had attended a New Jersey high school for at least four years and planned to apply for citizenship.

Languishing in the Legislature
 The bill, which has languished in the Assembly and the Senate Education Committee for two years, has the support of the New Jersey Immigration Policy Network, a coalition of students, charities and civil-liberties organizations. 
 ''Immigrants feel abandoned and isolated, and it's particularly painful for youth,'' said Ryan Lilienthal, an immigration lawyer in Princeton. ''They feel they belong here but are stigmatized because they lack opportunity. If we are not careful and close the education door, who knows what direction they will pursue? We've got to find ways to get them legal immigration status.'' 
 Opponents believe that the bill, if approved, would strain classrooms and budgets at public universities and provoke tension between legal immigrants who might not qualify for lower tuition and illegal immigrants who would.
 ''If someone from Philadelphia wants to go to school in New Jersey, and an illegal is getting in-state tuition, that angers students a great deal,'' said Jean Oswald, executive director of New Jersey Commission on Higher Education.
 Consequently, the measure faces an uphill battle, as does a bill pending in Congress that would allow illegal immigrants to apply for federal college assistance. 
 In New Jersey, many advocates of the measure blame racial politics for stalling its passage.
 ''The main perception among the immigrant community is that they are experiencing disguised racism,'' said Carlos Avila, 21, a leading supporter of the act. ''They feel it's a tool of power and a tug of war in an economic sense. The Latino immigrants have the economic power, and that sometimes threatens other communities -- Anglos and African-Americans.''
 The issue is particularly pressing in New Jersey, which has the fifth-largest immigrant population in the nation. Some migration studies say that as many as 500,000 residents are illegal immigrants, although the real numbers are hard to determine because these immigrants live largely in the shadows for fear of deportation. They often shuttle among low-wage jobs as cooks, construction workers and janitors. Their children tend to attend low-performing schools and drop out early to help their families scratch out a living.
 Even so, their children are integrated in the public schools, which by law are not allowed to question a family's immigration status. Once there, the children receive mixed messages. For instance, last year -- to ease the transition of those with limited English proficiency -- state high schools provided bilingual programs for 342,482 students. But when the college process begins, they face insurmountable odds and often receive bad advice. 
 So far, federal and state laws have sent immigrants mixed signals, too. In 1982, the United States Supreme Court ruled that public school students in kindergarten through 12th grade could not be denied an education because of their immigration status. A decade later, the national Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1996 largely cut social benefits to illegal immigrant families, including access to federal financial aid. The law also included a provision prohibiting in-state tuition rates for illegal immigrants. 
 After 2001, California and Texas were the first states to counter that act with laws to treat illegal immigrant students as residents if they had been educated almost exclusively in the United States. Those two states were followed by Utah, Illinois, Oklahoma, New York and Washington. 
 But many New Jersey legislators are hesitant to act. ''We just don't know how it's going to play out,'' Ms. Oswald said. ''We've been waiting to see what has happened in other states with similar laws. What if one is challenged?''
 Despite Mr. Avila's contention that racial politics is slowing passage of the measure, State Senator Ronald Rice, a black Democrat who co-sponsored the In-State Tuition Act, insists that immigrants are an asset and should not face obstacles in their quest for a college education.

'Cannot Say No to Students'
 ''We are who we are and cannot say no to students just because of where they were born,'' said Mr. Rice, whose district includes Newark, where more than 100 languages are spoken in the public schools. ''They are going to public school, they make friends and are doing well, and the only life they know is America. We teach them the values of this country, then all of a sudden when they turn 18, we say, 'The joke's on you.' It's psychologically hard.''
 Such was the case with Dina, who joined the bilingual program at Trenton Central High at age 13, when her parents fled Guatemala. Today, the 19-year-old Dina (who did not want her last name published) is still a force at the school, where she has joined the fight for passage of the In-State Tuition Act. 
 A National Honor Society student, Dina was awarded a scholarship to a local two-year college, where she is studying to become a nurse. Since Dina is an illegal immigrant, she is using a false Social Security number, and she declined to identify her college for fear of jeopardizing her own education and that of others. 
 Visiting the school librarian, Joan Bennett, one day last March, Dina -- president of the Bible Club last year at Trenton Central High -- embraced Ms. Bennett, who was her former adviser. 
 ''You don't see her kind of leadership very often,'' said Ms. Bennett, who has been teaching at Trenton Central High, where 22 percent of the students are foreign-born, for 35 years. ''Dina has a gentle manner. She's sweet. But she's a fighter.''
 Six years ago, Dina's family fled Guatemala in the aftermath of the guerrilla war in which a million people were either killed or disappeared. Like Mr. Navarro's family, they arrived as tourists and then overstayed their visas. 
 Unable to speak English, Dina had a hard time adjusting at first. But after two years in a bilingual program, life started to turn around. Last year her father talked about returning to Guatemala, and she said she suddenly realized that ''I don't know anybody there -- I don't know anything except the food.''
 Dina wants to be a professional, and although her parents are wary, they support her. ''My father told me, 'You can take your decision but everything has consequences,''' she said. 
 ''I know I am taking a risk, but if I don't who will?'' she said. ''You cannot live with this kind of worry -- whether the police will stop me driving or whether I am sick and have to go to the hospital. It's an oppression you feel.'' 
 Today, Dina's father, who was a chemical engineer in Guatemala, is a factory machine operator. The family pays taxes and just bought a house, relying on relatives who are legal immigrants to sign mortgage papers. 
 But the cost of sending Dina to a four-year state college is out of reach. Rutgers charges $16,667 for out-of-state tuition and fees, almost twice the amount that residents pay, and the cost of an education at the state's private colleges would be far higher. 
 That also complicates life for 15-year-old Mitchell, a French citizen of African descent who arrived at Trenton Central High two years ago. ''I want to be a lawyer and go to Princeton,'' Mitchell said with an air of confidence and only a hint of accent. 
 He had no choice when his mother decided to remarry and move to the United States. Mitchell had attended a rigorous school just outside Paris, where the government would have subsidized his university education. But the annual total cost of attending Princeton, where he would like to go, is $41,380 and out of the question.

Not Many Consider College
 Based on New Jersey Census figures, there may be as many as 100,000 illegal immigrants in the public schools. But in 2003, the last year for which figures are available, only about 1,200 had actually considered applying to college, according to the New Jersey Immigration Policy Network. 
 Ms. Oswald of the state Commission on Higher Education disputed those numbers. ''We can't assess the impact, because we do not have accurate figures,'' she said. ''We just don't know how it is going to play out.'' 
 Moreover, opponents of the In-State Tuition Act question whether New Jersey can afford to provide lower tuition rates to those here illegally when the loss of revenue to colleges and universities, already because of budget difficulties, are considered. ''We don't have any more room,'' Ms. Oswald said.
 For its part, Rutgers took no position on the In-State Tuition Act in testimony at hearings in 2003, but expressed concerns about its legal ramifications.
 ''One of the underlying issues from a policy perspective was the inequity this bill would create in a litigious state like New Jersey,'' Sharon Ainsworth, director of state relations at Rutgers, said in her testimony. ''There is a whole category of students whose parents are here working on visas. We would be providing a benefit to an undocumented student and not to a documented one.''
 Mr. Avila, whose family arrived illegally in the United States from Ecuador when he was 6, said, ''My father told me the reason he crossed the border was because he would wake up each night and wonder how he would feed us.'' 
 In 1985, his parents left their children with grandparents and worked illegally in California picking lettuce. The children joined them several years later, and the family gained legal status under the 1996 national amnesty. Today, Mr. Avila's father publishes a Spanish-language newspaper in Trenton and he is a political science major at the College of New Jersey. 
 Mr. Avila, who speaks rapid-fire English and Spanish as he presses for passage of the In-State Tuition Act, arrived breathless and late to an immigration conference in February that was attended by Dina and Mitchell. He darted to the podium with the confident air of a candidate for public office. 
 ''I see people in my life who need help that I can give to them,'' said Mr. Avila, interspersing passion with statistics. ''These kids work hard for all four years. They are top-notch, some of the best minds in America.'' 
 He then introduced Dina, whose English faltered as she fought back tears. 
 ''My father just took me on an airplane to this country,'' she said. ''Now I can see for myself and think for myself. I feel more American than Guatemalan. I want to become a professional, if it takes 10 years. I am working to save money. I want God to help me, and you to help me do it. Like Martin Luther King, we have a dream.''

'These Kids Are My Heroes'
 Robert Miranda, who has been teaching at Trenton Central High for 19 years, said, ''These kids are my heroes.''
 Mr. Miranda, a straight-talking history teacher, said: ''A great majority are law-abiding, in search of the American dream. In the next few months and years, we will see a relaxing of the laws. Once the phobias start to recede, we'll see the economic impact of one person becoming an engineer, a doctor, a lawyer. They buy houses, cars, pay taxes and generate so much purchasing power. It feeds our economy. It's good business.''
 Immigration papers arrived in April for the Navarro family. But they were too late for Esteban, who gave up his dream to go to college two years ago and cut off all contact with high school friends and teachers.
 ''It hurts me a lot,'' said his brother, Julio, who recently graduated from high school and plans to attend Middlebury College, where he was awarded a scholarship. ''When you are growing up, you hear of family members, really smart, who ultimately end up in roofing or as janitors. I see a lot of kids get the door shut in their face. You don't hear many success stories. It keeps me up a lot of nights, wondering why.''

HEADLINE: Icons of Summer Face Extinction

BYLINE: By ROBERT STRAUSS

DATELINE: NORTH WILDWOOD 

 BODY:
THE surf is pounding the rocks at Anglesea, and Moore's Inlet is open for yet another season. Charlie Gracie -- who had a No.1 hit in the spring of 1957 with ''Butterfly'' -- will be playing with his trio every weekend afternoon. Almost every Saturday at happy hour there will be a high school reunion for some Catholic high school from New Jersey or Philadelphia.
 But one day in the fall, when the last beach umbrella is folded up and the final plastic bar cup tumbles across the splintered deck, Moore's Inlet will have its last call after 94 seasons. 
 In its place -- on what these days is exceedingly expensive oceanfront land -- condominiums will reach toward the sun. Generations of sing-alongers and Bud drinkers and just-plain-good-timers will be but a memory as another in what seems like an endless series of icons along the New Jersey Shore gives way to expensive housing -- even in a place like North Wildwood, long considered solidly middle class.
 ''We have seen what has happened to property values in places just to the north, like Ocean City and Stone Harbor, and we were the last of the Mohicans,'' Mayor Aldo Palombo said. ''Now people will be coming to the Wildwoods who never came here before, and I have to think it is good for the community. I'm optimistic about our town's future, and I have to think it will be beneficial for us.''
 From north to south along the 127-mile-long shore, buildings that once were mainstays of New Jersey Shore life are vanishing. Some, like Wanamaker Hall in Island Heights -- built in 1904 as a seaside retreat for young employees of Wanamaker's department store in Philadelphia -- were in disrepair and needed to be torn down. But others, like Maloney's Tavern, a large bar and restaurant in Margate, are just becoming too much work and too little payback for the longtime owners.
 In this hyperventilated era of soaring prices for shore property, most of the buildings being dismantled -- including those in relatively good shape -- are worth far more as land for condominiums or luxury houses than clubs or motels decorated with aging seashells or sailboats. Take the Tradewinds, a club in Sea Bright once so revered that even Bruce Springsteen stopped in for a show now and then. Today it would take a Springsteenesque bank account to find a place there. The club came down two years ago, replaced by 20 oceanfront and oceanview homes, the last three of which are still for sale starting at $4.7 million apiece.
 ''Land is just too high everywhere, especially at the shore, where there is not much of it,'' said Ron Emrich, executive director of Preservation New Jersey, which lists endangered historic properties and serves as a clearinghouse for information about how to save them. ''But it's not just a shore issue. The teardown phenomenon is happening all over the state. Still, we do hear about it in shore communities more often.''
 Indeed, two of Preservation New Jersey's top endangered sites for 2005 are the Doo-Wop motel district in the Wildwoods and the Stone Pony, the seminal rock club in Asbury Park.
 While there always seems to be a movement to save the Stone Pony, the Doo-Wop motels -- most from the 1950's and early 60's -- have been coming down over the last few years as property values in the Wildwoods have soared. The incongruously named Casa Bahama as well as the Palm Beach, Silver Dollar, Dunes, Satellite and Memory -- with its Rolling-Stones-open-mouth diving board -- have been replaced by condominium developments.
 ''A big question about the Wildwoods is what happens when you replace all of these transient hotels where people can rent for a day or a week, bring families and go to the boardwalk, with privately owned condos,'' Mr. Emrich said. ''What happens to your tourist economy when people have no place to stay. Is that the way to protect the town's economy?''
 Nor is the phenomenon limited to the Wildwoods. On Long Beach Island, the Ship Bottom Motor Lodge, Ship Bottom Sand Castle and Sandpiper Motel -- touchstones for visitors to the long, slender island -- have all closed in the last two years, and are now sites of condominiums luxury housing. And the Brandt Beach train station, one of only two depots left of the defunct Long Beach Island Railroad, was torn down last spring so the owners could build a sprawling single-family home.
 In most cases, the shore icons are merely places of memories, but without specific kinds of historical designations. A similar fate could have swallowed up much of the Victoriana in Cape May when it started to revive itself in the 1970's, but the real estate market was mired in recession and high interest rates, and it made more sense to rejuvenate them than to replace them.
 ''It was kind of a ghost town, but bed-and-breakfast people noticed that it was probably the biggest collection of Victorian architecture in a beach town,'' said Adrian Fine, director of the Northeast Office of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. ''The recession essentially saved Cape May. Now they have become savvy on marketing their history, so the majority there is not going to mess with that, realizing the economy is based on saving these buildings.''
 Perhaps the tide is beginning to turn in the Wildwoods. New owners have taken over the Caribbean motel, with its plastic palm trees and swirling rampways to an upstairs pool, and the Lollipop, with its kitschy smiley-face outdoor sign and lollipop-colored motel doors. Both new owners have upgraded the rooms of the circa-1955 motels, with the Lollipop going condo, but staying essentially a motel. As for the Caribbean, the borough council may look favorably on its request to add another floor, assuring its economic viability as a motel.
 ''We've lost about 1,000 hotel rooms in the last five years, but if these owners can make a go of it, I think we will turn a corner,'' said Dan MacElrevey, head of the Wildwoods hotel association. ''We've lost some good motels in the last months, but I think most people like the idea of saving what they see at the Shore. That's what makes for those good, long-term vacation memories.''

HEADLINE: Where's Dad?

BYLINE: By KEVIN CAHILLANE. 
Kevin Cahillane is a freelance writer who lives in Summit.

 BODY:
ONE year ago, Christiaan De Jongh was living the good life. An information-technology manager and father of two in Palo Alto, Calif., Mr. De Jongh had a four-mile bicycle ride through the Stanford University campus as his commute. He often spent lunch at home with his wife and children, or even out on the golf course. He usually found himself pedaling up to his apartment at around 5:15 with the evening spread before him like a clean canvas. 
 Then, he moved to New Jersey. 
 Now, with a new job in Manhattan for the same company, his days are longer, his nights shorter and his anxiety is soaring through the roof of his new house in Summit (the one with 29 years and change left on the mortgage). He is now a grudging member of the legion of New Jersey bridge and tunnel commuters who often skulk from home at dawn and return from Manhattan as dusk deepens into night. 
 These men (and women, too) work longer hours than their fathers did, make more money and endure increasingly longer commutes to earn a living. They are often strangers to their families and communities Monday through Friday, while remaining on a first-name basis with the Starbucks barista. 
 Welcome to the New Jersey chapter of the rat race. T-shirts should be available next week.
 ''The stress is orders higher,'' Mr. De Jongh said of the difference between New Jersey and Palo Alto. ''And I'm not even on the worst end. I get to the parking garage at 5:45 in the morning, and I'm already one of the last cars. By the time I get home, near 7, those cars are still there. People work incredibly hard.'' 
 And hard work often comes with a special set of hardships. Since moving to Summit, Mr. De Jongh says he not only has less time for his two boys, Tiaan, 5, and Stefan, 2, but struggles to find any for himself, whether for a haircut, a visit to the dentist or a round of golf. When his biological clock tells him to go to bed soon after 9 p.m., he rebels and stays up an extra hour to spend time with his wife, Karen, or their trusted servant, TiVO. ''Otherwise, I might as well sleep under my desk,'' he said.
 That strategy might even make sense for Russell Brundage. A 45-year-old investment-banking associate and father of a preschooler, he crossed the Delaware, moving from Secaucus to Dresher, Pa., to be nearer to his wife's family. His wife picked the house, and he moved in without seeing it. After all, he would largely be spending his days elsewhere. 
 Rising at 4 each morning, Mr. Brundage drives to Trenton, where he catches the 5:38 New Jersey Transit Northeast Corridor train into Penn Station. His commute is roughly three hours and three states each way. Sometimes, in the gloaming, he forgets whether he's coming or going. ''I only see Dresher in the dark, and my body clock is a bit off,'' he said. ''But I do it for my family.''
 Yet, a family chasm remains. And an unlikely source is willing to place at least part of the blame on the economic expectations that rest like an anvil (or is it an anchor?) on men's shoulders.
 ''Many men are stuck in a life of working longer and longer hours to provide for a family whose needs (not to mention whose wants) can barely be met on their salaries,'' writes Judith Warner in ''Perfect Madness: Anxiety in the Age of Motherhood'' (Riverhead). ''That's not what they grew up dreaming of. It's not what they signed up for when they married either Many men, forced into provider roles that they never hoped for, must end up feeling ripped off.''
 So where do we go from here?
 Despite the seeming incompatibility of family and career fulfillment, a visit to the New Jersey Transit big board at Penn Station any workday night confirms for many men (and women, too) that the answer is home. The moment a boarding gate flickers into place like the numbers on an old alarm clock, commuters run toward their lives with something like abandon, perhaps just to get a seat. 
 Christiaan De Jongh is among them. He doesn't want to see the train leave the station without him. ''Kids don't care how much money you make,'' he says. ''They just want a piece of you.''

HEADLINE: And the Hot Tub Goes to... Austin

BYLINE: By JOE NICK PATOSKI

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex. 

 BODY:
WHEN Mayor Will Wynn of Austin announced last December that MTV's ''Real World'' would be filming its 16th season in his city, he did so with the enthusiasm of a civic leader who had just persuaded a Fortune 500 company to move to his neighborhood. ''MTV has discovered what we all know, that Austin is a great place to live, work and play,'' Mayor Wynn declared. ''We have a spectacular quality of life, particularly if you're young, energetic, educated, driven and have a passion for the outdoors and live music.'' The announcement was front-page news in the local paper, and it was deemed sufficiently important to be covered by news organizations around the world: ''Real World'' Discovers Another Cool City.
 While the idea of playing host to seven hard-partying, hot-tubbing strangers ages 18 to 24, along with cameras and production crews for several months, may induce rolled eyeballs among the genuinely cool, a growing group of officials, civic leaders and economic advisers in a number of cities understand the value of being chosen to be host to ''The Real World.'' 
 Jonathan Murray, chairman and president of Bunim-Murray Productions, which produces the series, is the man who makes the final decision about where ''The Real World'' films. 
 ''It has to be someplace where young people want to go, or a place they should want to go,'' Mr. Murray explained. ''When someone says'' -- and then he paused where the name of a city would be -- ''you go, 'Oh, that's cool.' Beyond that, the city has to be supportive of the idea of allowing us to take our cameras everywhere and not putting up walls. We've gotten everybody from the New York City subway to the Paris subway to the Austin airport to let us bring our cameras into places that major films can't get into.''
 The greater achievement is that cities are willing to cooperate despite incidents like the raid on ''The Real World: San Diego'' house in 2003 after a date-rape allegation had been made and an assault last year on a police officer hired to guard ''The Real World: Philadelphia'' house. He was attacked by several angry men, including two off-duty officers wanting to gain access to a party.
 In exchange for the all-access pass, the occasional street closing and an inevitable brush or two with the law, the host city reaps 22 weeks' worth of free advertising, plus additional exposure in reruns and on DVD's.
 ''This is a postcard,'' Mr. Murray said of the series. ''The images we paint aren't just pictures; the storyline and everything else reflect the vibrancy of the city we're in.'' 
 The consecutive choices of San Diego, Philadelphia and now Austin might suggest that Mr. Murray is straining for coolness, but ratings indicate otherwise. ''The Real World: San Diego'' was the top-rated series on basic cable among viewers 12 to 34 in 2004, seen by about 3.7 million viewers per episode, according to Nielsen Media Research. ''The Real World: Philadelphia'' has been the most-watched series on basic cable among viewers 12 to 34 so far in 2005, averaging three million viewers per episode. 
 Austin, the smallest city to be host to ''The Real World'' (the show has its premiere on Tuesday night on MTV), had been waiting for the call for years. Officially known as the Live Music Capital of the World, it is the hometown of the South by Southwest music, film and interactive conferences and the ''Austin City Limits'' television series and music festival. 
 ''Austin, I'm told, is the largest city without a major-league sports franchise,'' Mayor Wynn said in an interview. ''People occasionally ask when Austin will get a team. I say: 'You know what? I hope Austin doesn't get a major sports franchise.' I want music to be our major franchise, where a family every few weeks or months spends a couple hundred bucks on live music. How perfectly does MTV play into that?'' 
 So if cities like Austin compete for the opportunity to win a season of ''The Real World,'' why doesn't Bunim-Murray make like an aggrieved owner of a National Football League franchise and demand tax breaks, freebies or incentives? ''We're not quite that arrogant,'' Mr. Murray explained over a soda in the lobby bar of the Four Seasons in Austin, two blocks from the cast house where the wrap party would be held the following day. 
 Mr. Murray cites the Palms Casino Hotel in Las Vegas, where the cast of ''The Real World: Las Vegas'' lived during Season 12, as the best example of how hosts benefit from the show. 
 ''George Malouf really stepped up,'' he said of the hotel's owner. ''Most of the hotels in Vegas are owned by three or four companies, and all of them wanted to work with us. But when we went to see George, his hotel wasn't done. He was still building. He walked us in and basically said, 'I can make this anything you want it to be.' We made it into a high-roller's suite, which he effectively uses and markets to this day. I don't think there's a better example of someone taking the 'Real World' cool factor and commercializing it to great success.'' 
 Last season's choice, Philadelphia, was Mr. Murray's most unexpected selection. ''Philadelphia, more than any city I know, recognized they really need 'The Real World,''' he said.
 He had first visited Philadelphia when he was a college student and had observed a rebirth of its poorer areas. ''More kids go to college in the Philadelphia area than Boston, but the majority leave when they graduate, and they need to change the image of that city,'' he said. ''They've been working on that, and as part of that, the mayor and the folks there recognized that if they could get 'The Real World,' that would go a long way toward changing the image among young people.'' When a labor protest prompted Bunim-Murray to pull out, Mayor John F. Street and Gov. Edward G. Rendell intervened. 
 The upside for that city was an improved perception among an audience that the city had already singled out. Having two gay characters instead of the usual one for ''The Real World: Philadelphia'' dovetailed neatly with a gay-themed tourism campaign that had already begun, said Sharon Pinkenson, executive director of the Greater Philadelphia Film Office.
 Mr. Murray is mum about where ''The Real World'' goes next but dropped a few hints. ''There aren't a lot of overseas places that are on my idea list, but Sydney has been a place I want to go to,'' he said. 
 Canada was mentioned. Meaning Vancouver or Toronto? ''Or Montreal,'' he said with a poker face. 
 ''I'm tracking 10 to 15 cities to see what they're doing, what's going on,'' Mr. Murray said. ''I probably have a list of six or seven cities in my head. There are cities like Philadelphia I wouldn't have considered 10 years ago. Just because you're not on my list today, that doesn't mean you won't be in a year or so.'' 
 And if you are, Mr. Murray is confident that the feeling will be mutual. ''When we're through with a city,'' he said, ''they love us.''


CORRECTION-DATE: July 10, 2005

 CORRECTION:
An article on June 19 about the value derived by a city that plays host to the MTV series ''The Real World'' misspelled the surname of an owner of the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas, where the cast of the show's 12th season lived. He is George Maloof, not Malouf.

 BODY:

I once heard of a formula to determine if it's smarter to buy a ticket or use frequent flier miles based on a per-mile cost. Can you advise? -- Lore Acheson, Southport, N.C.

Mileage-based frequent flier programs date back to 1981, when air travel was still relatively costly. Over the years, the ''value'' of frequent flier miles -- determined by dividing the number of miles required for a free flight by the typical cost of that flight -- was around 2 cents each. So if you redeemed 15,000 miles for a free trip, at a time when domestic flights cost more than $300, using the miles was a smart move. If you found a ticket for less than $300, you would have been better off buying it.
 The equation is more complicated today, when there are more than 70 frequent flier programs and 120 million participants around the world, according to www.webflyer.com, the Web site of Randy Petersen, editor of Inside Flyer magazine. Credit card and other programs have made it easier than ever to build that mileage account, but discount airlines, Internet fares and increases in the number of points required to obtain a free flight (typically 25,000 or more) mean the per-mile value is a moving target. 
 The only certainty is that points aren't as valuable as they were in the past, said Mr. Petersen. ''Two cents times 25,000 miles is $500,'' he noted. ''It's hard to find a ticket that you could use for a frequent flier reward for $500 these days.'' 
 Mr. Petersen suggests that 1.5 cents a mile may be a more accurate formula, but he says that there's more to the exchange rate than number crunching. Some people like to save their points for holiday travel; others may base their decision on personal finances. ''If you can use them to replace a ticket you could buy for $150, hey, if times are tough, then $150 means a lot to you.'' 
 With economy fares low, Mr. Petersen suggests that frequent flier miles are most valuable when redeemed for business- or first-class tickets. ''A business-class ticket to Europe is 90,000 miles; at 2 cents a mile, that's $1,800 -- far, far less than what it would cost for a business-class ticket.''

We want to see some of the sights that the Hudson River School painted, if any of those places still exist. Can you suggest an itinerary, book or pamphlet that would guide us? -- Leonore Levit, Wilmette, Ill.

Considered the nation's first school of painting, the Hudson River School encompasses more than 70 artists of the early and mid 19th century known for their realistic landscapes of the Hudson River Valley, the Catskill Mountains and other locations. The time is right to follow in their footsteps: This month, the National Park Service (with several groups) opened Phase 1 of the Hudson River School Art Trail, a self-guided tour of seven sites featured in paintings.
 Anchoring the tour are the former homes of Thomas Cole (1801-48), considered to be the group's founder, and Frederic Church (1826-1900), one of its best-known artists. Cedar Grove, the Thomas Cole National Historic Site, 218 Spring Street, Catskill, (518) 943-7465, lies at the foot of the Catskill Mountains on the western side of the Rip Van Winkle Bridge. Across the river, Church's former home, the Olana State Historic Site, on Route 9G, Hudson, (518) 828-0135, is one of the region's most popular destinations, featuring dramatic Persian architecture, lush grounds and river and mountain views. 
 According to Elizabeth Jacks, director of the Cole site, visiting all seven sites takes at least a day. Some are accessible by car and others by walking trails. ''The sites that are the most remote will give you the most rewarding views,'' Ms. Jacks said. 
 The new trail brochure includes maps as well as reproductions of the paintings. It is available at sites along the route or by sending a stamped, self-addressed envelope to the Thomas Cole National Historic Site, Post Office Box 426, Catskill, N.Y. 12414. 
 At the New York State Tourism site, www.iloveny.com, you can click on Travel Ideas, then Cultural Tourism, and find a list of 22 sites where Hudson River School works are on view and where the artists lived and painted. Among the best vantage points: Fort Putnam and Trophy Point at the United States Military Academy at West Point, (845) 938-2638; Kaaterskill Falls, Route 23A, Haines Falls; and the Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center at Vassar College, (845) 437-5632, 124 Raymond Avenue, Poughkeepsie, which has about 25 paintings from the Hudson River School on display at any time.
 For hikers, a new book, ''Catskill Mountain House Trail Guide: In the Footsteps of the Hudson River School,'' by Robert A. Gildersleeve, (Black Dome Press, $16.95 ), includes period illustrations and maps to painting sites. SUSAN CATTO

HEADLINE: When the Stadium Makes a Statement

BYLINE: By NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF

 BODY:
MOST stadiums are hard to love. Not even the most beautiful are likely to contribute much to a city's urban vitality. Most feel like big empty containers, black holes cut through the city's fabric. 
 New Yorkers have an added reason to fear them: both the recently abandoned plan for a Jets stadium in Manhattan and the new Yankee Stadium in the Bronx were designed to the standards of a second-rate suburban office park.
 But as singular civic monuments, stadiums can also be particularly telling. More than dazzling structural accomplishments, they can be an instant window into a culture's values.
 Strangely, the most evocative can also be the most barbaric. The taut emotional power of many of the world's most revered stadiums springs from their ability to give architectural form on a monumental scale to the psychological intensity of mass events. The most chilling of these symbolize the coupling of mass conformity and state power -- what Elias Canetti called the ''closed ring'' -- as true of the Roman Colosseum as of Berlin's Olympic Stadium, built for Hitler.
 But in postwar Europe, some stunning designs began to emerge that evoke neither mass hypnosis nor nationalist extremism -- stadiums that seek to transform the collective experience into something more human.
 In Italy, the sensual lines and structural delicacy of stadiums by architects like Pier Luigi Nervi became endearing emblems of a country that was struggling to emerge from a backward agricultural economy and the ravages of war. More recent examples in Spain and Portugal serve as a corrective to the monumentality of traditional stadium design, their forms gently breaking open to engage the surrounding landscape.
 In America today, most new stadiums reflect the values of late capitalism rather than any such enlightened self-awareness. Stuffed with corporate boxes and concession stands, they often represent a weird blend of rigid class hierarchy and a mob mentality. 
 Despite the collapse of the Jets proposal -- a gargantuan bland box emblazoned with corporate logos and advertising -- New York may soon be in store for a large dose of such cynicism. The old Yankee stadium, which at least had charm, is to be replaced by a sleeker, soulless stadium wrapped inside a fake historic skin. And we should expect more of the same in Queens, where the mayor has recently unveiled a plan for a new Mets Stadium.
 If a new model is ever going to emerge, it may well be in Brooklyn, where Frank Gehry is designing a stadium for the Nets that will be embedded in layers upon layers of housing. 
 Mr. Gehry may have the right idea: rather than tinker with the formula, bury it.

It also remains the great prototype for stadium design. (Photo by Angelo Hornak/Corbis)(pg. 1)
Olympic Stadium, Berlin -- Designed by Werner March, the stadium was commissioned by Hitler for the 1936 Olympics. Its stone facade clad in rows of unadorned stone pillars captures Nazism's authoritarian order. A renovation, completed in 2004, did not repress the stadium's past. A gently curved canopy floats just above the stadium's stone cornice line, imbuing the structure with unexpected lightness. But circling behind the structure, the strong geometric forms reappear, as does the oppressive monumentality that makes this an unsettling emblem of state power. (Photo by Harf Zimmermann)
Beijing Stadium -- Designed by the Swiss firm Herzog & de Meuron, the stadium is the centerpiece of a vast building project that is transforming the city for the 2008 Olympic Games. Its remarkable donut-shaped shell, which evokes a gigantic bird's nest, will certainly achieve its goal: creating a captivating emblem of China's emergence as a major global force. (Rendering by Herzog & DeMeuron Company/China Architecture Design Institute)
Palazzo dello Sport, Rome -- Completed in 1960, when Italy was still struggling to emerge from its postwar misery, Pier Luigi Nervi's arena is a mix of structural bravura and sex appeal. Its delicate roof structure, made of interlacing concrete beams, seems more inspired by the taut musculature of athletes than by notions of social conformity. Its clean modern form was meant to symbolize Italy's desire to connect to an emerging internationalist spirit, and a rejection of Fascism's nationalist pretensions. (Photo by David Lees/Corbis)
Soccer Stadium, Braga, Portugal -- Completed in 2004, Eduardo Souto de Moura's stadium is less a self-contained object than an outgrowth of the surrounding landscape. Its concrete stands lean back dramatically to frame the soccer field like two enormous cupped hands. At one end, the stadium is embedded in a former stone quarry
at the other, it opens onto a sweeping view of the distant city. The design is muscular enough to stand up to the natural surroundings, but the feeling inside is one of remarkable freedom, as if spectators were floating on a carpet. (Photo by Agence France-Presse/Getty Images)
Staples Center, Los Angeles -- The epitome of cynicism, the arena's interior is dominated by rings of corporate boxes. In a particularly blunt example of the social stratification that marks most American stadiums today, the entries to the boxes and upper- and lower-level seating are carefully segregated. All of this is enclosed by a tacky corporate wrapper with a few retail shops meant to tie the stadium into the surrounding neighborhood, which is largely abandoned. (Photo by Richard Cummins/Corbis)
 Fenway Park, Boston -- The oldest baseball stadium in America, Fenway Park retains a quaint idiosyncratic charm. Unlike, say, the Colosseum, the stadium's nondescript shell virtually disappears into the neighborhood. All energy is focused inside on the field, which is dominated by the green monster, its towering left field wall. (Photo by Chris Trotman/Duomo-Corbis)(pg. 14)

HEADLINE: Looking Long Term? Get Your Glasses

BYLINE: By MARK HULBERT. 
Mark Hulbert is editor of The Hulbert Financial Digest, a service of MarketWatch. E-mail: strategy@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
MANY investors couldn't care less about the long term and focus instead on what a stock is likely to do over the next quarter -- or just the next week. But even when they do try to consider factors that will affect a company's long-term profitability, they still don't see very far. 
 In fact, a recent academic study has found that few investors can focus on events more than five years ahead, even when those events are very predictable and almost certainly will have a big impact on a company's earnings. The study, ''Attention, Demographics and the Stock Market,'' was conducted by Stefano DellaVigna, an assistant professor of economics at the University of California at Berkeley, and Joshua M. Pollet, an assistant professor of finance at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. A copy is at www.nber.org/papers/w11211.
 The study is attracting much interest because researchers for many years couldn't figure out how to disentangle the attention span of investors from other factors that could also explain their behaviors. How, for example, to interpret why investors are unimpressed with a company's announcement of a new research and development effort that it says will lead to higher profits in 10 years? It may be an indication that investors' horizons do not extend that far. But, just as easily, it may be evidence that investors doubt that the research will lead to higher profits.
 Professor DellaVigna and Professor Pollet solved this problem by focusing on industries whose profitability depends heavily on the age distribution of the population. Bicycle makers are a good example. Analyzing historical data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the professors found that people in their late 30's or early 40's bought bicycles at nearly twice the rate of the overall population, in large part because they were buying them for their children. By contrast, consumers under 27 or over 55 bought bicycles at rates far below the national average. 
 The professors focused on two dozen age-sensitive industries -- from toy and beer makers to nursing home operators and funeral homes -- from January 1935 through December 2003. For each industry, they built a model of the year-by-year changes in demand caused by shifts in the age distribution of the population. On average, they found that when their model predicted a one percentage point increase in demand for an industry's goods or services, its profits that year were 5 to 10 percent higher.
 If investors conformed to the completely rational, fully informed ideal described in an economics textbook, they would immediately take into account the long-term effects of a changing population. The stock prices of age-sensitive companies would thus be bid up or down soon after major changes in the country's birth rate, for example, even if the changes' effect on companies' earnings was not felt for several decades.
 The professors found, however, that virtually no investors conformed to this ideal. Instead, the study found that the price of a stock began to change only about five years before shifts in age distribution started to have big effects on that company's earnings.
 In other words, most investors tend to ignore events that are scheduled to happen more than five years into the future. They are like drivers who ignore warning signs about slippery pavement just around the bend, and instead wait until nearly the last second to apply the brakes.
 Finance theorists may object to the professors' conclusion on the grounds that competition should eliminate the greater profitability of age-sensitive companies. In the bicycle industry, for example, there were many years after the end of the baby boom when new companies could have joined the fray, catering to the increased demand from middle-age baby boomers. Presumably, that new competition would take away some or all of the extra profit that existing bicycle makers would have enjoyed otherwise.
 But over the 68 years studied, competition did not eliminate the extra profitability in age-sensitive industries. One reason, the professors suspect, is the entry barriers to at least some of them. Pointing to the beer industry, they said that despite the opening of many microbreweries in recent years, advertising costs have made it very difficult to compete nationally with the largest companies. 
 The professors also said that venture capitalists and corporate executives themselves might suffer from short attention spans and not anticipate the profit opportunities of more than a few years into the future.
 The findings may seem to contradict conclusions of other research into demographics and the stock market. As reported in this column, James M. Poterba, an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, recently found only modest statistical support at best for the notion that the aging of baby boomers would cause overall equity returns to be lower over the next several decades. But Professor Poterba sees no contradiction between his research and this new study, because it focuses only on specific age-sensitive industries, not on the stock market as a whole.
 The new research points to a potentially profitable strategy: invest in the stocks of companies that, in six or seven years, are projected to be the biggest beneficiaries of demographic trends. If the future conforms to the past, you will be able to sell those stocks profitably once more myopic investors discover the trends for themselves.

HEADLINE: The First Race-Based Medicine

 BODY:
With the unanimous endorsement of an expert advisory committee last week, a heart-failure drug aimed specifically at African-Americans moved a big step closer to regulatory approval. If the Food and Drug Administration gives a favorable nod, the drug, known as BiDil, will become the first medicine ever approved for a single racial group. Its arrival could be a boon to black patients, who die at disproportionate rates from congestive heart failure. But the history of this first racial medicine raises troubling questions about the impact of patent considerations on how drugs are tested. 
 The new treatment, a combination of two generic drugs, was first tested years ago in a broad sampling of patients. The results were deemed inconclusive by the F.D.A., and the drug was rejected for use in the general population. Subsequently, seizing on data indicating that blacks in those early studies had been helped by the treatment, proponents conducted further tests exclusively in self-described African-Americans. The results were so striking -- a 43 percent reduction in mortality when the pill was added to standard therapies -- that the clinical trial was halted early to allow those on a placebo to benefit. 
 The drug has been enthusiastically endorsed by black medical groups as a tool to help lessen disparities in health care between blacks and whites. The chief caveat is that race is a very crude category upon which to base medical treatments. Two experts on the panel that recommended approval resisted the notion that the drug should be labeled specifically for African-Americans. The panel's chairman justified race as a rough surrogate for underlying genetic factors that might make some people responsive to the drug and others less so. 
 What makes the history of this drug troubling is the role played by economic considerations in shaping its conversion to a racial medicine. Some experts believe that even after the first failures in clinical trials, it would have been possible to devise a better study to test the drug in a broad population, not just a single racial group. But the drug's maker, NitroMed, a small Massachusetts company, flinched from that arduous and costly process and opted instead to pursue a narrower market. The patent issue was especially potent. If BiDil were approved for the general public, its patent would expire as scheduled in 2007. Approval as a racially targeted drug would extend patent protection until 2020. 
 The danger here is that as other drugs emerge with better results in one racial group or another, some manufacturers may be tempted to qualify them as racial medicines rather than broader-based therapies. Once a drug has been approved for marketing, even based on narrow studies, doctors are free to prescribe it as they see fit. But they could be prescribing in the dark if no one has tested safety and effectiveness in the general population. Regulators need to find some way to ensure that drugs of potential value to everyone are tested broadly.

HEADLINE: Iraqis Found in Torture House Tell of Brutality of Insurgents

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE

DATELINE: KARABILA, Iraq, Sunday, June 19 

 BODY:
Marines on an operation to eliminate insurgents that began Friday broke through the outside wall of a building in this small rural village to find a torture center equipped with electric wires, a noose, handcuffs, a 574-page jihad manual -- and four beaten and shackled Iraqis.
 The American military has found torture houses after invading towns heavily populated by insurgents -- like Falluja, where the anti-insurgent assault last fall uncovered almost 20 such sites. But rarely have they come across victims who have lived to tell the tale. 
 The men said they told the marines, from Company K, Third Marines, Second Division, that they had been tortured with shocks and flogged with a strip of rubber for more than two weeks, unseen behind the windows of black glass. One of them, Ahmed Isa Fathil, 19, a former member of the new Iraqi Army, said he had been held and tortured there for 22 days. All the while, he said, his face was almost entirely taped over and his hands were cuffed. 
 In an interview with an embedded reporter just hours after he was freed, he said he had never seen the faces of his captors, who occasionally whispered at him, ''We will kill you.'' He said they did not question him, and he did not know what they wanted. Nor did he ever expect to be released.
 ''They kill somebody every day,'' said Mr. Fathil, whose hands were so swollen he could not open a can of Coke offered to him by a marine. ''They've killed a lot of people.''
 From the house on Saturday, there could be heard sounds of fighting from the large-scale offensive to eliminate strongholds of insurgents, many of whom stream across Iraq's porous border with Syria. [Page 10.]
 As the marines walked through the house -- a squat one-story building of sand-colored brick -- the broken black window glass crunched under their boots. Light poured in, revealing walls and ceiling shredded by shrapnel from the blast they had set off to break in through a wall. Latex gloves were strewn on the floor. A kerosene lantern lay on its side, shattered. 
 The manual recovered -- a fat, well-thumbed Arabic paperback -- listed itself as the 2005 First Edition of ''The Principles of Jihadist Philosophy,'' by Abdel Rahman al-Ali. Its chapters included ''How to Select the Best Hostage,'' and ''The Legitimacy of Cutting the Infidels' Heads.''
 Also recovered were several fake passports, a black hood, the painkiller Percoset, handcuffs and an explosives how-to-guide. Three cars loaded with explosives were parked in a garage outside the house. The marines blew them up.
 This is Mr. Fathil's account of his ordeal. 
 He was having a lunch of lettuce and cucumbers in the kitchen of his home in the small desert village of Rabot with his mother and brother. An Opel sedan pulled up. Two men in masks carrying machine guns got out, seized him, and, leaving his mother sobbing, put him in the trunk of their car. 
 The drove to the house here. They taped his face, put cotton in his ears, and began to beat him.
 The only possible explanation for the seizure he could think of was his time in the new Iraqi Army. Unemployed and illiterate, Mr. Fathil signed up after the American occupation began.
 But nine months ago, when continuing working meant risking the wrath of the Jihadists, he quit. In all, 10 friends from his unit have been killed, he said. So have his uncle and his uncle's son, though neither ever worked as soldiers.
 The men tended to talk in whispers, he said, telling him five times a day, in low voices in his ear, to pray, and offering him sand, instead of water, to wash himself. Just once, he asked if he could see his mother, and one of them said to him, ''You won't leave until you are dead.'' 
 Mr. Fathil did not know there were other hostages. He found out only after the captors left and he was able to remove the tape from his eyes.
 The routine in the house was regular. Because of the windows, it was always dark inside. Mr. Fathil said he was fed once a day, and allowed to use a bathroom as necessary in the back of the house. 
 When marines burst in, one of the captives was lying under a stairwell, badly beaten. At first, they thought he was dead. 
 The others were emaciated and battered. Mr. Fathil had fared the best. The other three were taken by medical helicopter to Balad, a base near Baghdad with a hospital.
 But he still had been hurt badly. Marks from beatings criss-crossed his back, and deep pocks, apparently from electric shock burns, were gouged in his skin.
 The shocks, he said, felt ''like my soul is being ripped out of my body.'' But when he would start to scream, and his body would pull up from the shock, they would begin to beat him, he said.
 Mr. Fathil has been at the Marine base south of Qaim since his release, on Saturday around noon. His mother still does not know he is alive. 
 When she was mentioned, he bowed and lowered his head, and began to cry softly, wiping his face with the jumpsuit given him by the marines. 
 He asked a reporter for help to move to another town, because it was too dangerous for his family to remain in their house. He begged not to have a photograph taken, even of the scars on his back. The captors took pictures of that, he said.
 His town has always been a good place, he said, but the militants have made it hell.
 ''These few are destroying it,'' he said, his face streaked with tears. ''Everybody they take, they kill. It's on a daily basis pretty much.''

HEADLINE: True or False: Outsourcing Is a Crisis

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
IF you read only the headlines, the future of globalization may seem scary, indeed. 
 American jobs have already been heading abroad. And as telecommunications and more powerful computers enable companies to take even more jobs overseas, the service sector, which accounts for about 85 percent of the United States work force, will be increasingly vulnerable to competition from the cheap labor pools of the developing world. 
 So the question looms: Is America on the verge of losing oodles of white-collar jobs? 
 Probably not. The threat of global outsourcing is easily overstated. 
 The debate over the global competition for jobs is awash in dire projections. All those legal assistants in New York and Washington, for example, could be replaced with smart young graduates from Hyderabad. Office support occupations -- jobs like data entry assistant, file clerk and the entire payroll department -- could also be carried out in remote locations. ''We are really at the beginning stages of this, and it is accelerating rapidly,'' said Ron Hira, assistant professor of public policy at the Rochester Institute of Technology.
 In a study published this year, two economists at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Brussels estimated that 20 percent of the developed world's employment could be ''potentially affected'' by global outsourcing. That could include all American librarians, statisticians, chemical engineers and air traffic controllers, the study said.
 What does ''potentially affected'' mean? Even if offshoring didn't drain away all these jobs, global competition for employment -- including workers in developing countries who earn so little by comparison -- could severely dent the livelihoods of American workers. ''It isn't going to hurt in terms of jobs,'' said William J. Baumol, an economics professor at New York University who has studied the costs of globalization. ''It is going to hurt in terms of wages.'' 
 But even if millions of tasks can be done by cheaper labor on the other side of the planet, businesses won't rush to move every job they can to wherever the cost is lowest. The labor market isn't quite that global, and it's unlikely to be anytime soon. 
 In a new set of reports, the McKinsey Global Institute, a research group known for its unabashedly favorable view of globalization, argued that 160 million service jobs -- about 10 percent of total worldwide employment -- could be moved to remote sites because these job functions don't require customer contact, local knowledge or complex interactions with the rest of a business.
 Yet after surveying dozens of companies in eight sectors, from pharmaceutical companies to insurers, it concluded that only a small fraction of these jobs would actually be sent away. 
 The report estimates that by 2008, multinational companies in the entire developed world will have located only 4.1 million service jobs in low-wage countries, up from about 1.5 million in 2003. The figure is equivalent to only 1 percent of the total number of service jobs in developed countries.
 Some sectors, like retail and health care, are likely to put very few jobs in poor countries. McKinsey estimated that less than 0.07 percent of health care jobs in 2008 would be outsourced to low-wage countries. But even designers of packaged software, whose work can easily be done abroad, will outsource only 18 percent of their jobs, the report said.
 Moving tasks to faraway sites isn't simple. According to McKinsey's study, many business processes are difficult to separate into discrete chunks that can be sent away. Many insurance companies use information technology systems that have been cobbled together over time and would be difficult to manage remotely. Managers can be unwilling or unprepared to work overseas. And sometimes the tasks that can be sent offshore are too small to make the move worthwhile. 
 To top it off, there aren't that many suitable cheap workers available. Human-resources managers interviewed for the McKinsey study said that for reasons ranging from poor language skills to second-rate education systems, only about 13 percent of the young, college-educated professionals in the big developing countries are suitable to work for multinationals. And competition from local companies reduces this pool.
 Sure, there are a billion Indians, but only a tiny percentage of the Indian work force have the appropriate qualifications. ''Only a fraction have English as a medium of instruction, and only a fraction of those speak English that you or I can understand,'' said Jagdish N. Bhagwati, a professor of economics at Columbia University.
 Of course, many of these obstacles can be overcome with time. The pool of adequate workers in poorer countries will grow, and companies will eventually iron out many of the logistical complications. 
 But that is likely to take a while. ''The rate at which companies are willing and able is much slower than you would realize,'' said Diana Farrell, director of the McKinsey Global Institute. ''We see this as being evolutionary, continuous but measured change.''

HEADLINE: County Seeks Deal on Indian Point, Perhaps in Vain 

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
SETTING the stage for a battle over the renewal of the operating licenses of the Indian Point nuclear reactors, Westchester County released a lengthy study on Tuesday that called the coming expiration a ''window of opportunity'' for negotiations, and said the reactors could be closed voluntarily and replaced with generators running on natural gas.
 But the county did not seem to have much common ground with the owner. A spokesman for Indian Point, Jim Steets, said that ''nobody in their right mind would want to build a gas-powered plant on that site right now.''
The county executive, Andrew Spano, called Tuesday for a ''carrot and stick'' approach to induce the owner, Entergy, not to seek 20-year extensions on the current licenses, which expire in 2013 and 2015. 
 Mr. Spano said the county would offer Entergy unspecified incentives to close the reactors and replace them with gas-fired generators. At the same time, he said the county would press federal regulators to deny the relicensing.
 ''It is not predestined that we should be adversaries in this matter,'' he said in a statement. 
 But the report, by Levitan & Associates, a consulting firm in Boston, did not fully support Mr. Spano's position. Since the two operating reactors were bought in 2000 and 2001, unit 2 from Consolidated Edison Company and unit 3 from the state, their value has risen, the consultant said, because of their better performance, the strong market for electricity and the increasing possibility of license extension. 
 The reactors would cost $1.8 billion to $2.7 billion for the county to buy through condemnation, the report said, and Westchester would then face the expense of decommissioning them. The county acknowledges that even the lower figure is beyond its reach. 
 According to the study, if the plants are retired in 2008 and new gas-fired generators are installed by then, prices for electricity in Westchester would rise 8.4 percent. If the licenses are renewed as they expire, prices would be 7.5 percent lower than if the plants were retired. 
 The study did not attempt to assign a dollar value to the risk of accident or attack. Susan Tolchin, a spokeswoman for Mr. Spano, said, ''He's committed to do everything he can to pursue the safety and peace of mind,'' and that the study showed that a negotiated retirement was preferable to condemnation. Entergy has until 2008 to apply for license extensions, said Mr. Steets, the Indian Point spokesman.
 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which has jurisdiction over reactor operating licenses, has required extensive engineering work by applicants but has yet to turn one down. So far, the renewal applications have attracted little public opposition.
 The Levitan report said that among the advantages of not seeking a license renewal was sidestepping the decision by New York State to require a cooling tower at the plant, which would cost $1 billion and reduce the power output. 
 Mr. Steets said that the tower would probably cost $1.5 billion but that state's decision did not require one. That issue is now in court.
 Entergy, though, seems to have a different strategy. The company is in the forefront of energy producers that are considering building new reactors, although not in the northeastern United States. And it says it is winning economies of scale by operating multiple reactors; it bought a second plant, James A. FitzPatrick, from the New York Power Authority when it bought Indian Point 3; it also owns reactors in Plymouth, Mass., and Vernon, Vt., managing them from an office in White Plains.
 The question of what would replace Indian Point has become more difficult recently. Nearly all the generating plants built in New York in the last few years run on natural gas. In the 1990's, when those plants were planned, gas was selling for $2 per million BTU, but lately it has sold for between $6 and $8 per million BTU. The price of fuel alone for the gas plant would exceed all costs for reactor power, including fuel, capital, maintenance and other expenses.
 ''You can't make money burning natural gas right now,'' Mr. Steets said. ''The only way you'd be able to do it is if rates were raised sharply.''
 In addition, companies that build power plants are finding it hard to build in New York, although this may change if the closing of Indian Point were scheduled. In a report produced in April, the New York Independent System Operator, which runs the state power grid, said developers were having trouble finding financing for new projects. 
 At about 2,000 megawatts, Indian Point would be a large chunk to replace. The two reactors are about one-twentieth of the state's installed capacity and generate one-tenth of its electricity; they are a much higher fraction in the downstate region.

HEADLINE: In Bid for Pumping Station, Water Company Warns of Rationing

BYLINE: By KIRK SEMPLE

DATELINE: EASTCHESTER 

 BODY:
EXECUTIVES at United Water New Rochelle, a regional water-supply company, warn of a dark and dry age if they do not receive permission -- and soon -- to build a large pumping station in a residential neighborhood of Eastchester.
 Without the new pumps, the executives say, the company will not be able to supply enough water to its 140,000 customers, among them Eastchester's 18,600 residents. Rationing will be imposed. Emerald-colored lawns will turn brown. Cars will remain unwashed. 
 But some Eastchester residents and officials are not buying it. They oppose United Water's plan and have been wrestling with the company over it, mostly in court, for about 11 years. The fight, at least on the legal level, is over matters involving the process of securing municipal permission for the project, but a deep suspicion about the pumping station's location is underpinning the community's resistance.
 The origins of the dispute are rooted in a set of rules issued in 1989 by the federal Environmental Protection Agency requiring treatment of all drinking water from surface water sources, with some exceptions. Of the New York region's three main sources of water -- the Catskill, Delaware and Croton watersheds -- the Catskills and Delaware systems were excluded from the requirements.
 United Water New Rochelle, which is owned by a subsidiary of the French utility conglomerate Suez, supplies water to customers in 12 Westchester municipalities. It currently draws about 90 percent of its water from the Catskills system and 10 percent from the Croton system. New York City is building a treatment plant in the Bronx for the Croton water, but United Water determined that it would cost too much to lay pipes and pump that treated water back north to its customers. So it tried to find ways to wean itself off the Croton supply.
 United Water settled on a plan to build the California Road pumping station to draw water from the Delaware system, rather than rely exclusively on the Catskill system. The strategy assured the company that it would always have a water supply should one system be shut down for any reason.
 The company first proposed the project in 1994, and the town initially approved the design, but then the project quickly became entangled in legal challenges over the municipal building and permitting process.
 According to the company, the need for the new connection further increased in 2003, when the New York City Department of Environmental Protection announced that it would be taking the Catskill Aqueduct off line for repairs in 2007. United Water officials say that construction on the plant needs to start by the fall in order to begin operation when the Catskills Aqueduct goes off-line -- ''or we're going to see a lot of dry taps,'' said Richard W. Henning, vice president for communications for United Water.
 The intended site of the pumping station, which is expected to cost at least $30 million, is a parcel of grass and woods the company owns on California Road near Route 22 in Eastchester.
 The plot now features a pump station disguised as a small bungalow, with a manicured lawn and a serpentine front pathway. The plan would require razing the bungalow, cutting down a stand of neighboring trees and building a low 7,700-square-foot building with 10 times the capacity of the current pump.
 Some residents and public officials resisting the plan say they are driven by concerns about aesthetics, the environment and safety. Some residents worry that it will be an eyesore and increase the number of trucks rumbling through the neighborhood. They also argue that with its supply of chemicals designed to condition the water and protect the pipes -- including caustic soda for balancing the water's pH level and a disinfectant bleaching solution -- the plant will provide a target for terrorists.
 According to John A. Sarcone III, the Eastchester town attorney, town officials have been pushing an alternative site, one that is not in the middle of a residential area.
 But United Water says economics and geography demanded that the plant be built on California Road: The site sits in the middle of the company's distribution area. ''Engineering-wise, location-wise, it fits like a glove,'' Mr. Henning said.
 The company has insisted that a minimalist design and creative landscaping will diminish the visual impact, while the number of trucks servicing the plant will average about one a week.
 As for the terrorism fears, Christopher C. Riat, operations manager of United Water, calls that ''a trendy excuse,'' and says a water pumping station is not a likely target.
 ''To me, it's a not-in-my-backyard concern,'' he says.
 A panel of judges in the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court ruled late last month that the company was permitted to submit a long-awaited application for a building permit.
 The town had contended that the company missed its deadline last year to file the application and had to begin the permit process from the beginning, which would subject the company to town reviews that could potentially sink the project. Mr. Sarcone said the town was demanding that the company ''follow the law and the process like every other applicant that has ever come before the town.''
 After the ruling, the company filed its permit application, but Mr. Sarcone said the town still had some fight left in it and planned to take the matter to the New York State Court of Appeals in Albany and, if necessary, to the United States Supreme Court.
 On a recent tour of the site, Mr. Henning gestured toward a cluster of nearby houses. ''This is not going to affect their lives at all,'' he said. The only thing that would affect their lives, he said, were the consequences of further delay.

HEADLINE: The Next Act

BYLINE: By JOEL KOTKIN. 
Joel Kotkin is an Irvine Senior Fellow at the New America Foundation and the author of ''The City: A Global History.''

 BODY:
MY grandparents all landed in Brooklyn shortly before World War I. My mother's parents, who stayed poor, shifted from small apartment to small apartment in Brownsville with their five kids. My dad's family did much better, building a successful garment business in Manhattan and moving to a two-story attached house, complete with backyard, on a tree-lined street in Flatbush.
 Most of my relatives ultimately left Brooklyn for cheaper housing and better schools in the New York suburbs, and eventually others moved to Florida and, in my case, California. Everyone remained ensconced in the middle class. 
 Brooklyn remains a crucible passed through by upwardly mobile middle- and working-class people like my grandparents, who wanted to live in a place where, for the most part, a dollar bought more space, trees and grass than in the human-packed sardine tin known as Manhattan.
 Today Manhattan, like San Francisco, Seattle and other so-called ephemeral cities, is increasingly populated by growing numbers of the young, the rich and those who serve them, usually recent immigrants. But Brooklyn, like Queens and Staten Island, still provides a counterpoint to the ephemeral city, as both a source of reality and a kind of municipal ballast. These boroughs have provided a refuge for middle-class New Yorkers who, priced out of Manhattan and reluctant to move to the suburbs, yearn to raise their families in an urban setting.
 Other cities also have such close-in neighborhoods, places like the Hill District in St. Louis. Like Brooklyn, these areas attract families and long-term residents by means of older, single-family houses, tree-lined streets, thriving local shopping districts, and active community institutions.
 In these respects, Brooklyn also reminds me of the highly diverse eastern portions of the San Fernando Valley, where I live with my family in a 1930's ranch-style house with a backyard dotted with fruit trees and swings for my two girls. The Valley, a sprawling area north of the Santa Monica Mountains, serves as a welcome alternative for middle-class families who have been priced out of the terminally trendy sections of Los Angeles's Westside but are reluctant to settle in the sprawling suburbs farther on the periphery. 
 Whether Brooklyn will retain this role for New York is an urgent question. The multiracial, middle-class character of Queens seems stronger every year. But more than one place is needed to play this role, and Brooklyn's future as a middle-class haven remains very much up for grabs.
 Andrew Beveridge, the Queens College demographer, sees Brooklyn's middle class as squeezed between the urban rich on one hand and the continued presence of a large population of poor people on the other. ''Brooklyn could be becoming another Manhattan,'' he suggests. ''Brooklyn still has places like Bay Ridge and Bensonhurst, but yuppification could end up driving the middle-class families out of these areas.''
 Some New York boosters celebrate the ''new'' Brooklyn as an expansion of Manhattan's sophisto culture, manifest in the proliferation of galleries, boutiques and upscale restaurants, and the growing number of high-end professionals. At the same time, the borough has seen an erosion of middle-class professionals, as well as the restaurants, bars and shops that have historically served them. During the 1990's, the census showed increases of more than 20 percent in Brooklyn's corps of dancers, choreographers, authors, writers, actors, producers, architects, college teachers, designers, veterinarians and psychologists. In the same period, the census showed similar drops in the numbers of firefighters, cabinetmakers and police officers.
 By contrast, until the middle of the last century, Brooklyn served several roles simultaneously. It was a middle- and working-class bedroom for Manhattan, a bustling port, a manufacturing center and a secondary center of local business services. Over the past half-century, much of Brooklyn's indigenous economy has dissipated, with manufacturing jobs falling by roughly 20 percent since 1995. The loss of this long-critical sector has left the borough largely dependent on a single source of new jobs -- finance and business service jobs from Manhattan -- and its real estate market tethered to the exodus of professionals from that borough.
 Brooklyn's wealth is now seen as a product of closeness to Manhattan, rather than a byproduct of improved indigenous industries in growth areas like health. ''There's a tendency to think of economic development as real estate development,'' says Joan Bartolomeo, president of the Brooklyn Economic Development Corporation. ''We have to start thinking about human development, about what we can do here.''
 Ms. Bartolomeo, a lifelong Brooklynite who lives in Bay Ridge, sees hope in the persistence of industries like food processing, the growth of a fledgling film industry in places like the Brooklyn Navy Yard and, perhaps most critically, the roughly 100,000 Brooklynites who describe themselves as self-employed. Local entrepreneurs, working in fields ranging from media and graphic arts to cabinetmaking and baking, could provide the borough with a base of economic growth independent from the boom-and-bust cycles typical of Manhattan.
 IN the next decade, the whole notion of Brooklyn's other-ness may be further undermined by development, particularly along the waterfront. The bold plans for a forest of pricey 30- and 40-story residential towers in areas deemed ''derelict'' by Mayor Bloomberg could transform large swaths of the borough's industrial heartland into another Battery Park City. These developments could attract enormous numbers of Manhattan-like transplants -- transient, trendy, childless, well-to-do -- and this, in turn, could further mute Brooklyn's appeal as a family-friendly, neighborhood-oriented place. 
 ''There are very real concerns,'' says Jan Rosenberg, a professor of urban history at Long Island University's Downtown Brooklyn campus. ''A lot of Manhattan does not have the mix of ages, incomes and races that we have. This is what Brooklyn is about -- a sense of neighborhood and community. There need to be places in New York that have a real public life, where people come to live and stay and put down roots.'' Exactly the sort of place where my grandparents, my parents, and my uncles and aunts thrived.

To the Editor:
 Re ''How New York Can Get Its Groove Back'' (Op-Ed, June 12):
 New York City periodically reinvents itself and is more in its ''groove'' than ever. Thousands of remarkable immigrant entrepreneurs are creating and growing their businesses in the outer boroughs, especially Queens and Brooklyn. 
 This activity is supported by the city's five-borough strategy of infrastructure repair, affordable housing, industrial condominiums and professional aid for the entrepreneurs. A new economic profile is being created for New York.

HEADLINE: UNEMPLOYMENT RATE DECLINES

BYLINE: By John Holl

 BODY:
The New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development announced that the state unemployment rate dropped from 4.2 percent in April to 3.9 percent in May, adding 3,800 new payroll jobs. So far this year the state has added 20,800 new jobs in the private sector. 
Public employment declined by roughly 18,000 jobs last month. In May the national unemployment rate was 5.1 percent. Joseph J. Seneca, a professor at the Edward Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, said the latest figures are encouraging for the state's work force because its on a pace to create 45,000 new jobs by the end of the year. ''The economy is doing remarkably well in New Jersey,'' Dr. Seneca said. ''It's an encouraging picture.'' The last time the state's unemployment rate was at less than 4 percent was in March 2001.

HEADLINE: That Looks Familiar. Didn't I Design It?

BYLINE: By AMY KOVER

 BODY:
INTRIGUED by the stream of traffic to the Web site of her handbag company earlier this year, Nicole Dreyfuss traced it back to a fashion chat room. She was delighted to find one visitor gushing over her bags -- $130 cable-knit clutches held together with wooden dowels and bedecked in preppy-looking ribbons. 
 Delighted, that is, until she saw that someone else in the chat room had told the admirer: ''Don't bother. You can get the same bag at Abercrombie for 30 bucks.''
 Sure enough, a quick Internet search revealed that, in its winter line, Abercrombie & Fitch was also selling a cable-knit held together with wooden dowels and bedecked in preppy-looking ribbons. To the untrained eye, the bag was identical to those made by Ms. Dreyfuss's company, Margaret Nicole of Manhattan. There was just one glaring distinction: the price. 
 Distraught, Ms. Dreyfuss called her mother, Rochelle Cooper Dreyfuss, a professor of patent law at New York University. 
 Rochelle Dreyfuss passed photographs of the two bags to her friend Graeme B. Dinwoodie, director of the intellectual property law program at the Chicago-Kent College of Law at the Illinois Institute of Technology. He advised Nicole Dreyfuss to fire off a cease-and-desist letter to Abercrombie. But, he warned, don't expect much in return.
 Ms. Dreyfuss said that within two weeks, Abercrombie's lawyer, Frank J. Colucci of the New York law firm Colucci & Umans, agreed to pull the purse and make a settlement. Abercrombie and Mr. Colucci did not return telephone calls over several weeks seeking comment. 
 Ms. Dreyfuss's story is unusual only in that she received a response, and some satisfaction. Dozens of small designers say that their ideas have been closely replicated by retailers or other designers. ''This is a very common problem,'' said Donald L. Kreindler, an intellectual-property lawyer at Philips Nizer, a New York firm, who specializes in the fashion industry. ''And it seems to have become more common in recent years.''
 Design poaching may be on the rise because corporate retailers are spooked by the growing influence of new designers. Marshall Cohen, the chief industry analyst at NPD Fashionworld, a consulting firm in Port Washington, N.Y., that tracks retailing trends, estimates that design businesses of all sizes have been able to maintain their 7 percent slice of the apparel market mainly because of growing sales by small designers.
 ''Because most stores are so homogenous,'' he said, ''new designers are paving the way for department stores to separate themselves from the pack.''
 Success, however, can breed problems. Many young designers say they have discovered that the swift success made possible by a big sale to the right store or by the buzz that comes with the attention of fashion-fixated magazines, Web sites and blogs can lead to a boom in imitators -- or counterfeiters -- as well as a boom in customers.
 ''Young designers are finding that with Internet and shopping magazines, the right people are watching,'' said Dannielle Romano, the editor at large at www.dailycandy.com, a Web site that showcases offbeat handbags, shoes and scarves. ''The flip side is that all of the wrong people are watching, too.''
 Like many accessories designers, Ms. Dreyfuss started to worry about possible imitators at an otherwise heady time for her business. In the last year, her bags have been featured in magazines like British Vogue and Elle, and sold in boutiques from Tokyo to New York.
 Allison Burns, a young accessories designer in Los Angeles, had a similar experience. After the actress Cameron Diaz was seen wearing one of Ms. Burns's Faithfull bags last year, Ms. Burns became the ''it'' girl of fashion accessories. Sales of her products doubled in one month. Soon, however, imitation Faithfulls flooded the Internet and the streets of Chinatown in New York. 
 Or consider the story of the designer Lisa Zampolin in Farmingdale, N.Y. When the actress Jeri Ryan appeared at an event in Los Angeles wearing one of Ms. Zampolin's Hot Loops necklaces, sales rose 30 percent. A few months later, Ms. Zampolin said, she learned that a local accessories distributor was selling a nearly identical necklace for much less. 
 An increasingly hectic pace of fashion is partly to blame. In the 1950's, American designers would fly to Paris twice a year, for the spring and fall fashion shows. They would buy patterns of the top couture, but they could not have similar styles for sale to American women until the next season. Today, the clothing company A.B.S. can copy gowns worn at the Oscars within a day of the event, a skill for which its chief executive, Allen B. Schwartz, is famous.
 David Wolfe, a creative director at the Doneger Group, a retailing consulting firm based in New York, said, ''The chase to keep up creates almost a panic situation.''
 Many shoppers refuse to pay a premium to be at the vanguard of design. Why should they? Large discounters like Target and H&M have signed major designers and can deliver fashionable clothing at cheap prices by manufacturing in countries like India and China and flying clothes to stores in the West. Computer systems can track inventories and replace sold-out items within a few days. 
 There is no way for a designer like Ms. Dreyfuss, who only recently stopped knitting her bags herself, to compete with such economy of scale. ''I would have to sell my bag for $15,'' she said. ''That would not even cover the cost of yarn.''
 Most designers do not have much protection from the law. Few bother to get design patents, an expensive and time-consuming process that they say does not make sense in the fast-paced world of fashion. Nor can they get much help from copyright laws that apply to forms of artistic expression, a difficult concept to establish for functional items.
 In order to sue successfully for ''trade dress infringement,'' they must prove that their design is either unique or is an identifiable image of their brand -- much the way Coca-Cola relies on the shape of its bottle as a symbol of its brand. Neither argument works particularly well for fashion designers who may have been in business only a few months. 
 MORE typical is the story of Julie Brown of New York, whose intricately silk-screened dresses, tops and handbags are sold at Bloomingdale's, Saks Fifth Avenue and Henri Bendel. While perusing a fashion magazine, Ms. Brown spotted a butterfly-print halter top from a different women's clothier that looked similar to her own design. Though she has since begun the process of patenting her prints, she never took legal action in this situation. ''It would be a waste of time,'' she concluded.
 Mr. Schwartz of A.B.S. has some advice for newcomers: Stop whining. ''When you are talking about fashion, lose the word original,'' he said. ''Ask the small designers where they got their inspiration. They pull their inspiration from others. It's in the air. You don't sit by the window and wait for it to materialize.''
 He may be right, but young designers say the financial damage is indisputable. Ms. Zampolin said her monthly revenue dropped to $10,000 from $50,000 after her necklaces were imitated.
 Many designers adapt by simply withdrawing from the public eye. After a particularly traumatic knockoff experience, said Amanda Keidan, a jewelry designer in New York, she did just that. She now primarily designs jewelry for private clients.
 Not Ms. Dreyfuss, however. She says she has added a larger bag with a circular handle to her collection. In the next few months, she said, she will invest much time marketing her latest creation -- and not worry about possible knockoffs.

HEADLINE: More Costs To Taxpayers Seen in Stadium Plans

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Last week, in news conferences announcing new stadiums for the city's two baseball teams, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg repeatedly said the city and the state would not subsidize their construction costs. The taxpayers would pay only for infrastructure needed for the stadiums, like roads, sewers and new parks, he said. 
 But a review of the city's tentative agreements with the Yankees and the Mets shows that substantial taxpayer subsidies are built into the construction deals with the two teams, along with other costs that the city did not initially disclose.
 Mr. Bloomberg said at the news conferences that the city and the state would contribute $180 million to the Mets project and $235 million to the Yankees project. The Mets plan emerged last week as an alternative for the 2012 Olympic bid after the city's first proposal, a football stadium on the West Side of Manhattan, collapsed. 
 City officials later acknowledged that they had also promised to provide the teams with sales tax breaks on construction materials and low-cost electricity, although, they said, the value of those benefits was hard to estimate today given that there are only rough estimates of construction costs. But if materials generally account for about 40 percent of a project's cost in New York, then the Yankees' $800 million stadium could expect a sales tax exemption worth about $22 million. 
 The Mets will also be allowed to collect more than $3.5 million in parking revenues from the 8,800 spaces at the new stadium; parking fees now go into the city's coffers.
 Perhaps the greatest benefit to the teams is an agreement that the city and the state will issue tax-free bonds to finance roughly $1.5 billion for the construction of the two stadiums. That will enable the teams, who will pay off the bonds, to save tens of millions of dollars a year in interest charges, while the city, the state and especially the federal government will lose an estimated $15 million in taxes, according to the city's Independent Budget Office.
 By Major League Baseball standards, the subsidies for the Yankees and the Mets are considered modest, especially compared with the deal in Washington, where the district government is covering nearly the entire cost of a new $535 million stadium for the Nationals. But Mr. Bloomberg bristles at any notion that the city may be subsidizing the privately owned teams.
 ''We make investments,'' Mr. Bloomberg said on Wednesday. ''We don't do subsidies.''
 He said the city will get back far more in tax revenues over the next 30 years than it will have to invest in the stadium projects, although most sports economists are skeptical about that prediction. The city and the state will spend money only on infrastructure and site preparation related to the projects, he said, including new garages and parkland in the Bronx and utility connections in the Queens.
 But according to the city's Independent Budget Office and the Citizens Budget Commission, a private watchdog group, the city and the state are providing the teams with benefits that most taxpayers and businesses never get, including tax-free bonds.
 ''Issuing tax-exempt debt for someone other than the government is a subsidy,'' said Charles Brecher, director of research at the budget commission.
 If the city and the state issue tax-free bonds for the entire cost of Yankee Stadium, the team would save about $12.8 million a year in financing costs, based on the 1.6-percentage-point difference between commercial lending rates and the interest rate on municipal bonds. The Mets would save about $11.2 million annually in financing costs for their new $700 million stadium. The savings occur because the tax exemptions make the bonds more attractive to investors, allowing the teams to pay lower interest rates on the money they borrow.
 At the same time, bond buyers (assuming all are from New York) would be exempt from a total of $14.9 million in taxes: $11.5 million that would normally flow to federal coffers, $2.2 million to the state's, and $1.2 million to the city's, according to the Independent Budget Office. But its officials said that cost was not exorbitant, given earlier proposals.
 ''These deals look to be less costly than some other recent stadium deals, certainly cheaper than the ones at the end of the Giuliani administration,'' said Ronnie Lowenstein, director of the budget office. ''The city is in a very good bargaining position with respect to the teams. We're sitting in the biggest media market in the country. So team threats to move to Fort Lauderdale are just not credible.''
 The mayor noted that the city has to cover the cost of maintaining the stadiums under its leases with the teams. In the past five years, the Yankees paid $26.43 million in rent, while the city spent $23.5 million on maintenance. The Mets paid $24.55 million to the city, which paid $20.8 million maintaining Shea Stadium. Under the new deal, the teams will own, operate and maintain the stadiums, but will not pay rent or property taxes for playing on city-owned land.

HEADLINE: Trade and Aid to Poorest Seen as Crucial on Agenda for Richest Nations

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

 BODY:
The breakthrough on debt relief to 18 of the world's poorest countries grabbed world headlines this month, but with only two weeks to go before the richest nations again take up the woes of the world's poor, this time at a summit meeting in Scotland, two more consequential issues loom: aid and trade.
 While the debt deal, which was reached June 11 at a meeting of finance ministers in London, will free the World Bank and 18 poor countries from decades of futile haggling, it will generate relatively little new money to fight poverty -- about $1 billion a year.
 That is just a bit more than one percent of the aid that rich countries gave poor ones last year, and a tiny fraction of the aid increase that Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain will be looking for when he plays host to the Group of 8 industrialized nations at the meeting, which begins July 6 in Gleneagles, Scotland. 
 Mr. Blair is seeking a doubling of aid, which would include an extra $25 billion for Africa alone. The worry among some of those advocating a huge new infusion of aid is that euphoria about debt relief will relieve pressure on leaders of rich nations to do more. 
 ''The G-8 meeting is make or break in mobilizing resources for Africa,'' said Kevin Watkins of the United Nations Development Program. 
 Over the past year reports from Britain, the United Nations and the World Bank have argued that, yes, African countries do need to root out corruption and improve the management of their economies -- but also that they need much more money to help pay for clinics, schools, medicines, roads and other investments to help millions of Africans stay alive, get an education and earn a living.
 The 15 major nations of the European Union, which already give most of the aid to poor countries, decided in May to almost double what they contribute within five years.
 The Bush administration has declined to make a similar commitment, skeptical that poor countries can productively spend such a large increase. And the likelihood that American aid will grow as much as even President Bush would like seemed to dim further last week. 
 Republican leaders of the House Appropriations Committee had already set a goal for foreign aid spending for next year of $20.2 billion, $2.5 billion less than President Bush requested. (The amount appropriated last year was $19.7 billion.) 
 And even Mr. Bush's own priorities are vulnerable. On Thursday, the subcommittee that oversees aid almost halved the $3 billion Mr. Bush had requested for one of his signature initiatives, the Millennium Challenge Account, which is charged with providing grants to well-governed poor countries.
 John Scofield, a spokesman for the House Appropriations Committee, noted that Mr. Bush's proposed spending on aid increases faster than spending on homeland security or defense. ''That's a tough sell in Congress,'' he said.
 Trade is also a crucial issue for developing countries -- and it will be on the G-8 agenda in Scotland, though the red-letter dates this year are in December at a World Trade Organization meeting in Hong Kong.
 A few statistics suggest the importance of trade to poor countries:
 Rich countries spent $280 billion last year subsidizing farmers and agribusiness -- more than triple the $79 billion they spent on aid. Those subsidies reduce prices for agricultural goods on international markets, making it harder for farmers in poor countries to compete. If all trade barriers were removed and agricultural subsidies were eliminated, developing countries would gain $100 billion in income, according to World Bank estimates.
 As the G-8 summit talks approach, those pressing for increased aid are trying to put the extra billion in resources from debt relief in perspective, and to remind the leaders of rich nations that what they believe the poor regions of the world need is a fairer trading system and more aid.
 ''These are countries that need grant financing to build infrastructure, fight disease and grow more food,'' said Jeffrey D. Sachs, the Columbia University economist. ''These are countries that have nothing. People are dying.''

HEADLINE: These Stocks Are Short on Glamour, Long on Returns

BYLINE: By BEN STEIN. 
Ben Stein is a lawyer, writer, actor and economist. E-mail: ebiz@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
BACK in roughly 1977, my clever screenplay agent, a wizard of an investor named George Diskant, referred me to his stockbroker at Merrill Lynch. That man, a likable fellow named Steve Van Brunt, told me that I should buy a reference book called ''Walker's Manual of Western Corporations'' to find unknown companies for investment with my few shekels of savings. 
 By an amazing stroke, one of the first companies I came upon was called the Los Angeles Athletic Club Company. It was a microcap, a tiny little limited partnership owned predominantly by the Hathaway family. 
 As its name implied, it owned a lovely athletic club in a choice location in downtown Los Angeles. But it also owned probably as good a piece of property as there was in Los Angeles -- the Riviera Country Club in Pacific Palisades -- as well as a long-term lease on a large peninsula in Marina del Rey where it operated as the California Yacht Club, and many other bits and pieces, including a parcel of hundreds of acres in Malibu, a place you may have heard of.
 The price seemed amazingly cheap, and the stock paid a good dividend, and so I bought some. As years went by, I bought more, although it was always hard to find. It traded, as they say, ''by appointment.'' If I recall correctly, I paid from about $60 to about $110 a share for it in the late 1970's.
 It always amazed me that no one in the investment world followed it, and that no one noticed the seemingly obvious contradiction between the share price of the company, formally known as Laaco Ltd., and the value of the company. I bought anyway -- not a lot, but some.
 Now, flash forward. It's 2005. Laaco sold the Rivera Country Club back in about 1990. For this plum, we stockholders got a special dividend of about $550 a share. They sold the Malibu property to the state of California as a scenic area. For this we got another huge slice, although I don't recall the exact amount -- maybe $150 a share payable into the company. And the company has used its formerly sizable cash stash to buy ministorage warehouses all over the Southwest and has become a big factor in that glorious industry, which has been a money machine.
 Now, some hotshots from the East are trying to buy a big stake in the company and are offering about $800 a share. The listed price is now $830 a share. And did I mention that it now pays a dividend of about $42 a share? (It switched from limited partnership to corporation maybe 15 years ago.) If I counted correctly, Laaco has -- from my earliest purchases -- paid me very roughly 17 percent a year, counting those lovely special dividends paid out mercifully early.
 This has turned out to be as good an investment as I ever have made, except for Berkshire Hathaway. I don't tell you about it to brag about my being a great investor, because I promise you, I also make staggeringly stupid investment decisions. I am telling you about it because of some data that my investment-guru pal, Phil DeMuth of Conservative Wealth Management, recently slipped under my door.
 Here is what it says, in a nutshell: If you had put $1 into the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index in 1927 and held it until 2004, you would have the staggering sum of $2,273 of total return (dividends and capital gains). But if you had put $1 into so-called small-cap value stocks -- that is, a basket of the smaller half, measured by market capitalization, of the companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange, then winnowed them into the approximate third of them that had the lowest ratios of price to book value -- that dollar would have grown to the astounding sum of $58,992. 
 To look at the same issue from a slightly different perspective, imagine that you bought the S.&P. 500 in 1979 and held it until 2004. Even with all of the sturm und drang of the recent market gyrations around high tech, you would have seen your investment achieve an average annual total return of roughly 14.9 percent, which is fabulous. But if you had put the same investment into the small-cap value stocks, you would have had an average annual total return of slightly more than 21 percent -- an improvement of almost 50 percent. On a compounded basis, that turns into serious money.
 What is going on here? Why do small-cap stocks do so well over long periods, especially small-cap value -- that is, unglamorous -- stocks?
 First, they are a tiny portion of the total stock market capitalization. All small caps -- again, roughly, the bottom half of the New York Stock Exchange stocks as measured by capitalization, or the aggregate value of their shares -- make up only about 8 percent of all stock market capitalization. That means fewer analysts follow those stocks, so their prices are subject to being mistaken and misjudged and out of date. 
 Second, because they are the ''value'' stocks with lower price-to-book ratios -- that is, they are cheap when compared with the assets they own -- they tend to have little market enthusiasm built into their price. They are the ugly ducklings waiting to blossom into swans. They are small, overlooked and underloved. 
 Big-cap growth stocks have a lot of hope and glory built into the price. Small-cap stocks have much less hope and hype in them. This means that they have more room to grow. And, grow they do, historically speaking, as they are discovered.
 NOW, a few cautions: The standard deviations of the small-cap value stocks tend to be larger than those of large-cap growth or value stocks: Their prices fluctuate more. Patience is required. Second, do not take Laaco as an example of how these stocks will go. Laaco is a micro-cap -- far, far smaller than the small-cap stocks that trade on the New York Stock Exchange -- and it was a lucky strike illustrative of general principles only. 
 (And, no, if you are a rich hedge fund manager, you cannot buy Laaco as a whole. The supersmart Hathaways still control it, and I don't think they want to sell -- and, at $830, it is no longer a great bargain.)
 But should small-cap value be in your portfolio? Past performance is no guide to future returns, but I would say history tells us that a diversified basket of small-cap should be at least a part -- maybe a fairly big part -- of a portfolio meant to endure for a few years. 
 There are a number of ways to buy small-cap stocks inexpensively. One is to buy the Russell 2000 Value Index fund. Another is to buy the S.&P. Small Cap 600/Barra Value fund. And other funds are coming out all the time in this index-mad, E.T.F.-crazy world. Talk to your financial adviser. I don't want you to be poor in your old age.

HEADLINE: Gee, Fixing Welfare Seemed Like a Snap

BYLINE: By GARDINER HARRIS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
REMEMBER the hot debate over the transformation of the American welfare system? When President Bill Clinton signed the welfare reform act in 1996, which gave states wide latitude in determining benefits, the federal government believed it had changed the way the country thought about antipoverty programs.
 But if overhauling welfare as we knew it gave politicians headaches almost a decade ago, fixing Medicaid -- the nation's largest antipoverty program -- will give them ulcers. 
 Medicaid has grown so large, providing health care to more than 52 million people, that it is bankrupting state governments. The program now soaks up 22 percent of the average state budget and takes a larger share of state spending than spending on all elementary and secondary education, according to the National Governors Association. Nearly two-thirds of nursing home residents have their care paid for by Medicaid. 
 And as the population ages, Medicaid spending will only skyrocket -- a prospect that has alarmed both governors and the federal government.
 Mike Huckabee, the Republican governor of Arkansas, representing his colleagues, told the Senate and House last week that Medicaid is unsustainable in its current form. Representative Joe L. Barton, a Texas Republican, said in an interview that he would produce legislation this year that would cut Medicaid spending.
 Other states have already taken some substantial steps. Tennessee will soon terminate coverage of more than 300,000 adults. Missouri, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Mississippi have either cut benefits or enrollments. Governors say they want legislation that will give them the flexibility to make even more changes.
 Under the federal welfare law, states were free to experiment, but doing so under Medicaid will be more difficult. The program is endlessly complicated, and any changes could have unintended and expensive consequences. 
 Moreover, politicians may have a hard time selling the public on any proposal. After all, voters may be more comfortable spending money on health care than on a government dole. And, unlike welfare, the middle class benefits from Medicaid, either directly through nursing home payments for their elderly parents and or indirectly, through local economies that depend on health care.
 In hindsight, the overhaul of welfare was a relatively simple concept. Drop someone from the rolls, and give them incentives, and they might take a job at McDonald's, become a manager, and eventually open their own restaurant. However unlikely, this chain of events is possible. 
 Medicaid is endlessly more complex. For instance, 42 percent of Medicaid's expenses underwrite care for elderly people who are also eligible for Medicare. Substantive changes in either program tend to affect the other. Medicaid is also affected by rules governing private health insurance, since anything that makes private insurance more expensive tends to increase the Medicaid rolls.
 And any ill-considered change could have expensive consequences, say many health care economists. A growing number of uninsured patients might crowd hospital emergency rooms with problems that could have been treated earlier and more cheaply had the patients remained in Medicaid. 
 To pay for treating the uninsured, hospitals increase rates for the insured. Insurance rates rise. Strapped employers drop coverage. And the newly uninsured apply for Medicaid or further crowd hospitals. Some analysts worry that as the ranks of the uninsured grow -- they now number more than 45 million -- the nation may reach a tipping point where the nation's private health care system starts to collapse.
 Cutting Medicaid financing could also adversely affect the economies of some communities. 
 Consider the situation of Hazard, Ky., a poor town of about 4,800 in Appalachia. 
 ''If Medicaid took a big cut, our civic infrastructure would just about be destroyed,'' said Judy J. Owens, director of the University of Kentucky Center for Rural Health, which is based in Hazard. ''This is very scary for us.''
 Even before the welfare overhaul, Medicaid payments into Perry County -- where Hazard is -- dwarfed those for welfare. 
 In 1995, the federal and state governments spent $3.7 million on welfare payments in Perry County and $27.8 million in Medicaid reimbursements.
 By 2003, the most recent year for which numbers are available, welfare payments in Perry County had dropped 25 percent to $2.7 million while Medicaid spending in the county doubled to $55.2 million. Annual welfare payments in Perry County now total less than three weeks' worth of Medicaid reimbursements.
 Indeed, Medicaid has become the area's lifeblood. One of Hazard's biggest employers is its hospital, Hazard A.R.H. Regional Medical Center. In the region, nursing jobs long ago outstripped coal mining jobs. ''For the communities in Eastern Kentucky that have been successful since coal mining collapsed, their strategy has been to develop health care,'' Ms. Owens said. There is also the question of whether voters think of Medicaid as a government program that they want to dispense with -- like welfare -- or that they want to keep, like Social Security. And that may make cutbacks difficult.
 ''There is no real or perceived demon in Medicaid as there was with the 'welfare queens' of a decade ago,'' said Gov. Mark Warner of Virginia, a Democrat. ''Nobody talks about the cycle of Medicaid dependency.''
 Instead, the conflict could well be generational.
 While half of Medicaid's enrollees are children, they receive only 19 percent of the program's resources. The rest finances the needs of the elderly, disabled and other adults.
 ''The emotional debate that we're eventually going to have to have is the old-versus-the-young debate,'' said Representative Barton. ''Two-thirds of the dollars in Medicaid go to old people when two-thirds of the needs in terms of health care are in children and young people. No politician wants to touch that.''

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article last Sunday about attempts to overhaul Medicaid misstated the intentions of Representative Joe Barton, a Republican from Texas who heads the energy and commerce committee. He said he expected to change the program, not to cut it.

HEADLINE: Scrutinizing the State of the African-American Male, and How to Improve It

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE

 BODY:
Why are African-American men more likely to wind up in jail, or unemployed or in poorer health than white men? These were just a couple of the questions addressed yesterday at an impassioned conference on the state of the African-American male. 
 The event, held at the New York University School of Law, was convened by members of the Congressional Black Caucus representing local districts. It concentrated on black men in New York and New Jersey, but was part of a nationwide effort to draw attention to the challenges facing black Americans everywhere.
 The conference was attended by nearly 1,000 people, and much of the day was filled with detailed reports, lectures and shouted questions from a sometimes volatile audience. 
 Despite the occasional disturbance, however, participants focused less on problems than solutions. Several speakers called on the crowd to act, not just speak, and start within their own community. 
 ''We want you to be involved in changing the image, changing the responsibility and taking the responsibility,'' said United States Representative Gregory W. Meeks, a Democrat from Queens. ''As Frederick Douglass said 150 years ago, he who wants and must be free should strike the first blow for freedom.''
 Most of the day's discussion centered on the intersection of education and jobs. Several speakers cited a study, released last week by two Princeton University professors, that found that white men with prison records are far more likely to receive offers for entry-level jobs than black men with identical criminal histories, and sometimes even black men who have never been arrested. 
 Senator David A. Paterson, the minority leader of the State Senate, and United States Representative Major R. Owens of Brooklyn complained that money for jobs programs is often spread too thin to help blacks who are most in need. 
 The Rev. Al Sharpton, in a raucous 20-minute speech that brought the crowd to its feet, proposed a more immediate form of opposition: protest. Noting that the city plans to build new stadiums for the Mets and the Yankees, he said that people should take to the streets if the construction contracts do not include written guarantees of employment for African-Americans. 
 ''We must tell this town,'' he said, ''that you ain't building nothing unless we are all part of the building.'' 
 Other speakers suggested starting programs that provide professional mentoring, pooling of finances among churches and increased support for vocational and all-male schools. 
 A number of programs already in place -- including the Eagle Academy for Young Men, an all-male public school in the Bronx -- were touted as examples. 
 Dr. Edison O. Jackson, the president of Medgar Evers College in Brooklyn, described a ''male empowerment center'' at the school, which he said increased enrollment among young black men by 23 percent last year with mentoring assistance and recruiting among certain high schools in the area. 
 Rodney Brutton, a project director at the New Jersey Institute for Social Justice, offered details on a program in Newark that helped 157 Essex County residents get apprenticeships with area construction unions. Among them was one 19-year-old who earned more than $50,000 in his first year. 
 There were also calls to reverse what many described as a crisis in health care for African-Americans. 
 Antonio D. Martin, executive director of the Queens Hospital Center, cited statistics showing that African-Americans were more likely than members of other ethnic groups to suffer from hypertension, cancer, obesity and heart disease.
 ''We need to let our men know that prevention is important, that engaging with a primary care physician is not just smart,'' Mr. Martin said. ''It's necessary.''
 In some of the comments, there were echoes of Bill Cosby's series of speeches last year, which drew national attention because the comedian criticized some black parents for buying their children expensive sneakers and other accessories of rap culture instead of prodding them to study. 
 And yet, while the criticism of hip-hop culture drew applause, David R. Jones, president of the Community Service Society of New York, reminded the audience that the men in dark suits on the dais probably looked ridiculous and dangerous to their own parents when they were young and sporting the fashions of the 1970's. 
 ''We have to give our young people a break,'' said Mr. Jones. ''They can't abuse women or themselves, but don't take the image, any more than what we looked like at that age, and write off a whole generation as beyond redemption.''

HEADLINE: An Office and a Gentleman

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

DATELINE: MOREHEAD CITY, N.C. 

 BODY:
SHORTLY before the terrorist attacks of 2001, Gen. H. Hugh Shelton, then the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the top military adviser to President Bush, met at an undisclosed location in California with Gen. Richard B. Myers, who later succeeded him in that job, and Gen. Michael E. Ryan, the Air Force chief of staff.
 For eight hours, a special Pentagon representative briefed them on matters of strategy and the future. But the briefing was not about national security. Rather, it was about their own financial future -- how to get seats on corporate boards, what kinds of pay packages to ask for, how to approach future employers and how to gain perks, stock options and lucrative consulting contracts.
 Unlike old soldiers who once just faded away, as Gen. Douglas MacArthur famously said, today's old soldiers -- or at least the best-known four-star generals, full admirals and other top military brass -- are finding new wealth and celebrity. It comes not just in the form of book deals, speaking tours and stints as television commentators but also, increasingly, positions as executives and on the boards of companies that do business with the Pentagon and other parts of the government. 
 ''The day I left the military,'' General Shelton said in an interview at his waterfront home here, ''my phone started to ring off the hook.''
 Those calls came from corporations eager to get a slice of business from a Pentagon that will spend $78 billion next year on weapons -- out of a total 2006 budget that is just more than $400 billion -- as well as from a Department of Homeland Security that has a $32 billion budget for next year. 
 Aside from the obvious players like Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Boeing, which have long had retired top military officers on their boards, there is also interest from lesser-known Pentagon contractors. These newer competitors -- such as DynCorp, Acxiom and M.I.C. Industries -- are attracted by the opportunities created as the United States scrambles to cope with new and different threats in the war on terrorism.
 Companies seek out retired military brass both for their stature and their easy access to decision makers at the Pentagon, Congress and the White House. Once on board, the soldiers are often only a phone call away from Pentagon officials with whom they once worked.
 ''Why do you think they are wanted on corporate boards?'' asked Lawrence J. Korb, a military analyst at the Center for American Progress, a liberal policy research group in Washington. ''It's not because someone led the Persian Gulf war, but for who they know, and their contacts. They can open the door.''
 Even more, their presence -- and their image of rectitude and probity -- can add luster to a corporate image. And, having spent so many years inside the Pentagon, they can also help corporations understand how the government works and what it really wants. General Shelton, for instance, is still on a first-name basis with many in the Pentagon and at the White House and, because he still has his security clearances, is in the flow of important Pentagon information.
 This trend has hardly gone unnoticed in Congress. The Senate, prodded by Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, has included a provision in the latest defense spending bill requiring military contractors to disclose the names of all former Defense Department officials they hire. Senator McCain, a former naval aviator and the son and grandson of admirals, has long been a critic of the Pentagon's revolving door.
 The move for greater disclosure gained momentum after an Air Force official was found to have been negotiating jobs at the Boeing Company for herself and members of her family while overseeing Boeing contracts for the Pentagon. The Pentagon official, Darleen A. Druyun, was hired, and later fired, by Boeing, and was eventually sentenced to nine months in prison. Boeing's former chief financial officer, Michael M. Sears, was sentenced to four months in prison, and was also fined $250,000.
 No one has suggested that any recently retired four-star generals and admirals have done anything wrong. The officers themselves say they are mostly interested in providing for themselves and their families, as well as taking on new challenges.
 Since retiring from the Army in October 2001, General Shelton has fashioned a new career as a director of five large corporations, including Anheuser-Busch. All of these companies do business with the government, which they say is one reason they sought him out. He is also a consultant to Cisco Systems and Northrop Grumman and a director at two smaller companies, one of which is a military contractor.
 He has found work outside the military-industrial complex, too. Early on in the current Iraq war, for example, he was a paid commentator for NBC News. He also has set up a leadership institute at his alma mater, North Carolina State University, and gives about 20 speeches a year -- most of them for what his booking agent said were ''five figure'' fees.
 EVEN Wall Street is finding retired military officers useful. Robert B. McKeon, the president of Veritas Capital, an investment firm in New York that owns military companies with $3 billion in sales, has put retired officers on the boards of his portfolio companies because ''it gives comfort to the government.''
 Those associated with Veritas include three former retired generals, Anthony C. Zinni of the Marines, Barry R. McCaffrey of the Army and Richard E. Hawley of the Air Force, and two former Navy admirals, Joseph W. Prueher and Leighton W. Smith Jr.
 ''When you have a distinguished four-star,'' said Mr. McKeon, referring to the most senior ranks in all four branches of the military, ''our government customer knows a company is in good hands.''
 ''Besides getting their insights,'' he added, ''they really can pick up the phone and call someone.''
 This warm embrace by corporate America is a new twist on Washington's ever-spinning revolving door between government service and private gain. But high-ranking officers like General Shelton, a former Special Forces paratrooper who has risked his life and led military campaigns, say they see it differently. They say they have little to show financially for decades of public service.
 ''It's a misperception that we are very wealthy and are paid well,'' said General Shelton, who served for 38 years before retiring at the age of 60. ''Most people are astonished that after you get out of the service, we need to work if we want to accumulate wealth or live more comfortably.''
 That said, four-star generals are hardly on the road to the poorhouse. Top base pay for a general at that level is $150,000, with retirees getting 75 percent of that each year, indexed for inflation. And, unlike many civilians, military officers do not have to contribute to their own retirement plans or cover many health care costs. They get health care for life, often at top military hospitals, and can shop at military stores that one Pentagon spokesman said ''make Costco look expensive.''
 STILL, for someone like General Shelton, who has been the nation's top military strategist and who slept for years with a beeper and next to a ''hot line'' phone to the White House, his retirement income pales next to the multimillion-dollar retirement packages of civilians at the top of the corporate game.
 Military officers often ask their families to pay a heavy price for the sake of their careers. General Shelton, for example, moved his family 29 times before settling here, just months ago, into his lovely but hardly lavish waterfront home where portraits of Robert E. Lee and Ulysses S. Grant decorate the dining room and photographs of General Shelton with world leaders are displayed elsewhere.
 In recent American history, few retired generals have scored as big as Dwight D. Eisenhower, who got the ultimate chief executive's job: president of the United States. World War II provided plenty of other big names like George S. Patton, Omar N. Bradley, Chester W. Nimitz and General MacArthur, but they are celebrated mainly in history books and not at shareholders' meetings.
 After the Vietnam War, most top generals retired quietly, largely because the war was so unpopular. When asked to account for the difference today, General Shelton responded with one word: ''media.''
 The Persian Gulf war, the first war to be televised internationally and live, created a new generation of telegenic generals, far more marketable than those before them.
 ''When you are running a major military operation and every day something is happening, you get a lot of attention,'' said General Shelton, whose daily briefings during a humanitarian campaign in Haiti in 1994 were seen worldwide. ''The more exposure we got, the more people appreciated that there are a lot of high-quality people, and in some cases some brilliant people, serving in uniform.''
 Retired officers and other Defense Department employees, including civilians, must be careful to conform to federal conflict-of-interest rules that forbid direct lobbying of former Pentagon colleagues, an activity that many former four-stars say they find distasteful anyway. The rules, however, do permit former officers to advise and represent military contractors, and that, government watchdog groups say, is a far more subtle -- and quietly powerful -- use of their status.
 ''When public service meets private gain,'' said Danielle Brian, executive director of the Project on Government Oversight, a nonprofit group that monitors government contracts, ''you have to question whether leaving it up to personal honesty is adequate.'' 
 General Shelton, like other retired officers, bristled at any hint of impropriety. ''I'd rather be shot than do something illegal, immoral or wrong,'' he said.
 In some ways, the two most famous veterans of the Persian Gulf war -- Colin L. Powell, then the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the battlefield commander who headed Operation Desert Storm -- opened the door for General Shelton and today's other celebrity generals. As a result, General Shelton and his peers have a broader array of business options available to them. 
 General Zinni, for example, is the president for international operations of M.I.C. Industries, which makes temporary structures for the military, and a director of BAE Systems and DynCorp, both Pentagon contractors. He is also on the board of the MHI Hospitality Corporation, which operates Hilton and Holiday Inn hotels, and is an adviser to Veritas, the military contractor.
 General Zinni said he did not seek out any of his employers. ''In every case they found me,'' he said in a recent interview from his office at M.I.C. Industries in Reston, Va. (General Shelton, too, is associated with M.I.C., as the vice chairman of its board of advisers.) 
 Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who recently cut back on his activities after a stroke, is on the boards of Boeing, L-3 Communications and United Defense Industries, all military contractors.
 Before making his 2004 presidential bid, Gen. Wesley K. Clark, a former supreme allied commander of NATO, had seats on boards of several high-technology companies that worked with the Pentagon. He serves on some of the same boards today and has added others, also government contractors. He has served as a director of Acxiom, a data supplier to the Department of Homeland Security, and Allied Worldwide, which moves military families around the globe.
 Military contractors are not the only companies seeking to bask in the glow of retired four-stars. Gen. Tommy R. Franks, the former American commander in Afghanistan and Iraq, for example, recently joined the board of Outback Steakhouse Inc.
 For General Shelton, corporate life began on the day in late 2001 when August A. Busch III, chairman of Anheuser-Busch, flew in a corporate jet with his son, August A. Busch IV, to the airport in Manassas, Va., to meet with General Shelton and offer him a board seat.
 Last year, Anheuser-Busch paid General Shelton $181,518, according to government filings reviewed by the Corporate Library, a corporate governance research group. (He also has options on 10,001 Anheuser-Busch shares and is a member of the company's nominating and corporate governance committees.)
 The general said he felt comfortable with Anheuser-Busch because its support of the military gave him ''good vibrations.'' For the company, whose Budweiser beer is sold on military bases around the world, it doesn't hurt to have a four-star on board.
 And General Shelton has been more than willing to lend a helping hand -- for instance, advising the company about whom to call to cut red tape and to get thousands of bottles of water and nonalcoholic beer to troops in Iraq, or helping the company navigate the Pentagon as the company planned pro-military events associated with the Super Bowl.
 ''I only go with companies where I feel that I have shared values with the leader of the organization,'' he said.
 As a consultant to Northrop Grumman and Cisco Systems, General Shelton said he meets with executives two or three times a year to review business proposals before they are sent to the Pentagon and to ''see if they pass the common-sense test.'' He said, for instance, that he might suggest that Cisco redesign products to make them smaller or more rugged, and thus more marketable to the Pentagon, a customer Cisco is pursuing.
 He is particularly active at the Anteon International Corporation. The company, based in Fairfax, Va., is one of the largest suppliers of information technology to the government, which accounts for about 80 percent of its $1.5 billion in sales. Anteon helped build NATO's intelligence-gathering operations and helped operate computer systems in the Afghan war.
 GENERAL SHELTON is just one of many former Pentagon officials at Anteon, as employees or directors. Along with two fellow board members -- William J. Perry, the former defense secretary, and Paul G. Kaminski, a former Pentagon acquisitions official -- he serves on an Anteon strategy committee that helps guide the company to government business. He is paid annual board fees of $46,000 and has received options on 15,000 Anteon shares, but owns no stock now, according to government filings.
 ''Perry, myself and Kaminski, we look at the capability of Anteon and what appears to be developing on the horizon and where Anteon should be playing a role,'' General Shelton said. ''We then help them develop a strategy for approaching various components of the Pentagon.''
 In that mission, they are aided by the fact that Mr. Kaminski is also a member of the Pentagon's Defense Science Board, an advisory committee. That position gives him a bird's-eye view of future Pentagon needs.
 ''We don't ask that these military celebrities run around knocking on doors,'' said Joseph M. Kampf, the company's chief executive. ''We discuss our marketing plans with the strategy committee and we look to them for guidance. General Shelton brings a unique military perspective. He was the customer, so he knows how the customer thinks.''
 General Shelton, too, makes a distinction between his activities and ''door knocking.''
 ''It did not appeal to me to be pushing product,'' he said. ''I do no lobbying of Congress to buy our stuff versus the stuff of others. And I want to avoid being put into that position.
 He added: ''I want to pass on my experience, not sell a tank or an airplane.''

HEADLINE: Living With Social Security: Small Dreams and Safety Nets

BYLINE: By JOHN LELAND and JODI WILGOREN

DATELINE: GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. 

 BODY:
Barbara Amberg used her Social Security checks to fly to New York and see Christo's ''Gates'' in Central Park. Shirley Malone lives on hers in subsidized public housing, sometimes washing her clothes in dish detergent to save money. 
 For Joseph Cohen, a businessman who lost his business, Social Security is the safety net he never thought he would need. ''We're talking about a fortunate guy who had assets to put away,'' Mr. Cohen said. ''But without Social Security I would be in bad shape.''
 As Congressional Republicans struggle to break a partisan impasse over President Bush's plan to reinvent Social Security and shore up its finances, 32 million older Americans are living the realities of the nation's biggest social program. 
 Any changes will not affect people like Mrs. Amberg, Ms. Malone or Mr. Cohen, who are already collecting their benefits. But in the details of their daily lives, set out in in-depth interviews, these Grand Rapids residents afford a nuanced working model of Social Security -- the bumps it cushions and those it does not, the dreams it fosters or leaves out of reach. For many, it is the bedrock of their existence. 
 Americans appear to overestimate how much money they will be able to put aside for retirement. A New York Times/CBS News Poll found that only 20 percent of Americans who are not yet retired expect Social Security to be their major source of income when they stop working. But 39 percent of retirees in the same survey said that Social Security was their major source of income.
 Nearly all Americans over 65 collect benefits. The Social Security Administration says that about a third depend on Social Security for more than 90 percent of their income; another third get half to 90 percent of their money from the program; and a third rely on it for less than half. About 13 million would fall below the poverty line without Social Security unless they found other sources. 
 Each of these situations plays out in Grand Rapids, a riverfront city of 197,000, where mansions built by the city's Dutch industrial elite gaze across town at concrete grids of public housing. 
 In different neighborhoods, Social Security is an antipoverty program, a middle-class pension, a widow's survivor benefit, a disability check. For some, retirement has brought trophy homes and donations to charity; for others, bathroom sinks mended with adhesive tape and prescriptions unfilled for lack of money. 
 Two brothers, the Wards, capture the range in benefits. Norman, a former heroin addict who shuffled among low-paying jobs, gets $502 a month, while Luther and his wife, who had steady careers at the local school district, collect a combined $2,400. 
 Reeling from layoffs and plant closings and with a strong evangelical Christian strain, Grand Rapids is tossup political territory, and opinions are varied about Mr. Bush's efforts to give Americans more say in how some of their Social Security payments are invested -- with the possibility of higher rewards and higher risk.
 Some people, like Bill Post, who helped invent the Pop-Tart and saved dutifully, support Mr. Bush's proposals to create individual investment accounts within Social Security. ''That's not a big risk,'' Mr. Post said, ''that's a good opportunity.''
 But others, like James Townsend, who worked as a forklift operator, defend the traditional program. ''If they hadn't had Social Security, I wouldn't have saved that money,'' he said. ''If I'd had extra money, I'd have spent it. I wouldn't have anything at all.'' 
 Here as elsewhere, Social Security has paid back some more generously than others. Created to protect the most vulnerable, it redistributes money from rich people to poor people, and from men to women, who often have no pension or assets. 
 But as family structures have evolved from the one-earner nuclear model of the 1930's, the program has not always kept up. It rewards married couples more than single people, and couples with one stay-at-home spouse more than those in which both spouses worked. 
 Groups with shorter life expectancies, like African-Americans, receive fewer benefits than those who live longer. Economists describe retirement as a three-legged stool supported by savings, pension and Social Security. But as companies have moved away from traditional pensions, and more Americans approach retirement with inadequate savings, many, like Mr. Townsend, are adding a fourth leg: work. 
 Just four decades ago, 3 in 10 Americans over age 65 lived in poverty; after changes in Social Security benefits, that figure is now less than 1 in 10, below the poverty rate for the general population. The Urban Institute, a policy research group, recently found that working couples earning average incomes, if they retired today, would have benefits worth the equivalent of $439,000 in a 401(k) plan, more than double what they would have had in 1960, accounting for inflation.
 But retirees here do not measure their benefits by such calculations. Social Security is a car payment, cable television, a tithe, the freedom to volunteer in town, the dignity of a first-ever savings account.

Budgeting Down to the Penny
 Nearly a third of Americans collecting Social Security benefits are single women. Many, like Shirley Malone, who is divorced and lives in subsidized housing behind a shopping center here, would fall into poverty without them. 
 A thickset woman who moves painfully from a car accident two decades ago, Ms. Malone, 69, gets $700 a month from Social Security and a $212 stipend from a volunteer program for low-income seniors helping out in the schools. She has no savings. 
 ''When I was young, I heard all these stories about the golden years,'' she said. ''What happened to them?'' 
 Each month Ms. Malone gathers her bills before the Social Security check comes. She pays $40 a month for car insurance, more than $100 for prescription drugs, $52 for basic cable television, $122 for supplemental health insurance, plus her rent, which is set at 30 percent of her income.
 When she is finished writing checks, she said, there is no money left. She has had to put off dental work and getting hearing aids because she cannot afford them.
 ''I'm contemplating every month getting rid of my cable, but what else do I have?'' she said. ''There's no such thing as splurging. I even don't give my grandchildren presents.''
 None of this was planned.
 ''My head was younger than the rest of me,'' she said. ''I always thought I'd be able to work.''
 Ms. Malone married before she turned 18 and did not work until her children were teenagers. When her marriage ended, she said, she came away with nothing but the children. She had a high school education and no work experience. She took a job as a cashier at a car wash, on her feet sometimes for 10 hours at a time. When she retired at 62, after 11 years, she felt lost. 
 ''The worst part was that I wasn't busy enough,'' she said. ''All the sudden, here I am all alone. My grandkids were all grown up; they didn't need me anymore.'' 
 She added, ''I never thought I'd feel completely worthless.''
 Though she still has ''blue'' days, working with children has made her feel useful.
 Social Security has been a bureaucratic maze as well as a lifeline for Ms. Malone. For years she did not realize that she could collect before turning 65, or that she could collect on her former husband's benefits.
 She deals with a variety of health problems, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and recurring pain throughout her body, for which she can tolerate only Tylenol, which gives her no relief. Osteoporosis, she said, is shrinking her to nothing.
 Still, she is happier now than she has been since her children were young. The income from Social Security and the volunteer stipend are secure, if small. She feels she has earned the benefit.
 ''We're not getting anything we didn't work for all our lives,'' she said. ''There's a lot of us like this.'' 
 But mainly, it is the children of Knapp Charter Academy, the ones who call her Grandma Shirley, that fill her life. At her hallway desk, she smiled as she dispensed stickers or helped a student with her reading exercises.
 ''I didn't have a lot of money to start with, so I don't feel I came down,'' Ms. Malone said.
 At the school, she wore a bulky sweatshirt promoting the volunteer program. She has resisted entreaties from her son to live with him. 
 ''The check is a lifesaver,'' she said of the stipend that allows her to live independently. But if the program lost financing and could not pay her, she said, she would work in the school anyway. ''They're my therapy,'' she said. ''There's nothing like feeling useful.''

A Full Schedule, in Comfort
 Barbara Amberg, who was born into privilege and married pedigree, represents the other edge of Social Security. Like 1 in 10 of the program's recipients, she relies on it for less than a fifth of her income, which is $50,000 to $100,000 a year.
 Hers is a retirement of comfort and choices without concern for costs, shown in scrapbooks that brim with the photographs and memorabilia of a busy traveler.
 There is her annual summer pilgrimage to the Stratford Shakespeare Festival in Canada, and yearly visits to her children in San Antonio, Pennsylvania and Los Angeles. Group trips to art museums in Chicago and Detroit. A four-day, $1,850 package tour to see ''The Gates'' in February.
 All courtesy of Social Security.
 ''It pays for extras,'' Mrs. Amberg, a widow who just turned 80, said of the $924 monthly check. ''Mostly I use it for trips.''
 If Mrs. Amberg does not exactly need Social Security, Social Security has always needed people like her. The original architects of the Depression-era program enlisted the crucial backing of the better-off by selling it as a broad-based insurance program rather than a poor people's stipend.
 Indeed, when asked about shrinking benefits to richer recipients to preserve payments to the poor, Mrs. Amberg was ambivalent, saying, ''Somehow I have that feeling you have put in your amount, you should get back what you are owed.'' 
 She is open to the idea of raising the $90,000 cap on income subject to payroll taxes, or the age of eligibility. But despite her own windfall from booming stocks like Wal-Mart and Eli Lilly, she remains skeptical of Mr. Bush's desire to divert some of Social Security to individual accounts. 
 ''I know it has to be tinkered with, I just don't think you should change the concept,'' she said. ''Who knows if they can get any extra money out of the market? I just think that's such a foolish idea.''
 Mrs. Amberg, who had a $7-an-hour part-time job at the Pooh's Corner children's bookstore for 15 years, has always used dividends from her family trust funds to pay for routine expenses, like a weekly $20 blow-dry at the beauty shop and $45 monthly dues at the health club.
 While she does not spend extravagantly -- ''I sort of have it in my head that I'm not going to buy a $500 dress'' -- neither does she worry about the price of her season tickets to Grand Rapids' symphony, opera and two major theaters. She owns a spacious condominium here and a four-bedroom cottage on Lake Michigan. She has given nearly half a million dollars in pretax bequests to her four grandchildren since 1991, and signs over at least $5,000 in stock each year to a church. 
 And she maintains her $342-a-month membership in the Kent Country Club, where she and her daughter had wedding receptions, though three hip replacements have halted her golf game. ''I think I would feel lost without that,'' she said. 
 Mrs. Amberg and her late husband, David, a lawyer, both descended from old Grand Rapids families whose homes are among the jewels of the Heritage Hill historic district, an enclave built between 1848 and 1920 by the city's lumber barons and furniture moguls. Their nest egg was layered by inheritance, which also sent their children to Princeton, Tufts and Boston University. They never felt pressure to save.
 Hair coiffed, lipstick fresh, ears adorned with gold, Mrs. Amberg is a genteel visage sipping chardonnay before dinner one weeknight at the Victorian mansion of the Women's City Club, where her mother and grandmother were members before her. 
 She grew up on a family compound -- ''like the Kennedys'' -- with an Italianate building at its center housing a squash court and a 50-foot lap pool. Her late husband's family helped settle Grand Rapids in 1834.
 Mrs. Amberg's days overflow with activity: two book groups, three bridge foursomes, lectures, reading on a radio station for the blind, serving as treasurer of the local Smith College alumnae club. One week in April, she was out every night.
 ''I think you have to work at it when you're a woman alone,'' she said. ''You just don't expect people to call you or to make up things to do, you have to make things happen.'' Several widows are among her closest friends, but Mrs. Amberg is careful to keep up with couples. ''So if you want to entertain, you can still find a few men to come to your party,'' she said. ''But if you have a cocktail party, they're the ones who can't stand up. The men have to sit down.''
 Not Mrs. Amberg. She is at the gym every Wednesday morning for senior aerobics, strutting to a Sinatra soundtrack, though she ducks out when stretching starts. ''I can't get down on the floor and then get back up again, so I leave,'' she said.
 If she goes a little slower these days, she still goes. In May, she visited Fallingwater, Frank Lloyd Wright's masterpiece in western Pennsylvania. To celebrate her 80th birthday, her family joined her for a weekend in New York.
 There are Social Security checks to spend, scrapbooks yet to fill.

Back on the Job at 74
 Between Social Security and a small pension, James Townsend thought he had enough to retire. 
 But 10 years after he began collecting his checks, he greeted a recent sunny spring afternoon with a familiar ritual: he put on his uniform and went to work. From 4 p.m. to midnight eight nights a month, Mr. Townsend, 74, works as a security guard at a retirement community at the edge of town. 
 As he made his rounds that evening, Mr. Townsend poked behind the furnace and paced a solitary, hourlong circuit of the carpeted hallways, empty except for a woman leaving the exercise area. ''I've been lucky, I've never seen any strange people,'' he said. 
 Mr. Townsend had not expected to be working at this age. When he retired at 64 from his job as a forklift operator in an auto parts plant, he believed he could live on his pension of about $200 a month and his and his wife's Social Security checks, which added up to almost $1,100. 
 The Townsends' home here, a neat ranch house in a neighborhood that he calls ''the inner city, but not the ghetto,'' was paid off, and Mr. Townsend thought he could cut back on a few activities or entertainment. ''I just wanted to stop working in a factory, waking up every morning at the crack of dawn,'' he said. ''I had put in a lot of hard time at the factory. It was a relief to stop working.''
 But for the Townsends, two small changes were enough to upset his plans. 
 Mr. Townsend's old car gave out, and he bought a new 1999 Dodge Intrepid, with payments of $327.55 a month. At the same time, his doctor found he had high levels of cholesterol. Medication ran to $99 a month.
 ''That's when things really tightened on me,'' he said. ''I had to cut back on everything, even my tithes and offerings at church.''
 So Mr. Townsend went looking for a job again. Almost five million Americans over age 65 worked last year, up from fewer than three million two decades ago. The rise counters a half-century trend toward earlier retirement. In 1950, nearly half of men over 65 were still working. By 2000, only 17 percent were.
 Some retirees miss the purposefulness of work; some need the money. Mr. Townsend straddled both categories. He could use the money, but he also had no hobbies to occupy his time; work, he said, has kept him active. 
 A native of Carbondale, Ill., Mr. Townsend moved to Grand Rapids to work in the factories here, and his finances have followed the unsteady rhythms of production: good in boom years, fragile when the demand for auto parts or office furniture slowed. In his first seven years here, he was laid off for part of every year. 
 His house, where he has lived for 40 years, sits on a block of weathered homes in a largely African-American section southeast of downtown. When he goes out at night, it is to a sports bar in a mixed neighborhood to the north. ''But my preacher don't know it,'' he said. 
 When his car payments put the crunch on him, he called his network of friends, who told him about a part-time opening at the retirement community. The added income of about $340 every two weeks covered his car payments and cholesterol medicine. 
 With his part-time job and his pension, the Townsends earn more than $2,000 a month, about as much as they did before his retirement, and without the threat of having all their income wiped out by layoff or strike. Social Security, which supplies the biggest share of their income, provides both stability and freedom. 
 ''I enjoy the way I work now,'' he said. ''I work 4 days and then I'm off for 10. What kind of job is that? It's not like the other work I did. I hustled when I was in the factory.'' 
 With his job, he said, he has enough money to take his wife to dinner. He is looking into supplemental health insurance, which would cost $200 or more a month to protect him against medical catastrophe. 
 He hopes that Social Security will continue as is. He doubts he could have done as well on his own managing for retirement. ''I feel it's scare tactics now,'' he added. ''If the government would stop using that money for other things like this war, the thing would go on and on and on.''

From the Pop-Tart, a Good Life
 With a $75,000 pension, Social Security, ample savings and a series of real estate investments, Bill Post could be the model for retirement planning in the pre-401(k) era. 
 A son of immigrants from the Netherlands whom poor people called poor, Mr. Post went to work at the local Keebler plant on his 16th birthday, putting pans in ovens for 38 cents an hour, and left the company 41 years later as a senior vice president with a $92,000 salary. He then embarked on a second career as a $30,000-a-year consultant for Kellogg, the company for which he had helped develop the Pop-Tart.
 Now, he carves wooden Santa Claus statues in a basement workshop under an old sign that says ''Nooitgedacht'' -- Dutch for, as Mr. Post put it, ''Never woulda thought.'' 
 He never would have thought a cranberry Jaguar convertible would sit in his garage. Hardly could have imagined retiring at 57 to a custom-built dream home, never mind selling it later for $1.1 million. ''I would never have ever thought that we would have such a good life,'' Mr. Post, 77, said. 
 He also never considered depending on Social Security. 
 He and his wife of 57 years, Florence, avoided debt by spending frugally with the future in mind. When his company provided executives with a financial consultant as a perk, Mr. Post recalled, ''he came back and said, 'I never met a guy like you: you're living within your income.'''
 The Posts are among 7.5 million of today's retirees, 29 percent, who collect private pensions, a middle-class staple that is fast disappearing. They also have income from bonds and interest payments on two private loans, but the only stocks they own are Kellogg shares he received as bonuses.
 ''No gambling,'' Mr. Post explained. ''I can't see the principal shrink; worked too hard for our money.''
 It is people like Mr. Post who in future generations, under Mr. Bush's proposals, could see their guaranteed benefits become much less generous than currently promised. ''I would be for less benefits,'' Mr. Post said, if that would promote the health of the program. Likewise, he supports Mr. Bush's vision of individual accounts, saying, ''I know there are better investments than what's happening.''
 Mr. Post, who dropped out of college to become personnel manager of Keebler's bakery in Grand Rapids at 21, was running the plant in 1963 when Kellogg came looking for a partner to develop a toaster pastry. He quickly green-lighted the idea despite the challenge of hoisting a huge piece of machinery to create the top layer and adapting an air clutch to squirt dollops of filling.
 ''I was just the guy who said we'd do it,'' said Mr. Post, who still stocks his pantry with his favorite flavor, frosted strawberry. 
 As he climbed the ladder from cookie baker to corporate officer, Mr. Post's biggest boon was real estate.
 In 1971, the Posts bought a 100-foot parcel on Glen Lake in northern Michigan for $16,000, building an A-frame bungalow for weekend getaways. They traded up twice to bigger lake properties, and after 18 years in their dream house, sold it to buy a 5,000-square foot, $415,000 home in a Grand Rapids suburb Mr. Post grew up thinking of as ''where the big shots lived.''
 It is at once an homage to their affluence and their humble roots. They added a large master suite and furnished it with an antique wooden night table, bed and dresser they bought years ago for $10. Mrs. Post weaves patchwork rugs out of remnants; the couple eats off dinnerware with a French pattern by Quimper Faience that dates from 1690 and sells for $95 a plate.
 ''What's enough?'' Mr. Post asked one afternoon relaxing on the expansive deck. ''You know what enough is? A little more than you got.''
 Rather than revel in their bounty, though, the Posts, who read Scripture aloud after breakfast, glory in giving their money away: $1,400 a month to Thornapple Covenant Church (plus an extra $1,000 on Thanksgiving and Easter); $2,500 a year to Gideon's, the Bible distributors; a recent $5,000 to a school for disabled adults; $2,000 here and $2,000 there for missionaries to Thailand or India. ''He's opened up the floodgates for us,'' Mr. Post said, referring to God's New Testament promise to reward those who tithe. ''We give, and he opens up floodgates, and we give more.''
 Without a calculator, Mrs. Post balances their three checkbooks -- one for their $2,000-a-month Social Security checks, which includes her spousal benefits; the others for the pension and interest. One afternoon, she spent hours stuck on a $2,000 mistake in her favor.
 The next morning, a fund-raiser for an evangelical broadcaster came to pitch the Posts for contributions of as much as $10,000.
 Mr. Post chuckled at the numbers, noting, ''I was a cookie baker all my life.'' He and his wife had agreed the night before to give $500, and upped it before breakfast to $1,000. When Mrs. Post pulled out the checkbook, though, she whispered, ''How about two?'' and that is what she wrote.
 ''The mistake I had made,'' she explained later. ''I just felt that was the Lord telling me, you have extra money in here, you should give it.''

A Significant Savings Depleted
 Joseph Cohen, 89, was a millionaire once, with a stake in a family clothing business and the intention of working forever. When the company collapsed in 1980, Mr. Cohen, then 64, had a few outside investments, a house and an asset he never expected to need: Social Security. 
 On a crisp Michigan morning, Mr. Cohen was having coffee and doughnuts with other retirees in the apartment complex where he now lives alone, near a cordon of strip malls and big-box retailers by the airport. He has a crown of white hair, a metallic Chicago accent and a manner that is both genial and cranky. When he had his business, he said, he never thought about Social Security or retirement. ''I assumed we'd be taking a month off and going to Florida. We used to do that.'' 
 Mr. Cohen belongs to the uncounted but substantial population of Americans who reach retirement age with less money than they planned, reliant on Social Security in ways they do not expect.
 ''People who end up with less assets than they thought -- that's almost all of us,'' said Alicia H. Munnell, director of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, who served in the Treasury Department during the Clinton administration.
 ''People have business reversals, or they lose money in the stock market, or they have medical expenses they can't afford. Anyone who ever worked for Enron or WorldCom knows how it feels to look in their retirement account and see there's nothing left.''
 Mr. Cohen now lives mostly on the $1,800 he receives each month from Social Security, plus income from bonds he bought after he sold his house -- about $1,000 to $1,200 a month. He does not own stock, a home or life insurance.
 Compared with most retirees, Mr. Cohen is doing well. He flies first class to see his children in New Jersey and Seattle, still has valuable art in his living room and has contributed money toward his grandchildren's education. Because he did not have to work, he volunteered extensively in his synagogue, the public schools and the local civil rights movement. By his lights he did not retire until last year, when a small stroke forced him to stop volunteering. 
 But last year, when one of Mr. Cohen's bonds matured, and he replaced it with one that pays dividends of about $100 less a month, he felt the loss. ''I got clobbered,'' he said. ''It doesn't sound like much, but it means you have $25 a week less to spend.''
 Mr. Cohen opposes individual investment accounts, because of the volatility of the stock market and the cost of managing the accounts.
 ''We're living in a society with an age group that haven't been through the Depression and aren't cognizant of what can happen,'' he said. ''How do you know that won't happen tomorrow? I often wonder what happened to all the people who used to work for me.''
 Mr. Cohen said he had spent a lot of his retirement savings on care for his wife, who died in 1993, and son Robert, who died of an inoperable brain lesion in 2001. His wife went from doctor to doctor -- ''all stupid S.O.B.'s,'' Mr. Cohen said -- before amyloidosis, a plasma cell disorder, was diagnosed. She died after three years of treatment at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. 
 Insurance paid for some of this care but not all. ''I've never gone back and seen how much it cost at Mayo's,'' he said. ''Word of honor, you never go over expenses and think about whether to get this treatment or this. You just do it.''
 Lately his own health has been giving him problems. In April, while spending Passover with his daughter in New Jersey, he underwent an M.R.I. for pain in his back, and a ruptured disk was diagnosed. He has not been back to Grand Rapids.
 Mr. Cohen can remember when he was like many young workers now, who do not think Social Security will be around when they retire. When the program was enacted, the same year he finished high school, he put little faith in it. 
 ''It was introduced without a lot of people knowing what it was going to do,'' he said. ''If someone had said, 'Here's this program that's going to take care of you,' I'd say, 'Yeah, wait and see.''' 
 Now it is the anchor of a retirement that Mr. Cohen has come to accept. ''It's not as much as I'd like to have,'' he said, ''but I'm not worried.''

Brothers, Side by Side Again
 Social Security was never intended as a family reunification initiative, but Luther and Norman Ward show how far its safety net can stretch. 
 For years, Luther, a school janitor and truant officer, hardly spoke to his brother Norman, a heroin addict, because ''when he came to see me it was with a hand out.'' Now they sit side by side every Sunday in church.
 The Social Security check that lets Norman, for the first time in his life, keep a small savings account, also allows Luther to offer hand-me-down furniture and the occasional covered dish without worry that his brother's needs will overwhelm his own. 
 Just as Social Security frees baby boomers from the financial -- and emotional -- burden of dependent parents, it has built a bridge between these formerly estranged brothers, who passed a recent afternoon feeding ducks at the Grand River like boys.
 ''I save every month; I refuse to get broke," Norman, 77, said. "I love my brother and I wouldn't want to hurt him.'' 
 The Wards, two of six sons of a steelworker and a laundress, embody Social Security's dual identity, as a return on an investment for people like Luther, 71, who play by the rules, and as an insurance policy that keeps even those who led largely unproductive lives from suffering on the street. 
 For Luther and his wife, Diane, a retired teacher, Social Security is one component of a relaxed retirement -- their monthly checks totaling about $2,400 provide 36 percent of their income, the rest coming from their solid school district pensions. Without it, Luther said, ''I'd probably have a part-time job.''
 For Norman, who gets $502 plus $96 in state and federal supplements for the poorest recipients, Social Security is a savior -- his only other income is the occasional bounty when one of his six numbers hits in the Michigan Daily Pick Three. Without it, Norman said, ''I'd probably be dead now.''
 Luther did decades of double duty as a janitor and truant officer, raising five children over two marriages.
 He took the second school district job to cover child support for the four children from his first marriage, and ended up with combined wages of $60,000. After selling off his mutual funds a few years ago, he keeps his savings, about $14,000, in the credit union earning 2 percent, and strongly opposes Mr. Bush's proposal to turn part of Social Security into individual accounts.
 ''At my age, I'm not thinking about 10 years it coming back,'' he said of the stock market.
 Norman, who never made it past 10th grade, got hooked on heroin while in the Army. Back home, slurping cough syrup when he could not afford heroin, he got and lost jobs at General Motors, Steelcase, a forklift factory, a meat warehouse and, his favorite, as a bellhop at the old Rowe Hotel downtown, for $12 a week plus tips. He did time twice, in 1961 and 1991, after pleading guilty to drug possession, and checked himself into rehab half a dozen times.
 He cared for his parents in their final years and inherited their house, but the $56,000 it sold for quickly disappeared into drugs.
 ''When I blew that money, I got scared,'' Norman recalled. ''I used to take the cover and pull it over my head because I hate to see daylight come.''
 Nowadays, in his one-bedroom at the Ransom Towers downtown, Norman is showered and with his bed made by 7 a.m., though he spends most days watching hours of back-to-back courtroom reality shows from a raggedy lounge chair. 
 He pays his $170 rent, $45 cable, $25 telephone, $20 church dues and $13 for air-conditioning in summer weeks in advance. Food stamps, $112 a month, fill his cupboards with canned vegetables and Special K. The nine pills he swallows daily for diabetes and high blood pressure cost him $3 for brand names, $1 for generics, under Medicaid. Magic Shaving Powder, $1.25 a can, keeps his head bald.
 Still he has enough extra that at times he is like an A.T.M., handing out two $20's and a $10 to various neighbors one Sunday before leaving for church. ''I don't want your reason, I just want it back,'' he said of his no-interest, no-information approach. ''If they ask for it, they need it.''
 Across town, Luther said he and Diane ''never take out a loan we can't pay back in a year's time,'' so they are setting aside $1,000 a month to cover the $11,000 home equity line of credit that pays for remodeling the kitchen this summer. They travel every other year to see her relatives in the Netherlands or his son, an Air Force officer stationed in Belgium, and the basement is lined with posters from the musicals they frequent here and in Toronto. For Luther's 70th birthday, Diane booked a suite at the Bellagio in Las Vegas.
 Seven or eight years ago, Norman asked Luther to pick him up on the way to Grace Christian Reformed Church. He called for a ride again the next Saturday. ''Then he said, 'I don't want to call you anymore, just pick me up every Sunday,''' recalled Luther, who is a deacon. ''He already knew the minister because he had borrowed money from the minister.'' 
 On Tuesdays, too, Luther swings by Norman's building for their weekly run to a food warehouse to stock the church pantry. 
 ''First time in my life I ever enjoyed it,'' Norman said as he piled up potatoes and set aside a box of chocolate cookies for himself, never mind the diabetes. ''Doing something and not looking for nothing.''

HEADLINE: A Free Woman

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF. 
E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com

 BODY:
After the Pakistani government tired of kidnapping Mukhtaran Bibi, holding her hostage and lying about it, I finally got a call through to her.
 Pakistani officials had just freed Ms. Mukhtaran and returned her to her village. She was exhausted, scared, relieved, giddy and sometimes giggly -- and also deeply thankful to all the Pakistanis and Americans who spoke up for her. 
 ''I'm so thankful to everyone that they keep a woman like me in mind,'' she said fervently. Told that lots of people around the world think she's a hero, she laughed and responded: ''God is great. If some people think I'm a hero, it's only because of all those people who give me support.''
 President Pervez Musharraf's government is still lying about Ms. Mukhtaran, saying that she is now free to travel to the U.S. Well, it's true that government officials removed her name from the blacklist of those barred from leaving Pakistan, but at the same time they confiscated Ms. Mukhtaran's passport.
 Let me back up. Ms. Mukhtaran is the indomitable peasant whom I first wrote about in September after visiting her in her village. Three years ago, a village council was upset at her brother, and sentenced her to be gang-raped. After four men raped her, she was forced to walk home nearly naked before a jeering crowd. 
 She then defied tradition by testifying against her attackers, sending them to prison, and she used compensation money to start elementary schools in her village. She herself is now enrolled in the fourth grade; a measure of her passion for education is that the day after the government released her, she was back in class. 
 Ms. Mukhtaran is using donations (through www.mercycorps.org) to start an ambulance service and a women's shelter, and she is also campaigning against honor killings, rapes and acid attacks that disfigure women. But President Musharraf, defensive about Pakistan's image, regards brutality as something to cover up rather than uproot.
 So when Pakistani officials learned that Ms. Mukhtaran planned to visit the U.S. this month, they detained her and apparently tried to intimidate her by ordering the release of those convicted for her rape. This wasn't a mistake by low-level officials. 
 Mr. Musharraf admitted to reporters on Friday that he had ordered Ms. Mukhtaran placed on the blacklist. And although Pakistan had claimed that Ms. Mukhtaran had decided on her own not to go to the U.S. because her mother was sick (actually, she wasn't), the president in effect acknowledged that that was one more lie. ''She was told not to go'' to the U.S., Mr. Musharraf said, according to The Associated Press. 
 ''I don't want to project a bad image of Pakistan.'' he explained.
 I sympathize. From Karachi to the Khyber Pass, Pakistan is one of the most hospitable countries I've ever visited. So, President Musharraf, if you want to improve Pakistan's image, here's some advice: just prosecute rapists with the same zeal with which you persecute rape victims.
 Ms. Mukhtaran says she can't talk about what happened after the government kidnapped her. But this is what seems to have unfolded: In Islamabad, government officials ferociously berated her for being unpatriotic and warned that they could punish her family and friends. In particular, they threatened to have the father of a friend fired from his job.
 Fittingly, the government is facing its own pressures. Government officials have denounced Pakistani aid groups for helping Ms. Mukhtaran, and Mr. Musharraf added that they were ''as bad as the Islamic extremists.'' So now the aid groups are threatening to pull out of their partnership with the government. 
 Mr. Musharraf has helped in the war on terrorism and has managed Pakistan's economy well. But in my last column, I reluctantly concluded that he is ''nuts,'' prompting a debate in Pakistan about whether this diagnosis was insolent or accurate. After Mr. Musharraf's latest remarks, I rest my case. 
 On Friday, Ms. Mukhtaran told me that one of the prime minister's aides had just called to offer to take her to the United States. It seems Mr. Musharraf wants to defuse the crisis by allowing Ms. Mukhtaran a tightly chaperoned tour of the U.S., controlled every step of her way.
 ''I said, 'No,''' she said. ''I only want to go of my own free will.''
 Hats off to this incredible woman. President Musharraf may have ousted rivals and overthrown a civilian government, but he has now met his match -- a peasant woman with a heart of gold and a will of steel.

HEADLINE: A Timely Departure

 BODY:
It took five African presidents to get President Bush to finally face up to the dismal performance of his flagship program to promote development in poor countries. Within days, the White House reported the resignation of Paul Applegarth, the chief executive of the Millennium Challenge Corporation, who, with an entire world of poverty, disease and wretchedness to consider, managed to find only two countries worthy of aid. His office says his departure had ''absolutely'' nothing to do with the complaints lodged last week by the presidents of Botswana, Ghana, Mozambique, Niger and Namibia, who told Mr. Bush that the bureaucracy and fine print of the program made it nearly impossible for them to get aid. We're just glad Mr. Applegarth is going, and hope President Bush appoints a successor more interested in actually giving money to poor people.
 To see just how badly the Millennium Challenge program has performed, compare it to the Fast Track Initiative for financing education, which is run out of the World Bank. Both programs came partly as a result of the Millennium Development Goals of the United Nations, which commit all member countries to meet a set of quantifiable targets for combating poverty, hunger, disease, illiteracy, environmental degradation and discrimination against women by 2015. Both programs use the same basic model: rewarding poor countries that demonstrate a willingness to reform with big increases in aid. Both programs were announced in 2002. 
 Since then, the Millennium Challenge program has signed contracts to give money to only two countries: $108 million to Madagascar and $215 million to Honduras. The program's board recently approved two more, Nicaragua and Cape Verde. Through the Fast Track program, rich countries have actually given money to 12 countries. During the first three years, donors shifted about $905 million in foreign aid to the qualifying countries for primary education; this year the 12 countries will get an additional $350 million. 
 No sane person expects the rich countries to assume the entire burden for eradicating poverty, although this is the first generation with the wherewithal to do so. But poor countries are at a crossroads, particularly in Africa. Tired of corrupt governments and self-defeating civil wars, which have depleted resources even as they laid waste to entire ethnic populations, Africans have been standing up to say ''enough.'' Even by the strict standards adopted by President Bush's Millennium Challenge program, which requires that governments meet all sorts of anticorruption, pro-growth criteria to qualify, there are plenty of countries where a big infusion of measurable, quantifiable aid would be put to good use. The issue will reach a critical point next month in Scotland, where Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain plans to push the Group of 8 industrialized nations to commit an additional $25 billion for Africa. President Bush has yet to endorse Mr. Blair's proposal.
 This is a good time to make a fresh start, and demonstrate to the world that America can still be a moral leader. The next head of the Millennium Challenge program should seize the role with gusto. That means taking Congress to task for not fully financing the program, something Mr. Applegarth could not do with any credibility since it was not as though he was actually handing out any money to poor countries anyway. It means lobbying hard within the administration for more money for development initiatives. 
 And finally, it's not necessary to reinvent the wheel. One reason the Fast Track Initiative got going quickly was that it did not waste years in assembling a staff of neophytes who narrowly defined strategies for growth to fit their ideological bent. The Millennium Challenge program granted $108 million to Madagascar for, of all things, land-titling, bank reform and agribusiness centers. Those are worthy endeavors, but this is a country where many villages do not have running water, clinics or schools. Bank reform is fine, but real growth cannot exclude the basics. Malnourished people are not going to make good businesspeople or farmers. And they are certainly not going to be asking for directions to the bank.

HEADLINE: The Clowning, Rump-Shaking, Wilding-Out Battle Dancers of South Central L.A.

BYLINE: By Guy Trebay. 
Guy Trebay is a reporter for The New York Times.

 BODY:
Slabs of bass beat split the air, seeming to warp the walls as the Rice Track Family started dancing at the Silverado Park Teen Center one Sunday in May. Outside, dusk was falling on a mellow evening in Long Beach, Calif., the sort of night when fluke winds swirl in from the desert and ruffle the fronds of the royal palms, rousing the rats from the crowns.
 The tune on the boom box was ''Piggy Bank,'' by 50 Cent. As Rod Soriano, whose dance name is Hot Rod, cranked up the volume, the other boys at the rec center started to pop their chests and sway. Abruptly, each in turn, they began to whip their arms around, hunching their shoulders, bending their bodies toward the sound and the violent lyrics, trancelike, as if some sort of battle was about to begin. 
 They shut their eyes then and let their heads nod. As the beats filled the room, the dancers started quivering and then caroming, at first delicately, then spasmodically, then picking up velocity in an alarming but strangely graceful way. They looked like rubber bands do when the tautened elastic is sprung. So submerged were the dancers in the dance that it was not clear how they managed to avoid crashing into the cinder-block walls or into the sharp-cornered foosball table or, for that matter, me. 
 The dancers took turns showing off their moves, first a teenager called Chris (Pokeey) Tanedo and then Marvin (Junior Pokeey) Salvador and then Raf (Young Pokeey) Ocampo and then Mark (Baby Pokeey) Irang and then Cliff (Little Pokeey) Sung and then Laurence (Solow) Gogit, the only member of the group whose nickname is not a play on the Tagalog word for ''scar.'' 
 The dance they were demonstrating is called krumping, equal parts break dance, pantomimed battle and demonic possession. As break dancing did 25 years ago in the South Bronx, krumping arose spontaneously some time in the last decade in neighborhoods in Long Beach and throughout South Central Los Angeles. And, just as break dancing was confined at its beginnings to a fragment of a New York borough then in ruins, krumping is still mostly unknown beyond the freeways that border these ragged areas of L.A.
 Over the past five years or so, though, a phenomenon that began with a handful of dancers has grown to include perhaps a thousand dancers and at least 80 independent crews, loosely organized and all part of a network connected informally but intricately by word of mouth. Most krump crews are black, but many are Asian, like the Rice Track Family, or white or Latino; they are allied less by race, as it happens, than by economics and their commitment to an unlikely form of art. 
 ''In this neighborhood, if you're not an athlete or a rapper or a gangbanger, you aren't going anywhere,'' Soriano, or Hot Rod Soriano, a young Filipino founder of the Rice Track Family, told me. ''Who knows if we weren't dancing if we wouldn't be gangbanging, too?'' 
 In Soriano's area, a section of Long Beach best known for the churning oil derricks so often employed as cinematic shorthand for L.A.'s underside, prospects are rarely bright for anyone, not athletes or rappers and certainly not any members of Long Beach's gangs. ''People from the outside don't see the violence here,'' Soriano said. ''But we live it every day.''
 From his spot in a corner of the recreation room, Gogit laughed quietly and said, ''Every 3 o'clock you see someone running down the street with a TV or a refrigerator, and that's just normal to us.''
 People, their parents mainly, Soriano said, think it's strange that the Rice Track Family members spend all their time dancing, practicing at the modest community center, located in a playground surrounded by plain frame houses just a short distance from the hum of the freeway. Crews like the Rice Track Family compete on an unofficial circuit with crews from all over South Central, meeting at parties, dance halls and clubs to do battle for the occasional trophy and sometimes cash but, most important, prestige. ''Some people say, 'Oh, you could be doing something positive,' but this is our positive,'' Soriano said. ''Some people, when they have problems, write in their diary.'' Krump dancing ''is our diary,'' he added. ''It's our everyday.''
 On the krump dance circuit there are cliques and crews and semiprofessional ''units'' that dance at parties for pay. There are legends, the way there always are in small underground scenes whose hierarchies are invisible to outsiders. It requires inside knowledge to assign rank and status to all the dancers, who go by names like Dragon or Tight Eyez or Miss Prissy or Lil C. Those same names may come to be recognized beyond the borders of Long Beach and South Central in the next few weeks, though, when a new feature-length documentary about krumping is released nationwide. ''Documentary'' may be too imprecise a term for ''Rize,'' a film that took the fashion photographer and music-video director David LaChapelle two and a half years to make and that evolved from a tantalizing short shown at Sundance in 2004.
 ''Rize'' falls under the rubric of what could be termed the Romance of the Permanent Underclass. According to the genre's unvarying conventions, characters must scale rope ladders of unlikely opportunity to escape their destinies. And this LaChapelle's dancers do -- out of a place where gangs and drugs and violence are not merely raw video wallpaper, artifacts of some Snoop Dogg cartoon. The film is dedicated to a dancer named Quinesha (Lil Dimples) Dunford, who was killed with a 13-year-old friend in a 2003 drive/by shooting, and not one of the dancers in it is without a story like Quinesha's to tell. 
 To a large extent, ''Rize'' does what Jennie Livingston did in ''Paris Is Burning,'' her 1990 documentary about the gay underground ball scene from which phenomena like vogueing first arose, and what the independent filmmaker Charlie Ahearn did when he documented the birth of hip-hop culture in the semifictional 1982 movie ''Wild Style.'' It trains its lens on an exceptional group of self-taught artists and lets their art speak for them. 
 The arcs of those earlier movies reached their apogees at tournaments of some sort; in LaChapelle's film, that climax comes at an annual krump dance showdown known as Battle Zone. Battle Zone has formalized what had been a wholly ad hoc movement, and it is at Battle Zone V, held in November 2003, that Tommy the Clown, or Thomas Johnson, the man credited with inventing the dance from which krumping evolved, can be seen in ''Rize'' going into ferocious dance combat alongside his crew. Under hot lights in the 18,000-seat Great Western Forum, Tommy the Clown and his posse take on a group of the finest krumpers in L.A. over the course of an evening-long series of showdowns. A krump session always involves one of these showdowns, in which two dancers meet inside a circle and take wild posturing runs at each other, mock attacks that are both martial and balletic. The music is loud, sampled from hip-hop and rap and mash tapes; the audience is made up of whoever in the neighborhood happens to have gotten word; the winners are signaled by ovations and screams.
 Like sessions in the St. Louis jazz clubs of the 1920's, or the 1980's break-dance competitions in the South Bronx, battle zones, both formal and impromptu, serve as laboratories for an evolving and distinctly American art form. 
 If the publicity surrounding the film can be believed, krumping will soon ''explode'' from the confines of South Central and spread like a kinetic virus across the country, or at least to the local cineplex. Considering the origins of break dancing and hip-hop, all incubated in landscapes no less benighted than those of South Central L.A., only a fool would take odds against the hype.
'Krumpers can say what they want -- Tommy the Clown invented clowning, and there wouldn't be krumping without me,'' Thomas Johnson told me one afternoon in a cinder-block office at a school on the outskirts of Compton. At that moment, Johnson was without his trademark Tommy the Clown rainbow Afro wig, but his face was whitened with greasepaint and talcum, and there were balloons drawn on his forehead and cheeks. 
 It was just after he was released from jail in the early 1990's that Johnson, a former self-described ''big time'' cocaine dealer, turned to evangelical Christianity and clown dancing more or less simultaneously. ''I needed to find some way to make money,'' he said. He came to a realization that ''even in the ghetto,'' folks have children's parties. ''And what is a ghetto party,'' he added, ''without a ghetto party clown?'' 
 Wearing baggy overalls, his Afro wig and oversize shoes, Tommy the Clown soon became a fixture at barbecues, block parties and birthday celebrations throughout South Central, doing mostly what every other party clown in the world does, twisting balloons into dachshund shapes and half-jollying, half-terrifying young kids. It was only after Johnson added some mild boogieing to his act that the career of Tommy the Clown began to take off. 
 The dance he favored in those days would be familiar to anyone who has ever watched a hip-hop video; smooth, mildly raunchy, occasionally rump-shaking, it was an amalgam of club dance styles and moves favored by women who earn their livings writhing around chrome poles on the tops of bars.
 Tommy first added those moves, termed stripper dancing, to his repertory and then some mild acrobatics and some stylized feminine posturings he swiped from Michael Jackson, who could have gotten it from the underground gay groups who invented the dance Madonna popularized in her video ''Vogue.'' In combination, Tommy's movements were goofy and antic and seemingly unique to him. By the late 1990's, he had a substantial local following and a crew of dance trainees among whom he divided his $250 party fee. 
 As his reputation grew, Tommy's face-painted style inspired competition, first at parties and then at impromptu gatherings of clown dancers, and soon as many as 30 other clown groups sprang up with names like House of Clowns, True Clowns, Worldwide Clowns, Just Clowning and No Comparison. 
 Like any of a thousand other urban dances, clowning might have lived its mayfly life and vanished unlamented had not a music-video director spotted some of Tommy's dancers and cast them for a Christina Aguilera production titled ''Dirty'' in 2002. The director was David LaChapelle. (Krump dancers also caught the eye of Missy Elliott, who used them in her 2004 video ''I'm Really Hot''; the Black Eyed Peas later hired krump dancers for their ''Hey Mama'' video.) 
 ''We were shooting, and some people on the set said: 'There's this dance that's going on in the 'hood. Would you like to see it?' '' LaChapelle explains. ''I went backstage, and there were two guys and a girl doing stripper dancing. There was so much more energy happening backstage than on the set that I couldn't wait for the shoot to end so I could find out more.''
 By the time LaChapelle happened on it, stripper dancing had morphed into clowning; in some quarters, clowning was being subjected to variations that changed by the day. ''You see so much at a krump gathering,'' Gogit says. ''You see a movement and add the idea to your own movement and watch a dance tape and take something from that.'' In ''Rize,'' Lil C, a brilliant dancer, gives some sense of the competitive ardor of dancers on the new scene when he says, ''If you don't dance for two days, we know it.'' New moves, attitudes and extreme forms of mime and posture are being invented on playgrounds and in clubs all the time.
 Among the dances that appeared to grow out of clowning was the whip, which originated at a South Central club called Soda Pop, and also an amiably drunken-looking dance called the wobble and another, unnamed clapping dance that looks much like the one Will Smith is trying to put across in the music video spun off from the film ''Hitch,'' his bid to score this summer's radio hit. 
 Most interesting by far was an athletic dance that came to be called wilding out, a bizarre appellation, considering its echoes of the 1989 Central Park jogger rape -- of which five New York youths were convicted (and later exonerated) -- which was reported to have begun in a spree of ''wilding.'' To wilding out was soon added the whip, in which dancers swung their arms crazily from side to side, becoming more focused, pugilistic and intense. 
 By the time the whip came along several years ago, most dancers on the clown scene had begun to leave behind Tommy's mild form of dancing, which they considered goofy and slow and uncomfortably close to minstrelsy. It was then that the radical movements that turned into krumping began: the staccato arm pumping, the chest thrusts, the mimed tussles that cannot fail to recall videos of the Los Angeles riots of 1992, one of the principal reasons LaChapelle termed the generation of krumpers ''the children of Rodney King.'' 
 All of these dancers owe something to Tommy the Clown, of course. But, in place of the sour pathos of a black man in white greasepaint capering about like Bozo, krumpers mime deep emotions. ''Clowning is like more of an entertainment,'' Gogit says. ''Krump is real emotion. It's like fight night.''
'In my neighborhood, there was always a lot of gangs and killings and banging,'' Ceasare Willis, known as Tight Eyez, was saying one afternoon at Exposition Park, outside the triumphal Art Deco stadium used during the 1984 Olympics. It was a strange spring day, windy and clear, the air scoured of its customary infusion of gardenia and gasoline fumes. Tight Eyez, 20, and his 18-year-old friend Christian Jones, known as Baby Tight Eyez, had suggested meeting here, where the parking lots and surrounding areas were spooky and vacant. 
 The two dancers had car trouble and arrived late for our meeting. An hour passed and then more before a beat-up white sedan pulled up and parked. Baby Tight Eyez exited from the driver's side; Tight Eyez climbed out the window of the broken passenger-side door. The two were dressed in outsize jeans and white T-shirts free of markings or logos, an anonymous protective uniform necessary in gang-controlled parts of Los Angeles. Tight Eyez explained, ''You don't want your life to end because you're wearing the wrong color.''
 Tight Eyez is a star of the underground krump circuit (and of LaChapelle's film), for reasons as simple as the elegant intensity of his dancing -- which he has been doing since his early teens, both solo and in the Remnant, his own crew -- and his harrowing biography. He was raised by a mother often high on crack and later by one of his grandmothers. He was shot in his early teens by a relative, the bullet ricocheting off a doorway and striking him in the arm. ''I still have the scar,'' he said, pulling up his sleeve to reveal a fat worm of keloid tissue crawling past his elbow. 
 ''That's just the way it is,'' Baby Tight Eyez said. ''For real.'' There is a disarming preteen squeak in Baby Tight Eyez's voice, and so it is not entirely easy to credit his tales when he says that, before he was led to evangelical Christianity, found God and happened on krumping -- in that order -- he was in the habit of harassing people at gunpoint. 
 ''I had slipped a little,'' Baby Tight Eyez said. ''I had done some crime, been shot at, shot at people, been in jail a couple times, was an ex-gangbanger. Before I found dancing and the church, I allowed myself to get caught up in all of that.''
 Tight Eyez and Baby Tight Eyez are among a small group of dancers in LaChapelle's film whose salvation depends as much on Christ as on krumping, a fact to which the director gives no particular weight. A partial explanation, at least, can be located in the term ''krump'' itself. Many times in ''Rize'' and at krump dance battles, dancers enter a state in which they seem bodily possessed. They look the way people do in Pentecostal churches who suddenly find themselves flailing and speaking in tongues, falling over suddenly as if struck dead. In the world of Tommy the Clown and Tight Eyez, a person who enters a state like that is described with the made-up word given to the dance itself. ''When someone gets struck like that,'' Tight Eyez said, ''you say they were krumped.''
 Before moving in with Tight Eyez and his mother, Baby Tight Eyez had been evicted from his own house and had formed an affiliation with the Crips. He did not think of himself as a dancer then, mostly because, he explained, dancing was something women did at parties and dancing was something that made a junior gangbanger look less like a man, and dancing, especially clown dancing, could be interpreted as gay.
 The point at which all that changed for Baby Tight Eyez was probably the day that Tommy the Clown first staged one of the impromptu dancing contests that eventually grew into Battle Zone. By then Baby Tight Eyez's friend and mentor Tight Eyez had already come to the conclusion that dancing ''was one thing I could do in a positive direction, that if I did it maybe I could avoid getting shot and ending up dead.'' By then, he had been dancing with one or another clown groups and then solo in his ''laboratory,'' a room at his mother's house he sleeps in and uses as his practice studio. He had been clocking the movements of his competitors as religiously as did the dance greats of an earlier era, tap dancers like Honi Coles, Bill Robinson and particularly the underestimated genius Chuck Green, who used to study the competition at impromptu club battles, then return to his studio, dissect their moves, torquing or slowing steps, playing with tempo until his feet crowded the rhythm and the music seemed to follow him, not the other way around. 
 ''If I might see a move at a battle, I'll take it back to the laboratory and work on it for the next time,'' Tight Eyez told me. His style is athletic and so fierce that challengers sometimes mistake his peaceable challenges for an invitation to do mortal combat. ''It looks violent, and people get scared by it a little,'' Tight Eyez said, not entirely displeased by the thought. ''But if you live in my kind of situation, you have some anger you need to express.'' 
It was a scorching afternoon when Tommy the Clown showed up at a middle school in Compton with a group of clown dancers in tow. Tommy does dozens of shows in schools each year, little makeshift pep rallies where he and his group tell jokes, recite stay-in-school bromides and then flip on the boombox to clown and krump. Tommy's group at the Vanguard Learning Center included Jesse Philpott, who dances as Rocco, and James Blackston, known as Little Tight Eyez, and Larry Berry, who has been dancing with Tommy the longest, eight years, under the name Larry the Clown. A special addition this afternoon was the 9-year-old Teyauna Taylor, known as Lil Mama. Lil Mama is a phenomenon who does her best to steal ''Rize'' from the competition with her frantic chest thrusts, raunchy splits and an expression of queenly hauteur that is all the more startling coming from someone four feet tall. 
 ''How many of y'all have seen this clown dance around?'' Tommy the Clown boomed into a microphone. The question hung in the air. ''Raise your hand if you can do this dance,'' he said. The crowd was quiet and bashful. ''O.K.,'' Tommy said then. ''I want all the ugly people in the house to be quiet.'' At this there was pandemonium. 
 As it turned out, the kids at Vanguard Learning Center knew clowning. They knew very well how to krump. But it was only after Tommy flipped on the trailer for ''Rize'' and invited his dancers to give a demonstration and delivered his standard stay-in-school speech that they got a chance to show what they could do. By then Tommy had recited his life story, the core of which is that, by rights, there should never have been a Tommy the Clown. 
 ''I used to sell drugs, cocaine, rock cocaine,'' Tommy explained. ''I did live a life surrounded by gangbangers, had no job and no money and took to doing criminal things. And what you have to understand is that you become that person when you live that life.''
 Nobody, Tommy explained, sets out to be a whiteface clown dancing in big shoes and a rainbow Afro. But not one of us knows, he went on, what his destiny is likely to be. 
 Before turning on the music again and inviting the Vanguard Learning Center students to show off for his crew, Tommy remarked that he had never imagined his attempt to earn an unconventional dollar would one day find recognition beyond the boundaries of community few outside eyes penetrate. ''When I first found out I was helping kids with the dancing, I felt blessed,'' he said. ''But, honestly, I was never trying to do it on purpose.'' 
 It happened, he explained, because he looked at his reality as an unemployed ex-convict living in the heart of South Central, thought of the prospects and started to laugh. ''I could have cried too,'' he said. ''But then I said to myself, 'If you have to be a clown, be a clown.' '' 
 Tommy the Clown cued up the the film's theme song, built around the refrain ''Krump, clown, break it on down!'' Then he tugged a young girl from the audience into the center of the assembly hall. 
 ''You gonna clown for us?'' Tommy asked the 12-year-old student, who seemed understandably overcome with shyness. 
 ''Turn the music up,'' he said, and suddenly the girl decided to take the challenge. Finding her place in the beat, she started pumping her arms, pistoning her hips and miming the don't-mess-with-me movements that are the essence of krumping.
 ''O.K., now, girl, go get it,'' Tommy the Clown hooted, laughing. 
 ''Go ahead now,'' said one of Tommy's other dancers. ''Take it out. Get krumped!''

HEADLINE: Iraq Is Ready for Foreign Aid, Minister Says

BYLINE: By JAMES GLANZ

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, June 19 

 BODY:
Although much of the world may see Iraq as mired in its insurgency, a high-level Iraqi official says Iraq will assert at a major international conference in Brussels this week that the government is now stable, secure and legitimate enough to begin receiving the vast economic and political help that countries other than the United States have promised.
 The Iraqis also will have something besides their version of current events to offer the more than 80 nations and international organizations that the hosts, the United States and the European Union, have invited to the meeting, Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari said in an extensive interview on Friday.
 He said Iraq would also pledge to slash its enormous domestic fuel subsidies and impose new taxes on its citizens. The gesture is aimed at international institutions like the World Bank, but invites a serious political reaction at home. 
 The large Iraqi delegation at the conference -- 25 to 30 officials, including 8 ministers -- will also present a new approach to rebuilding the country as the insurgency continues in many areas, Mr. Zebari said. The officials also plan to take the position that if the present government was to collapse, the consequences would be felt not only in the Middle East, but also in the farthest corners of the globe.
 ''The message is, really, nobody should underestimate the dangers of failing in Iraq,'' Mr. Zebari said,''because this will affect you all, both in terms of the spread of terrorism to your country and the effect it will have on the entire region.''
 With warnings like that, Iraqi officials will appeal for increased financial aid even though the meeting ''is not a donors conference per se,'' Richard H. Jones, senior adviser on Iraq to the secretary of state, said at a news briefing in Washington on Friday, according to a transcript of the event by Federal News Service Inc.
 Discussion is likely to focus on the $13 billion pledged by countries other than the United States for rebuilding Iraq at a conference in Madrid in 2003. Iraqi government estimates of how much of that money has been delivered have hovered around 10 percent. The delays have been attributed to security problems and poor coordination among the countries involved.
 Ayad Allawi, the former Iraqi prime minister and now a member of the Iraqi National Assembly, said in an interview that he constantly struggled during his tenure with the practicalities of getting the aid to Iraq.
 ''Frankly, the Iraqi side should present the meeting with a complete idea on how to form the mechanisms and mechanics for such a relationship,'' said Dr. Allawi, who will not be attending the Brussels conference.
 The United States hopes that improvements in such practical matters will be ''one of the deliverables, as we call it,'' of the meeting, Mr. Jones said.
 One seemingly insurmountable barrier is the unsettled security environment in Iraq, where American and Iraqi forces are still battling insurgent groups daily and where reconstruction contractors are regular targets of attack.
 But in a marked break with past policies, Mr. Zebari said the Iraqi government now contended it could make progress by slowing reconstruction in the most dangerous parts of the country like the central, Sunni-dominated provinces and the capital, Baghdad, while proceeding in safer pockets, like the Shiite-controlled city of Basra in the south or the peaceful Kurdish regions of the north.
 Previously, both American and Iraqi authorities insisted on pushing ahead with projects in virtually all areas simultaneously, which has led to skyrocketing security costs and widespread delays by the large Western contractors that effectively control the effort.
 ''For the reconstruction effort to proceed, it needs a major change of direction,'' Mr. Zebari said. ''First, it needs to concentrate on those areas where it's possible. Second, you need to involve more local Iraqi contractors, and not all those contractors from the foreign companies.''
 When told of that plan, Rick Barton, director of the post-conflict reconstruction project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said pouring resources only into certain areas ''really creates a favoritism that doesn't help.''
 Furthermore, since people generally arrive in the country in Baghdad, Mr. Barton said, ''if you can't get from the airport to downtown or you can't travel in the city at all,'' then those experiences will ''undercut the argument that it's safer.''
 Mr. Zebari said the government was also stable and reliable enough to receive reconstruction financing directly, rather than watching Western nations funnel money through the large contractors. But even within the United States Embassy in Baghdad, officials who deal with the Iraqi government on reconstruction say they doubt that it is capable of dealing with such sums of money yet, particularly on the level of technical management.
 ''For 20 years they haven't been exposed to anything new,'' said one senior official at the embassy. ''All of these techniques and tools that we take for granted, they don't have an understanding of that yet.''
 Iraq will also seek new international legitimacy on a political level in Brussels. The Iraqi government would like to see Arab governments send ambassadors and open full embassies. (The Persian Gulf country of Bahrain is one of the few to have done so.) The time is right even for European states that opposed the 2003 invasion to get behind the elected government of Iraq, Mr. Zebari said.
 In those efforts, the Iraqis may have a hard time getting more than polite gestures, said Joseph Cirincione, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, who had just returned from an unrelated conference in Italy.
 ''The Europeans have serious doubts about the viability of the Iraqi government,'' Mr. Cirincione said. But European bonhomie is likely to be on display in Brussels, he said, because ''they don't want to be blamed for what many feel is the likely failure of the American effort in Iraq.''
 Two other areas to be discussed in Brussels, support for Iraq's judicial system and security forces, could run into even deeper skepticism, particularly with Iraq's recent practice of parading apparently abused prisoners on television to give confessions. But that issue, Mr. Cirincione said, remains overshadowed, for now, by continuing questions over American treatment of its Iraqi prisoners.

HEADLINE: Time Runs Short to Settle Economics of Gaza's Future

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, June 16 

 BODY:
With Israel's pullout of settlers from the Gaza Strip looming in mid-August, officials on the Palestinian and Israeli sides agree that their coordination is lagging badly, particularly on economic issues important to the Palestinian population of Gaza.
 It seems highly unlikely, the officials say, that Gaza's successful greenhouses, which currently produce 15 percent of Israel's agricultural exports and employ 3,500 Palestinians, will be handed over fully functioning to the Palestinians, allowing them to pick up that portion of the market to Europe. 
 That uncertainty is compounded by the possible continuation of the laborious, security-focused method of checking perishable Palestinian agricultural exports, which would make it very difficult to keep those specialized greenhouses as a viable business, at least in the medium term.
 Those topics, as well as how to preserve the customs union of the West Bank and Gaza and Israel and how to improve freedom of movement in the West Bank, have been central to the discussions being held by the two sides, the World Bank, foreign donors and James D. Wolfensohn, a former president of the bank, who was asked by the United States and other countries to try to coordinate and energize the process. 
 Security coordination -- to try to ensure that the nearly 9,000 Israeli settlers in Gaza and a few hundred more in the West Bank can be evacuated peacefully -- is finally moving ahead, officials say. On Wednesday, for example, in a meeting of Israeli and Palestinian commanders, Israel promised to hand back the major West Bank town of Jenin to Palestinian security control before the pullout, to better enable the Palestinians to patrol the area that will be evacuated.
 But the linkages between security, freedom of movement of both goods and people and economic development are particularly intricate and highly politicized. Israel's prime minister, Ariel Sharon, is trying to reinforce his support on the right before the divisive Gaza pullout, with polls showing a drop in approval for the plan. And Palestinian leaders fear that Israel will use the withdrawal to consolidate its hold on the rest of the West Bank. 
 Muhammad Dahlan, the Palestinian minister overseeing coordination of the pullout, says Israel is withholding important information and maps about the settlements and he calls coordination ''a sham.'' He complains that Israel refuses to allow the Palestinians to reopen the Gaza airport or to arrange ''safe passage'' from Gaza to the West Bank. 
 Mr. Dahlan said recently that if the Israelis are trying to use ''Palestinians as partners in trying to turn the Gaza Strip into a large prison, then the Palestinians are simply not going to be their partners.''
 Israeli officials play down Mr. Dahlan's public complaints as grandstanding for a skeptical Palestinian audience and praise him for his practical grasp of the issues. 
 Eival Giladi, a former general who is coordinating the pullout for Israel, says one Israeli aim is to help the Palestinians. 
 ''We want to hand over living businesses to help the Palestinian economy,'' Mr. Giladi said in an interview, arranging with the Dutch, for instance, to keep their market quotas open to Palestinian produce that can replace Israeli settler produce. ''We're trying to create the situation necessary for the Palestinian Authority to lead, to establish law and order, create jobs and give Palestinians the good governance they deserve.''
 Israel does not want to hand over assets to militant groups like Hamas that are responsible for killing Israelis and who are rivals to the Palestinian Authority, Mr. Giladi said. Nor does Israel want to compromise its security interests and reduce its ability to protect its citizens from terrorism. 
 But maintaining security is the prime goal, with a revitalized Palestinian economy second, he said, especially when Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, is not satisfactorily cracking down on armed militants.
 This means that Israel will not dismantle its system of checkpoints and barriers that strangles the Palestinian economy. Yet eliminating that system would do more for the Palestinian economy than any asset handed over in Gaza, according to the World Bank and United Nations aid officials. And without more confidence about internal Palestinian reform and better governance, donor countries and investors will not make crucial long-term investments.
 The problems are clearest in three pressing issues, the officials say.
 First is the fate of the greenhouses, which enclose some 1,000 acres and have sophisticated machinery and irrigation systems. Donor countries will not further compensate Israeli settlers to get them to keep the greenhouses functioning until the last minute, and Israeli officials complain that the Palestinians will not discuss their handover except to say that the businesses would be privatized somehow and not taken over by the Palestinian Authority itself.
 The second issue is how to export perishable agricultural goods from Gaza quickly. Now, the Israelis simply drive their produce on protected roads directly to Israeli ports. But export of Palestinian goods can take days because of slow security-focused inspection and other measures that involve loading and unloading small pallets by hand. The Israelis say the Palestinians can start to build a seaport, but that will take years. And they refuse to allow the Gaza airport to reopen.
 Mr. Wolfensohn is trying to devise a solution involving terminals with sophisticated scanners and security checks that would allow containers or trailers to pass unopened without more than random checks, even if there is a change of truck cab and driver on each end. But such a solution will not materialize by summer's end.
 Still, Mr. Giladi says that Israel ''will do everything we can'' to speed perishable produce in and out of Gaza. Mr. Dahlan says those are empty words.
 Finally, there is the crossing at Rafah between Egypt and Gaza. Who will inspect goods and people passing into Gaza, currently done by Israelis, so that the uniform customs envelope is preserved between Gaza, the West Bank and Israel? To break the envelope would mean a different customs regime for Gaza and the West Bank, unacceptable to the Palestinians and confusing and costly to everyone. 
 Israel wants not only to ensure that weapons, explosives and wanted terrorists are not smuggled into Gaza, but also that cheap goods, counterfeit pharmaceuticals and even dangerous toys do not get into Gaza and then resold in Israel.
 The World Bank proposed using a foreign private company for a transitional period. But Israel, which does not want to rely on Palestinian customs officers and does not want to leave its own officials behind in Gaza, has rejected this proposal. 
 ''It's a genuine debate in our system,'' a senior Israeli official said. ''Treasury, responsible for customs, is very concerned about what will happen after disengagement. But there's mounting pressure from the donors to go private.''
 One solution might be to allow only luggage through Rafah, even if that luggage is stuffed with contraband for resale, and ensuring that all commercial goods go through other crossings. ''Then if all goes well, and Gaza settles down,'' the official said hopefully, ''we can look at it as a confidence-building measure and move on.''

HEADLINE: Start a New Career at 50? In Syracuse, Life After Layoffs

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: SYRACUSE 

 BODY:
When factories close, the workers who are laid off often feel like dinosaurs in a fast-disappearing industrial age. But when the Carrier Corporation shut down its huge air-conditioning factory here last year, Joseph Huppman saw it as a golden opportunity. 
 Mr. Huppman, who worked at Carrier for five years after spending 17 years in the Air Force, took advantage of his layoff to pursue a career that had long beckoned to him.
 ''I always wanted to be a nurse, and the opportunity never came up before,'' he said. ''Carrier, by sending my job to China, made the opportunity come up.'' 
 Now, after nearly a year back at school, Mr. Huppman, 50, is a licensed practical nurse, working at the local veterans hospital. 
 After Carrier, long this city's largest employer, moved the last of its Syracuse manufacturing operations to China and Singapore, many of the 1,200 laid-off workers felt as if they had been plunged into a real-life version of ''Survivor,'' although not on a Pacific Island. But now hundreds of these workers are pursuing a survival strategy that seems to be working: concluding that they had to reinvent themselves for post-industrial America, they are training for new careers.
 Helped by federal and state aid and generous tuition assistance from Carrier, nearly 500 laid-off workers have enrolled in a variety of college or vocational courses: respiratory therapy, education, trucking, human resources, hotel management, even geographic informational systems.
 ''We were pleased to see that a lot more of these workers went back to school than we usually see after layoffs,'' said Kelli Owens, the central New York regional administrator for the state's employment services office. ''Our goal has been to train these workers for a job they can move into.'' 
 With manufacturing withering in Syracuse and many other cities that were once blue-collar meccas, state, city and union officials urged the Carrier workers to train for new fields, and a large number heeded that advice.
 Two programs eased the way. First, Carrier promised to pay tuition for workers for up to four years, sweetening the pot by offering a $10,000 bonus to those who received bachelor's degrees and $5,000 to those who received community college degrees. Second, federal retraining money for factory workers who lose their jobs when their companies move operations overseas provided many Carrier workers unemployment benefits for as long as they remained in school, for a maximum of two years. Usually workers receive only six months of such benefits.
 But education has not been a cure-all. It does not ensure that the workers will find jobs or, if they do, that the jobs will pay as well as Carrier did. Happy as he is to be a nurse, Mr. Huppman is earning $30,000 a year, half what he earned at Carrier, where he earned $17 an hour and worked hundreds of hours of overtime. 
 ''They all got to accept they're not going to earn the same money they earned while at Carrier, even if they go back to school,'' said Rick Simone, business manager for the Sheet Metal Workers local at Carrier. He estimated that those who found new jobs took pay cuts of 30 to 40 percent, on average.
 Betty Haley, a career adviser with CNY Works, a government-financed training and employment agency in Syracuse, said the workers did not have it easy. 
 ''Looking for a job is very overwhelming when you haven't done that for 25, 35 years,'' she said. ''We've helped them with interviewing skills, resumes and networking, all these skills they haven't used in forever.''
 Stephanie Liddle, another Carrier castoff, took a six-month course to become a medical assistant in a doctor's office, but her job search has come up dry. 
 Now 59 and having problems paying her rent, she is at a point that she thought she would never reach: She has decided to move in with her 85-year-old mother.
 ''I've sent out resumes to at least five places a week, but without any luck,'' she said, having just hauled two dressers out of her apartment to the curb for anyone to take. 
 Still, Irwin Davis, the president of the Metropolitan Development Association of Syracuse, said that as a whole, the former Carrier workers were doing better than expected.
 ''If this were 10-plus years ago, a majority of these people would have simply hit the interstate and headed south and gotten a job there,'' Mr. Davis said. ''The interesting thing is some 500 of these workers have returned to school, and that shows they think there is opportunity here.''
 Roger A. Evans, an economist with the state Labor Department, was bearish about this city's prospects. ''This area is doing very well outside the manufacturing sector,'' he said, noting that the number of nonmanufacturing jobs in the area had risen by 8,700 to 287,400 in the last three years, while factory jobs fell by 5,200 to 33,000. 
 Some workers have scoured the Internet to find industries that are hiring. A Web search convinced Chris Fiacchi, 34, that he should study respiratory therapy. 
 ''A lot of us chose medical fields,'' he said. ''With all the aging baby boomers, there's going to be a large increase in medical staffing. You don't have to worry about layoffs there.''
 Thirty years ago, Barbara Ann Goss left Syracuse University after her freshman year and went to work at Carrier. Now she has returned to college to study health information technology. 
 ''Manufacturing, which I love, hardly exists any more in Upstate New York, and I'm not about to move to China,'' said Ms. Goss, who worked at Carrier for 26 years. ''I'm not about to leave the region, and about the only field I see growing here is health care. But I'm not cut out to be a nurse. I can't do blood and guts.''
 There are indisputable success stories. After studying to become a surgical technologist, Dale Carpenter, 37, landed a job in an operating room at St. Joseph's Hospital Health Center here. 
 ''The layoff was the best thing that ever happened to me,'' he said. ''Now I don't have to worry week to week about being laid off. Now I won't ever have to worry about looking for work again.''
 Patrick Sullivan, 52, sounds as if he has discovered the fountain of youth, so enthusiastic is he about studying for a degree in geographic informational systems, which involves interpreting satellite photos.
 ''Like most other parents, I told my kids, 'If you get a chance to go to college, you should,''' said Mr. Sullivan, who worked at Carrier for 27 years. ''Well, I finally had the chance to go to college, and I took it.'' 
 Even with their new skills, some former Carrier workers have been frustrated by the job hunt. Gary Galipeau, 57, who is married to Ms. Goss, will soon have a bachelor's degree in human resources from Empire State College. But he has repeatedly been rejected for jobs in the field, despite his expertise from having been the top employee benefits official for the union at Carrier. 
 ''I feel a need to continue working, financially and emotionally,'' said Mr. Galipeau, who worked at Carrier for 37 years. ''I was interviewed by a headhunter, but the subtle feedback was, I'm too old for what they're looking for.
 ''A lot of Carrier people worked 50, 60 hours a week for many, many years, and now, suddenly, they're considered too old to work.''
 Mr. Galipeau contrasted today's job market with the one in 1967, when General Electric laid him off from its now-closed television factory here. 
 ''At that point in time, you could roll out of bed into a manufacturing job,'' he said, voicing concern that the region's high-paying factory jobs were giving way to lower-paying service jobs.
 ''I'm scared about the future for central New York,'' he said. ''You can't base an economy on selling hamburgers and insurance policies to each other.''

HEADLINE: Can a Saturday Paper Pull Up Profit at The Journal?

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
For decades, readers have turned to The Wall Street Journal to learn how business and politics are played out in the boardrooms, and the backrooms, of the nation. 
 Will those same readers turn to The Journal to learn how to make the perfect souffle? 
 Starting Sept. 17, The Journal will add a Saturday issue named Weekend Edition, with a new emphasis on softer features -- entertainment, travel, sports, arts, books, real estate and, yes, recipes. The goal is to attract a more diverse base of advertising to pull The Journal out of its prolonged slump.
 The Saturday paper, which will be delivered at no extra charge -- at least initially -- to subscribers, will have a more airy, more casual feel than its daily counterpart, but will still be instantly recognizable as The Wall Street Journal. 
 It will come in three sections: news, Money & Investing, and a third called Pursuits, devoted to leisure activities. It is this section, which will feature articles about the ''business of life,'' with more white space and more color, on which The Journal's hopes rest. 
 ''The idea is to allow people to relax with The Wall Street Journal,'' said Karen Elliott House, publisher of The Journal and senior vice president of Dow Jones & Company, which owns The Journal. 
 The Saturday issue, which was developed under the code name ''Project Propel,'' inside The Journal's offices in Lower Manhattan, represents one of the biggest gambles in the paper's 116-year history. The Journal is betting that it can fluff up its editorial mix, capture the attention of its well-heeled readers and their families and attract consumer advertisers -- all without cannibalizing its weekday editions and, more important, without diluting one of the most recognized and sharply defined franchises in all of journalism. 
 Many people within Dow Jones, particularly on the business side, argued that the paper had little choice. Since the dot-com bubble burst, The Journal, more dependent than most papers on technology and financial advertising, has watched its ad linage decline in each of the last four years. In the first quarter of this year, financial ads in The Journal dropped 24 percent from the first quarter a year ago, and technology ads dropped 23 percent, according to the company's quarterly report. 
 As a result, profit at Dow Jones was down 54 percent in the first quarter and the print publications division, which includes all editions of The Journal and Barron's, lost just over $7 million. Dow Jones's stock price has dropped from a high of $76.75 a share in 2000 to a close on Friday of $35.39 a share, below where it was before the market crashed in 1987. 
 ''What I wonder is if the decision to pursue the Saturday edition isn't a tacit acknowledgement that their core franchise is challenged, that the base business is less attractive than it used to be,'' said Peter Appert, a media analyst at Goldman Sachs (where the client roster includes both Dow Jones and The New York Times Company).
 Weekend Edition is the second big move Dow Jones has made in recent months. In January, the company acquired MarketWatch, which provides business news online, for $538 million, hoping to tap into the growing demand for online advertising. The company also owns Barron's, Dow Jones Newswires and a chain of smaller newspapers.
 But The Journal still accounts for more than half of Dow Jones's revenue and a good part of its prestige. The paper's conservative editorial page is a must-read among the nation's power elites, and its writers have earned 12 Pulitzer Prizes since 1999. 
 John Morton, a newspaper industry analyst, said he thought the Saturday paper was ''a good idea because it plugs the Friday hole in their coverage.'' But, he said, the question was whether advertisers would spend new money on Saturday or stretch their five-day budgets out over six days and whether, with the stock price so low, the market would have the patience to wait while Weekend Edition built its advertising base.
 Editors began working on a prototype for Weekend Edition in 2003 and, as advertising remained weak, internal support for the project grew. Over the last two years, The Journal has conducted dozens of focus groups across the country and fine-tuning plans for the Saturday paper. 
 The company estimates that its net operating loss for rolling out the Saturday edition will be $12.5 million this year, taking into account printing, the hiring of an additional 150 employees, and the added expense of a sixth day of distribution (including rerouting about half a million papers to weekend addresses from the offices where they are now sent). 
 To save money elsewhere, The Journal has scaled back its overseas operations, shrinking its European and Asian editions to tabloid size, cutting its reporting staffs and even recalling to the United States some senior correspondents whom it is not replacing. These moves have troubled some in the newsroom, who regard the Saturday edition as something like an unknown relative to whom they may be asked to donate body parts.
 ''We're not questioning the strategic decision of The Journal to start a Saturday paper,'' said Theo Francis, a Journal reporter based in Florida, who represents the newsroom in the paper's union, the Independent Association of Publishers' Employees Local 1096 of the Newspaper Guild. ''What everybody is worried about is whether they're doing it on the cheap and whether they will hire enough additional people to put out the same quality paper.'' 
 Virgil Hollender, the union local's president, said that while management had said it was hiring an additional 150 employees, he had not yet seen them. ''If they are hiring 150 people, we don't know where,'' he said.
 A company spokeswoman said that hiring had begun in the news, marketing and sales departments but was not yet complete. And Ms. House suggested that having the Saturday paper would actually be easier on the staff rather than burdensome. 
 ''People won't be working six days a week,'' she said, then added, ''But any of the real stars of The Journal work a six-day week now.''
 While the paper still has the second-highest weekday print circulation in the country after USA Today, its daily print circulation for the six-month period ending in March slipped to 1,750,400, down 2.3 percent from the year before. (And more than 320,000 people subscribe to The Journal online, giving it a total circulation of 2,070,500.)
 ''Yes, we've had some slippage in circulation, like everyone else in print,'' said Paul E. Steiger, managing editor of The Journal. ''But it's an enormous circulation and an exquisite circulation. It's people who can move the world.''
 The question is whether enough of those people want to read a paper on Saturday. In big markets, Saturday circulation is generally lower than weekday circulation because fewer commuters are riding trains. The New York Times's Saturday circulation of 1,047,500, for example, is about 8 percent lower than its average weekday circulation.
 Mike Neiss, a senior vice president and managing director of Universal McCann, the advertising and marketing firm in New York, said that advertisers were generally leery of Saturday papers and he expected The Journal to offer special packages, at least initially, to lure them in.
 ''They'll be playing to an empty theater,'' he said of The Journal. ''They might trap a few advertisers who want exposure regardless, but this is an experiment in recycling.''
 Part of the point in calling the new paper ''Weekend Edition'' -- even though the paper already calls its Friday paper Weekend Journal -- is to get away from any negativity associated with Saturday papers. 
 Frederick W. Searby, an advertising and publishing analyst with J.P. Morgan, said that there were advertising dollars on weekends that The Journal could capture. 
 ''Weekends are a huge profitability center for newspapers,'' he said, citing the example of The Times, one of The Journal's chief competitors, especially in the New York region. ''The New York Times has the hegemonic position in advertising on the weekend, and this is a way for The Journal to go after those dollars. They've got to shake that tree.''
 Bill Keller, executive editor of The New York Times, said that the announcement of a Saturday Journal spurred The Times to overhaul its business news section faster than it had planned.
 ''The prospect of new Saturday competition from a business newspaper focused our minds and accelerated our timetable,'' he said. Still, he added, ''I don't worry that many readers of the Sunday New York Times are going to be hungry for another weekend newspaper.'' 
 When asked during an interview where new advertising money for Weekend Edition might come from, Mr. Steiger grinned broadly. 
 ''I don't think The New York Times should be afraid of a thing,'' he said. ''We can hope that advertisers take it out of their vast television budgets.''
 Journal editors said they were confident that the Saturday paper would be a success, in part because Weekend Journal on Friday had proved successful, even as business publications in general have struggled.
 A sampling of Journal readers found them curious, but noncommittal, about the Saturday edition. 
 Jude Shearer, 61, a retired county government official who lives in Rogersville, Tenn., said she loved The Journal and was eager to see what would be in Weekend Edition. ''I'm going to have to make time to read it on Saturday, but if it's worth reading, I'll be more than happy to do that,'' she said.
 But she also voiced some skepticism. ''I'm not really quite sure what exactly they can do in a Saturday Journal that they don't do on a Friday with Weekend Journal,'' she said. 
 John Osterweis, 62, an investment manager in San Francisco, said he would read the Saturday paper ''if it's got something worth reading.'' But, he added, ''it's not a product I thought I needed.'' He also said he would be the only reader in his household. ''My wife is an artist,'' he said. ''She's not going to sit there and read The Wall Street Journal.''
 She might be surprised if she did, since the editors have devoted much of the last year to coming up with ideas to appeal to nonbusiness readers. 
 ''It will have more editor's picks, lists, things that help a reader quickly decide and take action on books to buy, movies to see, meals to cook,'' Ms. House said.
 Mr. Searby of J.P. Morgan said that despite the risks, he applauded Dow Jones executives for taking such a bold step, even if it had been forced upon them.
 ''Everybody is experimenting because the industry is in a funk,'' he said. ''All newspaper groups are trying to maintain their relevance and find some way to jump-start the business.''

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Monday about the planned weekend edition of The Wall Street Journal misstated The Journal's online circulation. It totals 731,000; the 320,000 figure represented the number of online subscribers who can be counted, under audit regulations, as part of the paper's print circulation.

HEADLINE: LOOKING AHEAD

 BODY:
Fraud Squad -- Former C.E.O.'s in legal trouble -- and there are more every week -- will be watching closely as John J. Rigas, pictured, and his son Timothy, who together helped build the family's cable business into the industry giant Adelphia, will be sentenced on charges of corporate fraud. The government has taken the unusual step of asking for the maximum: 215 years. (Monday.)
 Hillary in '05 -- Even without an election this year, the book publisher Pearson hopes ''The Truth About Hillary: What She Knew, When She Knew It, and How Far She'll Go to Become President,'' the well-publicized look at Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton from its conservative Sentinel imprint, will join other highly partisan books on the best-seller list. (Tuesday.) 
 Brawl Street -- Morgan Stanley, where infighting, court battles and public embarrassments have turned the company into the Los Angeles Lakers of financial companies, will announce its quarterly earnings, the first since Philip J. Purcell, its chief executive, declared himself a lame duck. (Wednesday.)
 High Interest -- With house prices in much of the country climbing into new territory, anxious buyers now watch the release of the monthly existing-home-sales data from the National Association of Realtors the way they used to watch CNBC. Anybody remember ''Dow 36,000''? (Thursday.)
 Early Delivery -- As FedEx goes, so goes the nation -- or so a lot of people think. For those that do, the courier company, whose shares have slid more than 14 percent from this year's peak, delivers its own earnings report. (Thursday.)
 Almost Secure -- The shareholders of the Symantec Corporation and Veritas Software are expected to vote to approve the merger of the companies, creating the fourth-largest software company. The deal was valued at nearly $13.5 billion when it was announced in December, but today it is valued at about $11 billion. (Friday.)
 Economic Indicators -- Leading indicators for May (Monday); jobless claims for the week of June 13-18 and home resales for May (Thursday); and durable-goods orders and new-home sales for May (Friday).

HEADLINE: Bush's Road Gets Rougher

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 19 

 BODY:
Five months after President Bush was sworn in for another four years, his political authority appears to be ebbing, both within his own party, where members of Congress are increasingly if sporadically going their own way, and among Democrats, who have discovered that they pay little or no price for defying him.
 In some cases, Mr. Bush is suffering mere political dings that can be patched up, like the votes by the House this past week to buck him on withholding dues to the United Nations and retaining a controversial provision of the USA Patriot Act.
 In others, the damage is more than cosmetic, as in the case of stem cell research, an issue on which a good portion of his party is breaking with him. In a few instances -- most notably the centerpiece of his second-term agenda, his call to reshape Social Security -- he is dangerously close to a fiery wreck that could have lasting consequences for his standing and for the Republican Party. 
 On Monday, Mr. Bush will face another test of his clout, when the Republican-controlled Senate tries again to overcome Democratic opposition and confirm John R. Bolton as ambassador to the United Nations. And with his poll numbers sinking as voters grow more restive about Iraq and the economy, he faces additional big challenges in coming weeks and months, from legislative battles over energy, trade and immigration to the possibility of a divisive Supreme Court confirmation fight.
 The cumulative effect of his difficulties in the last few months has been to pierce the sense of dominance that he sought to project after his re-election and to heighten concerns among Republicans in Congress that voters will hold them, as the party in power, responsible for failure to address the issues of most concern to the public. 
 ''The political capital he thought he had has dwindled to very little, and he overstated how much he had to begin with,'' said Allan J. Lichtman, a presidential historian at American University in Washington. 
 ''Congress is like Wall Street -- it operates on fear and greed,'' Mr. Lichtman said. ''The Democrats don't fear him anymore, and they're getting greedy, because they think they can beat him. The attitude you see among Republicans in Congress is, my lifeboat first.''
 In the last week, Mr. Bush has responded by lashing out at Democrats, casting them as obstructionists, a strategy that carries some risk given that it seems to acknowledge an inability by Republicans to carry out a governing platform. Searching as well for a more positive message, the administration, which has always been reluctant to acknowledge that events are not unfolding precisely as planned, has embarked on a public relations campaign intended to reassure Americans that Mr. Bush is attuned to their concerns. 
 Mr. Bush has offered nothing new in the way of policy but is instead reiterating his views that the war in Iraq is worth the sacrifices it has demanded and that his approaches on issues like energy and trade are the best way of addressing economic jitters. But his message is being undercut somewhat by the more outspoken mavericks in his own party.
 Among them are two potential candidates for Mr. Bush's job: Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, who in an interview in the current issue of U.S. News & World Report said the administration's assertions on Iraq were ''disconnected from reality,'' and Senator John McCain of Arizona, who on NBC's ''Meet the Press'' on Sunday disputed Vice President Dick Cheney's characterization last week of the Iraqi insurgency as being in its last throes.
 It is far too early to dismiss Mr. Bush as a lame duck. He remains exceedingly popular among Republicans, he has a skilled and aggressive political team around him, and he has had a way in the past of teasing full or partial victories from dire-looking situations. Even if he has to wheel and deal, he stands a good chance of signing an energy policy bill and a trade agreement with Central American nations this summer.
 But he has already had to postpone his next big initiative, an overhaul of the tax code. And barring some crisis that creates another rally-round-the-president effect, analysts said, Mr. Bush's best opportunity to drive the agenda may be past.
 To many Republicans, Mr. Bush's problems are not unexpected given his willingness to take on politically difficult issues like Social Security and immigration. They say that divisions within the party are manageable and that Mr. Bush's doggedness and personal appeal ensure that he will still drive the debate on Capitol Hill and around the country, even if he does not get everything he wants.
 ''More is being done than it appears,'' said Representative Peter T. King, Republican of New York, pointing to the enactment this year of laws changing the bankruptcy system and limiting class-action lawsuits, as well as Mr. Bush's success in moving more of his judicial appointments through the Senate.
 But, Mr. King added, ''it's still going to be difficult on Social Security and immigration.''
 ''He will be in control of the agenda, but that control is not going to be as emphatic as it was in the first four years,'' Mr. King said.
 Democrats said Mr. Bush's problems were of his own making, and stemmed from a tendency toward insistence on doing things his way and viewing bipartisanship as nothing more than winning over a few Democrats to get legislation passed.
 Mr. Bush and his administration now find themselves with little or no support from Democrats and with a Republican Party that has proved reluctant to support him on a number of fronts.
 ''Their domestic agenda is really stalled, and they're pretty much looking for an exit ramp,'' said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon. ''They seem to have been unwilling to shift from the politics of a first-term president who has to run for re-election into the clear-eyed policy of a second-term president who wants to be able to point to substantive achievements.''
 To some extent, Mr. Bush's problems are a result of diverging political interests: the lawmakers he is asking to support him on difficult issues like Social Security, trade and immigration have to run for re-election, many of them next year, while he has the luxury of thinking about his place in history and reshaping, for the long term, politics and policy. 
 The current situation also reflects Mr. Bush's style of not giving an inch until defeat is certain, and only then compromising or capitulating. 
 At a recent meeting with Republican Congressional leaders, Mr. Bush told them, ''We're on the verge of getting a lot of things done,'' according to a White House official who was there. The 55 Republican senators have been invited to hold their weekly policy luncheon at the White House on Tuesday, a gesture that is part of an effort by the administration to respond to grumbling among Republicans that the White House has failed to open good lines of communication with Capitol Hill.
 ''While it's been a rough 45 days, Bush can and will get back on track, and all those jitters will go away,'' said Scott W. Reed, a Republican consultant who managed Bob Dole's 1996 campaign for president.
 But Mr. Lichtman said history suggested that it was difficult for second-term presidents to regain their clout in domestic policy once they had dissipated it.
 ''Second terms have never been redeemed by domestic policy,'' he said. ''It's very difficult once you've had problems in domestic policy, as they almost all do, to come back. To the extent you've had them come out successfully, it's because of foreign affairs.''

HEADLINE: Molding Europe's Agenda

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL

DATELINE: LONDON, June 19 

 BODY:
On the broad and fraying canvas of European integration, the vicious brawl between France and Britain that wrecked a summit meeting late on Friday seemed, as one British official put it, to be ''the worst crisis.''
 But through the narrower focus of the political fortunes of Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, Europe's disarray may offer different omens, diverting attention from challenges closer to home and enabling him to rewrite the timetable of his third term in office. With a bold -- and as yet uncertain -- maneuver to mold Europe's agenda, he might even be hoping to resuscitate the global role he once pursued as a bridge between the United States and Europe.
 Like his predecessor and adversary Margaret Thatcher, Mr. Blair returned from the Brussels meeting in the bloodied mantle of a victorious warrior against those in Continental Europe -- France and Germany -- whose demands have long grated on his nation's Euroskeptic soul. A poll on Sunday in the tabloid News of the World showed almost three-quarters of respondents in favor of Mr. Blair's readiness to face down his adversaries in what was reported here as a macho arm-wrestling match with President Jacques Chirac of France over the European budget. 
 He could hardly have chosen a more suitable adversary than Mr. Chirac, mocked in British tabloids with almost the same venom as British chauvinists reserve for the Germans.
 Indeed, columnists noted that the Brussels summit meeting broke up on the 190th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo, fought near Brussels on June 18, 1815, when the defeat of Napoleon by British- and Prussian-led armies redrew the map of Europe. 
 ''In saving Europe from itself, he thinks he has found a new mission,'' said Andrew Rawnsley, a columnist, in The Observer Sunday.
 Suddenly, this weekend, no one was talking about Mr. Blair's unpopular support for the war in Iraq -- the issue that haunted his re-election campaign. The vote on May 5 returned Mr. Blair to office for a third term, but with a reduced parliamentary majority that inspired much debate about when he might hand over power to his rival, Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown. But, faced with a common enemy across the channel, Mr. Brown and Mr. Blair seemed united in opposing French demands for an end to Britain's multibillion-dollar rebate from the European Union, because of Britain's meager benefits from European agricultural subsidies.
 Like the Duke of Wellington before him, Mr. Blair had found a new battleground. With Mr. Chirac in France and Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany weakened politically, he clearly feels molding Europe's future is a battle worth fighting. 
 ''It's certainly a crisis -- it's the worst crisis that I've seen during my four years as foreign secretary, indeed my more than eight years as a member of this government,'' Jack Straw, Britain's foreign secretary, said on Sunday.
 ''But crises can either turn into disasters if you do nothing about them or they can turn into cathartic opportunities, and I believe that we both have a duty and an opportunity here to turn it into a catharsis from which greater good comes,'' he said in a radio interview. 
 Some of Mr. Blair's calculations are based on felicitous timing. 
 On July 1, Britain will assume the rotating presidency of the 25-nation European Union, offering Mr. Blair the chance to combine two roles as a leading combatant in the Continent's division, and as an umpire in its struggle for healing. 
 Then, on July 6, as chairman of the summit meeting in Scotland for the Group of 8 major industrialized nations, he will strut the world's stage as host to the leaders of the richest and most powerful nations, including the United States -- a gathering that offers, in equal doses, the opportunity for great statesmanship and the peril of unseemly disputes over climate change and poverty relief with friend and foe alike. 
 (July 6 is also the date for the announcement from the International Olympic Committee of the host for the 2012 Olympic Games: with Paris and London among the top contenders, the decision will have more than simply sporting significance for Mr. Blair and Mr. Chirac.)
 In some ways, the battle for Europe has finally crystallized the distinctions that have kept Britain aloof from the Franco-German social vision of the Continent -- and therefore from the closer integration of the euro single currency -- for years. 
 It is, Mr. Straw said, ''essentially a division between whether you want a European Union that is able to cope with the future or whether you want a European Union that is trapped in the past.''
 In this analysis, Britain, with its hire-and-fire labor laws, its low unemployment, its struggling public services and its economic growth, is depicted here as the future. Continental Europe, with its jobless millions cosseted by unaffordable benefits, is history.
 Of course, it may not turn out to be so simple. European plans for a new constitution -- which Mr. Blair once said he supported -- have been wrecked by referendums in France and the Netherlands rejecting the charter. The Continent Mr. Blair seeks to lead may well be adrift, with domestic politics dominating agendas from Paris to Berlin.
 When he took office in 1997, moreover, Mr. Blair set out a grand vision of putting Britain at the heart of Europe and overcoming a profound Euroskepticism among his own people. Now, though, he seems to be the central proponent of that same hostility to the rest of the Continent. 
 What will underpin Mr. Blair's actions in coming months is the sense here that he is seeking a triumph that will define him for posterity in a way that eluded him in Iraq or at home.

HEADLINE: Corporate Synergy in Action: CNN Will Promote HBO Movie

BYLINE: By LIA MILLER

 BODY:
To promote his film ''The Passion of the Christ,'' Mel Gibson sought the pope's opinion. To promote its new movie ''The Girl in the Cafe,'' HBO has appealed to a higher power: corporate synergy.
 CNN, which like HBO is owned by Time Warner, will run 25 minutes of clips from the film as part of the network's reporting and as part of an hourlong special on the film. That will be followed by what is certainly a coup for Time Warner's cross-platform marketing: Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain (who received an advance copy of the film) will be interviewed by Christiane Amanpour on the subject of global poverty, followed by a filmed segment of Ms. Amanpour reporting from an impoverished village in Ethiopia. 
 The film, a romantic comedy by the British screenwriter Richard Curtis, who wrote ''Four Weddings and a Funeral,'' involves a naive young woman named Gina who shames world leaders at a fictional Group of 8 summit meeting into adopting goals to end world poverty. Gina, played by Kelly Macdonald, above, is invited to accompany Lawrence, a British civil servant played by Bill Nighy, also above, to the meeting. 
 The movie will first be shown on June 25th, two weeks before the real Group of 8 summit meeting in Scotland, starting July 6. CNN's special will be shown on July 2.
 Mr. Curtis, a founder of the charity Comic Relief, said, ''All this help by HBO, that can't help but create a sense of occasion.''
 Colin Callendar, the president of HBO Films, said the network approached its corporate sibling CNN while looking for ways to create a dialogue around the film. 
 ''They are a news organization,'' he said. ''A partnership with CNN seemed an obvious way to a get more people to see the film and talk about it and the issues that are at the center of the film.'' 
 Jonathan Klein, the president of CNN's domestic operations, said that the movie was an intriguing way to make a complex issue comprehensible to the audience. ''We will be covering the summit and I'm not sure that many Americans know what it is, or care or understand why it matters. The movie is a phenomenal way of making the central issue of the G-8 summit accessible to Americans.''
 The network will also use the film as a way to help highlight some of its own reporting on topics like what happens to aid when it gets to Africa and the rising roles of evangelical Christians in Africa. ''It is an inventive approach, but we are always looking for ways to get access points to the audience,'' Mr. Klein said. 
 HBO has brought in an occasional but unlikely-sounding partner, the Council on Foreign Relations, as a co-sponsor of premieres this week. 
 The audience for the premiere in Washington will include Congressional staff members and policy makers from the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the State Department. Afterward, Jeff Greenfield of CNN will interview Fareed Zakaria, the editor of Newsweek International and a foreign relations expert. 
 In his most recent column, Mr. Zakaria said that a romantic comedy about global poverty might sound ''sleep inducing'' but that ''The Girl in the Cafe'' was actually ''a pleasure to watch.''

HEADLINE: Israelis and Palestinians Agree On Demolishing Houses in Gaza

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN and GREG MYRE; Steven R. Weisman reported from Amman for this article, and Greg Myre from Jerusalem.

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, June 19 

 BODY:
Israel and the Palestinians have agreed to cooperate on the demolition of the 1,600 Gaza houses to be vacated by Israeli settlers in less than two months, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice announced Sunday. The agreement represented the first concrete Israeli-Palestinian cooperation in Gaza after many months of disputes.
 Under the agreement, the Israelis will tear down the houses and the Palestinians will be paid to clean up the rubble, providing the Palestinians money for jobs while avoiding any need for the Israeli army to stay in Gaza for long beyond the evacuation. 
 Ms. Rice said she hoped the agreement, in which both sides also reiterated their commitment to a peaceful Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, would lead to more examples of Israeli-Palestinian cooperation as the Aug. 16 target date for the pullout approaches. 
 ''Much more work will still be needed to be done in coming months for the disengagement to succeed, and the United States will remain actively involved in every step of the way,'' Ms. Rice said in Jerusalem. ''But let me say that I found the leaders on both sides to be focused, and their governments to be focused on what needs to be done.''
 The fate of the settler houses had emerged as a contentious issue partly because the Palestinian leadership did not consider them an efficient use of valuable land and wanted them destroyed. Israeli settlers in Gaza live in heavily guarded clusters of villas, many of them with gardens and seaside views. The Palestinians have always said they were not suitable for many of the 1.3 million Gaza residents who could end up living in the vacated settlement areas. 
 At the same time, many of the Israeli settlers, unhappy but resigned about leaving, wanted the Israeli military to demolish the houses because, they said, they did not wish to see Palestinian militants raising their flags on the houses the settlers had built. But senior Israeli officials, including the defense minister, Shaul Mofaz, had expressed reservations about cleaning up the rubble because that would have required that Israeli soldiers stay in Gaza many weeks beyond the evacuation, exposing them to potential attack.
 While significant, the agreement on the fate of the homes resolves only one of many issues surrounding the Israeli pullout, in which nearly 9,000 settlers are to be removed, a source of debate and trauma in Israel. On the Palestinian side is general cynicism and fear that the withdrawal will end up shutting down talks with Israel over a future state with viable boundaries. Palestinians are also concerned about the future of Gaza's economy when the Israelis withdraw, particularly Israeli-owned agricultural businesses. 
 Among the matters still being negotiated are the disposition of Israeli greenhouses -- which employ 3,500 Palestinians alone -- and other Israeli enterprises, and Palestinian plans for a seaport, an airport and open border crossings. Ms. Rice said the sides agreed generally to permit the cross-border flow of goods and people to ''allow for economic revival to begin immediately.''
 Israel, invoking security concerns, is resisting the Palestinian demand for supplying lethal arms to security forces and for construction of an airport deemed necessary for economic viability. Also contentious is whether Israeli security forces will stay in a narrow corridor between Gaza and Egypt.
 Two special envoys, James D. Wolfensohn, a former president of the World Bank, and Lt. Gen. William E. Ward, the deputy commander of the United States Army in Europe, are conferring with Israeli and Palestinian officials to work out details on these matters, which are also to be discussed by Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel and President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority when they meet Tuesday.
 Both envoys are shuttling between Jerusalem and the Palestinian headquarters, but they are not venturing into Gaza itself. The area has been off-limits to Americans since three American contractors were killed in an attack in 2003.
 Reflecting the increasingly urgent pace ahead of the Gaza pullout, Ms. Rice said she would present a plan to pay for Palestinian redevelopment to potential Arab and European donors this week. Various officials put the cost at $3 billion over three years, and the source of the financing was unclear. 
 Ms. Rice said that one project that needed financing was a ''master plan'' being developed for the area now occupied by 21 Israeli settlements, which had taken up about a fifth of the Gaza strip.
 The Palestinians themselves have not announced any formal details of that plan. Ziad Abu Amr, a prominent Palestinian legislator in Gaza, has said the vacated land would be used for a range of purposes, including multifamily housing, schools, parks and factories. 
 Mr. Amr welcomed the agreement on Sunday, saying the single family houses were not suitable for Palestinians. The settler houses were built to accommodate five or six people, whereas extended Palestinian families in Gaza often number 20 to 30 relatives under one roof.
 After two days of meetings, highlighted by sessions with Mr. Sharon and Mr. Abbas, Ms. Rice left Israel for Jordan and visits to Egypt and Saudi Arabia for discussions on the Israel-Palestinian situation and on democracy in the Arab world.
 Unrelated to the Palestinian discussions, Ms. Rice said in Israel that she had had difficult words with Israeli officials over their recent military cooperation with China. The United States has objected to Israel's arms sales to China, particularly its plans to upgrade some unmanned aircraft sold to China a few years ago.
 But she said it appeared that Israel had come to understand American concerns. Silvan Shalom, the Israeli foreign minister, said Israel had apologized for doing anything unacceptable to the United States. Gaza remains a volatile place despite a truce declared by the two sides more than four months ago, and there have been fears that the houses could become a focus of violence. 
 Even on Sunday as the agreement on the settler houses was announced, Palestinian attackers firing anti-tank missiles and automatic rifles killed one Israeli soldier and wounded two more along Gaza's southern border with Egypt, the Israeli military said. The soldiers returned fire, killing one attacker while a second one escaped, the military added.
 Israeli officials say that it will take a few weeks to remove the settlers, and another few weeks to reduce their houses to debris. Israel will pay for the demolition and plans to pay the settlers for the loss of their houses, greenhouses and other possessions, the officials said. 
 But two senior administration officials, in a briefing under ground rules in which they could not be identified, said the $50 million to $60 million for the removal of the rubble would be paid to the Palestinian Authority as an employment project, though it had not been determined where the money would come from.

HEADLINE: Black Market In Credit Cards Thrives on Web

BYLINE: By TOM ZELLER Jr.

 BODY:
''Want drive fast cars?'' asks an advertisement, in broken English, atop the Web site iaaca.com. ''Want live in premium hotels? Want own beautiful girls? It's possible with dumps from Zo0mer.'' 
 A ''dump,'' in the blunt vernacular of a relentlessly flourishing online black market, is a credit card number. And what Zo0mer is peddling is stolen account information -- name, billing address, phone -- for Gold Visa cards and MasterCards at $100 apiece. 
 It is not clear whether any data stolen from CardSystems Solutions, the payment processor reported on Friday to have exposed 40 million credit card accounts to possible theft, has entered this black market. But law enforcement officials and security experts say it is a safe bet that the data will eventually be peddled at sites like iaaca.com -- its very name a swaggering shorthand for International Association for the Advancement of Criminal Activity. 
 For despite years of security improvements and tougher, more coordinated law enforcement efforts, the information that criminals siphon -- credit card and bank account numbers, and whole buckets of raw consumer information -- is boldly hawked on the Internet. The data's value arises from its ready conversion into online purchases, counterfeit card manufacture, or more elaborate identity-theft schemes.
 The online trade in credit card and bank account numbers, as well as other raw consumer information, is highly structured. There are buyers and sellers, intermediaries and even service industries. The players come from all over the world, but most of the Web sites where they meet are run from computer servers in the former Soviet Union, making them difficult to police. 
 Traders quickly earn titles, ratings and reputations for the quality of the goods they deliver -- quality that also determines prices. And a wealth of institutional knowledge and shared wisdom is doled out to newcomers seeking entry into the market, like how to move payments and the best time of month to crack an account. 
 The Federal Trade Commission estimates that roughly 10 million Americans have their personal information pilfered and misused in some way or another every year, costing consumers $5 billion and businesses $48 billion annually. 
 ''There's so much to this,'' said Jim Melnick, a former Russian affairs analyst for the Defense Intelligence Agency who is now the director of threat development at iDefense, a company in Reston, Va., that tracks cybercrime. ''The story that needs to be told is the larger, long-term threat to the American financial industry. It's a cancer. It's not going to kill you now, but slowly, over time.'' 
 No one is willing to estimate how many cards and account numbers actually make it to the Internet auction block, but law enforcement agents consistently describe the market as huge. Every day, at sites like iaaca.com and carderportal.org, pseudonymous vendors do business in an arcane slurry of acronyms.
 ''Cobs,'' or changes of billings, are a hot commodity. Typically, a peddler of cobs is offering fresh bank or credit card accounts, along with the ability to change the billing address through a pilfered PIN. In other cases, a vendor selling cobs is offering to change billing addresses himself, as a service. Sometimes the address is changed to a safe ''drop,'' which might be an empty apartment in a local building, or some other scouted locale where goods can be delivered. (Information on reliable drops is also bought and sold.) 
 Lengthy tutorials posted at online ''carding'' forums indicate that the cob art form is highly developed. A patient criminal will wait until the day a victim receives a billing statement. ''That way you have a full 30 days'' before the victim is likely to look over his account again, explained one frank tutorial collected by the F.B.I. 
 A user going by the name ''mindtrip'' had cobs for sale recently: ''I'm selling cobs from at this time only banks Discover and American Express t'ill further notice,'' he wrote in brusque English. ''The cobs come with full info including MMN'' (mother's maiden name). Discover Card cobs with any balance were on special: $50. American Express, a more exclusive and potentially more lucrative account, commanded $85. 
 Alongside advertisements for cobs are pitches from malicious-code writers, who sell their services to the con artists, known as phishers, who contract with spammers to send out millions of increasingly sophisticated phony e-mails designed to lure victims into revealing their account information. 
 A successful phishing operation might bring in thousands of fresh account numbers, along with other identifying details: names, addresses, phone numbers, passwords, PIN's, and mothers' maiden names. The richer the detail (and the higher the account balance), the better the asking price. 
 A user by the nickname Sirota is peddling account information so detailed, and so formatted, that it clearly came from a credit report. He is asking $200 per dump on accounts with available balances above $10,000, with a minimum order of five if the buyer wants accounts associated with a particular bank. ''Also, I can provide dumps with online access,'' he wrote. ''The price of such dumps is 5% of available credit.''
 Every day brings more. ''These things have a short shelf life,'' said Dan Larkin, the unit chief at the F.B.I.'s Internet Crime Complaint Center in West Virginia. ''The criminal value of a compromised credit card is very short term, so there's a constant need to keep backfilling their resources.''

A Full-Service Black Market
 Those buying fresh batches of account numbers may try to make purchases online, having goods delivered to a drop and then fencing them through online auctions. 
 More sophisticated thieves will seek out a vendor of encoding devices, and others who sell ''plastic,'' or blank credit cards, and ''algos,'' algorithms that are needed to properly encode the magnetic strip and produce a usable card. And ''cash out'' services can be arranged with those offering to take the encoded plastic to a cash machine and make daily withdrawals until the account is depleted. (The cash-out risk commands a premium -- often 50 percent or more of the total balance.) 
 Traders -- whether they deal in plastic, algos, cobs or other booty -- build reputations first by earning the right to advertise, and then, in a black-market version of eBay buyer feedback, augment their status by receiving published kudos from other members. No one is permitted to post product or service offers at most of these Web sites without first having their wares vetted by site administrators, or by those who have been selected as trusted ''reviewers.'' 
 At iaaca.com, for example, those wishing to sell cobs or cob services ''will be required to provide ten (10) change of addresses, to be distributed to two reviewers,'' who ''will test this service by either phone or Internet.'' New vendors of credit card numbers ''will be required to furnish 20 VALID dumps (5 Classics, 5 business, 5 platinums, 5 corporate; 50 percent Visa, 50 percent MasterCard),'' according to the site administrators. ''The testers will determine the quality, in a percentage of valid numbers.''
 Once the wares are vetted, a vendor might then pay a fee to peddle them on a site's message boards. Banner ads can also be purchased. 
 Contacts among deal makers almost always move off the boards and onto ICQ, the instant-messaging program of choice among cyberthieves because of its easy anonymity (no names, no registration, no e-mail required). Payments often change hands in relative anonymity (and with little regulation) by e-gold, an electronic currency that purports to be backed by gold bullion and issued by e-gold Ltd., a company incorporated on the island of Nevis in the Caribbean. (Secret Service agents have expressed skepticism over the gold backing.)
 Transactions might also be made in WMZ's, electronic monetary units equivalent to American dollars and issued by WebMoney Transfer, a company based in Moscow.
 Plenty of noncriminal entities use such services to move money, Secret Service analysts said -- although they added that the agency had conversations with some of the e-currency issuers to discuss ways to address the problem.

Thefts at Data Aggregators
 Mark Rasch, the former head of cyberinvestigations for the Justice Department and now the senior vice president of Solutionary, a computer security company, said the numbers taken in the CardSystems breach -- at least 200,000 are said to have been in stolen files -- are almost certain to end up in one of these trading posts. 
 CardSystems represented a vital hub through which millions of account numbers passed. ChoicePoint, a data aggregator, was another gold mine; it announced in February that thousands of records had been downloaded from its databases by thieves posing as legitimate business clients (no hacking required). 
 ''The pattern in the last six months is going after aggregators,'' Mr. Rasch said. ''It used to be you'd get a few numbers from a few merchants and aggregate them yourself -- a few numbers from a lot of people. But at some point they said, 'Wait a minute, there are other people who aggregate this stuff.''' 
 And, Mr. Rasch pointed out, it is nearly impossible to stop. For all the information that law enforcement and security experts can glean from sites like iaaca.com, ''there are whole marketplaces of bulletin board systems and chats that are invisible,'' he said. 
 Still, law enforcement has made inroads. In October, the Justice Department and the Secret Service announced the internationally coordinated arrest of 28 individuals in eight states and several countries, including Sweden, Britain, Poland, Belarus and Bulgaria. 
 Among those arrested were Andrew Mantovani of Scottsdale, Ariz., David Appleyard of Linwood, N.J., and Anatoly Tyukanov of Moscow. The Justice Department says they are the ringleaders of Shadowcrew.com, the largest English-language Web bazaar trading in everything from stolen credit card, debit card and bank account numbers to counterfeit drivers' licenses, passports and Social Security cards. 
 The investigation, called Operation Firewall, broke up a 4,000-member underground that, according to the Justice Department, bought and sold nearly two million credit card account numbers in two years and caused over $4 million in losses to merchants, banks and individuals. 
 But eight months later, the traders have adapted and resumed business. They are a bit more skittish now, said John Watters, the chief executive of iDefense, which generates cybercrime intelligence for government and financial industry clients. Operation Firewall did take out some of the ''low-hanging fruit,'' Mr. Watters said. But that has only caused the pricing models to become more refined, and the characters in this black-market economy to become more sophisticated.

A New Market for New Identities
 Mr. Watters said there was also a small but growing market for the type of raw consumer information that has been pilfered from ChoicePoint, LexisNexis and other general data aggregators.
 ''We've observed people paying for identities,'' Mr. Watters said, describing Web forms where criminals could tick off the fields they had to sell or wanted to buy: address, date of birth, Social Security number, driver's license number, mother's maiden name. And as the traders slip deeper underground -- or onto servers in regions with lax laws, overburdened or uninterested law enforcement and no real working relationship with American authorities -- the odds of pulling off another Operation Firewall get worse. 
 ''The next battle will be substantially harder,'' Mr. Watters said. ''It's getting harder for us to do our job.'' 
 Asked at a symposium on cybercrime late last month if law enforcement was losing the battle against cybercriminals, Brian Nagel, assistant director for investigations at the Secret Service, said no, according to published reports. 
 But another panel member, Jody Westby, the managing director of security and privacy practice at PricewaterhouseCoopers, disagreed, insisting that based on Federal Trade Commission statistics on identity and credit card theft, only about 5 percent of cybercriminals are ever caught. 
 In an interview, Ms. Westby offered an assessment no less bleak. ''We're not making an impact,'' she said. ''The criminals are too hard to track and trace, too hard to prosecute, and the information they steal is too easy to use.'' 
 At one Russian-language site over the weekend, a user called Lexus celebrated the CardSystems breach, saying that ''judgment day has come for the bourgeoisie.'' Another, Zer0, suggested on the site that the hacked numbers might represent new opportunities in the underground. 
 ''It is a good occasion for us,'' Zer0 said. ''Happy hunting.''

HEADLINE: Top Court Backs Empire Blue Cross's Shift to Profit-Making

BYLINE: By AL BAKER

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 20 

 BODY:
New York's highest court ruled on Monday in support of the state's plan to convert Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield into a profit-making company, which would supply the state with billions of dollars to help balance its budgets.
 While several lawmakers and Gov. George E. Pataki have been counting on a windfall from the deal to meet the state's growing health care needs, several fiscal watchdogs have repeatedly warned that using such nonrecurring revenues to pay operating expenses breaks a cardinal rule of public finance. The problem is, the money from the conversion will eventually run out, but the costs will continue, critics have noted. 
 Still, many in Albany hailed the 4-to-2 decision by the Court of Appeals as a bright bit of financial news, saying it would allow the proceeds of the conversion to be turned over to the state, a jackpot those on both sides of the debate estimated could be worth up to $4 billion in new revenues. The decision also answered, in the final hours of the legislative session, a big uncertainty looming over lawmakers' heads: how to pay for some core programs in the state's multibillion-dollar Health Care Reform Act, which finances programs like drug insurance for the elderly and coverage for low-income families.
 ''This was the big shark lurking in the tank that could have upset all of the plans for this year's budget and for H.C.R.A. refinancing,'' said Senator Eric T. Schneiderman, a Democrat from Manhattan.
 In upholding the conversion, the court found that the way the state fashioned the deal in 2002 was constitutional. The conversion proceeds were pledged to pay for a variety of health programs and for three years of raises for hospital and nursing home workers. 
 The court ruled that giving Empire the permission to go public did not prevent other companies from seeking to convert in the same way, contrary to arguments that the deal was tailored to benefit one company, Empire, and was therefore unconstitutional.
 The suit was brought in 2002, by Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports, as well as three individual Empire policyholders. The plaintiffs argued that the ''state government's taking of private, nonprofit charitable property,'' was unconstitutional, said Charles Bell, the programs director for Consumers Union. The lawsuit also claimed that the board of directors of Empire breached their fiduciary duty ''to ensure its assets are going to charity purposes,'' Mr. Bell said.
 But Judge Susan Phillips Read, writing for the majority, said the court concluded that the plaintiffs' arguments were ''legally insufficient.''
 ''Empire has traditionally functioned as both a financing device for hospitals and a means to make economical health care available to as many New Yorkers as possible,'' Judge Read wrote. ''The dedication of conversion assets to support public health programs and to recruit and retain health care workers is wholly consistent with these activities.''
 Mr. Bell said on Monday that ''we are reviewing our legal options,'' including considering whether to file an appeal with the United States Supreme Court. ''We're very disappointed in the ruling because it fails to protect the billions of dollars, over $3.5 billion dollars, now, of Empire's value, that we believe are nonprofit and charitable dollars that we believe do not belong to the State of New York.''
 The two dissenting judges said that further court proceedings would be necessary to determine the facts. 
 Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, called the decision a ''sweeping and stunning victory'' that put to rest any anxiety about the flow of conversion money from this deal or others. The state is hoping to tap another pot of money, as much as $2 billion, by converting the HIP Health Plan into a profit-making company. ''It was a time bomb waiting to go off,'' Mr. Raske said. 
 In its budget passed this year, the Legislature extended the Health Care Reform Act until June 30, 2007, though some appropriations to pay for it were subject to the court decision, said a spokesman for Senator Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate's Republican majority leader. In this fiscal year, which began on April 1, the state is counting on $1.8 billion from the conversion of Empire.
 ''This basically buys the state possibly several years on the labor contract that the Empire conversion was done to pay for,'' said Assemblyman Alexander B. Grannis, a Manhattan Democrat. But, he added in the next breath: ''It's still a one-shot.''

HEADLINE: Digging Deep For a Slice Of the Pie

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN

 BODY:
NOT to alarm New York City subway and bus riders, but a pizza shop around the corner from our Times Square office is charging $2.20 for a plain slice. At a Famous Famiglia parlor a few blocks north, the price is up to $2.25.
 This horrifying discovery left us no choice but to place an urgent phone call to Eric M. Bram. He confirmed our worst fears for the subways. 
''Are you going to get another fare increase?'' he said. ''I guess it's inevitable.''
 On this score, there is every reason to heed Mr. Bram, a Bronx-born patent lawyer who moved to Westchester some time ago.
 In 1980, he articulated what we have since come to call the Pizza Connection. He noted that, from the early 1960's, the price of a pizza slice -- we're talking here about a no-frills wedge of mozzarella and tomato sauce, unmarred by toppings -- matched the cost of a subway ride ''with uncanny precision.''
 At the time, a slice typically cost 60 cents. Thus did Mr. Bram conclude that the prevailing 50-cent subway and bus fare was doomed. He was right, of course.
 He had history on his side.
 In 1960, the fare was 15 cents. That was what a slice of pizza cost, too. By the early 70's, the fare had risen to 35 cents. So had pizza.
 Three years ago, with the fare at $1.50, we invoked the Bram rule, noting that pizza was typically selling for $1.75 in many neighborhoods and for as much $2 in Midtown. It seemed unlikely that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority could hold out for long. And it couldn't. A year later, the fare zoomed to $2, after nearly eight years without change -- a defiance of the Pizza Connection that obviously could not be sustained.
 So now that a slice goes for as much as $2.25, what are the long-term prospects for the $2 fare? Probably no better, we figure, than the odds that Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie will still be together by this time next year.
 Granted, pizza doesn't cost $2.25 everywhere in New York. A slice for $2, even for $1.75, is common in many neighborhoods. Still, the higher price has gained a foothold here.
 Granted, too, that the situation is more complex than three years ago. With the subway token gone and the MetroCard in command, the subwaymeisters can tinker more readily with what in this city qualifies as natural law. The transportation authority did exactly that this year when it left the $2 base fare intact but managed nonetheless to dip deeper into riders' pockets by raising the prices of monthly and weekly cards.
 That action dealt a body blow to the Pizza Connection. ''Who knows if the fundamentals of economics will hold?'' Mr. Bram asked.
 AS it is, the fare is beset by other pressures, some almost as serious as the price of a slice.
 Future budget deficits loom for the transportation authority. They could rise to $1.1 billion in 2010, the state comptroller said. Peter S. Kalikow, the authority's chairman, has said it was a mistake to go eight years without a change in the fare, only to then sock riders with a 33 percent increase. Smaller but more frequent increases make more sense, he said.
 His agency will also have to borrow billions to renovate subway stations and pay for other improvements. Borrowing inevitably means higher interest payments, adding to the pressure on the fare.
 Beyond that, the authority has assumed certain costs that some New Yorkers believe should be borne by others.
 An example is a commitment to spend $80 million to rebuild the Cortlandt Street station on the No. 1 line, wiped out when the World Trade Center collapsed in 2001. Why, some wonder, is the authority -- and by extension, the riding public -- paying for this instead of the federal government, out of funds intended for post-Sept. 11 recovery?
 ''If the station was there and it was destroyed, that's exactly what 9/11 money was intended to cover,'' said Gene Russianoff, the staff lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign.
 All in all, even without higher pizza prices, times are tough for subway and bus riders. It hardly helps that city and state subsidies for mass transit have shrunk over the years.
 Maybe the problem, though, is not the size of the aid but rather where it goes. What if the city and state were to reinterpret the Bram rule and, instead of subsidizing subways, offer pizza parlors millions to keep their prices stable?
 The way things are going, that may well be our best shot at stopping the fare from going up, and soon.

HEADLINE: Outsourced All the Way

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, June 20 

 BODY:
Philip Chigos and Mary Domenico are busy building a children's pajama business. They are refining patterns, picking fabrics and turning the basement of their two-bedroom apartment into an office.
 Then there is the critical step of finding the right seamstresses in China.
 Instead of looking for garment workers in this city, they plan to have their wares manufactured by low-cost workers overseas. In doing so, they've become micro-outsourcers, adopting a tactic of major American corporations, which are increasingly sending production work abroad. 
 A growing number of mom-and-pop operations, outsourcing experts say, are braving a host of potential complications and turning to places like Sri Lanka, China, Mexico and Eastern Europe to make clothes, jewelry, trinkets and even software programs.
 ''We'd love it to say 'made in the U.S.A.' and use American textiles and production,'' Mr. Chigos said of his product. But, he said, the cost of that would be 4 to 10 times what was planned. ''We didn't want to sell our pajamas for $120.''
 The ability of Mr. Chigos, 26, and Ms. Domenico, 25, to reach across borders has as much to do with technology as it does with the globalization of the labor market.
 Computers, the Internet and modern telecommunications already make it possible for start-ups to market their goods to customers anywhere in the country. That infrastructure also enables even the smallest entrepreneurs to find workers tens of thousands of miles away in countries they will never visit and in factories they will never inspect.
 They can communicate with those factories cheaply via e-mail and phone, transmit images and design specifications and track inventory.
 ''It's easier to find people out there on the other side, to monitor them and keep in touch with them,'' said Ashok Deo Bardhan, an economist at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, whose field is outsourcing.
 One result of easy access to cheap manufacturing, he said, is that more American entrepreneurs may be able to turn an idea into a product. The situation ''vastly increases the scope of inventors and designers in the West,'' Mr. Bardhan said.
 Just how much work American companies, big and small, send offshore is difficult to measure, and experts have differing views of the effect of outsourcing on economic growth and job loss. 
 But even as that debate simmers, many of the smallest entrepreneurs are quickly turning to low-cost labor abroad to get their businesses off the ground. Thousands of Web sites have sprung up recently hawking factories in places like Bursa, Turkey, to potential customers like Mr. Chigos. 
 Outsourcing is ''happening at every level, from manufacturing of steel to make cars to software to computer chips to a little lady who make scarves,'' said Ally Young, who researches outsourcing trends for Gartner, a market research firm. Any job can be sent overseas, she added, ''if it can be digitized and you don't need face-to-face interaction, like a haircut.''
 Even that constraint may be disappearing. Ben Trowbridge, a Dallas consultant to major American companies that hire offshore labor, said that he recently received a request from a psychologist who wanted to hire counselors in India to make follow-up phone calls to his patients.
 Offshoring for small entrepreneurs, however, can be rough. Taking advantage of cheap labor means having to navigate language and time-zone differences, complex import regulations and shipping fees and unanticipated problems like the Asian bird flu. And, of course, there are always nagging worries about workmanship and anxiety among some entrepreneurs that the factory they engaged may be a brutal sweatshop. 
 Beverly A. Lengquist, a real estate agent in Santa Cruz, Calif., ran into many of those problems when she hired a factory in Sri Lanka in 2004 to sew 8,000 decorative cloth covers for water bottles. 
 After encouragement from friends who liked her cute designs, Ms. Lengquist, 42, turned to the Internet to find a manufacturer. 
 She searched on Google for terms like ''overseas fulfillment'' and ''manufacturing'' and quickly found many prospective partners in Indonesia, Bali and Sri Lanka. She settled on a Sri Lankan company, she said, because it worked with big American textile firms and came highly recommended by an acquaintance with manufacturing experience. 
 She initially negotiated with the factory owner by e-mail and then met him when he was visiting New York; he promised that he could fill the order quickly. Ms. Lengquist, a horse owner, needed to have the 8,000 bottle holders (which she calls ''Bcozies'') to sell at the Kentucky Derby in May 2004. 
 But unexpected problems quickly arose. For instance, the holders were decorated with marabou feathers. But United States customs would not allow feathers originating in Asia to be imported because of the Avian flu. So Ms. Lengquist had to buy the feathers in the United States and ship them to Sri Lanka. 
 To pay her Sri Lankan manufacturer, she wired the company $13,000, an amount she thought covered shipping costs as well as manufacturing. Then the shipper demanded $4,000 more, which she ultimately paid, but that was not the only problem. When she opened the shipment of holders on her kitchen floor, she found that half of them were too small to fit around water bottles. 
 Frustrated by the problems, Ms. Lengquist has since decided to use a manufacturing company in Ohio instead. The Sri Lankan company could not be reached for comment. 
 ''The problem had to do with language and culture,'' Ms. Lengquist said. The manufacturer, she said, did try hard to accommodate her requests, but ''just didn't understand the water bottle concept.'' 
 She has sold nearly all the holders, which are priced from $10 to $20, through her Web site, bcozy.com, or through retailers. Demand remains strong. She said she recently received an order for 150,000, but she said she could not fulfill an order of that size and the purchaser -- whom she declined to name -- could not agree on a price.
 For some small entrepreneurs like Todd J. Collins, 32, the operator of Irealtymanager.com, a Web site that focuses on property management, outsourcing has been relatively easy. In 2001, Mr. Collins, who is based in Washington, came up with an idea to sell software that would help apartment owners manage their properties.
 He turned to Macrotech, a company in Bridgeport, Conn., that hires computer scientists and engineers in Bucharest, Romania, and in Pune, India, a city near Mumbai. 
 The head of the Bucharest office, Alex Anitei, 27, said that for three years he had worked for many entrepreneurs like Mr. Collins, doing piecemeal software work, including projects as small as building online address books. 
 E-mail, instant messaging and Internet-based phone services, Mr. Anitei said, allow him to stay in constant contact with clients on other continents. He said he and his staff of six programmers, who work in a three-room apartment in Bucharest, charge hourly rates of $15 to $25 -- one-third to one-15th the cost of American software counterparts. 
 Still, Manish Chowdhary, the president of Macrotech, said the use of offshore labor was not always efficient for the smallest businesses. The big cost savings from outsourcing, he said, are realized over time and by placing large manufacturing orders; if the project is very small, the time and expense of finding an overseas contractor and setting up communications simply may not be justifiable. 
 Mr. Chigos and Ms. Domenico, though, see foreign workers as crucial to their nascent enterprise. Without them, they said, they would not be able to sell their pajamas for less than $50. 
 Mr. Chigos, a former commercial real estate agent, found information on the Internet about a trade show for overseas manufacturers that took place in Las Vegas in February. At that conference, he found eight prospective manufacturers, seven in China and one in Mexico, that could make the pajamas designed by Ms. Domenico, a 2001 graduate of the Rhode Island School of Design.
 He and Ms. Domenico have sent designs to six of the companies, including the Suqian Pajama Clothes-making Company and the China Worldbest Group Company, and are waiting to receive samples and final price quotes.
 Ms. Domenico said she was not sure of the location of Suqian City, which is in Jiangsu Province. ''I feel like I'm supposed to know that,'' she said, laughing.
 Once the business is up and running, they hope to hire a freight management company in Richmond, Calif., to receive the shipments, check the merchandise's quality, then send it along to customers. Their business is a virtual one; they have no manufacturing, storefront or warehouse. They plan to market the clothes on the Internet and through boutique retailers. 
 ''With the technology available today, we'll never touch the product,'' Mr. Chigos said. 
 Both, however, are concerned about the pitfalls of dealing with a far-flung manufacturer. In her youth, Ms. Domenico did volunteer work for Amnesty International, and she worries that the couple may wind up working with a sweatshop. ''It's my biggest fear,'' she said.
 ''People in the U.S. won't work for 50 cents an hour,'' Mr. Chigos countered. ''We also recognize that there are people around the world who are happy to work for 50 cents.''

HEADLINE: When the Allowance Falls Short

BYLINE: By MELINDA LIGOS

 BODY:
For Geoff Shank and his employees at the United States Marshals Service, scouring the world to track down dangerous fugitives can be a tough job. But Mr. Shank's team is finding that sometimes, nailing a hotel room that fits into the government's measly budget is an even tougher job.
 Mr. Shank, who is the chief inspector of the agency's Great Lakes Regional Task Force, said he was ''constantly'' fielding emergency calls from his division's 103 task force inspectors and officers, asking his permission to go over the allocated government per diem for hotel rooms. 
 ''There are certain cities where it's near impossible to get a room'' at the rates determined for government workers by the General Services Administration, according to Mr. Shank. ''Pretty much any big city is a real problem.''
 Mr. Shank recalls one officer who went to Baltimore recently and found that with an Orioles baseball game that weekend, ''all the hotel rates were jacked up.'' Mr. Shank granted the agent permission to book a more expensive room. 
 On another recent trip, to Miami, he and several officers had to get superiors to approve a hotel room that cost 50 percent more than they were supposed to spend. 
 Mr. Shank and other government workers are finding that the General Services Administration's travel per diems are not keeping pace with rising hotel room rates. The government typically sets such rates annually -- it adjusted rates in 17 locations in May by an average of $6 but did not increase rates for any large cities except Seattle, according to Kevin Maher, vice president for government affairs at the American Hotel and Lodging Association. Under the current rates, a traveler on government business is allotted $91 a day for domestic travel -- $60 for a hotel room and $31 for meals and incidentals, according to the G.S.A.
 About 420 designated cities have allowances that are higher than the standard per diem. For example, the per diem for Manhattan in the summer is $200 for a hotel room and $51 for meals and incidentals; in the fall, the rate drops to $177 a night for lodging and $51 for meals and incidentals. In Buffalo, the per diem is $81 for a hotel room and $43 for meals and incidentals. ''When these rates were set, the lodging industry wasn't doing as well as it is now,'' Mr. Maher said.
 While government workers historically have had difficulty sticking to the per diems in some cities, it had been less of a problem in the recent years, when hotel room rates decreased in major cities, according to Bjorn Hanson, a hospitality consultant and analyst for PricewaterhouseCoopers in New York.
 But that is all changing quickly. This year, PricewaterhouseCoopers is forecasting a 4.3 percent increase in hotel room rates nationwide. But that number is even larger in the biggest cities like New York, where room rates may increase before year's end by 9 percent to 10 percent, according to Mr. Hanson.
 Los Angeles, Boston, Orlando and San Francisco are among the other cities experiencing increases in room rates that are larger than average, Mr. Hanson said. A result is that ''government workers who had become accustomed to staying in Hiltons or Marriotts during the past few years are back at the lower-tier hotels,'' he said.
 That has sometimes been the case for Mr. Shank and his employees, who find themselves having to seek special approval to go over the government per diem on about 40 percent of trips, he said. While he says his employees are not fussy, it would be inappropriate for them to stay in fleabag motels.
 ''My guys are busting their butts all day long, so they need to get a good night's sleep,'' he said. They also need rooms with secure doors and a safe where they can stow their badges and guns.
 Fortunately, Mr. Shank said, he and his employees have persuaded desk clerks at some major hotel chains to lower the rate when they flash their badges. ''Particularly after 9/11, some people have been willing to help us out,'' he said.
 Not all government workers have been so lucky. Lisa Kaplan, a senior associate at the Capital Consulting Corporation in Rockville, Md., that is contracted to plan government meetings, said that recently she had been ''shut out'' from hotels that previously had been more than happy to accommodate government groups.
 Ms. Kaplan cited one hotel in Bethesda, Md., that had booked a government group four times a year for several years. But this February, when Ms. Kaplan called the hotel, which is part of a major chain, to book the group's meetings for 2006, she got the cold shoulder. ''They told me to call back in June,'' she said.
 Ms. Kaplan called back this month, only to be told to check back in the fall. ''They haven't gotten any other business for those dates yet, but they want to see if something better comes along,'' she said. Something better, according to Ms. Kaplan's contact, would be a corporate group that could exceed the rate of $153 a night that government workers would be forced to stick to.
 ''It's annoying, because we have a history with this hotel,'' Ms. Kaplan said. ''I haven't had this much trouble since the dot-commers were around in the late 1990s,'' she said, referring to the last time hotel rates far outpaced the per diem rates in many cities. 
 There could be hope on the horizon for government workers struggling to get a good night's sleep in America's larger cities. According to Brian Ferguson, vice president for marketing and strategy at Smith Travel Research in Hendersonville, Tenn., the G.S.A. is slowly changing the way it calculates per diem rates. About three years ago, for example, it began relying on market data from Smith Travel to calculate the new rates. Previously, it used surveys of random hotels -- and complaints from government workers -- to set the rates.
 And this year for the first time, Mr. Ferguson said, the G.S.A. will consider both luxury and economy hotels in its calculations, which will help the agency come up with a rate that better reflects properties in certain locations. Still, the system is not perfect, Mr. Ferguson conceded. ''The number is still set using historical data, so there's going to be a lag,'' he said. The G.S.A.'s next adjustment will come at the end of August.

HEADLINE: Jail Terms For 2 at Top Of Adelphia

BYLINE: By ROBEN FARZAD

 BODY:
John J. Rigas, who built the Adelphia Communications Corporation into the country's sixth-largest cable company, was sentenced to 15 years in prison yesterday for looting hundreds of millions of dollars from the company's coffers and concealing its true debt load from investors. 
 Timothy J. Rigas, Mr. Rigas's 49-year-old son and Adelphia's former chief financial officer, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his part in the fraud. 
 Addressing the elder Mr. Rigas, Judge Leonard B. Sand of Federal District Court in Manhattan, said, ''Even to this moment, you say you did nothing wrong; that's what is unacceptable.'' 
 He further said to Mr. Rigas's lawyers: ''If your effort is at this point to convince me that there was not blatant fraud, you're going to have a very hard sell.''
 Each man potentially faced up to three decades in prison just for bank fraud, the most serious in a list of convictions that also included securities fraud and conspiracy. The sentencing is one of the largest in a corporate crime case since the Supreme Court ruled last January that judges did not have to adhere to federal guidelines when issuing sentences.
 The elder Mr. Rigas spoke hoarsely and hunched over as he pleaded for leniency, and his family wept quietly as he was sentenced. ''To my stockholders, I apologize -- this whole thing has happened to all of us,'' he said. ''There are many things that I wish I had done differently.''
 His son, in his speech asking for leniency, said, ''Our intentions were good; the results were not so'' -- to which Judge Sand replied, ''I think your intentions were to deceive the market.'' 
 The judge ordered the two men to surrender on Sept. 19 to begin their prison terms. 
 The judge said the elder Mr. Rigas's term was shorter because he is 80 and is suffering from bladder cancer and a heart ailment. Should he become terminally ill, the sentence may be revised, Judge Sand said.
 Robert Mintz, a partner at the McCarter & English law firm and former assistant United States attorney for the District of New Jersey, said of the men's prison terms: ''It was not that long ago that sentencings of this length were reserved for drug dealers and violent criminals. These sentencings send the message that those days are over.''
 The Rigas verdict, reached last July, represented a major victory for federal prosecutors who were under pressure to respond to a wave of malfeasance that seemed to overtake corporate America.
 The Rigases are among a growing group of top executives who have gone to trial over accounting fraud at their companies. Last year, Martin Grass, the former chief executive of the Rite Aid Corporation, received an eight-year prison sentence and was fined $500,000 for his part in the company's accounting fraud.
 And Friday, L. Dennis Kozlowski was convicted of stealing from Tyco International while he was the company's chief executive. Bernard J. Ebbers will face sentencing on July 13 for his role in the $11 billion accounting fraud at WorldCom, the telecommunications company. 
 Jurors are still deliberating in the case of Richard M. Scrushy, the former chief executive of HealthSouth, who is accused of masterminding a $2.7 billion accounting fraud. 
 Jesse Choper, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, cautioned that the Rigas sentence does not necessarily mean that future sentencings will be as severe. ''The sentence in each case turns on many facts,'' he said. ''Therefore, you can't look at this and consider it to tell you an awful lot on the next securities law conviction."
 In the Adelphia case, the company was forced into bankruptcy three years ago when the Rigases' dealings and other off-balance-sheet obligations came to light. It has since sold itself to Time Warner and Comcast, the two largest cable television companies in the country.
 ''In terms of harm caused,'' argued prosecutors, according to court papers, ''the defendants' criminal conduct, motivated by greed and the desire to retain their power and control over Adelphia, stands among the most serious economic crimes.''
 The Rigas defense team pleaded for leniency, citing the family's community activism and philanthropy in Adelphia's former rural Pennsylvania headquarters, as well as John Rigas's delicate health. The elder Rigas's lawyers were seeking home detention or probation. Timothy Rigas's defense lawyers, meanwhile, petitioned for a maximum sentence of six months. 
 The judge was largely unsympathetic. ''I don't agree that a slap on the wrist sends the appropriate message,'' he said.
 Peter Fleming, the lead defense lawyer for John Rigas, dejectedly smoking a cigarette outside the courthouse, said: ''It's a very stiff sentence. We're living in hard times.''
 Others were not as surprised. ''Whenever you have a public company and you have a securities fraud case, based on the number of shares and amount of loss, you're almost guaranteed to come up with a number in excess of 15 years,'' said Kirby Behre, a partner at the Paul Hastings law firm in Washington and a former federal prosecutor.
 During the trial, the government illustrated what it argued was a deliberately confusing cash management system employed by the Rigas family to disburse $2.3 billion in Adelphia funds for their own purposes. 
 Prosecutors further drove home that portrayal by detailing a laundry list of luxury purchases that they said the Rigases financed with those proceeds, including the air shipment of Christmas trees, 17 company cars and $26 million worth of timberland that the elder Rigas acquired adjacent to his home in Coudersport, the tiny town in north central Pennsylvania that was Adelphia's headquarters until it sought bankruptcy protection. 
 Sentencing had been delayed repeatedly, owing mainly to the completion of negotiations with Adelphia investors who were seeking restitution after losing money in the company's collapse. 
 In April, Adelphia agreed to contribute $715 million to a government fund to compensate investors, one of the largest such settlements to date. The deal involved the Rigases' forfeiting $1.5 billion in assets to Adelphia.
 One of John Rigas's other sons, Michael, a former executive vice president, was acquitted of conspiracy and wire fraud charges, but faces a second trial in October for securities and bank fraud counts. Michael C. Mulcahey, Adelphia's former director of internal reporting, was tried and acquitted of all charges he faced.
 Judge Sand referred to what he perceived as an emerging father-son split during the case. The judge said that the moment of the trial that most stuck in his mind was when Timothy Rigas said: ''I cannot control my father.'' 
 Upon leaving the courtroom, John and Timothy Rigas diverged to opposite sides of the hallway -- the son huddling with his lawyers on one end while the father, looking overwhelmed, congregated with family on the other. ''You did a very nice speech up there,'' said an elderly friend, hugging John Rigas.

HEADLINE: Shares Retreat as Crude Oil Tops $59, Setting a Record

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Stocks ended slightly lower yesterday as oil prices hit a record, stirring concerns that corporate profits and consumer spending may weaken. Declines in shares of the aircraft maker Boeing and the online auction site eBay also weighed on the market.
 Crude oil for July delivery ended 90 cents higher, at $59.37 in New York. OPEC officials said the price jump was leading them to consider lifting supply quotas again. 
 Rising oil prices are generally negative for stocks, as they increase companies' costs, hurt profits and curb consumer spending.
 The Dow Jones industrial average was down 13.96 points, or 0.13 percent, to 10,609.11. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 0.86 point, or 0.07 percent, to 1,216.10. The Nasdaq composite index fell 1.98 points, or 0.09 percent, to 2,088.13. The Dow ended a seven-session streak of gains, while both Nasdaq and the S.&P. closed lower for the first time in five consecutive days.
 ''The fact that oil prices are persistently staying in the mid-50's to upper-50's is worrying investors because higher gasoline prices lead to lower consumer spending," said Giri Cherukuri, the head trader at OakBrook Investments.
 James D. Awad, the chairman of Awad Asset Management, said: ''The market was knocked off its balance by oil prices, and on top of that you had a Federal Reserve bank official say that they are not finished raising rates combined with a greater-than-expected decline in the leading indicators.''
 Jeffrey M. Lacker, the president of the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank, said the Federal Reserve's measured pace of increasing rates in increments of quarter percentage points is still appropriate, adding that it would be premature to declare the increases near an end.
 Treasury security prices slipped on suggestions that more Federal Reserve interest rate increases could be ahead. Losses were pared when crude oil futures in New York surged, stirring up fresh worries about an impediment to economic growth from high energy costs. By late in the day, the price of the benchmark 10-year note fell 9/32, to 100 5/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.11 percent, from 4.07 percent on Friday. 
 Earlier in the day, a major gauge on the future direction of the United States economy -- the index of leading economic indicators -- dropped a bigger-than-expected 0.5 percent last month, resuming a slide that began in January after a standstill in April.
 Boeing, a component of the blue-chip Dow average, fell 95 cents, or 1.5, percent, to $63.67 after Air Canada, a unit of ACE Aviation Holdings, said it canceled a $6 billion order from the company.
 EBay shares fell 81 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $37.24 on the Nasdaq on concerns that Google may offer an online payment service to compete with PayPal from eBay.
 Shares of Cablevision Systems rose $5.13, or 19.1 percent, to close at $32 after the Dolan family, which owns 71 percent of the company's voting shares, made a $7.9 billion bid to take the company private.
 On the New York Stock Exchange, 1.28 billion shares changed hands, below the 1.46 billion daily average for last year. On Nasdaq, about 1.53 billion shares traded -- below the 1.81 billion daily average last year.
 Here are the results of yesterday's auction of three- and six-month Treasury bills:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Price	99.250	98.394	High Rate	2.965	3.175	Investment Rate	3.029	3,272	Low Rate	2.940	3.130	Median Rate	2.960	3.160	Total applied for	$44,281,016	$35,281,970	Accepted	$23,947,095	$19,850,945	Noncompetitive	$1,602,709	$1,055,564	
Both issues are dated June 23, 2005. The three-month bills mature on Sept. 23, 2005 and the six-month bills mature on Dec. 22, 2005.

HEADLINE: The Adams Principle

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY. 
E-mail:tierney@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The work ethic is alive and well among America's retirees, or at least the ones who bombarded me with letters after I suggested raising the retirement age for Social Security. They said they would be glad to keep working if I could find them a job.
 In theory, this shouldn't be a problem because employers ought to be clamoring for workers as baby boomers hit retirement age and the pool of younger workers shrinks. In reality, though, older workers face discrimination. While some companies are recruiting them, many employers are still leery, partly because of irrational prejudice against the old, but also because of perverse incentives in current policies. 
 Some of the blame lies with the federal government, which has officially outlawed age discrimination while at the same time makes it inevitable. The antidiscrimination law itself is a reason not to hire an older worker. Given a choice between two equally qualified candidates, whom would you hire, a 35-year-old who could be quickly demoted or fired if he turns out to be incompetent, or a 65-year-old who could sue you for age discrimination?
 A more immediate reason not to hire the 65-year-old is that he would be more expensive to add to the company health plan. If federal policy were changed to allow older full-time workers to rely primarily on Medicare instead of on their employer, they'd have a much better shot at jobs.
 But it's not enough just to change laws. We need to rethink the old assumption that employees keep getting raises throughout their careers. 
 This seniority system was built on what economists call an implicit contract with workers: we'll pay you less than you're really worth when you're young, but stick with us and we'll make it up to you by paying you more than you're worth later in your career. Employers kept giving raises to workers even after their productivity started to decline, which typically occurs around age 50, says the economist Vegard Skirbekk (whose finding I shouldn't be publicizing now that I'm 52).
 The system made economic sense when employers and employees stuck by the contract. Now they each feel free to abandon the other, but the old assumptions linger and interfere with older workers' attempts to find comparable jobs after they have been downsized. 
 Some workers refuse to consider a lesser job, and even if they're willing to take a cut in pay and status, employers fear they'll be frustrated and find the new job beneath them. So these workers are retiring earlier even though they're living longer, forcing younger people to work harder to support them.
 It would be fairer to redistribute some of this free time so that young people, like harried parents, could enjoy it instead of waiting to get it all as one lump sum. As Ron Lee, a demographer at the University of California, Berkeley, asks, ''Why not restructure our life cycles so that we take more leisure when we most need it, earlier on, and less later in life?''
 That advice isn't practical for some blue-collar workers who aren't strong enough to keep doing their jobs into their 60's. But they're becoming a smaller and smaller minority -- fewer than 10 percent of jobs are physically demanding, according to the economist Eugene Steuerle -- and they could still quit early under a disability program even if the retirement age were raised. 
 Most workers could keep going longer if they and employers reconsidered the old assumption about a career trajectory. They could learn from the example of John Quincy Adams, who was elected to Congress after serving as president. He dismissed objections that the new job was beneath him, and voters didn't discriminate against him for being overqualified. 
 Adams started his new career at age 63, just about when the typical American man now retires. He wasn't especially spry, once calling his body ''a weak, frail, decayed tenement battered by the winds and broken in on by the storm.'' Yet he stayed on the job until his death at age 80. 
 He accomplished so much in those years that he is remembered as a better congressman than president. You could call him an inverse example of the Peter Principle, someone who succeeded by being demoted below his level of incompetence.
 But I prefer to draw a different lesson. Call it the Adams Principle for employees and employers: if the president can flourish after a demotion, so can anyone else.

HEADLINE: Leading Indicators Fell in May; Decline Exceeded Expectations

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
A closely watched gauge of future business activity fell more than expected in May, indicating slower economic growth may lie ahead this year, a private research group said yesterday. 
 The group, the Conference Board in New York, reported that its composite index of leading indicators fell 0.5 percent last month, to 114.1. The decline was more than the 0.2 percent drop that analysts had expected. 
 The May decline follows a revised unchanged level in April and a 0.6 percent decline in March. 
 Ken Goldstein, the board's labor economist, said in a statement that the indicators suggested ''slower growth setting in during the third quarter.'' But he added that this is ''not just a domestic phenomenon.'' He noted that the Conference Board monitors the leading economic indexes in eight countries and that six of them have showed declines or slower growth. 
 Mark Vitner, senior economist at the Wachovia Corporation in Charlotte, N.C., said that he was not worried about the decline, adding, ''This is a sign of a slower economy, but not anything more serious than that.'' 
 Mr. Vitner noted that a good part of the weakening in the leading indicators over the last few months came from the decline in financial components of the index, which include an interest rate comparison and real money supply, and that was a result of rising interest rates. 
 The Conference Board reported yesterday that only one of the 10 components of the leading index, stock prices, increased in May. The other components that dragged down the index included building permits, vendors' performances, the index of consumer expectations, manufacturers' new orders for nonmilitary capital goods, consumer goods and materials and average weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance. 
 The index of coincident indicators, which measures the current economy, rose 0.2 percent in May, to 119.7. The index of lagging indicators, which looks back to the last six months, increased 0.3 percent, to 99.8.

HEADLINE: Judge Won't Bar Spitzer From Seeking Bank Loan Data 

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY

 BODY:
A federal judge refused a request yesterday from a group of banks to block the New York State attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, from seeking further data from the banks about mortgages to lower-income borrowers. But the judge said he might reconsider if Mr. Spitzer sends subpoenas to the banks. 
 ''I'm just telling you, if a subpoena's issued, then things change,'' said Judge Sidney Stein, of Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York. 
 The Clearing House Association, which represented the banks, argued at the hearing that they are regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the federal banking regulator, and not the New York attorney general's office. The Office of the Comptroller, which was also represented at the hearing, filed its own lawsuit last week seeking to bar Mr. Spitzer from further examining the banks' data. 
 Dietrich L. Snell, the deputy attorney general, said after the hearing that the attorney general's office would continue with its investigation. Mr. Spitzer's office began an investigation in April into whether the banks have discriminated against minority and other vulnerable borrowers by charging high interest rates. 
 ''There is no injunction,'' Mr. Snell said. ''There is no restraint on what the attorney general is allowed to do. The judge simply did not buy their argument.''
 The Clearing House Association said it sought the temporary injunction while the court decided whether the regulation of the banks falls under federal or state jurisdiction. The association represents eight banks, although only four of them -- HSBC, J.P. Morgan, Wells Fargo and Citigroup -- have been contacted by Mr. Spitzer's office. Citigroup, though a member of the association, is not part of the lawsuit against Mr. Spitzer and has said that it was cooperating with the attorney general.
 A spokesman for the association said the organization was pleased with the hearing's outcome. 
 ''The judge made it clear that the office of the attorney general should not take any further action at this time,'' said Greg Berardi, a spokesman for the association.
 Judge Stein requested that the attorney general's office file its opinion on whether the association's suit should be combined with the Office of the Comptroller's suit.
 The lawyer representing the association said the group supports consolidating the cases. 
 The judge said he would let both sides know within a few days if the cases would be consolidated and if he would be handling it.

DEPRESSED DOMESTIC FARES -- Despite small, incremental fare increases imposed half a dozen times so far this year by major domestic carriers, the average domestic one-way air fare paid during the first quarter of 2005 was $202, which is 13 percent lower than the $234 average in the period last year, according to the American Express Business Travel Monitor. The survey, which reflects fares paid by clients of American Express Business Travel, a corporate travel management company, encompasses first-class, unrestricted coach and discount coach tickets. American Express said that fares were depressed because of continuing competitive rate cuts on many routes, as well as aggressive corporate negotiating on fares. The recent rounds of fare increases appear to be having an effect, though. In April, the average domestic one-way fare was $210, up $8 from the first-quarter average, American Express said. By comparison, for all of 2000, the average domestic one-way fare was $259. International fares are going up, meanwhile. On 160 monitored routes, the average fare rose 4 percent in the first quarter of 2005, largely reflecting strong demand for business-class and first-class travel.

WANTED: HIGH-SPEED INTERNET -- Hotel managers say that business travelers overwhelmingly want high-speed Internet access -- and do not want to be charged extra for it. That's according to the annual Hotel Pulse survey in Business Travel Executive, a magazine for corporate travel managers. More than three-quarters of hotel managers surveyed said that high-speed Internet access was ''the most frequently requested value-added amenity'' to be included in room rates. The high-speed Internet appears to be edging out fitness clubs in the opinion of business travelers, with 18 percent of hotel managers citing clubs as the most requested amenity, compared with 53 percent last year.

ROOMIER REGIONAL JETS -- Responding to customer dissatisfaction with cramped, one-class regional jets, United Airlines introduced the new 70-seat Bombardier CRJ-700 and Embraer -170 regional jets, which offer United First and Economy Plus seating, to six markets flown by its United Express subsidiary. The new planes replace 50-seat regional jets. They are being flown on six United Express markets with flights into United hub airports at Chicago O'Hare International Airport and Washington Dulles International Airport. ''Customer feedback on this aircraft has been very positive, and our passengers appreciate the additional seat comfort and space,'' Sean Donohue, United's vice president for United Express and Ted, the company's low-cost airline, said in a statement. Regional jets now account for one out of every four flights in the United States.

FLIGHTS TO CHINA INCREASE -- Singapore Airlines has added a third daily flight between Singapore and Beijing as regional business travel demand for service to China grows in Asia Continental Airlines said last week that it became the first domestic commercial airline to start service to mainland China in 20 years when it began daily nonstop flights between Newark and Beijing British Airways began five-day-a-week service between London and Shanghai. ''I've been a regular visitor to Shanghai during the last decade and know just how the economy is booming. We want to be part of its growth,'' said Martin Broughton, chairman of the airline. The Shanghai service is British Airways' first new long-haul route since late 2002 Boeing says the Asia-Pacific region, dominated by China, will account for 36 percent of the 25,700 new aircraft, worth $2.1 trillion, that it projects will be ordered in the next 20 years.

ON-DEMAND IN-FLIGHT ENTERTAINMENT -- Air Canada said it was installing new Thales in-flight entertainment systems offering on-demand video and audio on its entire fleet of 241 planes, including new CRJ-705 and Embraer 175 and 190 jets. That will be the first time an all-digital on-demand in-flight entertainment system will be available on the new jets from Bombardier and Embraer, which are regarded as more comfortable successors to regional jets.

HEADLINE: Rice Urges Egyptians and Saudis to Democratize

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN; Mona el-Naggar contributed reporting from Cairo for this article.

DATELINE: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, Tuesday, June 21 

 BODY:
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, delivering a challenge to the United States' closest allies in the Arab world, called on Egypt and Saudi Arabia on Monday to embrace democracy by holding fair elections, releasing political prisoners and allowing free expression and rights for women.
 ''For 60 years, my country, the United States, pursued stability at the expense of democracy in this region here in the Middle East, and we achieved neither,'' Ms. Rice declared at the American University in Cairo. ''Now we are taking a different course. We are supporting the democratic aspirations of all people.'' 
 Praising President Hosni Mubarak for taking some ''encouraging'' first steps toward democracy, she said Egypt's elections ''must meet objective standards that define every free election,'' including freedom of assembly, speech and press.
 As for Saudi Arabia, where Ms. Rice flew after speaking in Egypt, she said that ''brave citizens are demanding accountability from their government'' and that ''many people pay an unfair price for exercising their basic rights.''
 She praised ''some first steps toward openness'' in the holding of municipal elections. But she condemned depriving women of the right to vote and the arrests of some dissidents.
 Ms. Rice's appeal, some of the toughest talk in the Arab world from a secretary of state, drew a mixed reaction, including criticism from Egyptian opposition groups demanding an even harder line. On the other hand, the Egyptian foreign minister, dismissing her comments, said Egypt's planned elections were already going to be free and fair.
 Some of the 600 listeners at the university complained that her call for freedom was undercut by American indifference to Israeli ''war crimes,'' mistreatment of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and Abu Ghraib and the continuing violence in Iraq.
 The criticism was similar to what erupted last month after Laura Bush praised Mr. Mubarak for taking a ''bold step'' in planning multiparty elections, even as protesters were being arrested and opposition groups complained about election requirements barring independent candidates.
 ''We were shocked at the statements made,'' Hany Enan, one of the founders of an Egyptian movement demanding that Mr. Mubarak step down, said of Ms. Rice's remarks. She added, ''I don't think the content of her remarks met the expectations of the people or the opposition.''
 Officials traveling with Ms. Rice said they were prepared for such criticism. ''Most of the region's leaders won't like what they hear, and most people will resent it,'' one American official said on the condition of anonymity because he did not want to prejudge Arab reaction. ''But in the long run, her speech will make people think about the problem.''
 The reaction illustrated the quandary that the Bush administration faced in navigating the demands for sweeping changes and a desire not to offend close allies or to apply separate benchmarks to different countries, depending on their status as friends.
 Ms. Rice criticized Egypt and Saudi Arabia for intimidating or locking up protesters, for example. She also met with Ayman Nour, a Parliament member whose arrest this year prompted the secretary to cancel a visit to Egypt. But she did not meet with leaders of the outlawed Islamist organization known as the Muslim Brotherhood, though it is probably the most popular opposition group.
 ''Egypt has its laws, it has its rule of law, and I'll respect that,'' Ms. Rice said, explaining the decision not to meet with the Brotherhood. 
 In her speech, she assailed Syria as a police state, and then Iran, where the election for president on Friday got no praise even though it has been more competitive than Egypt's is likely to be. ''The appearance of elections does not mask the organized cruelty of Iran's theocratic state,'' she said.
 Her criticism of Egypt, by contrast, came in a conciliatory tone, accompanied by reminders that the United States has its own history of slavery and racism. ''The United States has no cause for false pride, and we have every reason for humility,'' she added.
 In Riyadh, her remarks in Cairo received a curt reaction from Prince Saud al-Faisal, the Saudi foreign minister, who dismissed her appeal for the release of the dissidents. ''They have broken the law,'' Prince Saud said at a post-midnight news conference with Ms. Rice, adding that Saudi Arabia would use its own judgment of what changes were best. 
 Ms. Rice's speech had been billed in advance as a bold change for the United States. ''This is a great region of the world, the cradle of civilization,'' she implored her audience. Noting that the entire region of 22 countries had a collective economy the size of Spain's, she added:
 ''How can that be the case? It certainly isn't anything about the intelligence of the Arab people. It certainly isn't anything about their aspirations. It's about the absence of freedom and the absence of liberty.''
 Even critics of the American administration say the increasing calls by President Bush for democracy have helped inspire the Egyptian movement known as Kifaya, or Enough, which calls for Mr. Mubarak to step down. He has served since 1981 without ever being challenged in an election.
 Under pressure, Mr. Mubarak in February announced the first Egyptian election for president in which candidates will be able to run, but the National Assembly dominated by his National Democratic Party has been moving toward erecting an array of barriers against candidates outside its influence.
 When Ms. Rice raised those problems at a news conference with the Egyptian foreign minister, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, she got what appeared to be an airy rebuff.
 ''Who would object to fair, transparent elections?'' Mr. Gheit said, turning to the secretary. ''Everybody wants fair, transparent elections. And it will be so, I assure you.''
 In another awkward exchange, Mr. Gheit reminded Ms. Rice that he had told her earlier that without ''a settlement for the Palestinian problem,'' little could be done. ''That is crucial!'' he added.
 Ms. Rice, who traveled to Egypt from Jordan and Israel, where she had sought to coax the Israelis and Palestinians toward a solution, retorted with a smile, ''That's what we're working on.''

HEADLINE: Iraq Strategy Will Work, Bush Tells Europeans

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 20 

 BODY:
President Bush, opening a two-week effort to defend his Iraq policy, told visiting European leaders on Monday that his strategy for ending the insurgency and stabilizing the country ''is going to work.''
 Mr. Bush's comments came as opinion polls show eroding public confidence of his handling of Iraq, and as fissures are developing in his own party over setting a timetable for American withdrawal. Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, who is considered a possible Republican candidate for president in 2008, said in an interview in the current issue of U.S. News & World Report that the administration's assessments of Iraq were ''disconnected from reality,'' adding that ''the reality is that we are losing in Iraq.'' 
 With similar if less blunt statements beginning to surface from other Republicans, the White House is preparing to have Mr. Bush speak at length about the conflict, first when Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari of Iraq visits the White House on Friday. He will speak again next week, on the first anniversary of the transfer of power to the new Iraqi government.
 So far Mr. Bush's stay-the-course message has not diverged from what he has said for more than a year. But his tone was different on Monday, as he acknowledged that the going was ''tough'' and he dodged a question about whether he agreed with Vice President Dick Cheney's recent assessment that the insurgency is in ''its last throes.'' Several White House officials, when speaking behind the veil of anonymity, said they believed that Mr. Cheney was overly optimistic.
 On Monday, Mr. Bush was cautious, saying only, ''We're making progress toward the goal, which is, on the one hand, a political process moving forward in Iraq and, on the other hand, the Iraqis capable of defending themselves.'' He put no timetable on how long those processes would take. But he added that he understood ''how dangerous it is there'' and twice mentioned how the issue followed him everywhere, saying, ''I think about Iraq every day, every single day.''
 Mr. Bush also defended the American treatment of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, without directly addressing calls to close the detention center there. ''I understand those of us who espouse freedom have an obligation, and those who espouse human rights have an obligation, to live up to those words, and I believe we are in Guantanamo,'' he said in response to a question by a European reporter. He invited European and American reporters to visit the detention center themselves.
 Mr. Bush's comments came in a short East Room news conference after the annual summit meeting of the European Union leaders. He was standing with Luxembourg's prime minister, Jean-Claude Juncker, who is president of the European Union, and with the president of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso.
 In many ways, the dynamic was the opposite of that at such meetings two years ago. Then, Europe was deeply divided over Iraq and seemed perfectly willing to make its differences with Washington clear. But Mr. Juncker and Mr. Barroso arrived amid one of the biggest crises of confidence to affect Europe in years, after decisive no votes in France and the Netherlands on the European constitution and a divisive battle on Friday over a budget for the European Union. 
 One result was a radically different tone: Mr. Juncker spent much of his time reassuring Mr. Bush and his aides that the fractious arguments in Europe would not undercut the relationship with the United States or harm progress on a series of trade issues.
 ''We made clear in our frank and open and friendly talks with the president that the European Union is not at its knees, but that the European Union is playing the role it has on the international scene,'' he said.
 On Monday, Mr. Bush seemed to view his role as one of bucking up his visitors. ''The United States continues to support a strong European Union as a partner in spreading freedom and democracy and security and prosperity throughout the world,'' he said, using the kind of language that might have been dismissed as boilerplate before the union's recent troubles. 
 While Mr. Bush and his visitors met, European and American business leaders were also meeting at the Decatur House across the park from the White House, trying to come up with steps to remove regulatory barriers to trade -- and arguing that European Union's political troubles should not bleed into its economy.
 ''Nobody needs to worry that Europe will fall back to protectionism,'' said Gunter Verheugen, a vice president of the European Commission responsible for enterprise and industry. 
 Michael Treschow, a senior executive for Ericsson, a European telecommunications giant, argued that the constitutional arguments were going on in the background and that ''business has to go on,'' saying, ''Hopefully, we from business will be able to drag along the political side.''
 Tariffs are not a major issue with Europe, but regulatory differences are: Companies that want to list their shares on both American and European exchanges need to adhere to two sets of accounting rules. Differing safety standards, on goods including beef, drugs and automobiles, are viewed by industry as an impediment to trade.
 ''There are regulations on both sides that are duplicative in nature,'' said the United States commerce secretary, Carlos M. Gutierrez. ''We are testing products in multiple countries when we don't have to. What we'll do at the next step is pick out priorities where we can start addressing that and start showing results.''

HEADLINE: India Shares Rally as a Family Feud Ends

BYLINE: By SARITHA RAI

DATELINE: BANGALORE, India, June 20 

 BODY:
India's stock markets rallied Monday on news that the matriarch of the family-controlled Reliance Group, India's biggest private conglomerate, had stepped in to broker peace between her sons and divide the company.
 The $23 billion group, whose businesses include the world's third-largest oil refinery, the world's largest maker of polyester yarn and India's biggest mobile telephone services company and its largest power company, had been in turmoil for months. 
 The brothers who led the company, Mukesh and Anil Ambani, engaged in a public battle for succession after their father's death in 2002.
 Under the compromise announced by Kokilaben Ambani, their mother, Mukesh Ambani, 48, will run the oil and petrochemicals company, Reliance Industries, where he is already chairman, as well as Indian Petro Chemicals Ltd. Anil Ambani, 46, will run Reliance Energy, a utilities company, and the financing company, Reliance Capital, both of them already managed by him, and the mobile telephone company, Reliance Infocomm, which had been run by his brother. 
 ''I have today amicably resolved the issues between my two sons, Mukesh and Anil, keeping in mind the proud legacy of my husband, Dhirubhai Ambani,'' Mrs. Ambani said in a statement over the weekend. 
 The Reliance Group was founded by Dhirubhai Ambani, who died without leaving a will or charting a clear succession path. 
 The Sensex index of the Mumbai Stock Exchange rose more than 1 percent on Monday, to a record close of 6,984.55, pushed by rallies in the Reliance companies. During the day, the Sensex briefly rose above 7,000 for the first time ever. 
 ''Investors are happy, the markets are buoyant,'' said S.K. Das, chief investment officer of the LIC Mutual Fund, the mutual fund of the Life Insurance Company of India, which owns Reliance stock.
 Shares of Reliance Industries, which would go to Mukesh Ambani, gained almost 5 percent, to close at 630 rupees ($14.48). The companies going to Anil Ambani, however, soared. Reliance Energy surged 11 percent, to 658 rupees ($15.12), and Reliance Capital jumped nearly 25 percent to 294 rupees ($6.78). Reliance Infocomm is not publicly traded.
 Investors seemed to be voting not only for the more forward-looking businesses that Anil Ambani will receive in the deal, but also for his more brash public persona. Mukesh Ambani, educated at Stanford University in California, is considered a traditionalist by comparison with his flamboyant, Wharton-educated brother, who is married to a former Indian movie star.
 The brothers' seven-month quarrel had heavily influenced the markets, with the Sensex index charting the course of the disputes. The shares of the group's companies often suffered as Anil Ambani accused his brother of paying scant heed to corporate governance and even of tapping his phones. 
 The corporate empire has sales that equal 3.5 percent of India's gross domestic product and its exports make up over 6 percent of the country's total. Since the two parts of the newly divided group are not equal in market value, speculation abounded about the amount of cash that may have changed hands in the settlement.
 The restructuring of the group, with its many strands of ownership, could take months to work out. For instance, the Ambani family controls 46 percent of the $17 billion oil refiner Reliance Industries, while about 12 percent is held by a family-controlled investment trust, and the rest by other companies. 
 A board meeting on Sunday authorized a committee to examine the issues, like legal requirements, needed for a reorganization. After this, shareholders will need to approve the split of the businesses.
 On Monday, Mukesh Ambani sent a farewell e-mail message to the 40,000 employees of Reliance Infocomm, a mobile telecommunications company considered his pet project.
 ''My younger brother Anil is taking over the stewardship of Reliance Infocomm; he has enormous energy and drive and we share a common commitment to take forward the legacy of our father the late Dhirubhai Ambani,'' he said.
 Reliance Industries has large holdings in both Reliance Infocomm and Reliance Energy.
 Anil Ambani said Sunday that he would rename his group Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Enterprises. He announced aggressive investments in his group -- 10 billion rupees ($230 million) in Reliance Energy and 20 billion rupees ($460 million) in Reliance Capital. He said the settlement was the dawn of a ''new life, a new beginning'' for him.

HEADLINE: Euro Tumbles Into Void Left by Continent's Rifts

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, June 20 

 BODY:
As European leaders bicker over money and the future of their union, the main victim is proving to be the euro, their sturdy but still sensitive young progeny.
 The six-year-old currency fell sharply in trading against the dollar on Monday in the aftermath of the failure of the European Union summit meeting Friday. 
 It was the latest tumble for the euro, which has swooned since France voted against the European constitution last month, throwing Europe into political turmoil and raising questions about the long-term stability of its monetary union.
 The euro has fallen 3 percent against the dollar since the French referendum, and more than 10 percent from its peak at the end of 2004. On Monday, it traded at $1.214 in New York, a decline of 1.1 percent from Friday. 
 Monday's decline was hastened by new rumors that the European Central Bank was considering a cut in interest rates to try to resuscitate the Continent's languishing economies. In this jittery environment, analysts said, traders are seizing on anything as further evidence of the euro's weakness.
 ''We're in the eye of a storm,'' said Nicolas Sobczak, senior European economist at Goldman Sachs in Paris.
 The convergence of negative factors has shifted the dynamics of the currency market. The euro usually trades up and down in response to the dollar and the American economy, analysts say. Its rise over the last year is generally viewed as a barometer of the dollar's weakness, rather than the euro's intrinsic strength.
 Now, however, the euro is being driven mainly by European events -- few of them positive. It rose slightly on Friday when the United States reported its current-account deficit, but promptly resumed its slide after the summit meeting's attempt to hammer out a budget ended in acrimony on Friday.
 ''We're in a very pessimistic mood,'' said Michael Schubert, a currency analyst at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. ''It's a herd instinct. Everybody is looking for factors against the euro and in favor of the dollar.''
 He and other analysts expect the euro to regain traction eventually, and make up some of the ground lost against the dollar, which remains burdened by an enormous current- account deficit in the United States, $195 billion in the first quarter. Mr. Sobczak of Goldman predicted that after a further decline to $1.15, the euro would rebound to somewhere between $1.25 and $1.30.
 Still, he said, the fallout from Europe's political strife had been more severe than analysts expected. ''We didn't think it would affect the euro that much, and that sentiment would turn so bad.''
 Adding to the uncertainty are strident voices in Europe declaring that the euro is a failure, and should be scrapped. While those calls have so far been limited to populist leaders in Italy, perhaps the most economically fragile country in the euro zone, they are sowing unrest about the currency's stability.
 With 10 new countries in Central Europe applying to adopt the euro, analysts said the currency was at a delicate moment in its development. These countries remain generally enthusiastic about the euro, but a drumbeat of negative publicity could weaken their resolve, particularly in places like the Czech Republic, which has already said it was in no hurry to convert its currency.
 ''If the 'no' vote, and the rancor over the budget, starts to undermine this vision of Europe and the euro, you could see the new countries reappraising the process,'' said David Abramson, the head of European research at BCA Research in Montreal. ''Then what does the euro become?''
 Mr. Abramson said he was particularly concerned about Italy, which has diverged radically from its neighbors in economic performance. With a damaging loss of competitiveness against Asian and even European countries, its exports have dried up and its economy has fallen into recession. Historically, Italy would have reacted by devaluing its old currency, the lira.
 Deprived of that opportunity by its membership in the euro zone, Italy faces a painful adjustment that some analysts fear could stir political unrest and turn even more people against the euro. Greece and Spain face similar losses of competitiveness, which could hobble their future growth.
 Europe's generally anemic performance has enormously complicated the task of the European Central Bank. It faces mounting political pressure to cut interest rates. And though its president, Jean-Claude Trichet, insists it will hold the line, bank watchers sense a weakening in its resolve.
 ''You can't separate the political crisis from the rumors about a rate cut,'' said Jorg Kramer, chief economist at the HVB Group in Munich. ''A rate cut is perceived as something that would help the political crisis. It may ease the situation.''
 To currency traders, rumors of a cut are yet more evidence of Europe's -- and therefore the euro's -- weakness. But to European exporters, a weaker euro would be a welcome reprieve, even if fleeting, because it would reduce the cost of their goods in the United States and other markets.
 Indeed, far from lamenting the recent decline in the euro, politicians in France and Germany seem comforted by it. ''The exchange rate has reached a level that is more in line with reality,'' Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin of France said in a speech last week in Paris.

HEADLINE: Six Months After

BYLINE: By William Jefferson Clinton. 
William Jefferson Clinton was the 42nd president.

 BODY:
IT has been nearly six months since the tsunami struck 11 nations surrounding the Indian Ocean, killing more than 200,000 people. The tragedy touched the chord of our common humanity. Forty countries committed military forces to provide food, water and shelter to the survivors. Millions of Americans contributed more than $1 billion to the relief effort. Millions of others across the world also sent contributions, and the United Nations and hundreds of charitable organizations rushed to the region. 
 This rapid response yielded substantial dividends. Widespread starvation was avoided. There were no epidemics. 
 Of course, the recovery effort has a long way to go. Hundreds of thousands of people remain homeless, and unable to work. Thousands of schools have to be built, and many of the region's children remain frightened and distressed. Fortunately, the United Nations, international financial institutions, governments, businesses and nongovernmental organizations have pledged billions of dollars to help the tsunami generation ''build back better.'' 
 As the special envoy for tsunami relief for the United Nations, I am working to make good on that commitment. To achieve our goals, I have asked all those involved in tsunami relief to agree to the following agenda:
 First, we are developing a joint action plan detailing precisely who will do what, where and when, to avoid duplication of effort, ensure efficient use of resources and leave no person or community behind. For example, we all agree on the need for an early warning system. The plan will identify who is responsible for financing and building the system, where it will be located, how the system will actually alert the public, and who will oversee its maintenance and reliability.
 We are also devising a reporting system to ensure that donations are being used appropriately and a unified scorecard to show what we have achieved and what remains to be done. 
 Second, we will work to restore the livelihoods of the survivors; to finance new economic activities to raise family incomes above their pre-tsunami levels; and to increase the capacity of local governments, nongovernmental organizations and businesses to undertake the gargantuan reconstruction effort.
 To diversify the affected economies, we need to make small loans -- micro-credit -- available for new ventures or for the expansion of existing ones. And we must help restore tourism in the entire region, especially in the Maldives, where destruction of tourism facilities, fishing operations and other enterprises and homes ran up losses in excess of 60 percent of the country's annual gross domestic product. Most tourist operations are open for business, but most potential visitors don't seem to know that.
 Jobs for local people in the reconstruction will require large vocational training programs. Thousands of masons, woodworkers, supervisors and laborers are needed.
 Third, we must move survivors from tents and barracks to decent transitional shelters as soon as possible. Although there are still some frustrating delays in getting government approval for contracts and for imports of machinery and materials, there are fewer bureaucratic obstacles every day. All of the affected countries have good plans, with able people in charge of executing them. 
 Still, the housing shortage presents a serious challenge. Last year, before the tsunami, 5,000 new homes were built in Sri Lanka. Now survivors in Sri Lanka alone need almost 100,000 homes. In Aceh Province in Indonesia, 2,000 schools and 200,000 homes must be constructed. Even the United States would have a difficult time getting a million people back into their houses in a year or two. 
 The construction effort also carries significant environmental risks. Wholesale, unrestricted logging can cause deforestation in some regions, particularly in Indonesia, doing great damage to rainforests and setting the stage for more natural disasters. Timber needs to be obtained legally, and conservation measures, like replanting mangrove trees rather than developing the land from which they were uprooted, should be part of the reconstruction. 
 The housing problem is further complicated because many ownership records were swept away by the waves. And in many small villages, such documents never existed. In some of the affected countries, up to 90 percent of displaced people have lost their identity documents. The World Bank is financing a ''titling'' project in Aceh to help Indonesians develop an effective property-rights system -- it is an initiative that should be replicated across the region. (Sri Lanka must also resolve conflicts arising out of the government's policy largely prohibiting reconstruction within a ''buffer zone'' near the water. Many survivors who want to return to their old land oppose the restrictions and their concerns should be taken into account as they are in Indonesia.)
 Finally, we must do all we can to assure that the voices of the most vulnerable are heard. Will women survivors be involved in the design and execution of the recovery process? Will their property rights be protected? Will the Dalits (also known as the ''untouchables'') of India be discriminated against? Will poor families get documentation for their assets and have access to lines of credit? Will national governments give localities greater flexibility to meet their particular needs? Will children who survived be able to get back to school? Will the disaster usher in a new chapter in the peace processes in Sri Lanka and Aceh, thereby making it easier for aid to be distributed and reconstruction to take place wherever it's needed?
 Thanks to the generosity of millions of people, we will have the resources to meet these daunting challenges. The World Food Program of the United Nations is feeding more than 700,000 people daily. Unicef is making substantial commitments to meeting the area's large needs for water and sanitation. Other United Nations agencies are doing their part.
 But most of the financing for reconstruction and recovery is in the hands of donor governments and charitable groups like the Red Cross, Catholic Relief Services, and hundreds of other nongovernmental organizations. In order for the recovery effort to succeed, these groups have to be treated as equal partners in the planning process. 
 Of course, the reconstruction process will proceed more smoothly in Aceh and Sri Lanka if all parties to the longstanding conflicts there are involved. Cooperation might even lead to greater prospects for peace in both places.
 On my most recent trip to the region, I visited the Jantho camp for displaced people in Aceh, where I met a woman who had lost nine of her 10 children. As one of the camp leaders, she introduced me to the youngest camp member: a 2-day-old boy. She said the child's mother wanted me to give him a name. I asked if there was an appropriate Indonesian word for ''new beginning'' and was told that there was: ''dawn,'' which in their language is a boy's name. I think a lot about that little boy, and our obligation to give him a new dawn. We can do it together.

HEADLINE: A War Shrine, for a Japan Seeking a Not Guilty Verdict

BYLINE: By Norimitsu Onishi

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
One recent rainy morning, a couple of dozen vehicles belonging to the Patriotic Youth League and other Japanese right-wing groups gathered inside the grounds of Yasukuni Shrine, the Shinto memorial to Japan's war dead. ''Revere the Emperor,'' read a slogan on one truck. Others alluded to enemies unnamed: ''Love and Protect our Motherland'' and ''Kill one, one at a time.''
 At 12:30 p.m., the caravan spilled out onto Tokyo's streets, destination unclear. But the targets are usually the same: the Chinese Embassy, the liberal media, anybody daring to challenge the argument that Japan's wars were legitimate and that their leaders were not criminals. Yasukuni Shrine is the symbolic center of Japan's efforts to revise its militaristic past, and lies at the heart of worsening relations between Japan and its neighbors. Not only right-wing extremists, but now also mainstream politicians and the news media are more openly arguing that the 14 war criminals enshrined in Yasukuni were not guilty -- and, because they were not, Japan's wars could not have been that bad. 
 In a face-to-face meeting on June 20, for example, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi steadfastly resisted the entreaties of President Roh Moo Hyun of South Korea that he stop visiting the shrine and build an alternate one that would be more acceptable to China and the Koreas, all of them victims of a brutal Japanese colonization.
 While the Japanese have received the bulk of the criticism for the shrine, they are not, however, the only ones to have manipulated the meaning of Yasukuni and its war criminals. So have the Chinese, the Taiwanese and the Americans, each according to their own interests. 
 During America's six-year occupation of Japan after World War II, Americans spent the first half democratizing the country and prosecuting war criminals. In the second half, with Communists controlling China and the cold war bearing down, Washington reversed course: wartime leaders were rehabilitated overnight in an effort to make Japan strong. Some Class A war criminal suspects, after barely escaping the noose, became postwar Japan's political and business leaders; one, Nobusuke Kishi, even became prime minister.
 The mixed messages from America -- as well as the highly politicized Tokyo Trials that tried the Japanese leaders but avoided mentioning Emperor Hirohito, whom America had decided not to depose -- laid the seeds of confusion here. They also left open the door for the Japanese to argue that the overall verdict -- that Japan had led a war of aggression -- was also false. 
 ''It was a war of self-defense,'' Yuko Tojo, the granddaughter of the wartime prime minister who was executed as a Class A war criminal and is enshrined in Yasukuni, said in a telephone interview. ''China claims it is unforgivable that the head of state visits Yasukuni, where those responsible for causing trouble by conducting a war of aggression are enshrined. But if we agree with China, it would mean that we recognize it as a war of aggression. So we can't.''
 Visits to Yasukuni have long been regarded as coded endorsements of conservative nationalist views like hers. Indeed, when Mr. Koizumi said two weeks ago that he actually recognized the validity of the Tokyo Trials, the nation's largest-selling newspaper, Yomiuri Shimbun, which does not, was flabbergasted. ''With what view of history has Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi visited Yasukuni Shrine in the past?'' it asked in an editorial, adding that if Mr. Koizumi accepted the trials' rulings, ''then Koizumi should not visit Yasukuni Shrine.''
 Yasukuni Shrine was built in 1869, as part of Japan's drive to create a nationalistic state religion centered around a divine emperor. By the end of World War II, almost 2.5 million soldiers would be enshrined here for giving their lives for the emperor. Except for two civil conflicts, the other nine wars in which the soldiers died all revolved around Japan's advance into China, the Korean Peninsula, Taiwan and, ultimately, its attack on the United States.
 Yasukuni's war museum argues that America forced Japan into attacking Pearl Harbor as a way of shaking off the Depression, saying that ''the U.S. economy made a complete recovery once the Americans entered the war.'' A video shown at the museum, called ''We Won't Forget,'' describes America's postwar occupation of Japan as ''pitiless.'' But the museum makes no mention of Japan's own occupation of Asia. As for the Rape of Nanjing, the museum blames the Chinese commander and adds that, thanks to Japanese actions, ''inside the city, residents were once again able to live their lives in peace.''
 In a written statement, Yasukuni officials said, ''The exhibition is not based on any special historical viewpoint, but is based on clear evidence.''
 Yasukuni's view of history is one that few Asians or Americans would accept. But like Japanese politicians, foreigners also appear to recognize the shrine's political value.
 Shu Ching Chiang, a Taiwanese lawmaker who is pro-independence and anti-China, visited Yasukuni in April. Taiwanese soldiers who served Japan's Imperial Army during the Japanese occupation of Taiwan are also enshrined in Yasukuni.
 ''Every country has the right to pay respect to its war dead in the way it chooses,'' Mr. Shu said in a recent interview in Taipei. Like many Japanese, he compared Yasukuni to Arlington National Cemetery.
 Arthur Ding, an international relations expert at National Chengchi University in Taipei, decoded Mr. Shu's trip: ''He delivered a message to Japan that his party wants a close relationship with Japan and to China that they are for Taiwanese independence.''
 While the Chinese and the South Koreans have legitimate reasons to oppose the shrine, they have been accused of using it to shore up domestic support by appealing to nationalist sentiments. 
 Noticeable in its silence on Yasukuni and the verdict on the Class A war criminals is the United States. As the nation that defeated Japan, occupied it and still has 50,000 troops deployed here, America is the one country that Japan may still listen to on these subjects. America is hardly a disinterested observer, after all, because Yasukuni deifies Japanese who ordered the attack on Pearl Harbor.
 American officials raise an eyebrow at Japanese comparisons of Yasukuni to Arlington National Cemetery. But they tend to defend, albeit somewhat uncomfortably, Japanese visits to Yasukuni, or maintain a studied silence. The cold war may be over, but China's rise alarms America just as much as did the rise of Communism in the 1940's. So better a strong, remilitarized Japan, no matter what the Japanese say about Yasukuni or war criminals.

HEADLINE: Hope and Gloom Out West

BYLINE: By PATRICIA NELSON LIMERICK. 
Maureen Dowd is on book leave. Patricia Nelson Limerick, director of the Center of the American West at the University of Colorado and the author of ''The Legacy of Conquest'' and ''Something in the Soil,'' is a guest columnist for two weeks. E-mail: limerick@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The American West, Wallace Stegner once wrote in one of the region's most quoted aphorisms, is ''the native home of hope.''
 Having put this very cheerful sentiment on public record, Mr. Stegner soon began to wonder what on earth had possessed him. 
 With its extraordinary landscapes, wide horizons and great natural resources, the West might qualify as hope's native home. But the West is also -- in large part because of these very assets -- the second home of tension, conflict, regret, dismay, gloom and bitterness. 
 Yet for all these miseries, the West has become the return address for my own sense of hope. I have the good luck to be employed as a kind of shuttle diplomat, carrying messages and attempting negotiations among various contending parties in the West today. That work has given me a deep -- if perhaps naive and lamblike -- faith that these are great times for bridge building, alliance making and solution finding. 
 True, we live in an era in which we are told daily, if not hourly, about the intense and draining polarization of our political world, and the West has its own well-developed version. Environmental conflicts -- energy production and consumption, water allocation, wildfire management, land-use planning, growth control -- provide fine battlegrounds for the display of the rattier aspects of human nature. 
 But our conflicts present one great advantage: neither major political party offers much in the way of solutions. Consult the platform and mainstream positions of either the Republican Party or the Democratic Party and, on the issues that matter most to the West, you will find yourself contemplating the yawning interior of Mother Hubbard's cupboard. 
 This vacancy presents a fine opportunity to notice the mounting irrelevance of partisan squabbling. When it comes to the all-important environmental issues, most Westerners are actually political hybrids, mixtures and muddles no matter what their party registration. They want to be supplied with the necessary natural resources to support their current level of comfort and convenience, yet they want the production sites of those natural resources to be out of sight and out of mind. They want water coming out of the faucet without disruption of the river system; they want to build Western-style log houses without disturbing a single tree within their viewshed.
 And it's no wonder the muddled outnumber the clearheaded, and the ambivalent inherit or at least manage the earth. In the last part of the 20th century, the West became the fastest growing region in the nation, and in that same era, Congress wrote a whole new draft of the assumptions and processes that govern public-lands management, environmental decision making and natural resource development. We feel awash in people, legislation and confusion. Pollsters would be advised to add a question to their protocol: ''Are you one of those rare individuals whose principles and convictions actually match up to and shape your conduct as a voter and as a consumer? Or are you as muddled, ambivalent and inconsistent as the rest of us?''
 The environmental laws -- the Wilderness Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Clean Air Act, the Endangered Species Act, the Clean Water Act -- were national in scope. But they carried particular consequence for the West, given the huge percentage of its lands still under federal management, and the importance of natural resources and natural beauty to local economies.
 So a flood of new residents has been colliding and jockeying for position with old-timers and each other. At the very time they were most needed, the ground rules for all this colliding and jockeying were up in the air as the environmental laws were being carried out, applied, interpreted, condemned, defended and second-guessed.
 Could anyone have created better conditions for the production and proliferation of conflict, tension, bitterness, litigation and reciprocal demonization?
 But now, as many of the various contenders look back at years of energy-draining contention, many of them yearn for a better code of conduct among opponents, a more productive manner of dealing with conflict and a more effective way to distinguish substance from noise in these under-refereed debates.
 And with that yearning, hope returns home.

HEADLINE: A Hot 2005 for Offices So Far

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
The demand by investors seeking to acquire office space in Manhattan remains intense, especially for properties in Midtown. 
 With the first half of the year almost over, the dollar value of sales of commercial property is on a pace for the best year ever, exceeding even the record level of 2004, when $15.1 billion worth of buildings changed hands. A majority of commercial property in Manhattan is office space.
 ''A banner year used to be in the $10 billion range,'' said Scott Latham, an executive director of Cushman & Wakefield, a brokerage and services company. ''Last year, we were 50 percent above that.'' 
 The company estimates that $12.67 billion of property was sold through mid-June. If current trends continue, 2005 will far exceed last year's total.
 Office rents in Midtown Manhattan have recovered almost to the peak levels of early 2001, providing some rationale for the lofty sales prices.
 In recent years, real estate executives have talked about the incongruity of the exceptionally high sales prices for office buildings and the soft rental rates for space within such buildings. Leasing income would seem to be the fundamental economic underpinning for purchases.
 ''The leasing market started to turn in November 2003, and 2004 was a very strong year,'' said John Powers, co-chairman for the tristate region at CB Richard Ellis. ''For the year to date, we are still ahead of the five-year average'' of square feet leased, he said.
 Although the pace of office leasing has slowed in recent weeks, some brokers describe this as a period of adjustment after the hot market of last year and the first quarter of this one. ''The market is pausing to digest,'' said Mitchell S. Steir, the chief executive of Studley, a brokerage company that mostly represents tenants. ''It is the rational follow-up to a period of peak activity.''
 Real estate executives say low interest rates and an increased appetite for real estate among institutional investors like pension funds are driving the demand for commercial and residential properties in crucial markets like Manhattan and Washington. 
 ''Ten years ago, real estate was a stepchild for institutional investors, who were mostly interested in stock and bonds,'' said Paul E. Pariser, a founder of Taconic Investment Partners, which owns, among other properties, 111 Eighth Avenue, which covers the block between 15th and 16th Streets. 
 ''Now funds that allocated 3 percent to real estate have moved to 8 percent, and those that were at 5 percent have moved to 12 percent,'' Mr. Pariser said. ''Those are big dollars. When you add three percentage points at a $100 billion institution, that's $3 billion.'' 
 Peter Hauspurg, the chairman of Eastern Consolidated Properties, a sales brokerage firm, said: ''There is a tremendous amount of capital chasing real estate assets. History says that we are three years overdue for a correction in pricing, but there is no sign of it.''
 Indeed, in April, a group of pension funds and Tishman Speyer Properties agreed to pay $1.72 billion for the MetLife Building, the 2.8-million-square-foot tower that rises above Grand Central Terminal. It is said to be the highest price ever paid for a single building.
 Even though institutions have become an important factor in real estate investing, many executives say private investors with access to cheap debt still dominate in Manhattan. ''Last year, 68 percent of the sales volume went to private investors,'' Mr. Latham said. 
 Part of the reason, he said, is that private investors are willing to take on more debt to make a purchase than are institutions, which tend to have stricter rules about financing acquisitions. ''A private investor can finance 80 percent of a deal, compared to 60 to 65 percent for institutions,'' Mr. Latham said.
 At the Toy Center, the connected buildings at 200 Fifth Avenue and 1107 Broadway that have housed offices and showrooms for toy manufacturers, the competition to acquire the property was fierce.
 ''When we went to sell the Toy Center, we had over 20 real bids, which is a remarkable number by historic criteria,'' said Anthony E. Malkin, president of W&M Properties, a large investor. 
 Mr. Malkin said most of the bidders were individuals based in New York. ''This market is being driven by entrepreneurial capital with access to high levels of debt,'' he said.
 The Toy Center was sold for $355 million to the Chetrit Group. There has been speculation that the buildings, which face Madison Square Park, will be converted into residential condominiums, but Chetrit has declined to disclose its intentions.
 Leasing brokers say that in Midtown, concessions packages -- periods of free rent and contributions toward interior construction -- shrank as the vacancy rate dropped to 10.3 percent in May from 12.3 percent a year earlier, increasing the effective rent.
 According to a Studley study, the average effective rent in Midtown by the end of last year was $66.27 a square foot, which was still 11 percent below the high of $74.54 set in early 2001. The effective rent as calculated by Studley includes operating expenses, real estate taxes and the cost of electrical power, making it higher than the nominal base rent.
 Barry M. Gosin, the chief executive of Newmark & Company Real Estate, said, ''The market is being pulled up from the top,'' with some prospective tenants willing to pay very high prices for space that meets their needs. ''Financial institutions like hedge funds have set the bar very high in prime buildings in the Plaza District,'' an area north of Grand Central. Because these companies were willing to pay high rents for the space they wanted, other landlords lifted their asking prices as well.
 But if the Midtown leasing market is finally recovering from the slump after the Sept. 11 attacks, the downtown market is not. The vacancy rate there was 16.3 percent in May, compared with 15.2 percent a year earlier, according to CB Richard Ellis. 
 The rebuilding of 7 World Trade Center is expected to be completed early next year, but no tenants have yet signed up for its 1.7 million square feet.
 ''Downtown is basically stagnant, although the conversion of office buildings to residential use will eventually be good for the area,'' Mr. Gosin said. He noted that the gap between the Midtown rental rates and those downtown has widened, as few office tenants have taken space downtown. ''The difference used to be something like $15 to $20 a square foot,'' he said. ''Now, it is more like $30 a square foot.''
 Some real estate executives said the decision by the investment banking company Goldman Sachs, the only firm that had committed to building a new office tower near Ground Zero, to suspend its plans was discouraging other tenants from looking for space downtown. ''Unfortunately for the city, the impact of Goldman will be far-reaching,'' Mr. Steir of Studley said.

HEADLINE: Riches of American Dance in Tangible Form

BYLINE: By JOHN ROCKWELL

 BODY:
There are two ways to look at exhibitions of mute memorabilia of once- (or still-) vital performing artists. They can be seen as profoundly creepy, in the necrological sense, or as mysteriously potent, emanations from artifacts still imbued with an ineffable power.
 Perhaps it depends on the performing art. I have found most of the exhibitions staged by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in Cleveland or the Experience Music Project in Seattle to fall on the necrological side of the line. But ''America's Irreplaceable Dance Treasures: The First 100,'' on view through Aug. 20 in the Vincent Astor Gallery, right inside the Amsterdam Avenue entrance of the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center, speaks with a quiet potency that brings back dancers and dancing long since lost from view. 
The exhibition has a slightly gnarled history. In 1999, when everyone was making lists in anticipation of the millennium, the Dance Heritage Coalition in Washington, an association of dance archives, decided to make up its own list, or a series of such lists every couple of years. With fanfare, the ''first 100'' treasures, a word meaning anything from dancers to choreographers to institutions to whole genres of popular or ethnic dance, even to dance critics, was announced.
 But then, says Elizabeth Aldrich, director of the coalition, harsh reality intruded. The idea was to trumpet the treasures in a traveling exhibition that would offer a comprehensive interactive kiosk but also a selection of photos and videos, to which each host institution would add artifacts from its own collection.
 It turned out that much of the archival material needed preservational work to bring it up to exhibition standards, and money was not readily available for that. Eventually the touring show -- 50 stills and 50 moving images -- began last year in San Francisco and continued to Jacob's Pillow in the Berkshires and Ohio State University in Columbus. Now it is in New York. Norton Owen, the director of preservation at Jacob's Pillow, who helped assemble the touring show with the dance historian Lynn Garafola, said that while all 100 treasures are represented on the kiosk, and the New York Public Library has material representing all 100, only 90 are represented by artifacts on display. 
 Any such selection of treasures, and less contentiously of artifacts to represent them, is subject to furious controversy. So afraid were some dance insiders on the selection committee of incurring their colleagues' displeasure that many chose to remain anonymous, Ms. Aldrich said. She added that the coalition welcomed controversy because it stirred up discussion of American dance history and encouraged donors, in a dire economic climate, to support the preservation of dance materials.
 Before making their choices, from about 900 nominations, the coalition and its selection committee divided dance into categories, thus ensuring breadth and diversity. This could be regarded as properly ecumenical or cravenly politically correct, depending on your position in our continuing culture wars. To me it seems difficult to challenge any of those included, however much it might be easy to regret those excluded. But remember, this is just ''the first 100,'' although Ms. Aldrich conceded that the idea of follow-up lists has been placed on hold.
 Right inside the door to the Astor Gallery is the kiosk, allowing a visitor to call up images onto a computer monitor, by artist, title or genre. There are also screens on the wall with a narrower range of dance videos, and one screen showing a rotating preselected sequence of video snippets. The walls are otherwise covered with posters and photographs, and there are vitrines full of more fragile memorabilia.
 There is an enormous richness here, compelling reminders of the depth and variety of dance in America and of American contributions to world dance, as both a source for innovation and a home for visitors and immigrants. 
 There are some especially striking images and artifacts. Ones that stick in my memory include an iconic portrait of Ruth St. Denis, proving that her onetime dancer Martha Graham was not the first to make fabulous use of fabric; thrilling film of the Lindy Hop in a Harlem club; Rudolf Nureyev in full flight in ''Le Corsaire''; a touching 1955 letter from the critic and poet Edwin Denby to Lincoln Kirstein; paintings of American Indian war dances and kachina dolls from Louis Horst; film of Merce Cunningham and Carolyn Brown, of Trisha Brown and Meredith Monk and Twyla Tharp; still and moving images of George Balanchine and Jerome Robbins and their dancers; and a whole constellation of stern, impassioned modern dancers from between the world wars, burning with modernist fervor and social commitment.
 Everyone who spends time at this exhibition will come away with different memories and different conclusions; that's part of the point. For me, this celebration of American dance (and of archival dance preservation) reaffirms the idea that no one genre, no one historic line of development, can lay claim to primacy in our dance history. To say that is hardly to abandon standards of judgment, to sink helplessly into some bottomless multicultural soup. It is merely to celebrate the obvious, that we live in a country of wonderful diversity and that an awareness of different traditions and how they influenced one another can only make us stronger.

HEADLINE: Paying for Social Security

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 ''Poll Finds Broad Pessimism on Social Security Payments'' (news article, June 19) reported that 60 percent of the public thinks that Social Security is in crisis or serious trouble. 
 It is time to let the public in on a dirty little secret, denied them by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to quiet Republican cries of ''Socialism!'' Social Security is not run like a private pension fund that pays people from their own past invested contributions and can go broke. 
 It is a government program financed by current taxes, very much like the Department of Defense. Either program can have an increase in costs, and that increase will be financed by an act of Congress, provided there is public sentiment for doing so. 
 In the case of Social Security, the public would certainly want to provide funds to cover the currently mandated benefit formula if the payroll tax were to fall short a quarter century from now.

HEADLINE: National Briefing Midwest: Illinois: Segregation And Racial Inequality

BYLINE: By Gretchen Ruethling (NYT)

 BODY:
Segregation and inequality between blacks and whites in areas like housing, education, income and employment are persistent problems in Chicago, according to a study by the city's chapter of the Urban League. The study found that 13 of the city's 15 richest neighborhoods were disproportionately white, while 12 of the city's 15 poorest neighborhoods were disproportionately black. The study also found that the city's 22 predominantly black neighborhoods had an unemployment rate almost twice that of the city as a whole. Also, from 1970 to 2000, the median family income in Chicago rose by 2 percent for blacks, compared with 19 percent for whites and 16 percent for Latinos. Gretchen Ruethling (NYT)

HEADLINE: Foreign Automakers, Settled in South, Set Industry's Pace

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD

DATELINE: HUNTSVILLE, Ala., June 17 

 BODY:
By most accounts, the United States auto industry is in deep trouble. But don't tell that to the newest workers here in Alabama, where foreign carmakers are redefining the auto industry in America.
 Automakers from overseas first began building manufacturing plants in this country in the 1970's, largely as a defensive response to protectionist threats. But even as General Motors and Ford have been announcing thousands of job cuts, the foreign automakers are aggressively building new factories and expanding plants they opened not long ago. 
 In Alabama alone, Mercedes-Benz has doubled the size of its plant outside Tuscaloosa in the last year, while Honda has done the same at its factory in Lincoln. A new plant from the Korean automaker, Hyundai, opened just last month in Montgomery. And Toyota is adding 300 more workers here at its two-year-old plant in Huntsville to produce powerful engines for the big pickup trucks that will be made in a factory opening next year in Texas. 
 In other industries, American manufacturers have been some of the most avid investors abroad. But in the case of the auto industry, the competition has been brought right to Detroit's doorstep as the strongest foreign companies are moving to states eager for their investments, most of them in the Deep South, and hiring workers seeking the stability that home-grown companies can no longer offer. 
 As a result, a quarter of all cars and trucks built in the United States are now made in factories owned by foreign automakers producing foreign brands, up from 18 percent in 2000. The assembly plants alone employ nearly 60,000 people, and that number continues to grow.
 The employment at the American companies still dwarfs that of the newcomers. Automakers in Detroit employ four times the hourly workers -- 250,000 -- but that number is continuing to fall. Already, G.M. has announced that it plans to cut 25,000 of those workers by 2008. 
 Union jobs at the Big Three plants pay a dollar or two more an hour -- about $26 an hour compared with $24 or $25 an hour for the nonunion jobs at the foreign plants. But compensation at the American automakers swells to an average of $55 an hour when health care, cost of living and other benefits are counted, compared with $48 an hour, on average, at Toyota.
 Toyota gets more out of its workers. Its plants operate at about 107 percent of the manufacturing capacity, meaning that they are constantly running on overtime, according to Harbour & Associates, a consulting firm that tracks manufacturing. By contrast, G.M.'s plants are operating at only 75 percent of their capacity, Harbour found.
 For David Herring, who grew up in Pontiac, Mich., outside of Detroit, his new job at Toyota's engine plant in Huntsville is a return to the industry that employed his uncle and other family members, but that he had originally decided to avoid. He earned a football scholarship to the University of North Alabama and then became a social worker. The job wore him down, he said, and he saw opportunity and stability at Toyota.
 ''Basically, auto country is moving down south,'' said Mr. Herring, 29, who met Toyota's president on his first day on the job. He added, ''Fate brought me here.''
 For the most part, the first wave of foreign-owned plants were farther north, in places like Ohio and Kentucky, while the newest factories are concentrated in the Deep South.
 The state of Alabama has been particularly generous in wooing auto companies. In 1993, it provided $258 million in incentives and tax breaks to land its first foreign automaker, Mercedes. The state has spent hundreds of millions since to attract the Honda, Hyundai and Toyota plants.
 But what may have clinched the deals was the state's laws -- similar to those on the books throughout much of the South -- that do not require workers to join unions even if their plants are organized.
 ''The auto industry has found a welcome down here,'' said Johnny L. Mathis, a business development manager with Qore Property Sciences, a company that has prepared the construction sites for many of the new auto factories and parts plants.
 Since 2000, the Big Three automakers have lost eight points of market share just to their Japanese competition. Detroit now holds 57 percent of the American car market, while foreign automakers have 43 percent. 
 Among the companies adding jobs, no company is courted more than Toyota, the world's richest car company, which is gaining strength even as G.M. falters. Beyond expanding its engine plant here, where its ultimate investment will be $450 million, Toyota is building a $1 billion factory in San Antonio -- set to open next year with 4,000 workers. And company officials are looking at even more places, including Arkansas, to build additional factories.
 Toyota's impact on the nation's economy has been powerful. A study by the Center for Automotive Research, which has yet to be published, estimates that Toyota's investments in the United States had led to 386,600 American jobs as of last year -- including jobs at suppliers and in surrounding communities.
 That includes the 29,000 assembly workers at Toyota's plants, plus another 74,000 people employed by the automaker in its California headquarters, design and engineering centers and at its dealerships. And those figures do not include Toyota's expansion plans. In Texas alone, the study estimates, Toyota will help create another 9,000 jobs.
 The impact helps explain why ''states are falling all over themselves to land a car company,'' said James T. Bolte, a Toyota vice president in charge of the Alabama plant. 
 In a state where the average wage is $31,000 a year, according to the Commerce Department, Toyota's workers earn $45,000 on average, with overtime, plus a benefits package valued by the company at $10,000. Workers receive medical, dental and life insurance coverage; a traditional pension plan and a 401(k) plan; an allowance for child care; and an annual cash bonus, which was $3,850 a worker last year. 
 Prospective employees are lining up to apply for jobs at the new factories. About 30,000 people vied for the 2,000 additional jobs at the gleaming white Mercedes plant west of Birmingham, where its workers dress in royal blue shirts that bear the company's three-pointed star logo on the right shoulder and their names on the left.
 For Tammy Young, 36, the sprawling Mercedes factory was a prize after being laid off at U.S. Steel's big Birmingham operation, where she worked for nine years. In between, she held a temporary job at the Honda plant and worked at a dairy store. 
 The factory has just begun building the new R-class, a luxury station wagon, which will sell for about $50,000. It joins a new version of the M-class sport utility, the original vehicle produced here, whose sales are up 66 percent since it was updated last spring. 
 Toyota, which opened its plant with 150 workers in 2003, had 9,000 applications for those positions, even though jobs in an engine plant lack the allure and glamour of building cars at places like Mercedes.
 The process of getting a job at Toyota is rigorous, meant to weed out those not meant for the repetitive, sometimes hot work inside the plant, which sits on 200 acres surrounded by cotton fields.
 After interviews, job seekers had to complete five weeks of pre-employment training at a center, which is run and paid for by the state, across the road from Alabama A&M University. The drill included exercises to see if they could work on teams and hours spent on a practice assembly line. None of the applicants were paid. Anyone who was late or missed a training session was instantly cut. 
 The few successful applicants went through nine weeks more training inside the engine plant, including two hours a day in a fully equipped gym where they ran on treadmills and lifted weights to build endurance. 
 Unlike plants run by Detroit automakers, where a worker can spend 30 years screwing on the same parts, everyone on the Toyota line is taught to do every type of assembly job, so they can switch positions when needed to keep production flowing.
 ''It was hard,'' Mr. Herring said, ''but it all had a purpose.''
 To many, the purpose is the stability of a job at Toyota, which earned $4.8 billion in 2004, as the Detroit companies struggled. Jewal Fossett II, 31, was encouraged to apply by his father, who had bounced from one Ford job to another.
 The younger Mr. Fossett, who previously worked for MCI, said he had one reason for applying: ''I have my own family to raise.'' 
 Noralyn Lassiter, 22, said she gave up her job as a customer service representative at DirecTV, where she spent days at a desk ''on a headset.'' Now, she will stand for hours a day at a workstation, redolent with the faintly acrid smell of engine coolant. But, she said, ''It's hard to find a job that you can stick with a long time.''
 Lately, at least some Toyota officials in Japan have expressed concern that the automaker's rapid growth could cause political problems, with one senior executive proposing that the company might raise prices or temper its expansion to give G.M. and Ford a break. 
 But, Mr. Bolte, the Toyota executive, is doubtful that the company is planning to retreat. ''I haven't heard anybody say, 'Slow down,''' he said.


CORRECTION-DATE: June 24, 2005

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Wednesday about foreign automakers' aggressive expansion of production in the United States misstated the training received by applicants at the Toyota plant in Huntsville, Ala. It is 36 hours over nine days, not five weeks. The article also misstated the size of the work force at the plant when it opened in 2003. There were 350 workers; 150 is the number of those being added. The article misstated the size of the force for a Toyota plant in San Antonio, which opens next year. It is 2,000, not 4,000.

HEADLINE: China Oil Giant Expected to Vote Today on Unocal Bid

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS

DATELINE: LONDON, June 21 

 BODY:
The Chinese oil and gas giant CNOOC was expected to decide at a Wednesday board meeting whether to make a cash bid of around $18 billion for Unocal, according to one executive involved in the negotiations. 
 If the state-controlled CNOOC does make a bid, it would be pitting itself directly against Chevron, which signed a $16.4 billion cash and stock agreement to buy Unocal in April. 
 [Reuters reported early Wednesday from China that a top executive of CNOOC said that the board had not yet made a decision on whether to challenge Chevron's bid.] 
 CNOOC's top executives have been eager to make an offer for Unocal, which is based in El Segundo, Calif., since it came on the market earlier this year. If the deal is done, it would be China's largest overseas investment ever, and would give CNOOC Unocal's natural gas operations in Thailand and Indonesia and its profit, $1.2 billion last year.
 But so far CNOOC's nonexecutive board members have blocked a bid, troubled by the amount of debt that would need to be taken on to buy Unocal. These nonexecutive directors hired Rothschild to advise them on a deal, and the investment bank completed its report Tuesday. 
 CNOOC's executives are prepared to make an offer of more than $65 a share, besting Chevron's offer, which is $62.09 a share based on Monday's closing price, according to the executive involved in the talks. CNOOC's executives are being advised by J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs. 
 CNOOC's interest in Unocal, which the Chinese company most recently expressed on June 7, has raised concerns in the United States that bidding wars between American oil giants and the Chinese government could become common. Both sides may be forced to rely on acquisitions to add energy supplies as China runs out of resources and American companies face difficulties in finding new oil reserves, analysts and economists say. CNOOC is 70 percent owned by the Chinese government. 
 Already, two Republican congressmen from California have expressed concern about a CNOOC bid for Unocal, even before any bid has been made. 
 ''Such an acquisition raises many concerns about U.S. jobs, energy production and energy security,'' Representatives Richard W. Pombo and Duncan Hunter wrote in a June 17 letter to President Bush. American companies will find it increasingly difficult to compete financially against China's energy companies, the congressmen said, and they asked the president to initiate a review based on the Defense Production Act, a law passed in 1950 to ensure economic stability. The letter was first reported on The Wall Street Journal's Web site Sunday. 
 But at an energy conference in New York, Lee Raymond, chief executive of Exxon Mobil, warned against legislative interference. ''The United States is dependent, and will be for a long, long time, on significant imports of oil,'' Mr. Raymond said, according to Reuters. ''To the extent that they preclude the Chinese from buying assets here, it could easily come back and reflect that we won't be able to buy assets in a foreign country.''
 Chevron said Tuesday that it would not comment on the rumored actions of third parties.
 ''Our focus is on completing the deal to buy Unocal, and we're very confident we can get the deal completed in a relatively short period of time,'' Andy Norman, a spokesman, said. Chevron has said previously it expects the deal to close by year-end.
 Any offer by CNOOC would have to include a $500 million breakup fee to Chevron.

HEADLINE: Senate Passes Amendment To Combat Climate Change

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 21 

 BODY:
Acting to address the contentious subject of global climate change, the Senate passed an amendment to pending energy legislation on Tuesday calling for voluntary reductions in some emissions and spending money to promote technology to reduce pollution. 
 The measure, adopted by a vote of 66 to 29, was the least stringent of three competing amendments intended to address climate change.
 Its passage followed a setback for environmentalists late Monday night, when Senator Pete V. Domenici, the New Mexico Republican who is chairman of the energy committee, declined to support another amendment imposing mandatory reductions in fossil-fuel emissions that scientists link to global warming. Mr. Domenici explained that he favored the idea, but worried that opposition might scuttle the energy bill. 
 The Senate is expected to vote Wednesday on a third climate-change amendment sponsored by Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut. It is the strictest of the three, calling for steeper mandatory cuts in emissions, and it faces stiff opposition.
 Still, advocates of federal efforts to combat climate change by reducing pollution called the framing of the debate itself a victory.
 ''This legislation represents a very significant shift in the consensus in the United States Senate toward taking significant steps toward dealing with global warming,'' said Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, a co-sponsor of the amendment that passed. He noted that the energy committee had announced plans for hearings on additional measures.
 Fred Krupp, president of Environmental Defense, a nonprofit advocacy group, said the amendment that passed, though ''inadequate,'' signaled a ''shift from debating whether we should do something to what we intend to do'' about global warming.
 To illustrate the changing dynamics of the issue, some environmentalists pointed to support for that amendment from Senator James M. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma, who previously called the idea of global warming a hoax.
 Repeating his arguments that ''there is not a relationship between manmade gases and climate change'' in a speech on the floor, Mr. Inhofe nonetheless praised the amendment for ''coming up with an approach that is measured and reasonable and will help convince a lot of the people that are right now participating in this religion called global warming to realize that maybe this is something that we shouldn't have to suffer economically for.''
 The provisions in the amendment, sponsored by Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska, are among several environmentally friendly measures in the Senate version of the energy bill. But it is headed for a collision with the version passed by the House and supported by the White House. The House bill emphasizes increasing the supply of carbon-based fuels like oil and gas instead.
 In addition to calling for businesses to voluntarily reduce the carbon-based emissions believed to contribute to global warming, Mr. Hagel's amendment authorizes loans and other forms of subsidies to promote new technologies that decrease pollution. It also directs the secretary of energy to adopt a ''national climate change strategy'' and authorizes the secretary of state to provide help to developing countries for technology to reduce carbon emissions.
 ''We all agree on the need for a clean environment and a stable climate,'' Mr. Hagel said on the floor, arguing that the bill would create ''public-private partnerships'' to reduce emissions. 
 The Senate also approved an amendment to the bill on Tuesday to allow the Justice Department or the Federal Trade Commission to sue the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries on antitrust grounds, a reaction to concern about oil prices now nearing $60 a barrel. It was sponsored by Senators Mike DeWine, Republican of Ohio, and Herb Kohl, Democrat of Wisconsin.
 Mr. Domenici said the provision was unlikely to survive a House-Senate conference on energy legislation.

HEADLINE: Run, Dick, Run

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
George Bush has a Dick Cheney problem.
 It's not the one you think: an overbearing, archconservative vice president imposing his will and ideas on a less-seasoned president.
 No, George Bush has a different V.P. problem. It is the fact that his vice president has made clear that he is not running for president after Mr. Bush's term expires in 2008. So Mr. Bush has no heir apparent. And that explains, in part, why his second term is drifting aimlessly, disconnected from the problems facing the country. 
 ''If President Bush had a vice president, or someone who was clearly designated as heir apparent to his administration, [the president] would have a more immediate incentive to widen his political base, to offer policies that would appeal more to the center,'' argued Don Baer, a former senior adviser to President Clinton. But if one looks at the sorts of policies that Mr. Bush has chosen, or not chosen, for his second term, it suggests that Mr. Bush ''is not thinking of the bigger implications'' for three years down the road, Mr. Baer added.
 For instance, the spending and tax cutting by the Bush team is ridiculously out of control. It will be a miracle if there is no market-induced implosion in the economy or the housing market in the next three years. But you can bet the farm there will have to be a huge correction after 2008 to get taxes and spending back in line. If Mr. Bush had a V.P. who was clearly anointed to succeed him, and whose success would be viewed as part of Mr. Bush's own legacy, it is hard to believe the president wouldn't be interested in a more sane fiscal policy. One thing for sure, his vice president would be.
 Instead, Mr. Bush seems to be governing as though he were on a permanent campaign -- much like Bill Clinton did. But Bill Clinton was on a permanent presidential campaign. Mr. Bush seems to be governing as if he were on a permanent primary campaign against John McCain in South Carolina.
 So far, the second Bush term, to the extent that it has any discernible agenda, seems to be to cater to the far-right wing of his party -- period. It's been urgent midnight meetings about Terri Schiavo and barely a daylight session about energy.
 With gasoline prices soaring, and the biggest beneficiaries being the very Arab dictatorships who are tacitly sponsoring the terrorists killing Americans in Iraq, it is blindingly obvious that our country needs a comprehensive strategy for reducing our energy consumption and developing alternative fuel systems. The president has utterly failed in this regard.
 To travel around America today is to find a country also deeply concerned about education, competition, health care and pensions. It is a country worried about how its kids are going to find jobs, retire and take care of elderly parents. But instead of focusing on a new New Deal to address the insecurities of the age of globalization, the president set off on his second term to take apart the old New Deal, trying to privatize Social Security, only feeding people's anxiety. It won't fly. 
 Yes, Mr. Bush has laid down a bold proposal for also fixing Social Security, but by not putting that front and center, it has gotten lost behind his private accounts obsession, which is not the country's priority. A president with a V.P. running behind him never would have let that happen.
 Mr. Bush would also not be taking the head-in-sand positions he has in opposition to stem cell research, climate change, population control and evolution -- positions from which centrist Republicans are now distancing themselves. Just last week, the Senate's top Republican energy-bill negotiator, Senator Pete Domenici, split from Mr. Bush and indicated that he believes the science is clear -- climate change is occurring -- and we need to do something about it. 
 If Mr. Bush's hope is to make the Republican Party into a permanent majority party and sustain his legacy, he would have picked a handful of significant proposals to widen the party's circle -- especially with the Democrats so clearly out of ideas. But instead of widening and broadening, by focusing on getting things accomplished that would benefit the vast middle of the country, Mr. Bush is catering to right-wing fetishes.
 If this is how he intends to use his political capital, that's his business. But if Mr. Bush had a vice president with an eye on 2008, I have to believe he or she would be saying to the president right now: ''Hey boss. What are you doing? Where are you going? How am I going to get elected running on this dog's breakfast of antiscience, head-in-the-sand policies?''

HEADLINE: Heartless Robber Baron Or Visionary Financier?

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:

Dark Genius of Wall Street
The Misunderstood Life of Jay Gould, King of the Robber Barons
By Edward J. Renehan Jr.
Illustrated. 352 pages. Basic Books. $30.
 In the freewheeling days of capitalism that followed the Civil War, the playing field was wide open for unscrupulous men to amass untold wealth. In a recent inflation-adjusted ranking of America's wealthiest men, Bill Gates scored an anemic 31 on a list led by John D. Rockefeller, Cornelius Vanderbilt and John Jacob Astor. Not far behind, at No.8, was Jay Gould, master of the dark arts of Wall Street speculation and the man who nearly cornered the market in gold. More than a century after his death, he still holds pride of place as the most devious, unprincipled and despised of all the robber barons.
Unfair, cries Edward J. Renehan Jr. in his revisionist biography of the man whom a London newspaper eulogized as a ''wrecker of industries and an impoverisher of men.'' Like the rest of his ilk, Gould was a street fighter who grabbed what he could with both hands and, whenever possible, kneed opponents in the groin or stuck a thumb in their eye. In other words, he played the game by the rules of the day. Secretive and humorless, he earned the hatred of the newspapers and the undying enmity of those whom he had bested in business deals. Their hostility, based partly on the mistaken belief that Gould was a Jew, haunted him in this life and the next, as one biographer after another restated the opinions and often erroneous stories circulated during Gould's brief but brilliant career. 
 For Mr. Renehan, who has written biographies of Theodore Roosevelt and the naturalist John Burroughs, Gould, the ''dark genius,'' was admittedly a Wall Street pirate, but he should also be appreciated as a visionary businessman. ''The highly imaginative, ruthless and easy-to-vilify Gilded Age manipulator of securities markets was also a detail-oriented owner of companies,'' he writes. Gould ''painstakingly consolidated dying railroads, transformed them into highly profitable megalines, and then did the same in maximizing the profitability of the Western Union, skillfully steering all his concerns through choppy economic seas in the 1880's.'' 
 Mr. Renehan's spirited argument is at least partly convincing, although, in his eagerness to produce a portrait rather than a caricature, he leans a little too heavily on the fond testimony of family members and devoted employees. It is gratifying to hear that Gould adored his wife and loved his children. It is good that that he gave generously to charities (on the sly, early in his career, lest the Darth Vader image suffer). But the man whom Mr. Renehan presents, in living color, does not make a very attractive figure, even if he is not, as one rival characterized him, ''the worst man on earth since the beginning of the Christian era.'' 
 Brilliant, yes. In deal after deal Gould got the better of the best. But as a personality, he was a somber, shadowy presence in an age dominated by gaudy, theatrical players. ''He seems to have approached all things, even his vain stabs at play, with a machinelike intensity,'' Mr. Renehan writes. 
 This makes him a challenge for the biographer. Jim Fisk, Gould's partner in crime when the two men fought Vanderbilt for control of the Erie Railroad, makes terrific copy. A backslapper, schmoozer and womanizer with a witty turn of phrase, he nearly steals the show, and it's a good thing for Mr. Renehan that murder sweeps him off the stage. Even the loathsome Daniel Drew, a pious Christian (he founded the seminary named after him) and irredeemable double-dealer, exerts a certain creepy fascination. Gould, by contrast, is a black hole.
 The deals, though, are something to behold, and Mr. Renehan describes them with zest. Readers who hope to keep up with the multiple back-stabbings and sleights of hand will need to be conversant with concepts like floating debt, stock watering, bear traps and consolidated bond issues. The battle for the Erie Railroad, in particular, is mind-bogglingly complex, but anyone can appreciate Gould's response to a rate war between the Erie and its rival, the New York Central, owned by Vanderbilt. After Vanderbilt cut the price for shipping a carload of cattle from $125 to $1, he delighted at reports of empty cars on the Erie. He did not realize that Gould and Fisk had bought up all the marketable livestock coming into Buffalo from the West and shipped it to New York City on the New York Central, reaping a windfall profit. 
 Gould often relied on the cruder methods of the day. He was not above planting rumors in the press, bribing politicians and judges, or trading on inside information. But he was also an artist. His rough and tumble days as a curb trader on Wall Street transformed him into a shrewd, skillful financier, a ''maestro of margins,'' as Mr. Renehan puts it, ''capable of creating capital out of thin air and gaining control of companies by using just a few dollars reflected in a hall of financial mirrors: funhouses of convertible bonds, proxies and leveraged cash.'' 
 Mr. Renehan would like the reader to believe that Gould was something more. His best case lies in the integrated railroad networks that Gould built from the Missouri Pacific and Union Pacific, which together represented more than 10 percent of the railway mileage in the United States. Gould had treated the Erie as nothing more than a vehicle for stock manipulation, but with painstaking, hands-on management, he built his Western railroads into efficient, highly profitable operations.
 He loved his family and he loved his trains. Yes, he tried to buy up all the gold in the United States and touched off a financial panic. But is that any reason to hold a grudge?

HEADLINE: Rice Urges Arab States to Send Envoys to Baghdad 

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, June 21 

 BODY:
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, joining a two-day international conference on Iraq, said Tuesday that she hoped more Arab nations would send ambassadors to Baghdad and upgrade their diplomatic missions to show support for the Shiite-dominated Iraqi government.
 But her comments, spoken to reporters on her plane traveling here, came as European and Arab diplomats expressed impatience over Iraq's troubles and as other Bush administration officials expressed frustration over the slowness of the Arab countries, most of them Sunni-dominated, in providing debt relief to Iraq. 
 Arab diplomats said security concerns were the main reason most of Iraq's Sunni neighbors had not sent ambassadors to Iraq, noting that King Abdullah II of Jordan said last month that his country would send an ambassador when it was safe. 
 But the diplomats also said they remained concerned about Shiite influence in the government of Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari and, by extension, the influence of Iran, which is ruled by Shiite clerics. 
 To allay concerns about Shiite dominance, Ms. Rice said envoys of roughly 80 countries and leaders of the United Nations, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund would urge Mr. Jaafari to reach out more to Sunnis and speed up writing a constitution that protects minorities.
 ''The international community is saying to the Iraqis that they should be as inclusive as possible, particularly with the Sunni community,'' Ms. Rice said. She said the Iraqis were committed to enshrining minority rights in the new constitution, ''but it will be good to reinforce that with them through the international community.''
 Ms. Rice traveled to Brussels after working on Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, and after stops in Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia to press for more democracy. She made clear that the United States wanted more worldwide support for the American-led efforts in Iraq.
 ''It is important that Iraqis receive political support from the region and from Arab states,'' she said, adding that ''more diplomatic representation from the region'' would be helpful. Only Egypt, she said, has sent an ambassador to Baghdad.
 The Brussels meeting is the latest in a series of international conferences on Iraq in the last couple of years. Ms. Rice said it was ''an opportunity to build really a kind of new international partnership for Iraq.'' But past conferences have produced mixed results, particularly in garnering economic aid and troops. The Defense Department reports that the number of non-American foreign troops has fallen to 21,000 after Spain and other countries pulled out, and many other countries plan to follow suit next year.
 Financial support has been disappointing, some American and European officials say. An initial donors' conference in Madrid in the fall of 2003 brought pledges of more than $13 billion in aid over three years, but only $2 billion has materialized.
 Part of the reason is security, which has hampered aid projects, but some countries remain uncertain about American efforts to pacify the country and spend American reconstruction funds. Of nearly $19 billion in economic aid appropriated by Congress in 2003, only about $7 billion has been spent.
 In addition, efforts to clear up Iraq's $110 billion in debt have stalled after making early headway. Former Secretary of State James A. Baker III negotiated forgiveness of about 80 percent of Iraqi debt held by the so-called Paris Club of leading industrial-nation lenders. But that amounted to only about $40 billion of the total it owes.
 Much of the rest of the debt is held by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and other Persian Gulf countries. They have resisted forgiving the debt because of disputes over how much is owed and an uneasiness that Iraq will become a Shiite-dominated country influenced by Iran. 
 Ms. Rice said Tuesday that there would be talks in Brussels about debt but probably no new agreements. An aide traveling with her said the conference was ''a coming out party'' for Mr. Jaafari, but Arab and European diplomats said the real challenge lay in a series of tight deadlines facing Iraq.
 Since the Jan. 30 elections, which were boycotted by most Sunnis, the constitution-writing process has been fractious and slow. A committee to write the charter has only recently been formed, and it is supposed to finish the job by Aug. 15 so it can be ratified by Oct. 15 and elections can be held by Dec. 15.
 On a side issue, Ms. Rice said she had ''no intention'' of meeting any envoy of Iran, which might send a delegate. 
 Last fall, at an Iraq conference in Sharm el Sheik, Egypt, former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell was seated by his hosts next to the Iranian foreign minister and had to make small talk, much to his irritation.

HEADLINE: A Risky Favor on Nuclear Exports

 BODY:
With concerns about nuclear terrorism on the rise, one would think it a no-brainer that Congress should be tightening, not loosening, controls over the export of bomb-grade uranium. Yet the comprehensive energy bill that passed the House and is pending in the Senate would foolishly weaken restrictions on the export of highly enriched uranium to make medical isotopes. 
 These isotopes are used to diagnose and treat illnesses like cancer, and the measure has been paraded as critical to nuclear medicine. But the real need appears to be a desire by isotope manufacturers for laxer standards. The Senate should back away from this precipice.
 Under current law, written by Senator Charles Schumer of New York, the federal government is allowed to ship highly enriched uranium to reactor operators abroad as long as they agree to switch to safer low-enriched uranium as soon as technically and economically feasible. But the chief supplier of medical isotopes for the American market, a Canadian company called MDS Nordion, is said to have broken its pledge to cooperate. Incredibly, the pending legislation would reward this resistance by easing the rules for exporting uranium to make isotopes in Canada and four European nations.
 Some medical groups are backing the relaxation. But the Physicians for Social Responsibility, which takes a broader view, notes that the law will not disrupt supplies as long as manufacturers work conscientiously toward safer forms of uranium. In the interests of reducing the amount of bomb-grade uranium in circulation, the Senate should support amendments being prepared by Mr. Schumer and Senator Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona, to keep the current restrictions in place.

HEADLINE: Romanian Law Backfires, Leaving Orphans in Limbo

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL; International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: BUCHAREST, Romania 

 BODY:
A new law here on the ''protection and promotion of the rights of the child'' has done little to protect Vasile, a 7-year-old who has lived his whole life in an orphanage in Botosani.
 More than two years ago, Becky Hubbell, a pharmaceutical executive from Overland Park, Kan., submitted the required papers to adopt the wide-eyed, dark-haired boy, whom she and her husband had met during medical missions here. 
 But before that process was completed, the government passed its new child welfare law, which essentially forbids international adoptions. The measure has left hundreds of families without children they had counted as theirs. More important, critics say, the sweeping law leaves thousands of abandoned Romanian children stranded indefinitely in institutions or foster care. 
 ''You have a child in your heart and you've made all the arrangements, and it's clear that child wants a family, too,'' Ms. Hubbell said. ''But for Vasile, time is passing without the stability of a home. And that's harder and harder to make up for.''
 When, in 2002, officials in Brussels demanded that Romania clean up a chaotic and sometimes corrupt child welfare system as a condition for admission to the European Union, Romanian politicians jumped into action. Law 272, written in collaboration with European Union advisers, aimed to halt decades of mismanagement with edicts that critics say were overzealous and impractical.
 In response to criticism that orphans were growing up in sterile institutions, the government mandated that no child under 2 could live in one; the new law, it noted, favored reuniting children with biological relatives or placing them in foster care. In response to charges that foreign adoptions were so poorly managed that they sometimes resembled child trafficking, the government declared there would be no more. 
 Experts applaud the central goal: to encourage Romanian families to stay together and to end the longstanding practice here of abandoning unwanted children. But many child advocates doubt that this poor country, just 15 years removed from a brutal dictatorship, will be able to find good living situations quickly for its huge population of orphaned and abandoned children. Many children currently in orphanages and hospitals, they say, will be stranded.
 ''There are good impulses behind the law -- to provide more assistance to mothers, to keep children out of institutions -- and we all felt the system needed more standards,'' said Gabi Mihaela Comanescu, program director of the ProChild Romania Foundation. ''But there are problems. For example, there are older children who are as adoptable as ever, but there is no one to adopt them now. Also, the law says every abandoned child under 2 should be in foster care, but as far as I know there aren't nearly enough foster homes.''
 The unintended result is that deserted infants are now passing their precious first years in a hospital ward. There are close to 10,000 children abandoned at hospitals each year in Romania, according to a new study by Unicef, and up to 50,000 children in the care of the state.
 Romania's unusual tradition of child abandonment began with a ban on birth control imposed in 1966 by Nicolae Ceausescu, the former dictator, to increase the population. Within a year, women began dropping off unwanted children at state orphanages or hospitals. Their logic was that ''the government wanted them, so the government should raise them,'' according to the Unicef report.
 Child abandonment has continued at the same level for 40 years, said Pierre Poupard, head of the Unicef office in Bucharest, even though birth control is widely available in post-Communist Romania. Now, mothers desert babies because they feel they cannot afford to raise them.
 Before Law 272 took effect on Jan. 1, politicians from France, Italy and the United States, among others, vigorously lobbied the government to rethink the ban on international adoptions, or at least to allow cases already started to proceed. In January the new Romanian prime minister, Calin Popescu-Tariceanu, said he would ''not forget foreign families'' who had taken steps to adopt Romanian children. To date, however, nothing has been done. 
 According to the Romanian Adoptions Office, 467 babies were adopted by foreigners in 2002, although a partial moratorium was already in effect. Before that, several hundred Romanian children were adopted annually by families in Italy, France, Israel and the United States, according to adoption groups in those countries. Today the number is zero.
 Instead, Romanian county child welfare officials are now required to ''reintegrate or integrate the children into their biological or extended families or to place them with a Romanian foster family,'' said Theodora Bertzi, head of the adoption office.
 New families are being trained in foster care to meet the need, she said. Romanian couples (or grandparents living overseas) are being encouraged to adopt unwanted children. Orphanages, called ''placement centers,'' can take children over 2 when no home is available.
 Florin Catanescu, 28, grew up in the centers after being abandoned at birth by a schizophrenic mother. Handsome and articulate, he carries his past in one small photo album decorated with a child's glittery stickers. He is skeptical about Law 272, at least in the short term.
 ''I just don't think the resources are sufficient in our country for this new law, and attitudes will not change that quickly,'' said Mr. Catanescu, who is starting a nongovernmental organization to help graduates of the centers integrate into society: find jobs, rent apartments, order food in a restaurant. ''Children will be stuck -- there are still so many families who abandon children.''
 Because so many of the children are given up for economic reasons, they continue to have contact with their mothers even if they live in orphanages for years, making it hard to define their family status.
 Under the old law, if a mother disappeared for more than six months, the child could be put up for adoption. But the new law, with its emphasis on maintaining biological families, stipulates that a mother's right to her child is indefinite, extending through years of separation.
 In order for a child to be put up for adoption, the mother must sign a paper formally ending the relationship, which is impossible in cases like Vasile's, in which the mother has long since disappeared. Other relatives have to decline the child as well.
 At the Sunbeam Complex of Community Service, a placement center 60 miles from Bucharest, 15 of the 16 children (aged 4 to 9) have had some contact with their biological families. Only one girl, who is 4, is technically adoptable. The tidy two-story house, lying amid dusty fields, is far superior to the huge, impersonal orphanages that made the child welfare system of Communist Romania so notorious.
 On a recent afternoon, young residents busied themselves drawing pictures at low tables and playing with blocks. But before Law 272, five children left here each year, adopted by foreign families, said Letitia Stefanescu, the home's director.
 The new law ''has many good aspects,'' Ms. Stefanescu said, like offering preventive counseling and financial assistance to young mothers deemed at risk of abandoning babies. But she acknowledged the downside for the children in her care: ''International adoptions gave them a chance for a family.''
 A cute 9-year-old with pigtails, who can only be identified as M.S., said, ''I like being here, but I would like more to be with my mom.'' The girl's mother, who lives nearby, has not visited for several years.
 Ms. Stefanescu has faith that the faults of the new system will be dealt with: New programs will encourage or force some mothers to pick up abandoned children; other children will find foster homes. The four-year-old, she hopes, will be adopted by Romanians, even though they traditionally do not adopt older children. 
 The Unicef report said it was crucial to take steps to prevent future abandonment, like allowing mothers to start rooming with their newborns in order to encourage bonding and prevent desertion.
 Becky Hubbell, who spends holidays volunteering at the Botosani orphanage, says it is great that the government is now helping families stay together. But in the meantime, she said, ''there are kids like Vasile who have no options but adoption abroad.
 ''We already provide support for him,'' she said. ''We will be his family, no matter what.''

HEADLINE: New Math For Summer: The Cost Of Chill 

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
WITH the dog days of summer just around the corner, homeowners who need a new central air-conditioner face the usual tough choice: buy a cheap but inefficient system that racks up high utility bills, or splurge on a more efficient but more expensive model that costs less to run.
 That equation changes in January, when new national efficiency standards take effect that will eliminate the least efficient models. 
 The new regulations will make the machines on the market more expensive and physically larger, a problem in some houses. Further, some consumers may be confused by the products offered. Emerson, the air-conditioner manufacturer, commissioned a survey that found that hardly any consumers understood how efficiency is measured. 
 Environmentalists predict, though, that consumers will quickly embrace the more efficient models, and that people who choose air-conditioners for others -- primarily landlords and home builders -- will be forced to buy units that make better financial sense for the residents. 
 Not everyone makes the same calculation about the cost of keeping cool. For example, Jan and Alan Kaplan, of Potomac, Md., found their 20-year-old air-conditioner conked out a few days ago, and they decided to replace it with a basic model for $2,450, not a more efficient one that would have cost $1,100 more. 
 ''The price differential was so much, and it was one of those expenditures I wasn't counting on anyway,'' Mr. Kaplan said. ''I didn't want to make it any higher than it needed to be.''
 The efficiency of central air-conditioners is measured by an obscure yardstick called Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, known as SEER, which is a way of measuring how much electricity is consumed for each unit of heat removed from the house. The current minimum is SEER 10, and the new rule will make the minimum 13, which means the machines will do 30 percent more work with the same amount of energy. Models up to SEER 19 are already on the market; those below 13 are being phased out. 
 For environmentalists, the new standard means saving energy when demand for power is the highest, so that fewer power plants will be needed overall. ''You can be comfortable knowing you're going to get air-conditioning in a way that's not going to burden the electric grid, and will help clean the air while keeping you cool,'' said Kit Kennedy, a lawyer at the Natural Resources Defense Council. 
 Yet environmentalists and manufacturers disagree about how to accurately calculate the cost differential between a SEER 10 and a SEER 13. The American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy puts the figure at $171, but an industry group, the Air-conditioning and Refrigeration Institute, says it's $763. The Energy Department weighs in at $341, saying the price is justified by the cost of the electricity saved. 
 The new standard was adopted after an epic legal battle. The Clinton administration produced a flurry of appliance standards in its last days, including one for central air-conditioners. But when the Bush administration took office, it blocked many of these rules and proposed a standard of 12 instead, which would have meant an energy savings of 20 percent. Environmentalists sued. The air-conditioning industry was divided over which standard to adopt; finally, opponents of the more lax standard gave up after an appeals court ruled in favor of the 13 standard. 
 New standards for window air-conditioners, water heaters, dishwashers, washers and dryers are also taking hold. A standard for home furnaces, also big energy users, was expected in 1994, but the effort to find a standard has stalled. 
 Andrew deLaski, executive director of the Appliance Standards Awareness Project, a nonprofit group in Boston, said that most of the new standards benefit society because the cumulative savings are large, even if the savings to an individual are small. 
 A new refrigerator with the Environmental Protection Agency's ''energy star'' rating for efficiency, for example, might reduce electric consumption by 10 to 15 percent. 
 Total consumption, however, is modest, about 550 kilowatt-hours a year, so the savings is only about 50 kilowatt-hours a year, Mr. deLaski said. ''If you're paying a dime, that's five bucks over the course of a year,'' he said. ''It's not enough to help you make the mortgage payment.'' 
 But central air-conditioners can use hundreds of dollars of electricity a month in summer, and many of those sold next year will use half the electricity of the models that were sold 20 years ago. This means that overall savings could be substantial for homeowners, as well as for the country as a whole. 
 At Emerson, Tom Bettcher, executive vice president, said that many of the models being replaced are from many years ago, and well below the SEER 10 rating. Thus, he said, ''a lot of people will see a nice step-up when they make this change.'' 
 But contractors who sell equipment may not push the most efficient -- and most expensive -- models, he said, because they do not want to seem overpriced.

HEADLINE: Eager to Be Noticed, Croatian Artists Set Their Sights on New York

BYLINE: By CAROL KINO

 BODY:
Rich in artists but relatively bereft of international galleries and collectors, the countries of the former Yugoslavia have yet to develop a strong art market. To get in on the action and gain international recognition for their work, some of their artists have decided that the logical first step is to infiltrate New York.
 Among those leading the way is the Croatian artist Andreja Kuluncic, who is amassing material for a semi-serious guide to the New York art world.
 Ms. Kuluncic, one of this year's artists in residence at the nonprofit exhibition space Art in General in TriBeCa, arrived in the United States in April and began canvassing local curators, dealers, artists and collectors for their opinions on what constitutes art-world success and how best to attain it. The results of her research are on view at Art in General through Saturday, and through July 15 by appointment. 
 Her advice manual, ''A Dummies' Guide to the New York Art World,'' which will also incorporate research conducted in Croatia, is to be published in December. ''The guide is cynical,'' Ms. Kuluncic cautioned visitors who attended her opening presentation at Art in General. ''It is not really a way to be successful.''
 Cynical or not, international recognition is a pressing issue for Croatia, long recognized as a cultural hotbed of the former Yugoslavia. Today, its artists sell their work primarily through Western European galleries or to Croatian museums, some of which are planning expansions and have begun to pursue contemporary work more aggressively. 
 Ms. Kuluncic, 36, who has shown her work at European art fairs like Documenta, Manifesta and the Liverpool Biennial, as well as at the Whitney Museum of American Art, said that Croatia's application for membership in the European Union had lent momentum to the artists' quest for international attention. 
 ''Because we are entering the E.U., we are thinking about what we have to offer -- in all fields as well as in art,'' she said. 
 Recently, too, as art-world buzz has developed around the formerly Communist countries of Eastern Europe, international curators have come hunting. ''We don't want to be colonized,'' Ms. Kuluncic said. ''Curators come and they already know what they want to see, and we don't want that. We have to make a market where we can sell what we already have.''
 What Croatia does have in abundance, says Roxana Marcoci, a curator at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, is performance, video and installation art. ''Right now there is a lot of continuity with the sort of avant-garde tradition that was alive during the Socialist republic,'' said Ms. Marcoci, who in 2002 organized ''Here Tomorrow,'' a huge survey of contemporary Croatian art, for the Museum of Contemporary Art in Zagreb. 
 ''There are occasions when you see painting and sculpture, but that's not the main bulk of work. A lot of it is video-based and performance-based, or institutional critique. There are also many collaborative groups.'' 
 Croatia has had a strong video scene since the 1970's: several of its artists, including Sanja Ivekovic and Dalibor Martinis, are considered pioneers of the movement. Work like Ms. Kuluncic's, which tends to combine sociological investigation and political activism with multimedia elements and the written word, is also fairly typical. So are performances, like those of Slaven Tolj, known for body art that pushes the limits of physical endurance.
 During the fighting in the Balkans in the 1990's, Croatia experienced something of a creative diaspora as some artists decamped for Vienna or Budapest, or for Italy, Germany, the Netherlands or the United States. Now many have returned, bringing with them fresh information and contacts, while others have developed transnational careers. 
 For artists, misconceptions are one legacy of the war in the former Yugoslavia, which involved many different ethnic and national groups. When curators and critics come to the Balkans, Mr. Martinis said, ''they are not ready to see work like Bill Viola's, or some sort of cool conceptual art.'' 
 ''People expect to see a messy, not too clear kind of work that has more to do with temperament and ethnicity,'' he said.
 At the Croatian Pavilion at this year's Venice Biennale, the artist Tomo Savic Gecan is exhibiting a line of text that notes how visitors to a gallery in Amsterdam might affect the temperature of a swimming pool in Estonia. 
 While this focus on process and the evanescent moment makes arresting exhibitions, it can be tough to package for the market. ''The gallerists know their rules,'' said Sandra Sterle, a multimedia artist based in Split, Croatia, ''and you have to apply them if you want to sell. The rules of the gallery are rather similar to those of the boutique.'' 
 In 2004, Ms. Sterle sold her first piece to an American collector through Galerie Jablonka in Cologne: the DVD component of her installation ''On the Dune,'' based on a performance in which she pours paint on a canvas spread on the beach, a la Jackson Pollock. 
 Recently, the dealer urged Ms. Sterle to formally mount a group of new photographs, rather than pinning them to the wall, to make them more salable. She refused. ''I don't see why I should apply these rules for every piece,'' she said.
 Like the other countries of the former Yugoslavia, Croatia had a strong and lively avant-garde for most of the 20th century. The advent of Communism after World War II allowed the art scene to develop without an emphasis on market profit, yet Tito's maverick government allowed many artists to travel abroad frequently and keep abreast of developments elsewhere. 
 After Tito's death in 1980, on through the civil war in the early 1990's and the authoritarian, nationalistic rule of President Franjo Tudjman, which ended in 1999, these freedoms were sharply curtailed.
 Today, said Katherine Carl, a curator at New York's Drawing Center who is writing a doctoral dissertation on early Yugoslav conceptual art, ''There is a very strong pool of artists all over the former Yugoslavia. 
 ''But it's economically and politically different in all the different areas because of the breakup of the different countries,'' she said. 
 Slovenia, which achieved independence without extensive fighting, is generally regarded as the furthest ahead in terms of infrastructure for artists. It played host to Manifesta in 2000 and today boasts at least two commercial contemporary galleries that work the international art fair circuit. Meanwhile, the contemporary art sectors of Serbia, Montenegro, Macedonia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina are struggling. 
 Having emerged from a recession and gained a more moderate government, Croatia is chafing at the bit. ''In both Croatia and Slovenia, people are reaching out,'' Ms. Carl said. ''But in Croatia they've had to make the channels more diligently.''
 In addition, the country's troubles and its lack of an art market have in some ways given its artists a special tenacity and a deep sense of purpose. ''When somebody is really young, it's much better to make work without market,'' said Zlatko Kopljar, 43, who finished art school in Venice in 1991, around the time the fighting in Croatia began. ''If you don't get anything and still you are making art, that means you really want to do it; you really want to communicate. I couldn't give up, and I know a lot of people who didn't, believe me.''
 Mr. Kopljar made the first sale of his life in 2004, when an American collector spotted his work at the Sao Paulo Biennial: a suite of photographs that picture Mr. Kopljar kneeling, head bowed, before some of the sites that have shaped his imaginative life -- the United Nations, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and Times Square. 
 Essentially, that sale -- and others since -- ''changes nothing,'' Mr. Kopljar said. ''But now I have sold a little bit of work, I can feel a little bit more relieved. I am not in existential cramps.''
 ''Whether that's good or bad,'' he added, ''I cannot say.''

HEADLINE: Yields on Treasuries Plunge; Slower Global Growth Is Seen

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Ten-year Treasury notes had their biggest price gain in almost seven months yesterday on speculation that slower global economic growth will cause the Federal Reserve to end a series of interest rate increases sooner than previously expected. 
 Treasuries followed a rally in European bonds for a second day as investors increased bets that the European Central Bank would cut its interest rate target after Sweden lowered borrowing costs. 
 ''The possibility of rate cuts in Europe will keep global yields depressed and in turn will have an indirect impact on U.S. benchmark rates,'' said Amitabh Arora, chief interest rate strategist at Lehman Brothers Holdings in New York. 
 The yield on the benchmark 10-year note fell 0.10 percentage point, to 3.94 percent, the lowest since June 8. It was the biggest one-day drop since December. 
 The price of the 41/8 percent note due in May 2015 rose more than 7/8, or $8.75 per $1,000 face amount, to 10117/32 . 
 Two members of the Bank of England's rate-setting committee called for a rate cut at its last meeting, minutes released yesterday showed. And Sweden's central bank reduced interest rates yesterday by more than economists expected. 
 Lower rates in Europe ''have given rise to the credibility of a global growth slowdown, and what that could do is turn into a round of global easing,'' said Kevin Flanagan, a fixed-income strategist at Morgan Stanley in Purchase, N.Y. 
 Treasuries are also benefiting from speculation that oil prices above $59 a barrel will hinder economic growth. Higher energy costs may curb consumer spending and erode corporate profits, according to Satoshi Asai, who helps oversee $1 billion of bonds at Sompo Japan Asset Management. 
 Charlie Bean, the chief economist of the Bank of England, and a departing committee member, Marian Bell, both voted to reduce the repurchase rate by 25 basis points on concern that growth would probably be weaker than forecast, minutes of the bank's meeting on June 8 and 9 showed. The bank voted 7 to 2 to keep the rate unchanged. 
 Traders in the United States pared bets on how much the Fed would increase its target rate over the next few months. The yield on the December eurodollar futures contract fell 7.5 basis points, to 3.885 percent, the lowest in two weeks.

HEADLINE: Flight 15 to Basra: Few Perks, But No Bombs. No Complaints.

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG

DATELINE: ABOARD FLIGHT 15, over southern Iraq 

 BODY:
The smiling flight attendants strode down the aisle of the Boeing 727 in crisp green uniforms, handing out cold cans of Sprite and pieces of cake.
 But it was more than just the food service, a throwback to another age of aviation, that brought a sense of relief to the passengers.
 Just minutes earlier, the plane had leveled off after a steep corkscrew ascent from Baghdad International Airport. It was cruising now at 23,000 feet. In one piece. 
 No smoke trails from surface-to-air missiles, no rocket attacks, no mortar hits. 
 ''The flight will be good, God willing,'' Awadees Razoiam, 55, an oil geologist, said as he bit into his cake.
 Such is the scene aboard the Iraqi equivalent of the New York-to-Washington shuttle -- a 55-minute hop between Baghdad and the southern oil city of Basra that costs $75 for a one-way coach ticket. The flight, begun this month, is the first domestic service operated by state-owned Iraqi Airways since the American-led invasion. 
 There are no frequent-flier benefits and no free newspapers at the gate. But the flight allows quick and safe passage (relatively speaking) between the capital and the city at the heart of Iraq's economy, making it perhaps the most significant in-country transportation development since the war.
 Jets carry travelers over a parched landscape containing some of the most dangerous terrain in the country: over the insurgent-dominated area south of Baghdad known as the Triangle of Death; over swaths of marshlands plagued by bandits; over the roadways in the south, where radical Shiite fighters plant bombs to ambush British Army convoys.
 There is little to love about the six-hour drive between Baghdad and Basra, Mr. Razoiam said. ''You have to hide all your money and all your jewels.'' 
 Iraqi officials say the flight is a crucial step in restoring an air network that was ravaged by the economic sanctions imposed after the Persian Gulf war of 1991.
 Residents of Basra, a relatively safe city of at least two million that is the second-largest in Iraq, also boast that the new route could herald the rebirth of the city as a Middle East aviation hub. Because Baghdad is steeped in violence, they say, business people and tourists will want to fly into Basra instead. Iraqi Airways officials say they hope to start direct flights between Basra and London by the end of the summer. 
 From 1932 to 1964, Al Maaqal Airport in Basra, built by the British in the twilight of empire, served as the main commercial airport in Iraq and a major regional hub, with Trans World Airlines and others touching down there on a traverse of Asia, said Ibrahim Abid Ali, an airport manager and air traffic controller. But in 1964, the national government ordered international flights to go through Baghdad instead. Befitting its colonial past, Al Maaqal now serves as a base for the British Army, charged with controlling southern Iraq.
 Iraqi Airways operates out of a relatively new site, Basra International Airport, lined with Italian marble and completed by German engineers in 1987. It was inaugurated with an Iraqi Airways flight to Asia. But most flights were grounded by the sanctions of the 1990's, and it was not until 2001, after other Middle Eastern airlines had already defied the United Nations by flying into Baghdad, that Iraqi Airways began regular daily flights between Baghdad and Basra. 
 The British military occupies half the main terminal of the new airport but is expected to leave this fall. The American government has already hired contractors to begin renovating the airport and expects to spend at least $40 million on the project.
 ''The opening of Basra airport gives us a lot of optimism,'' said Muhammad al-Waeli, the governor of Basra Province, referring to the airport's reopening this month. ''It will help bring investment and capital to our city. It's a safe airport, safer than Baghdad.''
 The airport has the capacity to handle up to 2.5 million passengers a year, said Abdul-Razzaq Kassim, the airport director. But at the moment, the only commercial flights are the ones that Iraqi Airways runs three times a week to Baghdad. 
 From the capital, Iraqi Airways also runs daily flights to Amman, Jordan, and Damascus, Syria, and three weekly flights to the Kurdish provincial capital of Erbil, which started June 14. Royal Jordanian also runs daily flights to Amman and smaller airlines serve Dubai. 
 So a traveler can now fly into Basra or Erbil from outside the country with just a single connection, making it possible to avoid setting foot in the volatile streets of the capital -- in particular, the bomb-infested stretch of highway from the airport to downtown Baghdad.
 That drive is considered the most dangerous part of air travel here. 
 Then there are the corkscrew ascents and descents to evade any projectiles fired by mujahedeen.
 In November 2003, a DHL cargo plane was forced to make an emergency landing after a wing was hit in a rocket attack. There have been no such attacks reported recently. 
 ''The airport is secured very well, and we have a special procedure for flying,'' said Abid Ali, the director general of Iraqi Airways and a former pilot. 
 Some days, the airline runs up to five flights carrying a total of 700 passengers to Amman, and planes to Basra are half full, he added. 
 That estimate appears optimistic. On this particular flight, there were only 24 passengers, far fewer than a fifth of capacity. 
 Iraqi Airways has plans to expand its international routes. The airline expects to lease seven or eight additional planes to add to its fleet of two jets in the coming weeks and will start flying to Dubai by the end of June and to Istanbul soon afterward, Mr. Ali said. Then there is a bid to get slots at Heathrow Airport near London. The airline also has Boeing jets stranded in nearby capitals from the start of the 1991 war -- five aircraft in Amman, five in Tehran and three in Tunis. 
 The passengers choosing to fly the new Basra route included an American security contractor in a tight Harley-Davidson T-shirt and green flak jacket, and a biology professor from Basra University returning from a conference in India. 
 A 70-year-old lawyer named Ghassan Malak, traveling to Kuwait, said the rebirth of Iraqi Airways was ''very, very important'' for the future of this embattled country.
 Mr. Razoiam, the oil geologist on his way home from a business trip in Amman, said he would not be flying if the South Oil Company were not paying the $75 for a one-way ticket. ''It's a little bit difficult for ordinary people to take this,'' he said.
 But the experience was clearly novel for those on board. As the pilot and his three aides pored over navigational maps in the cockpit, the passengers stared transfixed out the windows. Here was a tributary of one of the great Mesopotamian rivers, there a thick grove of date palms.
 As the plane began its descent into Basra, the dark spongy mass of the marshes, once the biggest wetlands ecosystem in the Middle East, came into view. Soon the towers of oil refineries appeared, spewing flames from the burn-off of natural gas. Mr. Razoiam leapt up and rushed to a window across the aisle.
 Then, in an admonition familiar to fliers worldwide, a flight attendant pointed out that the seatbelt sign had been turned on.

HEADLINE: Sony Buys Warner Brothers' Matrix Game

BYLINE: By LAURA M. HOLSON

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, June 22 

 BODY:
It did not take Hollywood long to figure out that it is difficult to make money in the video game business.
 Three months after Warner Brothers Entertainment started Matrix Online, the studio's first internal foray into video games, the company said that the game would be acquired by a rival, Sony Online Entertainment. 
 The deal to sell the rights for an undisclosed amount was reached last week. In addition, Warner Brothers has signed a licensing agreement with Sony to develop an online game based on Warner Brothers' DC Comics characters, including Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman. 
 For many in Hollywood, the Matrix deal is an indication of how tricky it is for a studio -- even one with a hot property -- to make money from an online game if it does not find a mainstream audience. 
 Multiplayer online games like Matrix Online or the popular EverQuest by Sony need to sign up hundreds of thousands of players to turn a profit. 
 With fewer than 50,000 subscribers enrolled to play Matrix Online, a far lower number than the studio projected, Warner Brothers executives said there was little economic incentive to keep the game.
 ''It's certainly disappointing that we are not the runaway hit like we would have hoped for,'' said Jason Hall, a senior vice president at Warner Brothers Interactive Entertainment, who oversaw the game's development.
 Mr. Hall said the game's content would still be overseen by Warner Brothers and, as part of the acquisition, about 20 to 30 employees who created the game are expected to join Sony.
 Warner Brothers is one of the few Hollywood studios to aggressively court video game users by both working with partners (it created the video game for ''Batman Begins'' with Electronic Arts) and by developing video games.
 Mr. Hall declined to say how much Warner Brothers paid to develop Matrix Online, but industry analysts suggested that the cost was about $20 million. 
 As part of the deal with Sony, Warner Brothers is expected to share in future profits of the game in an effort to recoup some investment. 
 The development of Matrix Online was a struggle from the start, with Warner Brothers twice delaying the game's debut. Mr. Hall said that the decision to sell the rights came on the heels of the company's decision to be a partner with Sony in an online game for its DC Comics characters.
 Along with Matrix Online's development costs, Warner Brothers was paying for the infrastructure to maintain it, including customer service.
 Now, Mr. Hall said, Warner Brothers ''can spend more on content.'' In the end, having Sony manage the game will be better for the consumer, he said.

HEADLINE: Report Says Space Program Is Lacking Money and Focus

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
Three weeks before the Discovery is to return the nation's space shuttle fleet to orbit, two influential experts say the Bush administration's plans for human space exploration are doomed to failure without a major infusion of money and fundamental changes in space policy. 
 ''Current U.S. space policy presents a paradoxical picture of high ambition and diminishing commitment,'' the experts state in a paper being released today by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in Cambridge, Mass. 
 The paper was written by George Abbey, director of the Johnson Space Center in Houston from 1995 to 2001, and Dr. Neal Lane, the White House science adviser under President Bill Clinton from 1998 to 2001. 
 It comes from a series of workshops with space companies and international agencies and from experts meeting at the academy and at Rice University in Houston, where both authors of the paper now work as senior fellows of the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy. 
 The authors say they are hopeful about NASA's new administrator, Michael D. Griffin, who has technical expertise and has begun to change a management culture widely blamed for the loss of the shuttle Columbia two years ago. But they wrote that ''current space policy is ill defined and its future path is uncertain.''
 A NASA spokesman, Allard Beutel, said the agency would have no comment because officials had not seen the paper. But in an interview last week, Dr. Griffin vigorously defended the administration's space plans, saying, ''If I were to write down on a sheet of paper what NASA should be doing, it would be very like what we are trying to do today.'' 
 A House staff member on the Republican side said it was unclear whether the critique would have much impact in Washington. The staff member, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of House rules, said that the academy did not have a high profile in the Capitol and that Dr. Lane and Mr. Abbey, while respected, ''have some baggage'' as former officials in a Democratic administration. 
 But other experts said the paper was important because of the authors' knowledge and background and the uncharacteristic bluntness of their criticism.
 ''It means a lot, because they are well known,'' said John D. Steinbruner, director of the Center for International and Security Studies at the University of Maryland. 
 Of the administration's plan to send a crew to the Moon and Mars, announced in January 2004, Mr. Steinbruner added, ''They are clearly suggesting it is hollow.'' 
 Mr. Abbey and Dr. Lane identify what they say are four failures of national policy that hinder future success in space:
 Inadequate planning for NASA's future.
 Erosion of international cooperation in space.
 Congressional restrictions on the export of space technology that have choked the flow of sales to other nations and make it difficult to share information with foreign partners.
 A projected shortfall in the future United States science and engineering work force, made worse by post-Sept. 11 restrictions on visas for foreign students.
 The president's ''vision for space exploration,'' announced in January 2004, calls for completing the International Space Station by 2010, and for ending the troubled space shuttle program and creating a new Crew Exploration Vehicle that will return to the Moon by 2020 ''as the launching point for missions beyond,'' including to Mars. 
 While the authors call the president's space plan ''bold by any measure,'' they wrote: ''It is incomplete, in part, because it raises serious questions about the future commitment of the United States to astronomy and to planetary, earth and space science. It is unrealistic from the perspectives of cost, timetable and technological capability.'' 
 They added, ''Pursuit of the NASA Plan, as formulated, is likely to result in substantial harm to the U.S. space program.''
 In an interview, Mr. Abbey said the current space plan called for about $5 billion in the next five years from the annual $16 billion NASA budget to be directed to the Moon-to-Mars plan. Getting to the Moon in the 1960's cost more than $125 billion in dollars adjusted for inflation, he said, so ''$5 billion a year probably doesn't even get you to orbit.'' 
 The paper said the space program had pursued a go-it-alone strategy in many areas, leading many of the nation's space partners to express concern. And because of restrictions on American exports of space technology, the paper argues, partnerships are hindered and foreign competitors are gaining an advantage in the commercial space market. 
 The move to put weapons systems in space, an Air Force initiative being considered by the White House, could further endanger efforts at international cooperation that help make space missions possible, Mr. Abbey said, adding, ''You wouldn't find people anxious to work with the United States in a cooperative space program when the U.S. is putting weapons up there.'' 
 Mr. Abbey said he had tried to raise his concerns with administration officials, but ''if you're critical of their position, you're absolutely wrong -- so they don't take time to listen.'' 
 Dr. Griffin told reporters this month that financing for the space program was more than adequate. 
 ''In my judgment we can go to the Moon, we can go to Mars,'' he said. ''We can't do it quite as quickly as we did during Apollo. But we can absolutely do it.''
 Dr. John M. Logsdon, the director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, said that the Abbey-Lane paper was in some ways a valid critique but that Dr. Griffin was already working to correct many of the problems. 
 Some of the problems, Dr. Logsdon said, are out of Dr. Griffin's control. ''Export controls are a real problem, and we are indeed shooting ourselves somewhere north of our feet,'' he said. 
 In the interview last week, Dr. Griffin said the space program was becoming what it ought to be.
 ''We're not on the right path,'' he said, ''but we're steering the boat to get on the right path.''

HEADLINE: In Paris, Romancing the Deal

BYLINE: By DEBORAH BALDWIN

 BODY:
ROBYNN ROCKSTAD-REX had a large house in Seattle. But after her husband died two years ago she ached for a little piece of Paris. ''It's the one city,'' she said, ''where I could smile again.'' She found herself hunched over the computer scouring real estate listings until all hours. ''It was an obsession for a while,'' she said. 
 A place of one's own in the city of light: it may sound like one of those impossible dreams, brought down to earth by the rude realities of doing business in a country where notoriously slow-moving bureaucracies can give apartment hunting a nightmarish hue. But this quest ended happily. 
 Working with a firm called Paris Real Estate Finders -- one of several such services to have sprung up in recent years -- Ms. Rockstad-Rex located a pied-a-terre near Montmartre within two weeks. Taking possession took several months, but Finders held her hand the whole time, and Ms. Rockstad-Rex suggested it was actually kind of fun. 
 Paris, that fantasy destination for so many expats and luxury goods connoisseurs, has become an unlikely destination for Americans hoping to acquire second homes. The prospective buyers are so plentiful, in fact, that they have spawned a cottage industry of local fixers who specialize in ushering Americans through the 7 percent transfer fee, codified inheritance rules, requisite ''notaire'' and other bewildering rituals of French real estate. 
 A strong euro has scared away some buyers, but others have clearly decided that it's a sign to buy in. Though the euro has sagged a bit in recent months, many economists see it bouncing back, indicating that now may be the time to buy.
 Some buyers are also motivated by prices below those in New York and a conviction that they can only go up. ''Let's say there are worse investments you can make,'' said Ms. Rockstad-Rex, asserting that her apartment has appreciated 50 percent since she bought it in 2003.
 Of course, when the alternative is investing in municipal bonds, who wouldn't prefer a private hideaway stocked with French armoires and raw-milk Camembert?
 Douglas C. Gaddis, and his partner, Dr. Gary Begin, found themselves lusting over photographs in real estate agency windows during regular trips to Paris. Last year, armed with listings from Paris Real Estate Finders' electronic database, they zeroed in on a one-bedroom in an 1890's building designed by Charles Plumet, and bought it based on photographs alone, like a mail-order bride.
 The couple, who live outside Washington, flew to Paris to renovate, hiring a contractor ''who came up the stairs with an air-powered jackhammer,'' Mr. Gaddis said with awe. The investment all told was about $340,000, he said. 
 That's not so bad considering where prices sit in Washington and New York. The average cost of a square foot in an older building in the fashionable Sixth Arrondissement in the third quarter of 2004 was 655 euros, or about $800, compared with $942 in Greenwich Village, an equivalent New York neighborhood. 
 For those with the means, renovation a l'Americaine can be a fait accompli. Alon and Betsy Kasha, an American couple who develop and sell properties (abkasha.com), put their pieds-a-terre on the market as finished luxury products complete with two-year warranties. Along with such authentic touches as herringbone parquet, they note, Americans want creature comforts like shower stalls and washer-dryers. 
 Ms. Kasha, formerly in the marketing department at Cartier, supplies decor, mixing flea-market finds and contemporary French furniture. 
 Their turn-key apartments, situated in the fashionable Sixth and Seventh Arrondissements near monuments like the Eiffel Tower and stores like Armani, are aimed squarely at well-heeled Americans who associate the good life with France and do not worry over currency fluctuations. The apartments have asking prices of roughly $400,000 to $1 million and ''are like a collection,'' Mr. Kasha said.
 ''We're treating this as fashion,'' he explained. 
 As he and other interested parties like to point out, Paris appears to be a more solid investment than, say, gold. In the third quarter of 2000 the average apartment in the Sixth Arrondissement was 460 euros a square foot, in contrast to the 655 four years later. 
 ''It's a really good investment right now,'' said Sharon Lagerberg, who bought a place near Montmartre in October with her husband, Dr. Steven Lagerberg. It cost 432,000 euros and has ''already gone up 50,000 euros,'' she said. 
 Bilingual and versed in currency trading, mortgage rates and property taxes, services like Paris Real Estate Finders feed the fantasies of Americans locked in their Dilbertian cubicles by sending them links to Web pages lush with descriptive prose and seductive photographs. In true American spirit, they offer efficiency, too. No more slogging from listing to listing in a city where each microneighborhood has its own microagency. No more translating phrases like ''poutres exposes'' (''exposed beams'').
 Doing business in a foreign language is only one of the challenges. Closings are typically two-hour rituals that can include a dramatic reading of a 30-page property transfer document. It's ''a holdover from the Revolution, when people with limited education began buying houses,'' explained Dr. Edward Wheatley, an American professor who bought an apartment in an Art Deco building with his wife, Mary Mackay, through Paris Real Estate Finders (parisrealestatefinders.com).
 There are no official French statistics on the number of Americans who buy apartments in Paris, though real estate agents said there has been an uptick this year. 
 The average buyer, said Olivier de Ripert, a real estate agent, is a hotel-weary 50-something who visits often and longs for a retirement haven, preferably near a good patisserie. 
 Mr. de Ripert, who serves what is widely considered to be the most desirable neighborhood among wealthy Americans, Ile-St.-Louis, said he started seeing more American noses pressed to his window after the November elections. More recently, politics seemed less relevant to clients than a chance to move some of their money overseas, he said.
 Michele Imhoff, a French banker who has been helping Americans line up mortgages in Paris since 1991, said the same thing. ''Now Americans do want to diversify their portfolios and investments, and the best way to do it is buying something in Europe.''
 Ms. Imhoff, the manager of the United States representative office of the Banque Transatlantique in Washington, said she provides free advice -- plus mortgage applications and the like translated into English -- to any client with one or more accounts. For information, call (202)429-1909. 
 For some buyers the fluctuating euro (trading this week for about $1.20), continues to have a chilling effect, said Darrell Halverson, who runs Paris Real Estate Finders with his wife, Stephanie Freedman. But with French mortgage rates still around 3 percent and the market ''marching up steadily, 1 percent a month for 40 months,'' he noted, many ''are poised and ready to leap.'' 
 Toward that end, Finders has compiled not only a sophisticated database of listings but also a rapid response mechanism that can shoot the right ones to browsers who fill out a short questionnaire at the company's Web site.
 The firm charges about 2.5 percent of the selling price for help with various aspects of finding and financing a property. They deal with one client at a time and say they had more business last year than they could handle. Rival services include Abodes Abroad (abodesabroad.net). Other self-taught go-betweens include Adrian Leeds, an American who publishes a subscription online newsletter (frenchpropertyinsider.com) and organizes sales seminars in Paris and the United States (a two-hour consultation is $250). 
 Rental income sounds like easy money, but that's not always the case. Though French co-ops are more laissez-faire than their New York counterparts -- no grueling interviews with board members -- they don't necessarily welcome strangers coming in and out of buildings. And absentee owners often find themselves giving a hunk of the income to other fixers to safeguard the plumbing and keep track of the keys. 
 Many buyers have an exaggerated idea of how much rental income can be generated, said Marianne Le Berre, a French architect who helps people find and fix up apartments. ''After you deduct fees and taxes on renting, it's 2 percent,'' she said. 
 But for those who have found their dream pied-a-terre, economic cycles, the bureaucracy and taxes are beside the point. It's satisfying to know ''you can negotiate your way through a different legal and cultural system to make a home for yourself in another country,'' Dr. Wheatley said. Right now he and his wife are busy preparing to move from Clinton, N.Y., to Chicago. But they say they are delighted to know that one day, when the rat race ends, ''the place is going to be there when we can use it more freely.''

HEADLINE: Are Collectibles the New Real Estate?

BYLINE: By Alan Krueger. 
Alan B. Krueger (www.krueger.princeton.edu) is the Bendheim professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University.

 BODY:
EVERYDAY it seems that another collectible is sold for a record price. Consider three widely publicized sales in the last month. Babe Ruth's contract, which sent him from the Red Sox to the Yankees in 1919, went for nearly $1 million. A 1913 Liberty Head nickel went for $4.15 million, up from $3 million a year earlier. And a 1918 upside-down biplane stamp sold for $525,000, more than three times its pre-auction estimated price. 
 Are collectibles a sound financial investment? If the past is any guide, the answer is no. Historically, collectibles have yielded a much lower return than stocks and carried more risk. 
 Benjamin J. Burton of Lehman Brothers and Joyce P. Jacobsen of Wesleyan University conducted an exhaustive summary of studies that estimated the financial return from investing in collectibles in an article published in The Journal of Economic Perspectives in 1999. They examined the payoff from holding several kinds of collectibles, including art, wine, antiques, ceramics, coins, stamps, books and Beanie Babies. 
 Measuring the return from investing in collectibles is difficult because the items that are sold each year are not identical and some items are rarely sold. Three methods have been used to estimate the return. One involves tracking the prices of objects sold on multiple occasions. Another follows the prices of a portfolio of similar but not identical items each year. And a third tries to adjust statistically for the characteristics of items that are sold at different times -- for example, a large Picasso should sell for more than a smaller one, other things being equal. 
 Despite the methodological differences, according to Mr. Burton and Ms. Jacobsen, the results from the various methods all support the same conclusion: ''The majority of collectibles yield lower financial returns than stocks, and studies that include a measure of variability over time uniformly find that collectibles embody more risk than most other financial assets.'' 
 For example, using information on repeat sales of paintings , William J. Baumol of New York University estimated that the compound rate of return was just 0.6 percent a year after accounting for inflation, more than 8 percentage points below the rate of return from stocks.
 The actual return on holding collectibles may be even lower than most studies indicate because they do not take account of storage and insurance costs, commissions on sales and the risk that it may be difficult to find a buyer. And that does not even take into consideration the products that are manufactured and sold as collectibles from the outset.
 To be sure, there have been periods when artwork and other collectibles yielded a higher return than stocks, but those periods tended to be brief and hard to predict. The resale price of Beanie Babies, for instance, grew at an astonishing rate of 140 percent a year from 1994 to 1999 -- and has since crashed. 
 The return on collectibles is inherently volatile because demand depends mainly on buyers' whims and current fads, not on fundamentals. For example, the fundamental value of the biplane stamp is just 24 cents, not enough to mail a letter; the rest of its value comes from consumers' tastes. And it is true that Babe Ruth was traded to the Yankees for $100,000 -- which translates to $1.2 million in today's dollars -- making the $1 million price tag his contract just fetched sound like a bargain. But the original contract came with Babe Ruth! 
 Looking across all types of collectibles, Mr. Burton and Ms. Jacobsen find that collectibles tend to yield a higher return when the stock market does poorly (Beanie Babies notwithstanding). Still, collectibles do not provide as good a hedge against stock market risk as bonds or money market accounts, which probably explains why virtually all hedge funds and mutual funds have shied away from investing in collectibles. 
 So why has the price of some prestigious collectibles surged lately? One possibility is that the news media has just played up some extreme, eye-catching cases. Given the high price volatility and wide variety of collectibles, it would be surprising if some prominent items did not rise sharply in value every year. 
 Another possibility, however, is that we are in one of those infrequent periods when the price of collectibles is surging. Scott Mitchell, a numismatist at Stack's Coins in New York, said that over the last five years there has been an increase in both the sales volume and price of rare coins, because of publicity about some high-profile sales like the Liberty Head nickel and a desire by investors to move funds from stocks to rare coins. 
 Still, the average collector and investor would be wise to recognize that collectibles have historically been a poor investment but a good hobby. 
 ''The most important thing I have found out,'' said William Gunn of Lawton-Wellington Collectibles Inc. in West Palm Beach, Fla., who has sold sports memorabilia for 27 years, ''is that many people are more interested in the sizzle than the steak when they buy collectibles; they like the story more than the item.'' 
 Presumably the joy that buyers derive from owning and displaying collectibles is why people buy them despite their poor financial return. This is unlikely to change. 
 Mr. Gunn added that he advises customers, ''Buy stocks and bonds to make money; buy memorabilia for the pride and pleasure of ownership.'' That sounds like sound advice to me, despite the hype given to a few recent record-breaking sales.

HEADLINE: Brazil's Right to Save Lives

 BODY:
Brazil has the best anti-AIDS program of any developing country. It has a model prevention effort and was the first poor country to provide free AIDS treatment to all who need it, a program countries around the world are now beginning to emulate.
 It has been able to afford this because Brazilian labs make copycat versions of expensive brand-name drugs. Brazil can freely copy any drug commercialized before 1997, when the country began to respect patents on medicines, a requirement for joining the World Trade Organization. But newer AIDS medicines are still imported and are expensive, and Brazil is spending two-thirds of its antiretroviral budget on just three of these drugs. 
 The government is now contemplating measures that would allow Brazilian labs to copy these drugs. Brazil's health ministry has asked the manufacturers of the drugs to voluntarily license Brazil to make copies. They have refused, and Brazil is threatening to break the patents and pay the holders a reasonable royalty, as W.T.O. rules require.
 Right-wing groups in the United States and pharmaceutical manufacturers are calling this theft, and several members of Congress have asked the United States trade representative to apply trade sanctions. American trade officials have refrained, but they have criticized Brazil's threat to seize patents. While property rights deserve respect and should not be carelessly violated, what Brazil is doing is legal and deserves Washington's support. 
 Brazil's opponents argue that the country has no real AIDS emergency. Drug companies note that they offer Brazil drugs at deep discounts and say that Brazil can afford them. But the World Trade Organization rules are clear: they encourage all members to use the flexibilities in the intellectual property rules to promote access to medicine for all. Countries need not wait for an emergency, and Brazil isn't even a tough call. 
 Brazil's free universal treatment program, an indispensable weapon against the AIDS epidemic, locks Brazil's government into buying lifelong daily medicines for 170,000 people, and that number is rising. Brazil has the right to make sure it can continue to meet this burden by getting medicines at the cheapest possible price. 
 Breaking patents should be reserved for when it is clearly necessary to protect public health. But these rights have been underused. Only a handful of countries have used W.T.O. rules to break patents on medicines. Countries are intimidated, mainly by the United States. Health ministers who propose making copycat drugs are usually silenced by influential local business sectors afraid of trade retaliation. The American trade representative should make a public statement that the United States will not retaliate against Brazil for exercising its right to save lives.

HEADLINE: CHINESE OIL GIANT IN TAKEOVER BID FOR U.S. COMPANY

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA and ANDREW ROSS SORKIN; David Barboza contributed reporting from Shanghai for this article and Andrew Ross Sorkin from New York.

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Thursday, June 23 

 BODY:
One of China's largest state-controlled oil companies made a $18.5 billion unsolicited bid Thursday for Unocal, signaling the first big takeover battle by a Chinese company for an American corporation. 
 The bold bid, by the China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC), may be a watershed in Chinese corporate behavior, and it demonstrates the increasing influence on Asia of Wall Street's bare-knuckled takeover tactics.
 The offer is also the latest symbol of China's growing economic power and of the soaring ambitions of its corporate giants, particularly when it comes to the energy resources it needs desperately to continue feeding its rapid growth.
 CNOOC's bid, which comes two months after Unocal agreed to be sold to Chevron, the American energy giant, for $16.4 billion, is expected to incite a potentially costly bidding war over the California-based Unocal, a large independent oil company. CNOOC said its offer represents a premium of about $1.5 billion over the value of Unocal's deal with Chevron after a $500 million breakup fee. 
 Moreover, the effort is likely to provoke a fierce debate in Washington about the nation's trade policies with China and the role of the two governments in the growing trend of deal making between companies in the countries. 
 This week, a consortium of investors led by the Haier Group, one of China's biggest companies, moved to acquire the Maytag Corporation, the American appliance maker, for about $1.3 billion, surpassing a bid from a group of American investors.
 Last month, Lenovo, China's largest computer maker, completed its $1.75 billion deal for I.B.M.'s personal computer business, creating the world's third-largest computer maker after Dell and Hewlett-Packard.
 After years of attracting billions in foreign investment and virtually turning itself into the world's largest factory floor, China appears to be nurturing the growth of its own corporate giants into beacons of capitalism. China wants to be a player on the world stage, and it is eager to have its own energy resources, its own multinational corporations and its own dazzling corporate names.
 And some of China's biggest companies are now on the hunt, trying to snap up global treasures.
 ''If there's an asset up for sale anywhere in the world, people are looking to China, particularly if there's a manufacturing element involved,'' said Colin Banfield, who runs the mergers and acquisitions practice at Credit Suisse First Boston in Asia. ''And if these two deals go through this year, no one is going to doubt the credibility of the Chinese corporates when it comes to M&A.''
 The deal making and bidding wars are all the more remarkable because they involve Chinese companies taking on American multinationals in a series of transactions certain to be a boon for Western lawyers and investment bankers, many of whom have been betting hundreds of millions of dollars on China's rise.
 Indeed, CNOOC is being advised by an army of bankers from Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan Chase and NM Rothschild & Sons of Britain.
 In a response, Unocal said in a statement that its board would evaluate the offer, but that its recommendation of the deal with Chevron ''remains in effect.''
 CNOOC's bid faces an uphill battle, with hurdles that probably rise above those usually confronting a corporate bidder. Already, lawmakers in Washington are questioning whether the Bush administration should intervene to block the bid for Unocal, which was founded in 1890 as the Union Oil Company of California.
 Two Republican representatives from California, Richard W. Pombo and Duncan Hunter, wrote a letter last week to President Bush, after speculation concerning the deal arose, urging that the transaction be scrutinized on the grounds of national security.
 They wrote: ''As the world energy landscape shifts, we believe that it is critical to understand the implications for American interests and most especially, the threat posed by China's governmental pursuit of world energy resources. The United States increasingly needs to view meeting its energy requirements within the context of our foreign policy, national security and economic security agenda.''
 Energy Secretary Samuel W. Bodman said at a meeting of the National Petroleum Council late Wednesday that the government's review of the deal would be ''truly a complex matter,'' according to Reuters.
 In Beijing, Liu Jianchao, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, told reporters on Tuesday that ''this is a corporate issue,'' according to Bloomberg News. ''I can't comment on this individual case,'' Mr. Liu said, ''but I can say we encourage the U.S. to allow normal trade relations to take place without political interference.''
 TCL, a Chinese company that began by making cassette tapes in 1981, is suddenly the world's biggest television set maker, after its acquisition last July of the television business of Thomson of France, which owned the old RCA brand.
 Chinese companies still have a long way to go to become global giants that can compete head-to-head with Toyota, Siemens or General Electric. Most of the China deals are small in value -- about $1 billion to $2 billion -- when compared with big American or European deals.
 Whether CNOOC's bid will succeed on it merits is unclear. It is interested in Unocal, once known for its 76 brand, less for its exploration and production in North America than for its huge reserves in Asia. Twenty-seven percent of Unocal's proven oil reserves and 73 percent of its proven natural gas reserves are in Asia, according to Merrill Lynch.
 To succeed, CNOOC will have to persuade Unocal's shareholders to vote against their deal with Chevron. The new deal would then face a shareholder vote.
 Even though CNOOC's offer is worth $1.5 billion more than Chevron's, some shareholders could still decide that the regulatory review process and the time required to complete a deal with CNOOC would pose too great a risk, given the size of the offer.
 Chevron, which could raise its bid to counter CNOOC, is racing to complete its deal and submit it to a shareholder vote as early as August. The company made no specific comment on the Chinese offer. 
 CNOOC's all-cash offer values Unocal at $67 a share. Chevron's cash and stock offer values Unocal at $61.26 a share, based on Chevron's closing price on Wednesday of $58.27 a share. Shares of Unocal jumped 2.2 percent, to $64.85, as investors anticipated CNOOC's higher bid.
 In CNOOC's letter to Unocal, it went to great lengths to say that its bid was friendly, despite being unsolicited. ''This friendly, all-cash proposal is a superior offer for Unocal shareholders,'' wrote CNOOC's chairman and chief executive, Fu Chengyu.
 Trying to assuage concerns of some in Washington, CNOOC pledged to continue Unocal's practice of selling all of the oil and gas produced in the United States back to customers in the United States. The company also said it would retain substantially all of Unocal's employees in the United States.

HEADLINE: On a Rare Visit, Bush Talks Up Atomic Power

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD; David D. Kirkpatrick contributed reporting from Washington for this article.

DATELINE: LUSBY, Md., June 22 

 BODY:
George W. Bush on Wednesday made the first presidential visit to a nuclear plant in 26 years, and declared, ''It is time for this country to start building nuclear power plants again.''
 Mr. Bush laid out steps that he said the government should take to help. None of those proposals were new, but his venue was: an office building next to the twin-unit Calvert Cliffs nuclear plant here, about 50 miles southeast of the White House. 
 Mr. Bush offered his thanks to those who showed him around, especially control-room technicians, ''for being so gracious and kind and taking time to explain all the dials and gauges.''
 ''I can play like I understand what I saw,'' he said, drawing chuckles from an enthusiastic crowd of about 300, including state and local officials, executives of nuclear power organizations and plant workers.
 The president's 45-minute speech touched on other elements that the White House groups under the heading of economic security, including his proposals on Social Security, asbestos litigation, medical malpractice, education and foreign trade. But nuclear power was the focus, more than three decades after the industry last ordered a nuclear plant whose construction was not subsequently canceled.
 The last president to visit a nuclear plant was Jimmy Carter, who went to Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania on April 1, 1979, the fifth day of the major accident there. Urging calm, Mr. Carter, a veteran of the nuclear Navy, wore disposable booties that day because of contamination on the floors. On Wednesday, Mr. Bush wore a hard hat but ordinary clothes; the areas he visited -- the control room and the turbine hall, where steam is converted into mechanical energy and then electricity -- are normally clean.
 Among those in the audience for Mr. Bush's speech was Nils J. Diaz, chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, who said, ''The memories people have are Jimmy Carter intervening in a moment of crisis,'' whereas Mr. Bush ''is intervening in something he believes is very important to the country.''
 The president emphasized a proposal he made in April for government-financed ''risk insurance'' to help reassure investors in new nuclear plants that they would not be hurt if lawsuits or government delays held up a project. Leaning over a lectern as if to make a confidential point, he said, ''You don't want to go out and build a plant, spend all the money and have the license jerked at the last minute.'' 
 Mr. Bush said that since the United States stopped ordering reactors, France had built 56 of them; China, he said, is working on 8. He contrasted oil, whose consumption in the United States grows even as the nation's production of it declines, with an energy source that he called ''completely domestic,'' though in fact the business of designing new reactors, and making fuel for existing ones, is now mostly globalized.
 Any aid for the nuclear industry faces stiff opposition. Jim Riccio, an energy expert at Greenpeace, said that despite much talk that nuclear power was becoming economically viable, reactors were still one-third too expensive to be competitive. Brent Blackwelder, president of Friends of the Earth, said subsidies for new reactors would soak up all the money that should go into solar or wind power, or into efficiency investments.
 As the president toured the plant here, back in Washington senators continued work on a broad energy bill. A day after adopting a provision asking companies to voluntarily reduce the emissions that scientists blame for global warming, the Senate voted 60 to 38 to defeat an amendment that would have imposed mandatory limits. The amendment, sponsored by Senators John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, would have capped carbon emissions by 2010 at levels that prevailed in 2000. 
 The Senate then adopted a resolution, sponsored by Senator Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico, expressing support for future mandatory limits.
 The Senate also agreed to give Washington clear authority to override states' objections to the location of liquefied natural gas terminals. By 52 to 45, it rejected an amendment that would have allowed governors to veto federal permits for such terminals because of state concerns about safety or environmental harm.
 Advocates of the proposal said states should have a greater say because of the possibility of terrorism or tanker spills. 
 ''We're not talking about the siting of a neighborhood ballpark or a Wal-Mart,'' said Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine. ''It's a states' rights issue, plain and simple.''
 But opponents said that deciding where to put the terminals was a federal matter, because imports would help meet a growing demand for natural gas.
 A vote on the entire energy bill is expected by the end of the week. The House has already passed its own version.

HEADLINE: International Donors Pledge to Step Up Their Efforts to Provide Financial Aid for Iraq

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, June 22 

 BODY:
Officials at an international conference of more than 80 nations and organizations pledged Wednesday to reinvigorate their lagging efforts to provide financial aid and debt relief for Iraq, and they urged Iraqi leaders to make more efforts to reach out politically to disaffected minorities supporting the insurgency.
 In a day of meetings, conference attendees led by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, the United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, and the heads of the European Union listened to upbeat reports about Iraq but also appeals for more financial help, which the Iraqis said had not come through as promised.
 ''Today I believe that Iraq and the international community are turning a page together,'' Mr. Annan said. ''I hope that all Iraqis take heart from today's conference. The people of Iraq have plenty of friends, and we do not intend to let them down.'' 
 Ms. Rice assured attendees that despite news reports focusing on violence and instability, Iraq was ''well on its way to democracy'' and had ''exceeded our expectations'' in restoring political order.
 She continued what has become a rising tempo of criticism of Syria, which sent an envoy to the conference and joined in the final declaration, accusing it of allowing its territory to be used to help the insurgency, but she said Iraqis who supported the government were more determined than the rebels to win.
 ''When it is defeated in Iraq, it will be a death knell for terrorism as we know it,'' she said of the insurgency.
 Presentations from Iraqis came from Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari, Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari and Finance Minister Ali Allawi. They pleaded for understanding of the difficulties of building a new nation on top of an insurgency and the ruins of war and misrule by Saddam Hussein.
 Most of the conference was closed to the news media, but there were signs of disappointment in some public comments.
 Mr. Allawi made it clear that Iraq was disappointed that little of the financial aid promised in Madrid in 2003 had materialized. 
 American officials say that of the more than $13 billion pledged in Madrid over three years, only $2 billion had been raised. 
 According to American officials, some generalized pledges were made at the two-day conference. The biggest was from the European Union, which, having already met its Madrid pledge, said it would give $130 million in new aid. Other countries promised to assist in police training and to help set up civilian government operations. 
 Those taking part in the conference were also urged to attend a donors' meeting next month in Jordan and to help speed up the aid.
 Mr. Allawi painted a bleak picture of Iraq's financial situation, particularly its problems in producing oil. The production of 1.4 million barrels a day is below the industry's targets, he said, but revenues are higher than expected because of high oil prices.
 An important theme at the conference came in a series of appeals to Iraqi leaders to make sure that their constitution-writing process included Iraqis of all ethnic and religious backgrounds. Iraqi leaders repeated just as often that they would do so.

HEADLINE: Name Brands Embrace Some Less-Well-Off Kinfolk

BYLINE: By Claudia H. Deutsch

 BODY:
CHARMIN has a new low-rent cousin, Charmin Basic. It's slightly less ''squeezably soft'' -- but it's a lot less pricey than Procter & Gamble's other toilet paper. 
 ''Hold onto a little more change,'' is the tag line of one ad that shows a wet piece of Charmin Basic holding the weight of two silver dollars. 
 Procter's Bounty has a less expensive version hitting markets now, too. And, while Procter is among just a handful of companies introducing downmarket versions of upmarket brands, it has a lot more company when it comes to advertising to a budget-minded nation. 
 Indeed, consumer products companies are addressing cost-consciousness with a zeal usually associated with recessions, not economic recoveries. And marketing experts offer a potpourri of theories about why. 
 Some cite high gas prices, which continue to pinch middle-class budgets (the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority has posted highway billboards, and broadcast some radio ads, reminding drivers that taking trains can ease the pain of skyrocketing gas prices). 
 Others cite the impact of Wal-Mart, Costco and other big-box retailers, which enable consumers to get generic prices by buying brand names in bulk. Others mention the proliferation of high-quality store brands. And still others note that attitudes have changed -- well-off consumers who once would have blushed mightily if caught shopping at a price club now flaunt their bargain-hunting acumen with pride.
 The reasons, taken together, add up to a brutal dose of reality for consumer products companies. As Sridhar Balasubramanian, an associate professor of marketing at the Kenan-Flagler Business School at the University of North Carolina, put it, ''The premium that consumers were traditionally willing to pay for a brand name is under attack.''
 Actually, the companies themselves have more idiosyncratic reasons for chasing the budget-conscious buyer. 
 ''Any share we can gain back from Anheuser-Busch in the economy segment will help provide cash flow for our mainstream and worth-more brands,'' said Peter Marino, a spokesman for the Miller Brewing Company, which next month will begin advertising Milwaukee's Best Light, one of its least expensive beers, on the ''World Series of Poker'' on ESPN. The spots have already been shown in a few local markets in the first television campaign Miller has run for the economy brand in more than five years.
 Procter, whose Charmin and Bounty brands lead their markets, has a mirror-image reason for introducing Charmin Basic and Bounty Basic. ''Charmin and Bounty have led their markets for 25 years, and we realized that we had to address a new consumer segment if the brands were to continue to grow,'' said Celeste C. Kuta, a spokeswoman for Procter's family care products.
 Of course, there is nothing new about using price as a come-on to increase sales. Cents-off coupons and store promotions were a staple of the shopping experience long before most current-day shoppers were born. 
 Nor is downward brand extension a radically new idea. Mercedes now sells relatively inexpensive versions of its luxury cars, and Apple has cheaper iPods. And unlike, say, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines, which put different names -- Ted and Song, respectively -- on the scaled-down versions of their premium products, these companies proudly slap their vaunted brands on their low-cost offerings.
 What is new, the experts say, is the stress on budget-friendliness by sellers of branded consumer staples like toilet paper or batteries or detergents. They have normally operated on the theory that consumers who buy products based on the price probably switched to store brands or other low-cost alternatives long ago. Thus, their ads and marketing have primarily stressed product attributes -- Charmin's softness, Bounty's strength, United's friendly skies -- in hopes that their brand names will be automatically associated with quality. 
 Now many of them have pushed cost-effectiveness to the top of the attribute list. Ads for Tide Coldwater, made by Procter, stress how much consumers can save on energy costs -- $63 a year is the claim in one newspaper insert -- rather than how white and bright the clothes end up. 
 Similarly, since November, Duracell from Gillette has been supplementing its ''trusted everywhere'' ads with a print and radio -- and, since last month, television -- campaign mocking heavy-duty zinc batteries from its rivals Eveready and Rayovac. The message is: ''It's amazing how cheap they can make them when they use less powerful technology.'' The implied message is: Duracell batteries may cost more to buy, but their longer life span means they cost less to use.
 Conversely, Miller has concluded that now is a good time to woo cash-short drinkers to its cheaper beers. Its tongue-in-cheek campaign for Milwaukee's Best Light makes fun of young men cuddling little dogs, wiping grease off pizza or indulging in other actions that Miller deems questionably masculine. Each 15-second spot ends with the offender slammed in the head with a can of Milwaukee's Best Light, and uses the tag line ''A man should act like a man, and a light beer should taste like a beer.'' 
 None mentions price -- but price is the elephant in the room, in that Milwaukee's Best has always been a low-priced beer, so the ad campaign is aimed at persuading young men that drinking it will hurt neither their image nor their taste buds.
 ''There was never a thought that we needed to stress value,'' Mr. Marino said. 
 Such approaches carry little risk to the basic brand. But, experts say, companies offering a lower-cost version of branded products are walking a tightrope. They note that it took Cadillac years to repair its image after it introduced the Cadillac Cimarron, its low-priced -- and it turned out, low-performing -- car in 1981.
 ''If you put the brand name on a clearly inferior product, you are shooting the premium brand in the foot,'' said Judy Hopelain, a managing partner at Prophet Brand Strategy, a San Francisco brand consultancy. 
 Even companies that safeguard quality face hazards. If they persuade deal-conscious consumers that they can get brand-name quality on the cheap, they may simultaneously persuade their high-end customers that they might as well buy the cheaper version. 
 ''It's a trade-off,'' said John T. Gourville, an associate professor specializing in pricing research at the Harvard Business School. ''The brand name gives you the credibility to quickly gain share in the lower-end market, but there's the danger that you'll dilute the premium brand.''
 Others note that the more iconic the brand, the greater the danger that the cheaper versions will cannibalize the premium ones. ''If you've already persuaded people that only the best products are sold under your brand, then they'll readily buy the least expensive item with that brand name,'' warned Michael Watras, president of Straightline International, a brand consultant in New York. 
 But as plentiful as the traps may be, they are avoidable. Packaging can be a great differentiator -- for example, the word ''Basic'' is more prominent than ''Charmin'' on the Charmin Basic package, and the Charmin bears are nowhere to be seen. Moreover, many companies, Procter included, are advertising their cheaper products only in newspaper inserts, saving costlier commercials for their premium items. 
 Most important, marketing experts say, is to keep adding features to the premium product after the cheaper one comes out. ''Companies will be O.K. as long as they keep innovating in their premium line,'' Ms. Hopelain said. But, she warned, if they do not want a mass migration to the less expensive items, ''They'd best not be tempted to put new features in the cheaper product for a long, long time.''

HEADLINE: Issues Remain as Albany Tries to End Session

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER and AL BAKER

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 23 

 BODY:
Lawmakers headed toward the end of their session Thursday night trying to resolve lingering disagreements over which economic incentives to offer to aid in the recovery of Lower Manhattan, how many casinos to allow in the Catskills and how to provide more oversight of public authorities.
 Although several big-ticket items remained undone, the legislators reached or came close to deals on several others, including the authorization of the planned replacement of Yankee stadium, increased penalties on laboratories that produce methamphetamine, and the creation of a new board to watch over the scandal-plagued New York Racing Association. 
 As the sun set on what was supposed to be the last night of the 2005 session, officials said that the State Senate, at least, would have to return to the Capitol on Friday. 
 The Republican-led State Senate is still pushing for a bill that would authorize construction of three Indian-owned casinos in the Catskills. Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican, and the Democratic-led State Assembly want to authorize only one casino. 
 Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker, a Democrat who represents Lower Manhattan, continued to push for a plan to offer tax incentives to lure and retain businesses there.
 Officials said they were nearing an agreement on what to do about the state's public authorities, which have been criticized for a lack of accountability. But they said there was no agreement on when and how to allow the HIP Health Plan to become a for-profit company, a conversion the state believes could net the state as much as $2 billion. 
 The Legislature and the governor continued to battle over a bill to allow people to buy wine on the Internet. The Supreme Court struck down New York's law in May. State leaders said they would pass a new law allowing purchases from out-of-state wineries. Governor Pataki wants to limit purchases to two cases a month; lawmakers want to allow larger purchases.
 Although lawmakers passed several ethics measures in recent days and made an effort to allow lawmakers more time to read bills before voting on them, the end of the session was marked by the traditional flurry of last-minute negotiations of major issues behind closed doors. 
 The Senate and the Assembly agreed to soften the so-called Rockefeller drug laws a bit more by allowing about 513 inmates -- those convicted of A-2 felonies -- the chance to petition a court for resentencing and early release. Last year they had allowed inmates serving sentences for A-1 felonies to do that. But Governor Pataki said he had ''some concerns,'' as did several critics who are pushing for judges to have more discretion in sentencing those convicted of narcotics crimes. 
 Senator Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican majority leader, said on Thursday that officials had resolved the question of what to do about an item in this year's budget that would have provided $80 million in Medicaid money to help pay for raises in upstate nursing homes, which some critics called a giveaway to 1199/S.E.I.U., the powerful health care workers union. 
 Although David Catalfamo, an aide to Governor Pataki, said there was no final deal, Senator Bruno said the agreement called for spending more than the original $80 million on nursing homes north of Westchester County. He said that it would ''expand the dollars that were budgeted from somewhere around $80 million, over a couple of years, to $134 million, and it includes something like covering about 220 or 230 of the nursing homes in upstate.''
 And lawmakers said they had agreed to a plan to broadcast gavel-to-gavel legislative sessions on cable television networks around the state, much like a local version of C-Span.

HEADLINE: Unclear on American Campus: What the Foreign Teacher Said

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER; Michael Falcone contributed reporting from Berkeley, Calif., for this article.

 BODY:
Valerie Serrin still remembers vividly her anger and the feeling of helplessness. After getting a C on a lab report in an introductory chemistry course, she went to her teaching assistant to ask what she should have done for a better grade.
 The teaching assistant, a graduate student from China, possessed a finely honed mind. But he also had a heavy accent and a limited grasp of spoken English, so he could not explain to Ms. Serrin, a freshman at the time, what her report had lacked. 
 ''He would just say, 'It's easy, it's easy,''' said Ms. Serrin, who recently completed her junior year at the University of California, Berkeley. ''But it wasn't easy. He was brilliant, absolutely brilliant, but he couldn't communicate in English.'' 
 Ms. Serrin's experience is hardly unique. With a steep rise in the number of foreign graduate students in the last two decades, undergraduates at large research universities often find themselves in classes and laboratories run by graduate teaching assistants whose mastery of English is less than complete.
 The issue is particularly acute in subjects like engineering, where 50 percent of graduate students are foreign born, and math and the physical sciences, where 41 percent of graduate students are, according to a survey by the Council of Graduate Schools, an association of 450 schools. This is despite a modest decline in the number of international students enrolling in American graduate programs since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. 
 The encounters have prompted legislation in at least 22 states requiring universities to make sure that teachers are proficient in spoken English. In January, Bette B. Grande, a Republican state representative from Fargo, N.D., tried to go even further after her son Alec complained of his experiences at North Dakota State University. Mrs. Grande introduced legislation that would allow students in state universities to drop courses without penalty and be reimbursed if they could not understand the English of a teaching assistant or a professor. 
 ''If a student has paid tuition to be in that classroom,'' she said, ''he should receive what he paid for.'' 
 State lawmakers, however, balked, instead ordering education officials to assess how well state universities were training teaching assistants. 
 Many universities are trying to minimize the problem by creating programs to assess the English skills of international graduate students who are prospective teaching assistants and offering courses as needed.
 But interviews with dozens of undergraduates at six universities over the last few weeks indicate that the problem remains acute, in some cases even influencing decisions about what majors to pursue. 
 Ms. Serrin said that she went to Berkeley thinking she might go to medical school but that she was now majoring in economics, in part because of freshman chemistry.
 Myles Sullivan, a University of Massachusetts senior, twice dropped courses, once in astronomy and once in linguistics, because he could not decipher his teaching assistant.
 ''Both were brilliant men, but the language barrier was just too much for me,'' Mr. Sullivan said. 
 Some students end up spending hundreds of dollars to conquer the language barrier. Loyda Martinez, a senior at the University of Massachusetts, started subscribing to an online service that provides copies of notes from previous courses at the university when she had a hard time understanding teaching assistants in math, science and psychology classes. The service cost $20 to $75 a course, Ms. Martinez said.
 Others in the academic world believe that the complaints are not entirely about the shortcomings of foreign-born teaching assistants. 
 ''Is there some low-level carping? Absolutely,'' said Dudley Doane, director of the Center for American English Language and Culture at the University of Virginia. ''Is it justified? At times it may be. However, we have some students who aren't used to stretching.''
 It is a point echoed by some foreign teaching assistants who, in addition to their own studies and the rigors of grading papers, overseeing labs and leading discussions, must deal with what they sometimes consider intolerant undergraduates. 
 ''I had students come into my class mimicking the accent of a friend of mine, who is a teaching assistant in math,'' said Atreyee Phukan, a graduate student in comparative literature at Rutgers University who was born in India and raised in Bahrain and has a slight accent. ''They thought it was hilarious to make fun of his accent.''
 But Ms. Phukan also thinks the university should consider requiring more graduate students to take rigorous classes in spoken English.
 Many public and private universities have created programs in recent years to assess and train international graduate students. Most research universities require international applicants to pass a standardized test in written English for admission to graduate school. Many also set standards in spoken English for prospective teaching assistants.
 Virtually every major graduate school has made a concerted effort to make sure that international teaching assistants have the language skills they need, said Debra Stewart, the president of the Council of Graduate Schools, but that does not guarantee that there will not be problems.
 ''American students are living in a global world, and there is value in making an effort to understand people who sound different from you,'' Ms. Stewart said. ''That said, it is also an obligation of those of us in education, that if we put someone in front of students, reasonable people will be able to understand them.'' 
 At Stanford, for instance, about 200 foreign graduate students take a standardized test each year to assess their ability to speak English. About 30 of these students are required to take English classes, and others are encouraged to do so, said Philip Hubbard, director of the English for Foreign Students program there.
 ''I can't say there's no problem out there,'' Mr. Hubbard said. ''It wouldn't be fair. But there hasn't been any significant problem here for a number of years.''
 At the University of Virginia each year, about 120 foreign-born graduate students who are prospective teaching assistants take a test in spoken English; those who need to improve are offered courses.
 But many students said that despite such efforts the problems remained. They said they had adopted myriad strategies to get by, not all of them successful.
 Alison Monrose, a junior at Rutgers, said she began sitting in the front of the classroom to ''lip read.'' Ms. Serrin at Berkeley formed a study group with other students. Jacqueem Winston, a junior at Rutgers, decided he would just ask questions in class until he did understand. ''You can't be shy,'' Mr. Winston said.
 But Mohammed Islam, who is also a junior at Rutgers, simply stopped going to his discussion section in a physics course. The professor who lectured to the large class was excellent, Mr. Islam said, but the teaching assistant who oversaw his small weekly discussion section ''didn't speak English at all.''
 Mr. Islam, a ceramic engineering major from Brooklyn, paid a price for his decision. Homework, which counted for 25 percent of his grade, was supposed to be turned in to the teaching assistant. But since Mr. Islam had stopped going to the discussion section, he did not hand in any homework. He still managed to get a B-plus in the course, he said: ''I broke the curve on the final.'' 
 Geoff Young, a junior at Rutgers, said he had not had problems understanding his teaching assistants. But he said many of his friends at Rutgers had struggled mightily. 
 ''I've heard a lot of people complain about that,'' Mr. Young said, ''saying things like, 'How many languages other than English have you learned while you were here?''' 
 Even dealing with the problem caused anxiety for some students. 
 ''You don't want to be rude and say, 'Your English is no good,''' said Rhyshonda Singletary, a senior at the University of Massachusetts. ''But you also don't want to suffer.''

HEADLINE: A Black Woman's Memories Guide a Fragmented Tale

BYLINE: By CHARLES ISHERWOOD

 BODY:
The sternly competent Lieutenant Van Buren, the formidable figure played by S. Epatha Merkerson on ''Law & Order,'' is a long way from the warm but addled Birdie Blue, the title character in the new play by Cheryl L. West at the Second Stage Theater. The gifted Ms. Merkerson has no trouble bridging that emotional distance, but there's little she can do to patch the dramatic holes in Ms. West's fragmentary, seriously unsatisfactory play.
 ''Birdie Blue'' unfolds in the wandering mind of its central character, which may explain but cannot really excuse its blurry lack of cohesion. As it shifts confusingly across time in recounting an African-American woman's journey from the fields of Mississippi to the gritty streets of Chicago in the latter years of the 20th century, Ms. Merkerson proves herself a skillful emotional tour guide, grounding many moments in palpable feeling. But she is defeated by a script that relies too heavily on narration and recollection to paper over its lapses, so that Birdie Blue, who is meant to be a woman of strength and conviction (''tough,'' ''fierce'' and ''spirited'' are words the author uses to describe her in a note), largely comes across as a bewildered observer of her own life. 
 The play opens as Birdie Blue is struggling to prepare her husband, bedbound and angrily incoherent, for a journey of some kind. (Their grim destination will be revealed in the play's final moments.) She is also baking a cake for her son's birthday, but sets both tasks aside to begin chatting. Her memories rise before us, as Birdie's mind is flooded with images of her past life, flashing by in vague chronological order.
 Born in the Deep South, she was enticed north by her sister Minerva, who described Chicago as an economic promised land. Birdie Blue never escaped a life of hard labor, however, and met more trouble in the form of a no-good husband who left her with a no-good son. He abandoned Birdie when he grew up and grew angry in the tumult of the late 1960's. Only when the sweet-talking charmer Jackson (Charles Weldon) entered her life later did Birdie find a measure of peace. But as Jackson's muttering struggles in the opening scene make clear, Birdie's hard-won serenity would give way to more sorrow soon enough.
 Ms. Merkerson imbues Birdie Blue with a sturdy warmth, and she is strongly supported by Mr. Weldon, who gives an affecting performance as a proud man bitterly losing control of his mental faculties. Billy Porter displays his versatility and verve in a variety of roles, from the sassy Minerva and Birdie Blue's troubled son to Little Pimp, an effeminate neighbor boy whom Birdie Blue befriends at some point late in her history.
 They are all abetted in their efforts by Ms. West's marvelously pungent dialogue. But ''Birdie Blue,'' wanly directed by Seret Scott, is too loosely assembled to hang together compellingly, or even hold the audience's attention. Watching the play is like thumbing through a photo album in the presence of an elderly relative who knows the names, the faces and the facts but has lost the knack for telling the stories.

HEADLINE: One Nation, Divisible

BYLINE: By Norman Ornstein and Barry McMillion.

 BODY:
There is a lot of talk about political polarization in Congress. But is it true? Well, yes. Keith Poole and Howard Rosenthal, social scientists at the University of Houston and Princeton, respectively, used systematic measures of liberalism and conservatism built around government intervention in the economy to chart roll-call votes in Congress. 
We have adapted their scores to look at the House and Senate in each decade from 1955 to the present. The result? Thirty-three percent of House members were near-pure centrists in 1955; in 2004, just over eight percent fit that category. Thirty-nine senators were centrists in 1955, compared with nine in 2004.
 The differences are attributable to the emergence of the permanent campaign, the rise of partisan news media and, most of all, changes in Congressional redistricting. The expansion in the number of safe seats in the House that began in the 1980's has put an increased importance on primaries, which favor more ideological candidates. A number of these sharp-edged representatives have then moved to the Senate, where they have helped widen the partisan gulf we have talked about ---- and now can see.


CORRECTION-DATE: June 26, 2005

 CORRECTION:
A graphic on Friday about political polarization in Congress misstated the university where Keith Poole, on whose work the graphic was partly based, teaches. He is a professor at the University of California, San Diego -- not the University of Houston.

HEADLINE: Cutting Here, But Hiring Over There

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
Even as it proceeds with layoffs of up to 13,000 workers in Europe and the United States, I.B.M. plans to increase its payroll in India this year by more than 14,000 workers, according to an internal company document. 
 Those numbers are telling evidence of the continuing globalization of work and the migration of some skilled jobs to low-wage countries like India. And I.B.M., the world's largest information technology company, is something of a corporate laboratory that highlights the trend. Its actions inform the worries and policy debate that surround the rise of a global labor force in science, engineering and other fields that require advanced education. 
 To critics, I.B.M. is a leading example of the corporate strategy of shopping the globe for the cheapest labor in a single-minded pursuit of profits, to the detriment of wages, benefits and job security here and in other developed countries. The company announced last month that it would cut 10,000 to 13,000 jobs, about a quarter of them in the United States and the bulk of the rest in Western Europe. 
 ''I.B.M. is really pushing this offshore outsourcing to relentlessly cut costs and to export skilled jobs abroad,'' said Marcus Courtney, president of the Washington Alliance of Technology Workers, or WashTech, a group that seeks to unionize such workers. ''The winners are the richest corporations in the world, and American workers lose.''
 WashTech, based in Washington State, gave the I.B.M. document on Indian employment to The New York Times. It is labeled ''I.B.M. Confidential'' and dated April 2005. An I.B.M. employee concerned about the shifting of jobs abroad provided the document to WashTech.
 I.B.M. declined to comment on the document or the numbers in it, other than to say that there are many documents, charts and projections generated within the company.
 But in an interview, Robert W. Moffat, an I.B.M. senior vice president, explained that the buildup in India was attributable to surging demand for technology services in the thriving Indian economy and the opportunity to tap the many skilled Indian software engineers to work on projects around the world.
 Lower trade barriers and cheaper telecommunications and computing ability help allow a distant labor force to work on technology projects, he said.
 Mr. Moffat said I.B.M. was making the shift from a classic multinational corporation with separate businesses in many different countries to a truly worldwide company whose work can be divided and parceled out to the most efficient locations.
 Cost is part of the calculation, Mr. Moffat noted, but typically not the most important consideration. ''People who say this is simply labor arbitrage don't get it,'' he said. ''It's mostly about skills.''
 And Mr. Moffat said that I.B.M. was hiring people around the world, including many in the United States, in new businesses that the company has marked for growth, even as it trims elsewhere. The company's overall employment in the United States has held steady for the last few years, at about 130,000.
 To foster growth, I.B.M. is increasingly trying to help its client companies use information technology rather than just selling them the hardware and software. So I.B.M. researchers and programmers are more and more being put to work for customers, redesigning and automating tasks like procurement, accounting and customer service.
 Yet those advanced services projects will be broken into pieces, with different experts in different countries handling a slice. This emerging globalization of operations, Mr. Moffat noted, does lead to a global labor market in certain fields. ''You are no longer competing just with the guy down the street, but also with people around the world,'' he said.
 Such competition, however, can become particularly harsh for workers in the West when they are competing against well-educated workers in low-wage countries like India. An experienced software programmer in the United States earning $75,000 a year can often be replaced by an Indian programmer who earns $15,000 or so.
 Most economic studies, including one last week by the McKinsey Global Institute, a research group, have concluded that the offshore outsourcing of work will not have a huge effect on American jobs as a whole. 
 But looking at job numbers alone, said Joseph E. Stiglitz, a Nobel Prize-winning economist and a professor at Columbia University, understates the potential problem. ''What worries me is that it could have an enormous effect on wages, and that could have a wrenching impact on society,'' said Professor Stiglitz, a former chief economist of the World Bank.
 The fact that globalization anxiety about jobs and wages does not extend to executive ranks has stirred resentment among workers. ''Maybe the shareholders should look offshore for competitive executives who would collect less pay and fewer benefits,'' said Lee Conrad, national coordinator of the Alliance@IBM, a union-affiliated group that has 6,500 dues-paying members at I.B.M. ''In all this talk of global competitiveness, the burden all falls on the workers.''
 Education and retraining, most experts agree, is a major part of the answer for helping skilled workers adjust and find new jobs to replace those lost to global competition. For its part, I.B.M. says it spends more than $700 million on training its employees for new jobs within the company, and for those laid off it offers severance packages that include career counseling and reimbursement for retraining.
 Even some champions of globalization say the corporate winners should do more to ease the transition of the losers. ''The wealth creation clearly has some fallout, and there is a responsibility for it,'' said Diana Farrell, director of the McKinsey Global Institute.
 By one calculation, the cost of softening the blow might not be all that high. For every dollar invested offshore, American companies save 58 cents, McKinsey estimates. And 4 or 5 percent of those savings could pay for a theoretical wage insurance program that would cover 70 percent of the income lost between an old job and a new one, as well as subsidized health care coverage, McKinsey said.

HEADLINE: Goodbye South Bronx Blight, Hello Trendy SoBro

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
Last summer, Todd Fatjo stepped out on the roof of a former piano factory in the South Bronx and fell in love with the jagged panorama -- the workaday bridges along the Harlem River, the blur and purr of three highways, the rooftop water tanks, the gaudy billboards and the hulking housing projects.
 ''It's great at sunset,'' said Mr. Fatjo, a 29-year-old D.J. who was raised in the countryside of Middletown, N.Y., in the foothills of the Catskills. ''I like the industrial scene, the metal, the brick. I've seen enough sunsets over mountains.''
 Mr. Fatjo is part of a crop of newcomers, many of them refugees from the rising rents of Williamsburg and the East Village, who are making the South Bronx the city's new cutting-edge address. 
 Hundreds of artists, hipsters, Web designers, photographers, doctors and journalists have been seduced by the mix of industrial lofts and 19th-century row houses in the Port Morris and Mott Haven neighborhoods. Some now even call the area SoBro.
 Yes, it's the very South Bronx that had a reputation for grinding poverty, rampant arson, runaway crime and as the starting point of Tom Wolfe's race-relations nightmare, ''The Bonfire of the Vanities,'' which chronicles what happens to a Master of the Universe driving with his mistress in his Mercedes-Benz on a creepy Bruckner Boulevard.
 Well, Bruckner and the blocks nearby now boast two tidy bars that a Master of the Universe would feel more than comfortable patronizing, including one, the Bruckner Bar and Grill, that offers pear and arugula salad.
 There are a dozen antique shops, at least one new lively art gallery, Haven Arts, to join three older ones, and a cafe partly owned by a resourceful Dominican immigrant that sells bourgeois bohemian delights like croissants and veggie wraps.
 There are also the allures of the longstanding Latino and African-American culture -- sidewalk dominoes games, flamboyant murals, lush vacant-lot gardens and restaurants with fried plantains and mango shakes -- that give the neighborhood a populist authenticity that cannot be matched in the more decorous precincts of Manhattan or Brooklyn.
 Porfirio Diaz, who owns the Maybar Cafe and Piano Bar on Third Avenue, said his new customers are ''very happy with Spanish food because the prices are low.'' 
 Still, no one expects the area to become another TriBeCa or SoHo anytime soon. The newcomers, some of whom have spent much of their lives abroad or in the hinterlands and are not as easily put off by the Bronx's outdated reputation, say they have felt welcomed. Nevertheless, those welcomes sometimes mask fears by longtime residents that they may someday be priced out of the neighborhood. 
 ''It's going to attract a class of people whose incomes and lifestyles are going to be radically different from those in the South Bronx, which is one of the poorest areas in the city,'' said Hector Soto, a lawyer active in developmental and environmental issues. Many of those fears coalesced around a rezoning measure passed by the City Council last March that essentially added another 11 square blocks of Port Morris to a five-block zone where, starting in 1997, apartments were permitted among the factories.
 Mr. Soto and other critics -- backed by artists and professionals -- fought in vain for provisions that would have assured that half of any new apartments be set aside for low-income families. Amanda M. Burden, the chairwoman of the City Planning Commission, objected successfully that such set-asides would have discouraged development. 
 Neil Pariser, senior vice president of the South Bronx Overall Economic Development Corporation, a nonprofit group that has renovated factories and apartment buildings in the area, acknowledged that some poor people could eventually be displaced, but doubted the relocations would be ''wholesale.'' 
 ''What you don't want to do is relegate an area that has finally achieved a place in the market to only the poor,'' he said. ''This should be for everybody.''
 Indeed, longtime locals have been attracted to the newly available lofts and row houses. Jose Baez, a 36-year-old freelance photographer, rents a 1,000-square-foot loft in the Clocktower, the former piano factory, for $1,350. ''For what you get here, you get a closet in Manhattan,'' he said. And local merchants appreciate the infusion of new money. 
 Ronald Trinidad, a 27-year-old Dominican immigrant, started the Open House Cafe a year ago with his business partner, Eric Beroff, in what had been a Mexican restaurant, and he sells croissants to artists heading to the subway stop at 138th Street and Third Avenue. 
 ''Lots of people come here from downtown Brooklyn and ask me, 'Where do I rent?''' he said.
 The area they are beguiled by is dominated by factories like the Zaro's Bread Basket bakery and warehouses like Shleppers Moving and Storage as well as by car washes and gas stations, all framed by the elevated stretches of the Major Deegan Expressway and ramps for the Willis and Third Avenue Bridges. 
 Many lofts were forsaken with the decline in American manufacturing, and in the 1970's the neighborhood went into a tailspin of arson, foreclosures and rampant crime. 
 City programs reclaimed hundreds of burned and abandoned buildings and built ranch houses and town houses on vacant lots. Crime plummeted. The South Bronx slowly recovered.
 Purnima Kapur, director of the Bronx office of the city's Planning Department, said the ''mixed use'' rezoning of 1997 had created at least 200 new apartments and other homes.
 Most new tenants are single people or childless couples, so the quality of the local schools -- not among the city's most stellar -- has not been an issue. 
 Although the impact of arriving artists was probably negligible at that point, an analysis of the 2000 census showed that median household income in Mott Haven alone had risen by 29.1 percent in the previous decade and the number of college educated residents by 86.5 percent.
 By 2000, Linda Cunningham, an Ohio-born sculptor whose outdoor installations have been exhibited near the United Nations, felt secure enough about an investment to buy a five-story loft on East 140th Street with two partners for $660,000.
 ''When I got off the subway, white faces were distinctive,'' she said. ''Someone would stop me and ask if I needed directions.'' Now she feels comfortable getting off the subway at 2 a.m. 
 She even notices that a local Western Beef supermarket has accommodated the tastes of the newcomers, selling alfalfa sprouts, mesclun and ''a decent yogurt.'' 
 ''I get to the Metropolitan Museum much faster than I could from SoHo,'' she said of another asset, the No. 6 train.
 Now anyone strolling on Bruckner can see boxes of geraniums and satellite dishes adorning the industrial windows of the Clocktower, the five-story red-brick former piano factory that was converted into 75 apartment lofts by a landlord experienced with lofts in East Williamsburg. Those lofts rent for between $1,000 to $2,000, according to Mr. Fatjo, who, in addition to working as a disc jockey at parties, helps pay his Clocktower rent by showing apartments to artists.
 ''He talks their language,'' said Isaac Jacobs, the building's owner. (Mr. Fatjo was the subject of an article in The New York Times last summer about signs that the hipster scene in Williamsburg might be fading.)
 As he has been doing for 16 years, Angel Villalona, a Dominican immigrant, still sells papayas, coconuts and mangoes from the side of a truck, as well as batidas -- fruit milkshakes that he prepares by yanking the cord on his sidewalk generator, which feeds electricity to an Osterizer blender. But now one of his customers is as likely to be a sculptor who has just moved from Williamsburg as a longtime resident like Charles Bachelor, a truck driver who immigrated from Antigua.
 ''White Europeans used to be afraid to walk in this neighborhood,'' Mr. Bachelor said. ''Now they walk comfortably.'' 
 There are some newcomers who worry that gentrification will lead to an unappetizing blandness. 
 ''A lot of people in the Clocktower feel a sense of guilt,'' said Darcy Dahl, an artist whose work is exhibited at Haven Arts. ''They feel they are part of the first wave of gentrification and they don't want the second wave to come, but they created it.''
 That paradox doesn't bother Mr. Fatjo so much as that he not get caught in a neighborhood that's played out. ''This neighborhood is already happening,'' Mr. Fatjo said. ''I may have to move soon.''

HEADLINE: Home Sales Slow; Jobless Claims Decline

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 23 

 BODY:
Sales of existing homes slowed in May but were still at the second-highest level on record with home prices reaching an all-time high. 
 Sales of previously owned homes and condominiums edged down 0.7 percent last month, the National Association of Realtors reported on Thursday. 
The decline left sales at a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 7.13 million units, down from a 7.18 million sales pace in April. 
 Even with the small drop in sales, median home prices nationwide rose to another all-time high of $207,000. 
 David Lereah, the Realtors' chief economist, said he was concerned about borrowers' reliance on interest-only mortgages and other mortgages with low down payments. Both kinds of loans would leave borrowers vulnerable if home prices slid in areas where they had been sharpest. 
 In other economic news, the Labor Department reported Thursday that the number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits fell by 20,000 last week, to 314,000. The improvement was far better than the drop of 3,000 that analysts expected. 
 The four-week moving average of jobless claims, which tends to smooth out volatility, eased to 333,000 from 335,500 the previous week.

HEADLINE: The Limits of Property Rights

 BODY:
The Supreme Court's ruling yesterday that the economically troubled city of New London, Conn., can use its power of eminent domain to spur development was a welcome vindication of cities' ability to act in the public interest. It also is a setback to the ''property rights'' movement, which is trying to block government from imposing reasonable zoning and environmental regulations. Still, the dissenters provided a useful reminder that eminent domain must not be used for purely private gain. 
 The city of New London has fallen on hard times. In 1998 -- when its population was at its lowest since 1920, and its unemployment rate was nearly twice the state average -- an effort was begun to turn New London around. State and local officials put together a redevelopment plan, anchored by a $300 million Pfizer research center, that would bring restaurants, stores and a new Coast Guard museum to one hard-hit neighborhood. 
 The city authorized a nonprofit development corporation to clear the necessary land by eminent domain, a forced sale in which the seller is given appropriate compensation. The development corporation got control of most of the land it needed, but a few people refused to sell.
 Eminent domain allows governments to take property for a public use, such as building a road. The property owners in New London claimed that handing over private property to a private developer cannot be a public use, even if it is part of a comprehensive plan to turn around a depressed city.
 The Supreme Court, by a 5-to-4 vote, sided with the city. The court noted that in past cases it had taken a broad view on this issue, and given governments wide discretion to determine when a taking of property meets this standard. New London, the court held, was within its rights to decide that its development plan was a valid public use. (The New York Times benefited from eminent domain in clearing the land for the new building it is constructing opposite the Port Authority Bus Terminal.)
 In a blistering dissent, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor lamented that the decision meant that the government could transfer any private property from the owner to another person with more political influence ''so long as it might be upgraded.'' That is a serious concern, but her fears are exaggerated. The majority strongly suggested that eminent domain should be part of a comprehensive plan, and Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing separately, underscored that its goal cannot simply be to help a developer or other private party become richer.
 That is not the situation in New London. Connecticut is a rich state with poor cities, which must do everything they can to attract business and industry. New London's development plan may hurt a few small property owners, who will, in any case, be fully compensated. But many more residents are likely to benefit if the city can shore up its tax base and attract badly needed jobs.

HEADLINE: Big Ideas, Little Books: What a Concept

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:
For the last 12 weeks a highly unusual book has been roosting in the nonfiction best-seller list compiled by this newspaper. The title includes a mildly vulgar synonym for ''nonsense'' and cannot be printed here. But the title is beside the point. It's the length that interests me. ''On Bull----,'' by Harry G. Frankfurt, runs a grand total of 80 pages. It shines like a beacon of hope to overburdened readers bombarded with nonfiction titles that routinely weigh in at 300 to 400 pages, no matter how inconsequential the subject. It dares to say that short can be good.
 Two books stare at me from my bookshelf. One is ''The Command of the Ocean,'' the middle volume in N.A.M. Rodger's authoritative history of the British Navy. It is 907 pages long. When I pick it up, my wrist buckles. Standing next to it, like Laurel next to Hardy, is the winsome ''Waterloo,'' by Andrew Roberts. At 143 pages, it barely counts as an appetizer, but as a reading experience it more than holds its own with its heftier shelfmate. 
 Both books deal with momentous events. Both are admirably researched and stylishly written. But ''Waterloo'' demands, at most, a couple of hours of reading time. It delivers the maximum amount of information, and pleasure, in the minimum number of minutes -- an unbeatable deal. 
 There are a lot of these junior-sized books out there at the moment. Some are slim by design, like the whippet-thin volumes that Paul Strathern, a British academic, has been turning out with machinelike regularity. His various series on great authors, great philosophers and great ideas (''Nabokov in 90 Minutes'' is one title) promise to get readers up to speed on, say, Wittgenstein, in 100 pages or so with no dumbing-down.
 Some books, for whatever reason, simply happen to be thin. Subject matter has nothing to do with it, either. There are short books on pared-down topics, like ''American Gothic,'' Steven Biel's ''biography'' of Grant Wood's famous painting, and short books on hugely important, world-changing subjects, like ''Auschwitz,'' by the German historian Sybille Steinbacher, due out from Ecco in August. 
 It's worth pointing out that long books can seem short, and vice versa. ''Command of the Ocean'' runs long but reads short. The author has a vigorous, economical writing style and a rare gift for packaging his facts tightly. ''American Gothic,'' with only 156 pages of text, has as much sag and bag as a Thomas Wolfe novel. 
 All books should be exactly as long as they need to be. There is no ideal length. But like mainstream Hollywood films, nonfiction books have shown a tendency to expand in recent years, for no particular reason. Directors cannot bring a film in at 90 minutes anymore. Likewise, my shelves are overloaded with nonfiction titles that, 30 years ago, would have been 225 or 250 pages. I'm not sure why. Fatter spines do look more imposing, and readers may feel, subconsciously, that $30 should buy them a thick, substantial volume. But time and again, I find, the extra weight comes from empty calories. 
 My candidate for the most impressive entry in the less-is-more category is ''In My Brother's Shadow: A Life and Death in the SS,'' by the German novelist Uwe Timm. Like all the books discussed here, it runs less than 220 pages of actual text. Far less, in fact. In a mere 150 pages, Mr. Timm roams, in a series of disjointed meditations, over most of 20th-century German history.
 His starting point is a cryptic diary left by his brother, an SS soldier who fought and died on the Ukrainian front. But jumping back and forth in time, he also touches on the traumatic aftermath of the First World War, in which his father served; the bombing of Hamburg, his hometown; and the ''economic miracle'' of the 1950's. Sensitively translated by Anthea Bell, ''In My Brother's Shadow'' is equal parts German history and family history, a profound rumination on the way history shapes and breaks private lives.
 I.B. Cohen, the founder of Harvard's history of science department, died in 2003, but he left behind a brief, lively and highly entertaining little book, ''The Triumph of Numbers: How Counting Shaped Modern Life.'' Cohen's grand theme is the rise of ''number consciousness,'' or the acceptance of numbers as a regulating power in human affairs, a slow process that did not really get going until the 16th and 17th centuries. 
 Many curious facts appear along the way. For years, the English and their colonial offspring resisted counting their populations in a census for fear of committing ''the sin of David.'' In the books of Samuel and Chronicles, King David orders a census of Israel and Judah, an act that, for mysterious reasons, is deemed evil and for which David and his people suffer fearful punishment. If nothing else, the Puritans knew their Bible. John Winthrop, the governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, estimated rather than counted the population, explaining in a letter that ''David's example stickes somewhat with us.''
 Cohen, in following his numerical trail, always takes time for detours. He examines the rise of life insurance in the 17th century and Benjamin Franklin's shrewd demographic calculations, which influenced Britain's decision to acquire Canada rather than Guadeloupe after the French and Indian War. Special attention is devoted to Adolphe Quetelet, a numbers-mad Frenchman who applied statistics to predict, among other things, when lilacs bloom and when playwrights are most likely to produce their most successful works.
 Spontaneously slim books like these come like a bolt out of the blue. Others spring from the minds of clever publishers. James Atlas, who has carved a niche in the short-book market, has two series in production. Eminent Lives, published by HarperCollins, matches writers like Christopher Hitchens with subjects like Thomas Jefferson, or Paul Johnson with George Washington, to take two current examples. Great Discoveries, published by W.W. Norton, applies the same matchmaking approach to the history of science, with excellent results in the two most recent titles to roll off the assembly line: ''Miss Leavitt's Stars,'' by George Johnson, and ''Lavoisier in the Year One,'' by Madison Smartt Bell.
 This brief-lives format can be found throughout the publishers' catalogs. Oxford University Press has its Lives and Legacies series, the most recent being ''Roger Williams,'' by Edwin S. Gaustad. The British novelist Peter Ackroyd has just embarked on a series of short biographies, Ackroyd's Brief Lives, which began with Chaucer earlier this year and will include J.M.W. Turner and Isaac Newton. 
 Times Books is well into the American Presidents, a first-rate series, overseen by Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., that offers well-edited, sharply written lives in a uniform format. For those of us who dozed through the administrations of Polk, Taylor and Arthur in school, this is a golden opportunity to make amends. Some of the author-subject matchups are intriguing. Mr. Schlesinger has paired E.L. Doctorow with Abraham Lincoln, Louis Auchincloss with Teddy Roosevelt and Gary Hart with James Monroe. 
 Not every president cooperates. Ted Widmer recently delivered a surprisingly bouncy, entertaining account of Martin van Buren that makes the case, rather persuasively, that the Little Magician should be regarded as the author of modern party politics. Charles W. Calhoun, on the other hand, does not have a lot to work with in Benjamin Harrison, unless tariffs and currency policy happen to set your pulse racing.
 Travel and ideas have also been downsized. Oxford cleverly drafted a motley group of seven authors to pick one of the deadly sins and hold forth, briefly. In Crown's Journeys series, writers like Christopher Buckley, Edwidge Danticat and Roy Blount Jr. have devised idiosyncratic travel guides intended for the pedestrian.
 The matchmaking game is a roll of the dice. Wendy Wasserstein on sloth is a delight. Francine Prose's ''Gluttony'' reads like a class assignment. ''Washington Schlepped Here,'' a tour of the nation's capital by Mr. Buckley, is so perfunctory that it might have been written on a napkin during lunch. Even worse, it's a bureaucrat's view of Washington: rarely has a city seemed so boring. By contrast, Mr. Blount's tour of New Orleans, ''Feet on the Street,'' delivers the goods -- it's a wild, unpredictable ramble up and down the streets of a wild, unpredictable city. 
 Reaktion Books, a small press with a very high brow, recently initiated a series called Critical Lives that focuses on leading figures in modern culture. Franz Kafka, Pablo Picasso and Jean Genet have been given the treatment so far, and this may be everyone's last, best chance to get a handle on Michel Foucault before he disappears from the radar screen. In ''Michel Foucault,'' David Macey does the job in about 150 pages.
 Even more compressed is a promising new series from Norton, due out in September, called How to Read. The subjects range from Shakespeare to Hitler, but the approach is uniform. Each author presents about 10 extracts from the writer under discussion and subjects them to a close critical reading. These key texts serve as entry points to the mind and the work of figures like Freud and Wittgenstein.
 The Modern Library, in its Chronicles series, expands the short-take concept to just about everything. It has included titles by A.N. Wilson on London, Jeffrey Garten on globalization, Colin Renfrew on prehistory and Pankaj Mishra on the rise of modern India. My introduction to the series came with ''The Company,'' the snappily told history of an idea that today rules all our lives. The authors, John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge, who both work for The Economist, begin with simple barter exchanges in ancient Mesopotamia and in a little less than 200 pages arrive at their final destination, the multinational corporation. In a couple of hours, the reader travels through all of recorded history and comes out the other end, stuffed with valuable information and pointed toward the future. 
 Give me more. I mean, less.

HEADLINE: For Homeowners, Frustration and Anger at Court Ruling

BYLINE: By AVI SALZMAN and LAURA MANSNERUS; Avi Salzman reported from New London for this article, and Laura Mansnerus from Trenton.

DATELINE: NEW LONDON, Conn., June 23 

 BODY:
The owners of the few brick and frame houses remaining in the Fort Trumbull neighborhood here who lost their fight in the Supreme Court to stop the city from seizing their homes said Thursday that they were devastated and saw few other legal options.
 ''I am sick,'' said Susette Kelo, sitting on the porch of the pink Victorian cottage that she bought on her nurse's salary eight years ago. ''Do they have any idea what they've done?'' 
 What the justices did in their 5-to-4 decision, Kelo v. New London, was allow the city redevelopment authority to condemn the old waterfront neighborhood so a private developer can put office and apartment buildings in their place. 
 But similar battles are being fought across the nation in state courts, the usual forum for eminent domain cases. The Washington lawyers who brought the challenge to the City of New London's redevelopment project say they see opportunity in state legislatures and state courts to address the question of whether local governments can use eminent domain, or condemnation, to replace homes and businesses with bigger, better sources of tax revenue.
 Though the Connecticut Supreme Court ruled against Ms. Kelo and her neighbors, courts in several other states have ruled that their constitutions protect owners in cases like Ms. Kelo's. Such rulings by a state's highest court are not subject to review by any federal court.
 The rights of owners have become populist causes in many places as local governments have grown bolder in efforts to fatten their tax bases.
 ''I think there's going to be an unbelievable popular backlash to this decision,'' said Dana Berliner, a lawyer at the Institute for Justice, a libertarian group that represents the New London homeowners and has taken dozens of other eminent domain disputes. ''The court has just told homeowners that the government can take their house for someone who pays more in taxes.'' 
 The Institute for Justice says there are thousands of similar disputes around the nation, although many involve a local government's designation of an area as ''blighted'' -- not an issue in New London -- under laws dating to the 1950's and 60's when slums were cleared wholesale. 
 Nine state supreme courts, including those in Illinois, Michigan and Washington, have forbidden the use of eminent domain simply to bring in more revenue and jobs. New York's highest court, the Court of Appeals, has allowed such condemnations. The New Jersey courts have not ruled on the issue, although a trial court in 1999 barred the state Casino Reinvestment Development Authority's plan to take a house, a small Italian restaurant and a pawnshop to allow the Trump Plaza casino to expand. 
 Michigan was among the first states to encourage the use of eminent domain to promote economic development. In a 1981 decision, the Michigan Supreme Court allowed the City of Detroit to condemn 1,400 houses and 140 business to make way for a General Motors plant. In doing so, it encouraged the use of eminent domain for economic development all over the country. Then, last August, the court reversed the legal rationale behind that decision.
 With no recourse left in Connecticut's courts, Ms. Berliner said lawyers from the Institute for Justice would go to New London next week to discuss other possibilities to save the houses, including appeals to the State Legislature.
 Bill Von Winkle, a plaintiff who owns three houses with 12 apartments in Fort Trumbull, said he would take every opportunity to continue the battle.
 ''It's desperately hard to believe that in this country you can lose your home to private developers,'' Mr. Von Winkle said. ''It's basically corporate theft.'' 
 The redevelopment authority has set aside $1.6 million to compensate property owners. Scott G. Bullock of the Institute for Justice, who has argued the case in three courts, said the city had offered most of them ''something in the low 100,000's,'' although that was based on appraisals made five years ago. The city took possession of the Fort Trumbull houses four years ago and has since been collecting rent. 
 The city's lawyer, Thomas J. Londregan, said Thursday that the United States Supreme Court had vindicated the plan to revitalize the city's waterfront. 
 ''I'm here to tell you that this case was never about the taking of property from one person and giving it to another,'' Mr. Londregan said. ''This case was not some type of land grab. This case was about the City of New London, its six square miles and its economic survival.''

HEADLINE: Poll Shows Modest Changes In Levels of Anti-U.S. Mood

BYLINE: By BRIAN KNOWLTON; International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 23 

 BODY:
The anti-Americanism that surged through much of the world over the war in Iraq shows modest signs of abating, although distinctly negative views persist in the Muslim world, an international opinion poll released Thursday indicates.
 Favorability ratings of the United States -- while well below levels of 2002, before a trans-Atlantic rift opened over Iraq -- improved slightly even in France and Germany, as both sides have sought to mend the earlier wounds.
 Still, among America's traditional allies, only Britain and Canada remained positive in their overall views of the United States. In many countries the unpopularity of President Bush remained a salient factor. 
 ''Anti-Americanism in most parts of the world we surveyed seems pretty entrenched,'' said Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Center, which conducted the poll. ''But there are some very positive signs of progress in India and Russia and Indonesia.''
 For example, 79 percent of Indonesians said they had a more favorable view of the United States as a result of the aid Americans provided after the Dec. 26 tsunami. Indians appeared pleased with closer economic ties to the United States, and Russians with cooperation on trade and terrorism.
 In Britain, Canada and France, about three-quarters of respondents said Mr. Bush's re-election had made them feel less favorable toward the United States. 
 The poll, a Pew Global Attitudes Survey, was conducted from April 20 to May 31, surveying nearly 17,000 people in the United States and 15 other countries: Britain, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Pakistan, Poland, Russia, Spain and Turkey. 
 The margin of sampling error ranged from plus or minus two to plus or minus four percentage points. In most of the countries the poll was conducted face to face, but in some was done by telephone. It was conducted nationwide except in India, Pakistan and China, where it mostly covered urban areas. 
 Around the world, a sense that the United States pays little attention to other countries' interests remained widespread, although India was an exception.
 Asked what could be done to improve America's image, former Senator John C. Danforth, a co-sponsor of the Pew survey, referred to the war in Iraq and said, ''It could be that the price of being forceful in dealing with perceived problems is you're unpopular.''
 Mr. Danforth, who resigned as the American ambassador to the United Nations in January, added, ''The United States has been assertive, and our view is that with the threat of terrorism we cannot be passive.''
 Americans appeared quite aware of their image problem. Only one in four thought the country was well-liked abroad. 
 Strong majorities in several countries said they would like to see another military power emerge to balance the United States, but most, especially in the West, did not want it to be China.
 Seven in 10 of those surveyed in Britain, France and Russia opposed a rising Chinese superpower, as did about 8 in 10 Germans and Americans. But the idea was much more popular in developing countries: majorities in Indonesia, Jordan, Pakistan and Turkey favored it.
 Most West Europeans said they would prefer greater independence from the United States in security and diplomatic affairs. An overwhelming 85 percent of the French said it would be good if the European Union emerged as a military rival to the United States.
 Immigration remains a vexing issue. More than half of the Germans polled called immigration from the Middle East and North Africa a bad thing; only one-third saw it as good. They were even less favorable to immigration from Eastern Europe.
 The most welcoming country in Europe was Spain, where two-thirds of those polled called immigration from North Africa and the Middle East a good thing, followed by Britain, with 61 percent in favor. Although the United States is traditionally viewed as a land of opportunity, people in most countries, when asked where they would advise a young person to move to be able to lead a good life, chose other destinations. Australia, Britain, Canada and Germany were cited more often than the United States.
 Over all, the most negative views of the United States were found in Muslim countries. Two countries caught up in the American effort to combat terrorism, Turkey and Pakistan, were the most negative: only about one in five people in each country said they viewed the United States favorably. 
 In the Muslim world and in Europe, the war in Iraq remained as unpopular as it was in 2003 and 2004. Views in Pakistan turned sharply more negative after allegations that American guards at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, had abused the Koran.

HEADLINE: Saratoga's Bid To Start Anew

BYLINE: By DANIEL J. WAKIN

DATELINE: SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. 

 BODY:
COBWEBS clung to the blue and brown plastic seats at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center last week as workers pounded on the roof and a brook gurgled below.
 Those cobwebs have been swept away for the formal opening of the center's 40th season tomorrow, along with -- it hopes -- the shrouds of scandal and mismanagement.
 The performing arts center is pronouncing itself reborn after a grim year touched off by the announcement that the New York City Ballet -- a founding constituent -- would be banished because of a financial crisis. The news led to a scathing state audit, an attorney general's investigation and a bombardment of critical articles in the local press.
 But a new and politically connected executive director was appointed. The old board resigned en masse last month and was replaced. The State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, which performed the audit, declared itself satisfied with the center's progress. So has the state attorney general's office, which is bringing its own investigation to a close. And money -- from private donors and taxpayers -- is trickling back in. 
 ''There's a total turnaround here,'' said Marcia J. White, the new executive director and a former close aide to the State Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, whose district includes the center. ''When you see things slipping through your fingers, you recognize what you might lose, and you recapture what's precious,'' she said. ''That's what's happened here.''
 More important to balletomanes, the New York City Ballet is returning, although the company remains without a long-term contract and is chafing at how much it has to subsidize its performances. This year, it will present 19 ballets in July, starting with ''A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' the work that opened the center in 1966.
 In August, the Philadelphia Orchestra takes up its residency under Charles Dutoit, with solo appearances by Yo-Yo Ma, Martha Argerich and Emanuel Ax, among others. There is the Lake George Opera, a chamber music series and the usual slate of well-attended pop acts presented by Clear Channel Entertainment, which pays a $1 million yearly fee.
 The center's bucolic surroundings of lush woods, manicured lawns and stately 1930's spa architecture also remain, along with the soothing sound of the brook near the center, which a past Philadelphia Orchestra maestro once famously (and unsuccessfully) ordered silenced. And the center is embarking on long-needed repairs and renovations.
 But all is not rosy.
 Ticket sales so far this year for the City Ballet are down by 15 percent from the same time last year although the Philadelphians' sales are up. The endowment, raided in past years to pay the bills, has dropped to $6.8 million from about $10 million. The center owes $3.5 million in loans, and another $2.5 million is restricted to specific purposes. The board's ambitious goal is to build the unrestricted endowment to $10 million over five years. That amount, it believes, will spin off the income necessary to make up chronic deficits that ran to $600,000 a year.
 The center said it hopes to break even this year, although it is several hundred thousand dollars short in its fund-raising and has budgeted for an increase in ticket sales over last year.

Cautious Optimism
 Along with financial troubles, some resentment lingers.
 ''There needs to be some financial restitution,'' by the former president, Herb Chesbrough, said Jennifer Leidig, a member of Save the Ballet, a grass-roots organization that raised money for the center. But even Ms. Leidig, one of the most vocal critics of the past administration and the high salary paid its former executive director, said she was satisfied by the changes.
 So, apparently, is the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation. ''I think we're on the road to recovery here,'' said Bernadette Castro, the commissioner. Center officials said they expect more parks money for capital improvements, but Ms. Castro declined to put a timetable or amount on the funds. 
 The orchestra and ballet company are giving Ms. White the benefit of the doubt, with reservations.
 ''I think these are very positive steps they are taking,'' said Christopher Ramsey, the City Ballet's director for external affairs. ''But they have a lot of hard work to do.'' Mr. Ramsey said a major accomplishment was re-establishing public trust, crucial to attracting ticket buyers, political support and donations. 
 Mr. Ramsey said he remained dissatisfied with the company's financial arrangement. The cost of bringing the company to Saratoga is $2.6 million, with the center paying $1.8 million. The ballet has to make up the rest. 
 ''We need some assurances that we're going to have a more equitable fee structure going forward,'' he said. Ms. White declined to discuss future negotiations.
 Joseph H. Kluger, the departing president of the Philadelphia Orchestra, said he was satisfied with his fee arrangement, in which the orchestra covers $1.1 million of its $2.4 million expenses. In the arts, ''everybody is in the business of losing money wisely,'' he said.
 Despite the lingering problems, Ms. White remains relentlessly optimistic. ''The most important thing is for the community to move forward,'' she said. ''We don't want to open those wounds again.''

Earthquake and Aftershock
 The tale of the Saratoga arts center's fall and journey back is one that interweaves small town life, the arts and New York State politics. 
 Backed by Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, the center was born in the early 1960's to restore life to a no-longer-thriving spa zone. Unlike a Tanglewood or Glimmerglass and their ambitions as artistic training grounds and incubators, it functions essentially as a summer home for the City Ballet and Philadelphia Orchestra, which present ready-made lineups from their regular seasons.
 Signs of the ties between the center and the area abound, like the chain of Stewart's Shops convenience stores owned by the Dake family, who were among the center's founders, or the CV Whitney Memorial Highway into town, named after the late husband of Mary Lou Whitney, a board member and major contributor. William P. Dake, the chairman of Stewart's, is the new board chairman. 
 The center began struggling in the late 1990's amid declining arts audiences across the board. But it was slow to react. In February of this year the board voted to end ties with the ballet, saying it could no longer afford the residency,
 It was an unexpected earthquake in the ballet and Saratoga worlds, touching off a local fund-raising drive and the Parks Office audit. Attention focused on the long-time president, Mr. Chesbrough, who was seen to be behind the decision.
 A preliminary audit report in November said he was vastly overpaid, with annual compensation of more than $328,000. It criticized his $400,000-plus severance package. The final audit report in March also cited him and a board member for potential conflicts of interest over business dealings with the center. 
 The auditors called for Mr. Chesbrough's resignation, and under scrutiny from the attorney general's office, the board early this year negotiated his departure and a severance package worth only a tenth of the previous one. 
 Along with challenging the ballet decision, the auditors criticized the center for bad financial planning and anemic fund-raising, and said the board had isolated itself from the community. They recommended a wholesale reform of how the board functioned.
 [Mr. Chesbrough was not available for comment late Thursday afternoon, the center said. But in an interview with The Times Union of Albany published on June 12, he defended the decision to dismiss the City Ballet on artistic and audience-building grounds. He said the financial state of the center was not as bad as depicted, and condemned what he called ''nasty, unfair'' attacks on him.]
 Ms. White took over in February, with a salary of $175,000 and a more modest bonus system.

More Changes
 But her presence was not enough. It became clear that for the center to gain credibility among donors, the board had to be replaced. ''There was still a lot of anger in the community,'' said Abraham M. Lackman, a recent board member and a budget director for Rudolph W. Giuliani when he was New York City mayor.
 The center is now building itself back up. A search has begun for new investment advisers, Mr. Lackman said, to replace, among others, a board member who had filled the same role. The center is close to hiring a development director, a job once held by Mr. Chesbrough's wife.
 The board, however, has resisted some of the audit's recommendations as excessive or not urgent, including a bylaw requiring the presence of two Parks Office representatives as directors, a stronger conflict-of-interest clause, term limits and more board members. 
 Mr. Lackman said the state had shown its approval of their efforts by granting the center -- thanks largely to Senator Bruno, the powerful majority leader -- $2 million for improvements and repairs. The money will go toward improving the pavilion's accoustics and lighting, repairing the roof and painting. The senator has long been the center's political patron. Now two of his former staff members are part of the new guard: Ms. White, an aide for 18 years and his press secretary for the last decade, and Mr. Lackman, a former special adviser and chief of staff for the Senate Finance Committee.

Fences to Mend
 Ms. White has also helped attract private money, a priority of the board in picking a new executive director. Five gifts totaling $2.5 million have come in the last two months to cover operating expenses. The donors include Ms. Whitney, a major figure in Saratoga, who resigned from the board in acrimony after helping blow the whistle on its fiscal policies in 2001 but rejoined after the overhaul. 
 When she was hired, Ms. White, 57, a former nurse, had little experience in arts administration or running a big institution. But what she did have was political and public relations savvy and dedication to the center dating from her days as a ballet mom. She also happened to be the Bruno staff member who handled issues involving the center. 
 ''Marcia White is perceived as a fence mender who's capable and intelligent, and better than that, connected,'' said Kathleen Smith, a former president of the Saratoga chamber of commerce and a local innkeeper. ''She's doing everything right so far.'' 
 Ms. White said when it became clear that Mr. Chesbrough was on his way out, friends told her that she would be perfect for the job, and she applied. She contended that Mr. Bruno had played no role in her hiring but was supportive of her taking the job. 
 ''Because of my experience and what I've learned in 20 years of government and public relations, you can see a problem quickly and know how to handle it,'' she said. 
 ''You need to listen to the people, always.''

HEADLINE: Jets Cling To Dream Of Stadium On West Side

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Nearly three weeks after the Jets' plan for a Manhattan football stadium died in Albany, an appeals court yesterday upheld the team's deal to buy the development rights over the West Side railyard for $250 million.
 The Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court rejected a challenge by Madison Square Garden, the most vehement and well-heeled opponent of the stadium, ruling that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority made a rational decision to sell the rights to the Jets, and that the M.T.A. was not obligated to accept the offer from the Garden simply because it would have paid more money. 
 The decision might seem to be a hollow victory for the Jets, considering the June 6 decision in Albany that blocked state subsidies for the project. In revising its 2012 Olympics bid, the city has already moved past the proposed Jets stadium to plans for a new and far less contentious stadium in Queens for the Mets. 
 But the Jets and their most vociferous supporters in the construction industry have refused to throw in the towel on the West Side project. While many people at City Hall refer to the planned stadium in the past tense, the team and its supporters are exploring ways of raising $300 million to offset the money that the state refused to supply.
 At a June 10 luncheon for the team's supporters in the construction unions at Shelly's New York restaurant in Midtown, Matt Higgins, a Jets vice president, sent a clear message: ''We're not giving up,'' according to two union officials who were there. Much of the discussion revolved around raising money and assessing the chances of getting the City Council to rezone the railyard for a stadium, they said.
 ''If they get the site, we'll take another shot at this next year,'' said Stephen McInnis, political director for the carpenters union.
 Both the unions and building contractors are looking at whether they could invest pension fund money in the stadium project if the Jets go forward, according to Mr. McInnis, as well as Louis J. Coletti, president of the Building Trades Employers' Association and Vincent F. Pitta, a lawyer for several large unions in the city.
 ''There'll be thousands of jobs, and it'll be a huge injection into the economy,'' Mr. Pitta said.
 The Jets were willing to invest a record-setting amount of money--about $1.6 billion -- in what would be the most expensive stadium in the world. The project would also have required a $600 million investment by the city and the state, which would have been the largest public subsidy ever for a stadium.
 But Woody Johnson, the owner of the Jets, has already spent more than $63 million and five years on plans to build a stadium in Manhattan. Next month, the team's intentions will become clear when the M.T.A. is expected to ask the team to sign a contract to buy the property. If the Jets want to preserve their right to build on the site, the team will then have to make a $50 million down payment to the agency and prepare to complete the transaction in early 2006. Otherwise the team will have to walk away from the agreement.
 Peter S. Kalikow, the M.T.A. chairman, said the agency would review the matter in a closed session of its board next week.
 But political uncertainties abound. There are several outstanding lawsuits challenging the project, and after the November city election the team may have fewer supporters on the City Council than it does now. Madison Square Garden and its parent, Cablevision, which declined to comment on the appellate court ruling, have no plans to go away. 
 In the meantime, the Jets are also talking to New Jersey officials and the Giants about a new stadium for both teams in the Meadowlands that would cost far less than the Manhattan proposal, requiring an estimated $400 million to $500 million each from the Jets and the Giants. One Jets supporter acknowledged that talk of a simmering New York option also gives the team leverage in its negotiations with New Jersey.

HEADLINE: Shares Take a Heavy Hit As Oil Briefly Touches $60

BYLINE: By ROBEN FARZAD

 BODY:
Stocks fell sharply yesterday as oil prices hit $60 a barrel for the first time and FedEx reported disappointing earnings, citing the high cost of energy.
 Crude oil prices briefly touched $60, a record, on inventory concerns and expectations of a strong summer driving season; the price retreated in the afternoon. 
 Oil contracts for August delivery rose $1.33, or 2.3 percent, to close at $59.42 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, representing an increase of 58 percent in the last year and more than double the price of two years ago. Gasoline for delivery in July rose 4.42 cents, to $1.66 a gallon. Still, crude oil prices would have to hit $90 a barrel to match their inflation-adjusted record set in 1980. 
 Transportation shares led the stock market's decline. The Dow Jones transportation index fell 3.1 percent, led by an 8.3 percent decline in shares of FedEx, the package delivery company, which announced weaker-than-expected earnings and a disappointing outlook because of higher jet fuel prices. 
 Investors are concerned that higher energy expenses will increase transportation and raw material costs, hurting corporate profit margins. Shares of DuPont and Procter & Gamble, two blue-chip manufacturers that rely on raw materials derived from crude oil, fell yesterday. Shares of DuPont dropped $1.17, or 2.5 percent, to close at $45.43, while shares of P.&G. lost 78 cents, or 1.4 percent, to close at $53.66. 
 Airline stocks plunged, with Delta losing 6.3 percent and AMR, the parent of American Airlines, falling 4.3 percent. Shares of Delta were down 26 cents and closed at $3.85. AMR dropped 57 cents to close at $12.57.
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 166.49 points, or 1.6 percent, to 10,421.44, while the Standard & Poor's 500 index declined 13.15 points, or 1.1 percent, to 1,200.73. The Nasdaq composite index was down 21.37 points, or 1 percent, to 2,070.66.
 ''If oil hits $60, the market asks, 'Why not $75?''' said Robert Harrington, head of institutional equities trading at UBS. ''And that can really hit the economy.'' 
 Mr. Harrington also attributed the sell-off to the approaching end of a challenging quarter for money managers, particularly hedge funds. ''People are getting their books in order.''
 The prospect that civil unrest might interrupt oil production in Nigeria, one of the world's top exporters, worried the crude market, especially as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries seems unable to increase supply to meet strong international demand. This week, the president of OPEC said that he would consult with member nations to increase production by as much as 500,000 barrels a day. Despite that assurance, crude prices have continued to move higher.
 ''It's not about the oil in the ground,'' said Jeb Armstrong, an energy industry analyst with Argus Research. ''It's our ability to get it out.''
 United States refineries are running at full speed, forming a bottleneck for any additional crude. Motorists could pay higher prices at the gasoline pump if refiners do not shift capacity from heating oil back to gas for the peak summer driving season. 
 The Energy Department reported yesterday that domestic gasoline production fell to an average 8.7 million barrels a day last week, a decline of 255,000 barrels compared with the prior week.
 ''We're pressing OPEC; we're pressing the refiners; and oil still hits $60,'' Mr. Harrington said. 
 Other industry watchers cite speculation as a driving force behind the recent surge in crude prices.
 ''I don't see anything magical about $60 oil,'' said Gene Gillespie, senior analyst with Howard Weil, an energy brokerage firm in New Orleans. ''There's a lot of money pouring into commodity funds, and that's bidding up crude futures. Investors are buying what's been working.''
 Nevertheless, long-term supply and demand concerns loom large.
 ''The question remains, what kind of capacity room is left for OPEC?'' Mr. Armstrong said. ''The amount of investment of the past couple of years just has not kept up with demand.''
 In the Treasury market, the 10-year note fell 3/32, to 101 13/32, and the yield, which moves inversely to the price, rose to 3.95 percent, from 3.94 percent.

Broadway

'AFTER THE NIGHT AND THE MUSIC' Though its opening odd-couple-on-a-dance-floor skit shows promising charm, this evening of three sketches from the first lady of neurotic comedy, Elaine May, mostly feels terminally torpid in the way that overworked and familiar material often does, even from comic geniuses. Daniel Sullivan directs an ensemble that notably features Jeannie Berlin (Ms. May's daughter and onstage alter ego) and the invaluable J. Smith-Cameron. (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club, at the Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200.(Ben Brantley)

'ALL SHOOK UP' In a pint-size theater with a campy young cast, ''All Shook Up'' might be a moderate hoot. Inflated to Broadway proportions, it's a mind-numbing holler (2:10). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)

'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish windup music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldberg-like machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us (2.30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)

'THE CONSTANT WIFE' A stylish production of a creaky 1926 comedy by W. Somerset Maugham. Kate Burton stars as a well-heeled English wife who scarcely raises an eyebrow at her husband's philandering, scandalizing her friends. Maugham's dialogue isn't quite as witty as the brisk Ms. Burton and Lynn Redgrave, who plays her imperious mother, manage to make it sound (2:15). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)719-1300. (Charles Isherwood)

'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper, this tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005 and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' From the moment it sounds its first word in this placid revival, the voice of Harvey Fierstein (who has replaced Alfred Molina in the central role of Tevye) makes the audience prick up its ears. Whether that voice fits comfortably into the Russian village of Anatevka is another issue. But at least it brings a bit of zest to this abidingly bland production (2:55). Minskoff, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100.(Brantley)

'THE GLASS MENAGERIE' This revival suggests that to recollect the past is to see life as if it had occurred underwater, in some viscous sea. Folks drown in this treacherous element. Unfortunately, that includes the show's luminous but misdirected and miscast stars, Jessica Lange and Christian Slater (2:30). Barrymore, 243 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS' (Tony Award, Best Play Revival 2005) Highly caffeinated bliss. Watching Joe Mantello's hopping revival of David Mamet's play about a dog-eat-dog real estate office is like having espresso pumped directly into your bloodstream. But what's a little lost sleep when you've had the chance to see a dream-team ensemble, including Liev Schrieber and Alan Alda, pitching fast-ball Mamet dialogue with such pure love for the athletics of acting (1:50) Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200.(Brantley)

'JACKIE MASON: FRESHLY SQUEEZED' Jackie Mason has so cunningly manufactured and marketed his dyspeptic comic persona -- the herky-jerky movements used to embellish the routines, the voice that's like a sinus infection with a bad back -- that he may soon be able to refine all actual jokes out of his act, and still slay 'em. That's chutzpah. And quite a talent, too (2:05). Hayes, 240 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

'LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'THE PILLOWMAN' For all its darkness of plot and imagery, Martin McDonagh's tale of a suspected child murderer in a totalitarian state dazzles with a brightness now largely absent from Broadway. Exquisitely directed and designed, ''The Pillowman'' features top-of-the-line performances from Billy Crudup, Jeff Goldblum, Zeljko Ivanek and Michael Stuhlbarg (2:40). Booth, 222 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'STEEL MAGNOLIAS' Despite an ensemble featuring high-profile veterans of stage, film and television, sitting through this portrait of friendship among Southern women, set in a beauty parlor in small-town Louisiana, is like watching nail polish dry (2:20). Lyceum, 149 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE' The capricious gods of casting have not been kind to Tennessee Williams of late. This staging, starring an erratic Natasha Richardson as Blanche, is not the hazy mess that the current ''Glass Menagerie'' is. But it, too, suffers from fundamental mismatches of parts, especially John C. Reilly's sexually unmagnetic Stanley (2:45). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212)719-1300. (Brantley)

'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical, directed by Walter Bobbie and choreographed by Wayne Cilento, never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

* 'WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?' Everybody ultimately loses in Edward Albee's great marital wrestling match of a play from 1962. But theatergoers who attend this revealingly acted new production, starring a superb Kathleen Turner and Bill Irwin, are destined to leave the Longacre feeling like winners (2:50). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

Off Broadway

* 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Isherwood)

'BEAST ON THE MOON' Richard Kalinoski's musty romantic drama depicts the fractious marriage of two survivors of the mass killings of Armenians during World War I. Larry Moss's production is respectable and effective, but the performances by Omar Metwally and Lena Georgas are exhaustingly busy (2:00). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

* 'BORDER/CLASH: A LITANY OF DESIRES' With razor-sharp cheekbones and two voluminous puffs of hair resting on top of a delicate wisp of a body, Staceyann Chin, the author and star of this new autobiographical solo show, is a caricaturist's dream. Her appealing if not terribly original show follows her from a tumultuous childhood in Jamaica to New York City, where she starred on Broadway in ''Russell Simmons' Def Poetry Jam.'' (1:30). The Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212)307-4100. (Jason Zinoman)

'THE CHERRY ORCHARD' The debate about evoking the proper measurements of humor and pathos in the plays of Anton Chekhov is settled evenly if dubiously in Scott Zigler's production for the Atlantic Theater Company: It fails more or less equally at eliciting laughter and tears (2:00). Atlantic Theater Company, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

'DRUMSTRUCK' The noisy novelty at Dodger Stages, is a mixed blessing. Providing theatergoers a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating; and on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast. So, while literally and figuratively giving off many good vibes, it adds up to lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). Dodgers Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Lawrence Van Gelder)

* 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'HURLYBURLY' If you are going to inhabit a wasteland, you might as well be thoroughly wasted. That seems to be the first rule of survival for the characters who have been brought so vibrantly and unforgivingly to life in this smashing revival of David Rabe's 1984 play. But thanks to a terrific cast, theatergoers are likely to experience a heady buzz of excitement and clarity, which any of the desperate characters onstage would kill for (3:15). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, garment district, (212)307-4100.(Brantley)

'LAZER VAUDEVILLE' If this isn't an ancient showbiz rule, it ought to be: things will look a lot more impressive if they are done in the dark with a heavy dose of fluorescence. That seems to be the guiding principle behind this hodgepodge of juggling, rope twirling and such, delivered wordlessly by the cast (1:30). Lambs Theater, 130 West 44th Street, Midtown, (212)239-6200. (Neil Genzlinger)

'MANUSCRIPT' Three talented, attractive young actors and some skillfully shaggy dialogue are the only reasons to see Paul Grellong's inconsequential play, a revenge tale centering on the theft of an unpublished manuscript expected to be of great literary merit. Implausibility is a big problem: there are plot holes here you could easily drive a hardback copy of ''Infinite Jest'' through (1:30). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

'THE MUSICAL OF MUSICALS!' The musical is the happy narcissist of theater; parody is the best form of narcissism. All it needs are smart writers and winning performers. That's what we get in this case (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 5, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Margo Jefferson)

'MY SWEETHEART'S THE MAN IN THE MOON' When the eccentric millionaire Harry Thaw shot and killed the famed architect Stanford White on the roof of Madison Square Garden almost a century ago, the subsequent trial of the century -- the first of many in the 20th -- was a perfect storm of celebrity scandal. Don Nigro's ''My Sweetheart's the Man in the Moon,'' recounts the sensational events with nuance and admirable research, but the passionless production unfortunately has the whiff of the whiff of Masterpiece Theater (2:00). 14th Street Y, 344 East 14th Street, East Village, (212)868-4444.( Zinoman)

* 'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros'' directed by Orson Welles and starring Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

'THE PARIS LETTER' Jon Robin Baitz's ambitious but schematic play is a morality tale about a misspent life and the dangers of sexual repression. Cleanly directed by Doug Hughes, it features a pair of excellent performances by the superb actors John Glover and Ron Rifkin. But Mr. Baitz gets himself trapped in the mechanical working of an overcomplicated plot (2:00). Roundabout Theater Company, at the Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, Midtown, (212)719-1300.(Isherwood)

'PEOPLE ARE LIVING THERE' This unrewarding Athol Fugard play benefits from some rewarding performances by its four actors. O'Mara Leary is Milly, who on her 50th birthday has been dumped by her boyfriend, and tries to keep her spirits up by recruiting some pals to join her in what turns out to be the worst birthday party ever (1:30). Signature Theater's Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)279-4200.( Genzlinger)

* 'PRIVATE FEARS IN PUBLIC PLACES' Alan Ayckbourn's 67th play, a minor-key comedy about six Londoners leading lives of quiet desperation, is rueful, funny, touching and altogether wonderful. Sir Alan's flawless cast amplifies the emotional impact of his writing in variously subtle and hilarious ways, while respecting the depth in his literary spareness (1:50). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200.(Isherwood)

'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212)307-4100. (Van Gelder)

* 'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

'THRILL ME: THE LEOPOLD & LOEB STORY' The story is familiar, and the script and lyrics are not especially innovative, but somehow Stephen Dolginoff's pocket musical about the Leopold and Loeb murder case lands like a well-placed punch. Every time Doug Kreeger, as Loeb, and Matt Bauer, as Leopold, blend their voices in close harmony, it's a reminder that evil often looks and sounds beautiful (1:20). York Theater Company, at St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue, at 54th Street, (212)868-4444. (Genzlinger)

'TROLLS' Dick DeBenedictis and Bill Dyer's semi-terrific musical is about gay men who aren't as young as they used to be. With a glorious opening, likable characters and affecting but derivative music, the show is worth seeing but needs some work (1:35). Actors' Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200.(Anita Gates)

'UNSUSPECTING SUSAN' Celia Imrie stars as a snobbish Englishwoman in this funny, engaging (mostly) and tragic one-woman show written by Stewart Permutt. Ms. Imrie's character frets about her troubled son, living in London with a charming man, but doesn't begin to grasp how worried she should really be (1:10). Part of Brits Off Broadway. 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200. ( Gates)

Off Off Broadway

'BIG TIMES' Did you hear the one about the three actresses who wrote themselves a play? The punchline is this sweet, slender homage to the glory days of vaudeville, complete with goofy jokes, gags, and good music by the Moonlighters: kids are as likely to enjoy it as adults. Walkerspace, 46 Walker Street, TriBeCa, (212)868-4444. (Anne Midgette)

* 'DISPOSABLE MEN' James Scruggs, who wrote and performed this collection of character pieces, engages issues of race in the button-pushing satirical style that Spike Lee was aiming for (yet failed to pull off) in his film ''Bamboozled.'' This multimedia show compares the way African-American men are portrayed in the media to images of monsters in classic horror films like ''Frankenstein'' and ''King Kong'' (1:10). Here Arts Center, 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212)868-4444.( Zinoman)

'SCREEN PLAY' A.R. Gurney's gleefully partisan retooling of the film ''Casablanca'' sets one tough saloon owner's battle between idealism and cynicism in Buffalo in the 21st century. Staged by Jim Simpson as a deftly orchestrated reading, ''Screen Play'' turns out to be more than a quick collegiate caper; it's a morally indignant work that fights frivolity with frivolity (1:10). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212)352-3101.(Brantley)

Last Chance

'BROOKLYN THE MUSICAL' Try to imagine a sanitized ''Hair'' or a secular ''Godspell,'' with a helping of funky 70's disco, all filtered through the vocal pyrotechnics of ''American Idol'' (1:45). Gerald Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday.(Brantley)

'LA CAGE AUX FOLLES' (Tony Award, Best Musical Revival 2005) Robert Goulet is now striding gallantly through this garish revival of the Jerry Herman-Harvey Fierstein musical. Mr. Goulet brings a subdued professionalism to the role of Georges, the owner of a transvestite nightclub on the Riviera who is facing a rising souffle of domestic conflict (2:30). Marquis, 1535 Broadway, between 45th and 46th Streets, (212)307-4100, closing on Sunday. ( Isherwood)

'FLAT' This happily crass send-up of a BBC family drama is perfectly pitched for fans nostalgic for the self-parodying vulgarity of the sit-com ''Married With Children.'' Twelve episodes, quick scenes, stock characters and an opening montage sequence with a jingle that will lodge itself in your cranium, like it or not (1:00). Part of the Moral Values Festival. Brick Theater, 575 Metropolitan Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (212)868-4444, closing on Sunday. (Zinoman)

'HECUBA' Revenge is a dish served at room temperature in the intelligent but passionless production starring Vanessa Redgrave. Ms. Redgrave intriguingly brings forth the cool strategist inside the battered woman. But if we can admire this abject figure's salvaged aplomb, we rarely get a visceral sense of the despair and the rage at injustice that make the character such a compelling one (1:45). Brooklyn Academy of Music's Howard Gilman Opera House, 30 Lafayette Avenue, (718)636-4100, closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)

'JACKSON'S WAY' Thirty-one-year-old Will Adamsdale isn't so much a comedian as a veritable wizard; a virtuoso of the transcendently absurd. Like a magician pulling a rabbit out of a hat, he spins a wacky world of increasingly bizarre nonsense out of thin air, creating an exquisitely idiosyncratic worldview that is as funny as it is wonderfully weird, all in the guise of being a life coach named Chris John Jackson, inventor of the motivational technique (1:15). Part of Brits Off Broadway. 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200, closing on Sunday. (Phoebe Hoban)

'LITTLE MARY' William S. Leavengood's parable about faith, politics and conservatism in the Roman Catholic Church can sound more like a position paper than a play, but the author's strong storytelling instincts can't be denied (2:10). Sanford Meisner Theater, 164 11th Avenue, at 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)352-3101, closing on Sunday. (Andrea Stevens)

* 'MARK TWAIN TONIGHT!' In a role he has been playing over half a century, Hal Holbrook delivers a performance that is perhaps most remarkable for the energy it derives from a studied languor. Mr. Holbrook's Twain is an exhilarating master of theatrical passive aggression, while Twain's observations about corrupt journalists, politicians and religious fanatics remain soberingly relevant (2:30). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street (212)307-4100, closing on Sunday. (Brantley)

'MARATHON 2005, SERIES C' Horton Foote, the Chekhov of the South, tries something different with his gothic depression-eratale ''The One-Armed Man,'' the highlight of the third series of the Ensemble Studio Theater's annual collection of short plays, which always features a few wonderful pleasures. Along with Mr. Foote's chilling drama is Craig Lucas's shrewd portrait of a troubled woman, ''Your Call is Important,'' which plays on, among other things, New Yorker's neurosis about country life, and two minor pieces by Kate Long and Romulus Linney (2:00). Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (212)352-3101), closing on Sunday. (Zinoman)

'SENECA'S OEDIPUS' In the new production of Seneca's ''Oedipus'' by the Theater by the Blind, the iconic story of the king of Thebes who unknowingly murders his father and marries his mother is performed in modern dress. The poet Ted Hughes's masterly 1968 adaptation is vividly alive, contemporary and shocking (1:30). Mint Space, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212)868-4444, closing on Sunday. (Honor Moore)

'SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER' This comedy, written more than two centuries ago by Oliver Goldsmith, doesn't have much to say today, and Charlotte Moore, the director of the Irish Repertory Theater's production, wisely doesn't try to pretend otherwise. Instead she lets the actors play with the audience, a restrained glee that ultimately pays off with some great laughs. This 1773 comedy mocks the London upper class's snobbery, while piling on the slapstick, mistaken identities and farce (2:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)727-2737, closing on Sunday. (Genzlinger)

'TERRORISM' Every element of everyday existence participates in the title activity of this smart, snarling shaggy dog of a play by the Siberian-born Presnyakov brothers. But while Will Frears's production makes its thematic points clearly, it is still searching for a style that convincingly blends Slavic urgency and ennui (1:20). The Clurman Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200, closing on Sunday.(Brantley)

'THE WHORE OF SHERIDAN SQUARE' Michael Baron has written and directed this merry tribute to Charles Ludlam, who died of AIDS at 44, cutting short one of the most influential careers in downtown theater. For many downtown theatergoers, this silly -- or should I say, ridiculous -- dramatization of the life of Ludlam will be a nostalgic kick, like bumping into an old friend who you haven't seen in a long time (1:50). La MaMa, E.T.C., the Club, 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)475-7710, closing on Sunday. ( Zinoman)

Movies

Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.

'THE ADVENTURES OF SHARKBOY AND LAVAGIRL IN 3-D' (PG, 94 minutes) There's a reason that children aren't allowed to vote, drive or make movies with multimillion-dollar budgets. Lively and imaginative as their inner worlds may be, the very young still lack the discipline and maturity to shape their dream worlds into coherent and compelling stories -- a task the director Robert Rodriguez (''El Mariachi,'' ''Sin City'') also fails to accomplish in this muddled quest narrative based on characters and themes created by his 7-year-old son, Racer Max. (Dana Stevens)

* 'BATMAN BEGINS' (PG-13, 137 minutes) Conceived in the shadow of American pop rather than in its bright light, this tense, effective iteration of Bob Kane's original comic book owes its power and pleasures to a director (Christopher Nolan) who takes his material seriously and to a star (a terrific Christian Bale) who shoulders that seriousness with ease. ''Batman Begins'' is the seventh live-action film to take on the comic-book legend and the first to usher it into the kingdom of movie myth. (Manohla Dargis)

* 'CATERINA IN THE BIG CITY' (No rating, 106 minutes, in Italian) In this contemporary political allegory from Italy, a disgruntled teacher and his family move from the country to Rome, where his 12-year-old daughter finds herself the object of a furious tug of war between two cliques, one left wing and bohemian, the other right wing and materialist. Bold, richly textured and entertaining.(Stephen Holden)

'CINDERELLA MAN' (PG-13, 144 minutes) The best part of Ron Howard's ingratiating, Depression-era weepie about the boxing underdog-turned-topdog James J. Braddock are, unsurprisingly, Russell Crowe and Paul Giamatti, actors who could steal a movie from a basket of mewling kittens and an army of rosy-cheeked orphans. Renee Zellweger also stars. (Dargis)

'CRASH' (R, 107 minutes) A gaggle of Los Angeles residents from various economic and ethnic backgrounds collide, sometimes literally, within an extremely hectic 36 hours. Well-intentioned, impressively acted, but ultimately a speechy, ponderous melodrama of liberal superstition masquerading as realism.(A.O. Scott)

* 'ENRON: THE SMARTEST GUYS IN THE ROOM' (Not rated, 110 minutes) This sober, informative chronicle of the biggest business scandal of the decade is almost indecently entertaining, partly because it offers some of the most satisfying movie villains in quite some time. Recommended for everyone except those likely to be in the Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling jury pools. (Scott)

'5x2' (R, 90 minutes, in French) A couple's relationship unravels backward, from divorce through the birth of their child to their first meeting. Interesting, but chilly. (Scott)

'HEIGHTS' (R, 93 minutes) In its aspirations, design and worldview, ''Heights'' resembles a number of other films about cozily connected souls, a soap-operatic subgenre that might be called We Are the World. Everybody hurts, as Michael Stipe likes to sing, but people in ''Heights'' seem to hurt more or at least spend a lot of time nursing that hurt in brooding silence and noisy confrontation. (Dargis)

* 'THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY' (PG, 103 minutes) In this hugely likable, long-awaited film of Douglas Adams's beloved book, the world comes to an end not just with a bang, but also with something of a shrug. Nicely directed with heart and sincerity by the newcomer Garth Jennings, the film features Martin Freeman, a sensational Sam Rockwell and some gloriously singing dolphins. (Dargis)

'THE HONEYMOONERS' (PG-13, 90 minutes) Not the greatest, baby, but not as bad as it might have been. (Scott)

* 'HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE' (PG, 118 minutes) The latest animated enchantment from Hayao Miyazaki. Lovely to look at, full of heart and mystery. ( Scott)

'THE INTERPRETER' (PG-13, 123 minutes) A political thriller, both apolitical and unthrilling, notable for two accomplishments: turning the United Nations into a movie set and, even more remarkably, giving Nicole Kidman the opportunity to embody the suffering of Africans everywhere. (Scott)

* 'KINGS AND QUEEN' (No rating, 150 minutes, in French) About a hapless man and a woman who is alternately, perhaps even simultaneously, a mistress, monster, mother, murderer, object of lust and subject of loathing, this latest work from the wildly talented French filmmaker Arnaud Desplechin is essential viewing. (Dargis)

'LADIES IN LAVENDER' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Two dames of the British empire (Judi Dench and Maggie Smith) inhabit spinster sisters in Cornwall who nurse a handsome Polish violinist back to health in 1936. Amiably bogus. (Holden)

'LAYER CAKE' (R, 104 minutes) Directed by Matthew Vaughn, making a smoothly assured debut, and written by J.J. Connolly, this is the newest in British gangland entertainment and the tastiest in years. The star of this show is the very good British actor Daniel Craig, who slices through ''Layer Cake'' like a knife. (Dargis)

'THE LONGEST YARD' (PG-13, 97 minutes) In this crummy remake of the 1974 film of the same title, Adam Sandler stars as the former N.F.L. quarterback Paul Crewe, who years earlier was booted out of the league for shaving points and is now charged with leading a team of prisoners against a team of guards. In the original film, directed with seriocomic facility by Robert Aldrich, Crewe was played by Burt Reynolds with effortless charm and the tightest pants this side of Tony Orlando. The Aldrich version was recently released on DVD and makes for a nice evening in. (Dargis)

'MADAGASCAR' (PG, 86 minutes) Like many computer-animated features, this one, about four celebrity-voiced animals exiled from the Central Park Zoo -- expends most of its imaginative resources on clever visuals. These, in the end, are not enough to compensate for the lack of interesting narrative, real characters or jokes on subjects other than flatulence, excrement and contemporary pop culture. (Scott)

'MAD HOT BALLROOM' (PG, 105 minutes) This documentary follows fifth graders from three very different New York City public schools as they prepare to compete in a ballroom dancing tournament. The sight of 10-year-olds trying to master the graceful, grown-up motions of the fox trot and the tango is charming, and the glimpses of their lives in and outside of school are fascinating, though unfortunately the film offers little more than glimpses. (Scott)

'MR. AND MRS. SMITH' (PG-13, 112 minutes) What counts in a movie like this are stars so dazzling that we won't really notice or at least mind the cut-rate writing (from Simon Kinberg) and occasionally incoherent action (from the director Doug Liman). Sometimes Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie succeed in their mutual role as sucker bait, sometimes they don't, which is why their new joint venture is alternately a goof and a drag. (Dargis)

* 'MYSTERIOUS SKIN' (Not rated, 99 minutes) Gregg Araki, onetime bad boy of the New Queer Cinema, has made a heartbreaking and surpassingly beautiful film out of Scott Heim's cleareyed novel about two Kansas boys dealing with the consequences of their sexual abuse by a Little League coach. Superb performances, especially by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. (Scott)

'THE SISTERHOOD OF THE TRAVELING PANTS' (PG, 119 minutes) On a shopping trip, four teenage girls find a pair of thrift-store jeans that mysteriously flatters all four of them, despite their differing shapes and sizes. Deciding the jeans must be magic, they make a pact to share them for the summer, wearing them for a week apiece and then mailing them to the next friend. Like the four girls at its center, this fresh-scrubbed, eager-to-please film makes up in charm for what it lacks in sophistication. (Stevens)

* 'STAR WARS: EPISODE III -- REVENGE OF THE SITH' (PG-13, 142 minutes) George Lucas saved the best -- or at least one of the best -- for the end. Or for the middle. In any case, the saga is now complete, and has regained much of its original glory. (Scott)

'WAGING A LIVING' and 'ROSEVELT'S AMERICA' (No rating, 85 and 25 minutes) An eye-opening, often heartbreaking documentary tracking four members of the working poor in the Northeast and California. Roger Weisberg's feature is accompanied by his short film, ''Rosevelt's America,'' a verite profile of the Liberian refugee Rosevelt Henderson.(Jeannette Catsoulis)

Film Series

ANNIE (Tuesday and Wednesday) The Norwegian singer Annie's happy dance pop takes on darker aspects because of associations with the minimalist techno club scene and work with bands like Royksopp and St. Etienne. For these shows, she will DJ with her Finnish producer Timo Kaukolampi. Tuesday at 10 p.m., Hiro Ballroom, Maritime Hotel, 363 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (718)599-3101, $10.

ANTIBALAS AND SOULIVE (Tonight) Antibalas delivers a New York makeover to Fela Kuti's Afrobeat, the Nigerian funk propelled by burly saxophones, fierce percussion and righteous anger. Soulive is an organ-guitar-drums trio that harks back to the 1950's and 1960's, playing meaty, blues-centered jazz and funk. Lately, it has been hooking up with a little hip-hop. 7:30 p.m., Celebrate Brooklyn, Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn; $3 suggested donation.(Jon Pareles)

ALESSANDRA BELLONI AND BRAZILAIN GUESTS: NIGHT OF THE SHOOTING STARS (Tomorrow) Ms. Belloni, the singer and tambourine player, has spent years researching ancient songs and trance rituals from southern Italy.

BOUKMAN EKSPERYANS, BOUKAN GINEN (Tonight) A double bill of Haitian rock based on voodoo rhythms. Boukman Eksperyans went to the Haitian countryside to collect the Afro-Haitian rhythms of rural voodoo and carnival music. Then it added electric guitars and lyrics hinting at revolutionary messages, and reshaped a generation of Haitian rock. Boukan Ginen was formed by an ex-member of Boukman Eksperyans. 12 a.m. and 2 a.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212)243-4940, $20, $22 at the door. (Pareles)

DAVID BYRNE (Wednesday) The stylish, brainy punk rocker and world-music fixture David Byrne has been in danger of slipping into cliche. But at a recent show, Mr. Byrne was a man on fire, shaking and hurling his yelps into the balcony. His latest work features the Texas-based chamber group Tosca Strings, who will appear with him here. 5 p.m., Central Park Summerstage, Rumsey Field, midpark at 70th Street, (212)360-2777, $37, $40 at the door. (Sinagra)

BILLY CORGAN (Monday and Tuesday) One of the more abrasive alternative rockers of the 90's, Billy Corgan (of Smashing Pumpkins fame) nonetheless penned some of the decade's most triumphant pop complaints. After feigning humility for 2003's Zwan project, he released a book of his poems and recorded a just-released solo album. 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212)353-1600, $35, $40 at the door. (Sinagra)

C-RAYZ WALZ, J LIVE, VAST AIRE (Wednesday) This trio of local rappers share an aesthetic that idealizes the East Coast Golden Age of elite M.C.'s. That is, they pursue nuance over histrionics and hubris. 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103, $15. (Sinagra)

D'GARY (Tonight) It has been a while since the Malagasy guitarist D'Gary was first hailed as the low-key prodigy from Madagascar's back country whose self-taught style involved exquisitely detailed flourishes over unorthodox rhythms, but his approach remains distinctive. 10 p.m., Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Manhattan, (212)576-1155, $18, $22 at the door.(Sinagra)

* DR. DOG (Thursday) This emerging Philadelphia band loves breezy vocal harmonies, but the live show is much louder and more exuberant, especially when Scott McMicken unleashes one of his wailing, shape-shifting guitar solos. Opening for Apostle of Hustle. 9:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700, $10. (Kelefa Sanneh)

EISLEY (Tonight) The waifs in this pretty pop quartet are siblings, home schooled in a Texas small-town by Christian parents who supported their daughters' Radiohead obsession. If they seem slight now, just wait. The youngest writes the best stuff, and her round, imploring voice sounds spookily like Christine McVie's. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111, $15. (Sinagra)

EELS (Thursday) There's really only one eel, the prolific confessional indie rocker Mark Everett. His projects include the hip-hop kitsch of ''I Am the Messiah'' (SpinART). His latest work delves into family deaths and trauma, moving from countrified swoon to ironic flail to self-aware, yet nostalgic, regret. 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Midtown, (212)840-2824, $24.50 and $29.50.(Sinagra)

FEIST (Tomorrow) A pal and collaborator of the dirty electroclash queen Peaches and part of the Canadian indie collective Broken Social Scene, the warm-voiced Feist brings more of a cabaret swing to her own music. She's good at affecting a Continental, beer-hall gloom, but her best songs are quirky, plucked jazz-tinged numbers that make her sound like a hipper Norah Jones. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111, $20. (Sinagra)

RUTH GERSON (Thursday) With a voice that rises from tender endearments to a bluesy, impassioned growl, Ruth Gerson sings folk-rock songs that reach for the status of anthems. 8 p.m. Sin-e, 148 Attorney Street, Lower East Side, (212)388-0077, $10. (Pareles)

THE GET UP KIDS, FRENCH KICKS (Tonight) The jumping-bean energy of the emo rock stalwarts the Get Up Kids shames anyone not pogo-ing to their earnest beat. The French Kicks have moved from the angular post-punk of their Washington roots to a more wistful new wave sound. 5 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212)353-1600, $18, $20 at the door (sold out).(Sinagra)

HAMELL ON TRIAL (Wednesday) A solo performer with the force of a hard-rock band, Ed Hamell quick-strums his acoustic guitar and delivers torrents of words, sometimes funny, sometimes furious. 9:30 p.m., Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212)576-1155, $12. (Pareles)

JOHN HIATT, THE NORTH MISSISSIPPI ALLSTARS (Tomorrow) Mr. Hiatt's songs get to the heart of human frailty, loyalty and love, even if they take a sidelong route. With a deep-diving baritone, a twang-happy band and enough strange facial expressions to rival Jim Carrey, Mr. Hiatt sings his songs as convincingly as anyone around. The jamming Southern rock band North Mississippi All-Stars play an asymmetrical, cantankerous blues from the Mississippi Delta and the hill country nearby. 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212)353-1600, $35, $40 at the door. (Pareles)

Dos includes Mike Watt, the bassist and singer of the Minutemen and Firehose, and Kira Roessler. See above for the Blue Van. Danko Jones opens. 8:30 p.m. Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700, $10. (Pareles)

LA LEY (Thursday) La Ley, from Mexico, is a long-running Rock en Espanol band that's hugely popular south of the border.

This is billed as its final tour. 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212)353-1600, $35, $40 Thursday. (Pareles)

TED LEO AND THE PHARMACISTS, RADIO 4 (Sunday) The Irish-American indie rocker Ted Leo plays soulful punk, nearly popping a neck vein for political justice. But his melodic sensibility and sudden falsetto also recall the melodic 70's arena-rock of bands like Thin Lizzy. Radio 4 plays steadily improving post-punk. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, Union Square, (212)777-6800. $15.(Sinagra)

* ELLA LEYA (Tomorrow) Born in Azerbaijan and celebrated as a jazz singer in what was the Soviet Union, Ella Leya rediscovered the melancholy songs called Russian romances after she emigrated to the United States. On her album ''Russian Romance'' (B-Elite), she sings them with a tenderly mournful voice, in exquisite arrangements that merge chamber music, Russian and Central Asian touches. 7:30 p.m. Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212)539-8778 or (212)239-6200, $25. (Pareles)

LEZ ZEPPELIN, (Wednesday) Strapping on the double-necked Gibson with attitude to burn, this all-girl quartet pays tribute to its swaggering namesake Led Zeppelin, ripping through the catalog with blazing accuracy. Of course, they also have their gender-bending way with macho metaphors about squeezed lemons and dripping honey. 9 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700, $15. (Sinagra)

LHASA (Thursday) Lhasa sings in Spanish, French and English, with a husky, torchy voice that fills her music with the smoldering drama of Mexican boleros and French chansons. 8 p.m. Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, $20, $25 at the door. (Pareles)

THE LITTLE KILLERS, CHEATER SLICKS (Thursday) This garage-rock showcase stars the local trio the Little Killers and Cheater Slicks, a veteran band that finds ways to combine exuberance with meanness. 9 p.m., Sin-e, 148-150 Attorney Street, Lower East Side, (212)388-0077, $10. (Sanneh)

* THE LONG BLONDES (Tomorrow) The Long Blondes, a three-woman, two-man band from England, hark back to the sparse, scrabbling late-1970's post-punk of the Slits and Delta Five on the handful of songs they have released, including the eager ''Giddy Stratospheres'' (What's Your Rupture), which takes some unexpected turns. 11 p.m., TriBeCa Grand, 2 Avenue of the Americas, at Church Street, (212) 519-6677; free with RSVP to getrad@igetrvng.com. (Pareles)

LONGWAVE (Wednesday) Longwave ponders self-destruction and transcendence in brooding songs with guitar lines that coil and climb. With Benzos opening. 8 p.m. Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111, $15. (Pareles)

LYNYRD SKYNYRD (Sunday) Their funky Southern hard rock made them one of the best bands of the 70's, and the plane crash that killed the singer Ronnie Van Zant and others made Skynyrd's story the most horrific ''Behind the Music'' tragedy. Remaining original members, the guitarist Gary Rossington and the keyboardist Billy Powell, continue in the tradition of the band's boogie stomp. 7 p.m., North Fork Theater at Westbury Music Fair, 960 Brush Hollow Road, Westbury, N.Y., (516)334-0800, $50.50. (Sinagra)

MADLIB, PEANUT BUTTER WOLF (Monday) He has just released an album as Quasimoto, but the nasal-voiced motormouth and D.J. performs here under his more frequent moniker with label mates including his old-school Bay Area producer, Peanut Butter Wolf. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, Union Square, (212)777-6800, $22.50. (Sinagra)

MAGIK MARKERS (Tonight) This noise-rock trio's sound assaults build from shirring buzz and ominous clang to maelstroms of bash and feedback. Kicking and jerking as the spirit moves her, the vocalist and guitarist Elisa Ambrogio surges from hiss to howl, wrestling with her guitar to choke out its most dangerous peals. 10 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, (212)358-7503, $8. (Sinagra)

MC LYTE (Tonight) The last decade has been full of comeback attempts by this 80's hip-hop star who, along with artists like Roxanne Shante, was vocal about the macho rap game. If her music hasn't kept up with the latest trends, her feminist message about misogyny in hip-hop is timely. 10 p.m., Roxy, 515 West 18th Street, Chelsea, (212)645-5156, $20 in advance, $25 at the door. (Sinagra)

MEAT BEAT MANIFESTO (Thursday) Jack Dangers has been layering together samples since the heyday of industrial rock in the 80's. On Meat Beat Manifesto's latest album, ''At the Center'' (Thirsy Ear), he mixes jazz musicians and the voice of the poet Kenneth Rexroth, letting his densely packed tracks swing as much as they stomp. With Ming & FS and Dub trio opening. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Union Square, (212)777-6800, $22.50, $25 at the door. (Pareles)

NEW PORNOGRAPHERS, THE STARS, THE SADIES (Tomorrow) This revved-up Vancouver outfit's power-pop grandeur builds with a sort of time-release tension that makes anthems of their absurdist lyrical bric-a-brac. See below for Stars. The country rockers the Sadies open. 7:30 p.m., Celebrate Brooklyn, Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn; $3 suggested donation. (Sinagra)

(Sinagra)

EDDIE PALMIERI (Tomorrow and Thursday) Latin pianists have a longstanding affinity for jazz, but Eddie Palmieri may well be the jazziest and most experimental of them all, plunging into modal harmonies and burly, splashing chord clusters, building suspense and then detonating it with rhythm. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, Isaac Stern Auditorium, 57th Street and Seventh Avenue, (212)247-7800, $45 to $85. Thursday at noon, BAM R&B Festival, Metrotech Commons, Downtown Brooklyn, free. (Pareles)

ROBERT PLANT (Sunday and Monday) After scaling hard-rock peaks in his prime, the Led Zeppelin frontman's solo efforts never matched the skin-tight hedonism of his heyday. No one would blame him for joining the suit-and-standards circuit, but his new ''Mighty Rearranger'' (Sanctuary), rocks confidently, incorporating West African folk and the Islamic modal patterns that his band once mined with ''Kashmir.'' 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212)496-7070, $33.50 to $78.50. (Sinagra)

PUCHO AND HIS LATIN SOUL BROTHERS (Tomorrow) In the 1960's, soul met Latin music in the form of the boogaloo, an earthy beat that has survived the intervening decades. The timbales player Henry Brown, aka Pucho, is loyal to the heyday of musicians like Joe Bataan and Mongo Santamaria. 7:30 p.m., Midsummer Night Swing, Lincoln Center Plaza, (212)875-5766, $15. (Pareles)

* LUCIA PULIDO (Thursday) Lucia Pulido, a singer from Colombia, merges traditional Colombian songs with modern jazz.

(Pareles)

REEL BIG FISH (Wednesday) How many iterations is the punk-ska hybrid good for? Another one, at least, as bands like Reel Big Fish pump out bratty, bouncy pop. With El-Pus and Punchline opening. 7 p.m. Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Union Square, (212)777-6800, $21. (Pareles)

THE ROOTS, DE LA SOUL, MF DOOM (Tuesday) The funky, experimental hip-hop band the Roots, the wordsmith rappers De La Soul. But the big news is the appearance of MF Doom, the MC sometimes known as Madvillain, whose wildly imaginative raps glower and shimmer over a current of poetic pain. A creator of New York's jazzy hip-hop sound, D.J. Premier is performing as well. 5 p.m., Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street, (212)307-7171, $36. (Sinagra)

MICHELLE SHOCKED (Wednesday) The eclectic Texan folk-rocker Ms. Shocked will perform three shows in a row.

(Sinagra)

THE SOUNDTRACK OF OUR LIVES (Sunday) The Soundtrack of Our Lives, a Swedish band that sings in English. The band has learned a lot from the early Pink Floyd, the early Who, the Beatles circa 1967 and countless more obscure English and American bands; it recaptures the sense of teetering between discovery and disillusionment. Midnight. Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006, $17. (Pareles)

STARS (Tonight) The Canadian indie band the Stars play achingly pretty boy-girl vocal pop that makes a dreamy soundtrack for a quarter-life crisis. 11 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201)653-1703, $15.(Sinagra)

JAMES TAYLOR (Tomorrow and Sunday) Mr. Taylor makes blanket music. Sometimes it is as reassuring as an electric blanket, other times it's as annoying as a wet blanket, and almost all of the time it attempts to envelop existence in one large monochrome blanket, grappling with birth, love, pain, friendship, madness and death in such universal terms that to wallow in a specific tragedy -- and Mr. Taylor has been faced with many over the years -- is to commit a sin of solipsism. 8 p.m., PNC Bank Arts Center, Exit 116 Garden State Parkway, Holmdel, N.J., (732)335-0400. $25 to $69.50. (Pareles)

TEGAN AND SARA, RON SEXSMITH, EAST VILLAGE OPERA (Sunday) The Canadian twins Tegan and Sara's lyrics about love and loss are underground girl anthems. As of late, their acoustic folk has given way to power pop topped with their tart vocals. Mr. Sexsmith sings affecting folk rock, and the East Village Opera Company puts a glam rock spin on classic arias. 3 p.m., Central Park Summerstage, Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street, free. (Sinagra)

RICHARD THOMPSON (Tuesday) Rock's smartest misanthrope is also one of its greatest guitarists. Richard Thompson, who was one of the architects of British trad-rock in the 1960's, writes songs steeped in Celtic melody and the stoicism of traditional ballads. This is a solo acoustic concert. 7 p.m., Hudson River Festival, World Financial Center, 200 Liberty Street, (212)945-2600, free (Pareles)

MARY TIMONY (Tomorrow) Ms. Timony, who led the band Helium, has kept her tightly wound guitar riffs but has gradually left behind the personality crises of indie-rock to ponder higher thoughts and cosmic forces. With Medications, Bella Lea and Minaret opening. 8 p.m. Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)599-5103, $10, $12 tomorrow. (Pareles)

FRANCISCO ULLOA (Wednesday) Francisco Ulloa, from the Dominican Republic, is one of the world's fastest, wildest accordion soloists. Playing merengue tunes that barely pause for breath, he takes off from the traditional fast arpeggios into breakneck solos that loop and stutter all over the galloping beat. 7:30 p.m., Midsummer Night Swing, Lincoln Center Plaza, (212)875-5766, $15. (Pareles)

WINGDALE COMMUNITY SINGERS, CLAUDIA GONSON (Tonight) The guitarist David Grubbs, the vocalist Hannah Marcus and the novelist Rick Moody get together and make literate folk.

DAVE BRUBECK QUARTET/ and JOHN PIZZARELLI QUARTET (Tonight) Mr. Brubeck, now in his mid-80's, plays the piano with undiminished vigor; what he shares with the 35-year old guitarist and vocalist John Pizzarelli is a style of performing that needn't condescend to entertain. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800. Tickets: $30 to $75, JVC Jazz Festival.(Chinen)

HARRY CONNICK JR. AND BRANFORD MARSALIS and /MIGUEL ZENON (Sunday) Mr. Connick has always been a pianist as well as a singer; here, as on the new record ''Occasion'' (Marsalis Music), he'll play a round of duets with Mr. Marsalis, the saxophonist and fellow New Orleans transplant. The evening's highlight, however, just might be ''Jibaro,'' a suite for jazz quartet by the Puerto Rican saxophonist and composer Miguel Zenon. 8:30 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800. Tickets: $39 to $66, JVC Jazz Festival. (Chinen)

No cover. (Chinen)

KNEEBODY (Thursday) Rock, funk and electronic music commingle convincingly with jazz on ''Kneebody'' (Greenleaf), this quintet's recent studio debut; it's an update of the rugged, exploratory early fusion of Weather Report and Return to Forever, and just as likely to sound better live. 10 p.m., Zebulon, 258 Wythe Avenue, between North Third Street and Metropolitan Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)218-6934. No cover. (Chinen)

ABBEY LINCOLN QUARTET (Tonight through Sunday) Jazz has had only a handful of singers as powerfully expressive as Ms. Lincoln, whose performances can still approach the sublime; her band includes the estimable Marc Cary on piano. 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212)475-8592.

Cover: $20. (Chinen)

Tickets: $45 to $85, JVC Jazz Festival. (Chinen)

GRETCHEN PARLATO GROUP (Thursday) The lilting cadence and mellow sonority of Ms. Parlato's voice have earned her a good many casual admirers; a recent deluge of critical acclaim has more to do with her musicianship, underscored here by the guitarist Guilherme Monteiro, the bassist Ben Street and the drummer Adam Cruz. 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063. Cover: $12, $10 for members. (Chinen)

Classical

Opera

'SAMSON ET DALILA' (Friday) It's all about sex and violence, yet Saint-Saens's biblical opera is one of the most static in the repertory. This makes it ideal for a concert presentation, particularly given that it has some of the best arias ever written for mezzo-soprano, and the Met in the Parks series version is perfectly respectable, sturdily led by Julius Rudel. 8 p.m., Brookdale Park, Bloomfield/Montclair, N.J., (212)362-6000, free. (AnneMidgette)

'TOSCA' (Tomorrow) The Met in the Parks series concludes with this free al fresco performance of the Puccini favorite. The solid cast features Francisco Casanova as Cavaradossi, James Morris as Scarpia, and Aprile Millo in the title role. Derrick Inouye conducts. 8 p.m., Buccleuch Park, New Brunswick, N.J., (212)362-6000. (Jeremy Eichler)

Classical Music

BARGEMUSIC (Tonight, tomorrow, Sunday and Thursday) Great views and typically fresh performances help make this floating concert hall one of the best places in the city to hear chamber music. This weekend, Jeffrey Swann performs Liszt's piano music and lectures on that composer's life and work in two programs: ''Liszt, the Religious Mystic'' (tonight), and ''Liszt and Faust'' (tomorrow and Sunday). Thursday brings chamber music by Mozart and Prokofiev, as well as Bach's Cello Suite No. 1 performed by Jan Vogler. Tonight and tomorrow and Thursday nights at 7:30; Sunday at 4 p.m.; Bargemusic, Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718)624-2083, $35. (Eichler)

CARAMOOR (Tomorrow, Sunday, Thursday) Sixty years ago, Walter and Lucie Rosen founded this summer festival on the verdant grounds of their estate in northern Westchester County, and tomorrow night, Caramoor will celebrate the opening of its anniversary season with its first performance of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. Peter Oundjian conducts the Orchestra of St. Luke's, the Collegiate Chorale and soloists. Sunday features two concurrent family concerts, and on Thursday, Caramoor begins its summer-long ''Extreme Chamber Music'' series with the trio Worlds Beyond (Daniel Schnyder, saxophonist; David Taylor, trombonist; Kenny Drew Jr., pianist) playing music by Weill, Gershwin and Mr. Schnyder. Tomorrow night at 7, Sunday at 2:30 p.m., Thursday at 7:30 p.m.; Katonah, N.Y., (914)232-1252, $35 to $75 tomorrow; $15 to $25 on Sunday; $10 on Thursday. (Eichler)

CONNECTICUT EARLY-MUSIC FESTIVAL (Sunday) The highlight of the festival's final weekend (after Renaissance dances in Mystic tonight) is a concert performance of Handel's opera ''Xerxes,'' a delectable work more or less familiar to New Yorkers from a sparkling production at the New York City Opera. 6 p.m., Harkness Chapel, Connecticut College, New London, (860)444-2419; $24, general admission; $28, reserved seating.(James R. Oestreich)

SIMONE DINNERSTEIN (Tomorrow) A young pianist comes to Christian Steiner's Tannery Pond Concerts to play favorites that are tried, true and sometimes tough, from Mozart and Bach to Schumann's ''Kinderszenen'' and Beethoven's Opus 111 Sonata. 8 p.m., Mount Lebanon Shaker Village, New Lebanon, N.Y., (888)820-9441; $23 and $28. (Midgette)

EVELYN GLENNIE (Sunday) Ms. Glennie is one of the few classical percussionists to have had a solo career on the international touring circuit. In recent years this dynamic Scottish artist has been urging critics and presenters to play down her much discussed hearing impairment. For most audiences, all thoughts of disability disappear in the presence of Ms. Glennie's brilliant performances. On Sunday afternoon she ends this season's ''Free for All at Town Hall'' series with a typically adventurous program, including works by Matthias Schmitt, Keiko Abe, Toshimitsu Tanaka and others. 5 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212)707-8787, free; two tickets per person are available at the box office, starting at noon.(Anthony Tommasini)

HUDSON VALLEY CHAMBER MUSIC CIRCLE (Tomorrow) This 55-year-old organization presents visiting ensembles in a short series at Bard College, in a preface, of sorts, to Bard's own summertime explosion of music. The program this week is by the Orion String Quartet, which offers Haydn's Quartet in G (Op. 77, No. 1), Bartok's Quartet No. 5 and Schubert's ''Death and the Maiden'' Quartet. 8 p.m., Olin Hall, Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., (518)537-6665; $25; $18 for 65+; $5 for students. (Allan Kozinn)

MUSIC MOUNTAIN (Tonight through Sunday) The New Haven Oratorio Choir performs chamber choral works tonight; the Galvanized Jazz Band plays New Orleans-style jazz tomorrow; and on Sunday it's back to the classics, with the Jacques Thibaud Trio playing an arrangement of the ''Goldberg'' Variations and Mozart.

(Midgette)

SOLSTICE FESTIVAL (Sunday) The theme is Faust; the subtheme, Walpurgisnacht. And the music is accordingly obvious (songs of Mephistopheles by Wagner and Busoni), as well as less so (Mendelssohn's String Octet rather than his ''Erste Walpurgisnacht''). 3 p.m., Synagogue for the Arts, 49 White Street, TriBeCa, (212)696-6569; $25; $20 for 65+; $10 for students. (Oestreich)

Art

Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.

Museums

* AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'ANCESTRY AND INNOVATION,' through Sept. 4. This selection of quilts, paintings, sculptures and drawings by several generations of self-taught artists jumps with color and talent and reflects a sharp curatorial eye. 45 West 53rd Street, (212)265-1040. (Roberta Smith)

AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SELF AND SUBJECT,' through Sept. 11. From Grandma Moses' view of herself beguiled by infant descendants to A.G. Rizzoli's rendition of his mother as a Gothic cathedral, this refreshingly offbeat show of 20th-century self-taught artists covers a vivid range of portraits. (See above.) (Grace Glueck)

AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY: 'TOTEMS TO TURQUOISE,' through July 10. Jewelry dating to prehistoric times is used here to lend credence to contemporary works that are sometimes little more than glitzy knockoffs. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212)769-5100. (Smith)

COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'EXTREME TEXTILES,' through Oct. 30. Don't look for aesthetic pizazz in this intensely tech-y show of industrial fibers and fabrics, but don't rule it out. The show's raison d'etre is solely use, but a lot of what's on view, in the first museum display of material made to function in extreme conditions, is visually exciting. 2 East 91st Street, (212)849-8400. (Glueck)

COOPER-HEWITT: 'HELLA JONGERIUS SELECTS,' through Sept. 4. Shifting through the museum's outstanding holdings in embroidered samplers, this innovative Dutch designer has selected a wonderfully reverberant show and also based a series of new wall hangings on sampler motifs. Their combined display diagrams the fraught but essential symbiosis of old and new. (See above.) (Smith)

* EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'MEXICO, THE REVOLUTION AND BEYOND, PHOTOGRAPHS BY CASASOLA 1900-1940,' through July 31. This extraordinary show of work from a photo agency established by Agustin Victor Casasola in Mexico City has the span of a Greek epic and the nested themes and subplots of a picaresque novel, with revolutionary heroes and a vivid cast of everyday people. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212)831-7272. (Holland Cotter)

* GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ART OF TOMORROW,' through Aug. 10. Appreciated more for her role as a founder of the Guggenheim's forerunner, the Museum of Non-Objective Painting, Hilla Rebay (1890-1967) is finally given her due as a painter in a full-dress display of her work over six decades. This first chance to see it en bloc reveals a painter whose spirit, energy and invention, especially in collage, come as a revelation. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)423-3500. (Glueck)

* JAPAN SOCIETY: 'LITTLE BOY,' through July 24. Masterminded by the artist-writer-entrepreneur Takashi Murakami, this eye-boggling show traces the unexamined legacy of World War II as played out in Japan's popular culture. With Godzilla and Hello Kitty presiding, it reveals how this culture was twisted and darkened by the otaku, or geek, subculture, which has in turn influenced younger artists. 333 East 47th Street, (212)832-1155. (Smith)

METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ALL THE MIGHTY WORLD,' through Aug. 21. In one of the medium's shortest great careers, Roger Fenton helped establish photography as both an art and a profession in masterfully composed landscapes, portraits and still lifes that, for all their prescience, also express a profound ambivalence about the very notion of progress. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)535-7710. (Smith)

MET: 'DEFINING YONGLE,' through July 10. This show of imperial art in early-15th-century China is both perfect and messy. Its porcelain, metalwork, embroidery and ivory highlight the astounding craftsmanship of the imperial workshops under the Ming emperor Yongle, and reflect the miscegenation of Asian cultures at a time when most roads led to China. (See above.) (Smith)

MET: 'MAX ERNST,' through July 10. Despite and because of Ernst's being one of modernism's mystery men, he remains of interest, and there are intriguing things in this survey: from early Surrealist paintings, to near-abstract images generated by chance techniques, to the collage-style books some consider his masterworks. But only when he responds to specific events, like war, does his art snap into focus. (See above.)(Cotter)

MUSEUM OF BIBLICAL ART: 'COMING HOME!,' through July 24. A new small museum devoted to art related to the Bible gets off to a lively start with a big show of artworks by 73 untrained Southern Christian evangelicals. Many names familiar to followers of 20th-century folk and outsider art are on hand, including William Edmondson, the Rev. Howard Finster and Sister Gertrude Morgan. 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street, (212)408-1500. (Ken Johnson)

* MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: LEE FRIEDLANDER, through Aug. 29. A gigantic retrospective of this great photographer of the American vernacular scene, whose sly and haunting works (grungy cityscapes, wild landscapes, portraits and nudes) can put you in mind of Auden's remark that ''every 'original' genius'' has something ''a bit shady about him.'' In Mr. Friedlander's case, it's a compliment. 11 West 53rd Street, (212)708-9400. (Michael Kimmelman)

NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'GEORGE CATLIN AND HIS INDIAN GALLERY,' through Sept. 5. The portraits and landscapes here give an account of Plains Indian life in the 1830's in wonderful and sometimes harrowing detail. Viewing it is a remarkable experience. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212)514-3700. (Glueck)

P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'GREATER NEW YORK 2005,' through Sept. 26. A youth-besotted, cheerful, immodestly ingratiating, finally disappointing survey of contemporary art, perusing a scene whose wide stylistic range, emphasis on drawing, persistent teenage infatuations and overall dexterousness are firmly entrenched characteristics of the marketplace. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)784-2084. (Kimmelman)

STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: CHRIS OFILI, 'AFRO-MUSES,' through July 3. More than 100 delirious watercolors by this familiar British artist, warm-up exercises for his daily routine. They depict imaginary men and women, head on or in silhouette, in African garb, and in deep, swimmy colors -- portraits as modest and charming as the work that made Mr. Ofili famous is outsize and occasionally over the top. 144 West 125th Street, (212)864-4500. (Kimmelman)

* STUDIO MUSEUM: 'BILL TRAYLOR AND WILLIAM EDMONDSON AND THE MODERNIST IMPULSE,' through July 3. The work of two self-taught proto-modern artists whose beautifully complementary achievements argue against the usual dualities, but offer further evidence that African-American folk art is as great as any art or music that this country has produced. (See above.) (Smith)

WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'REMOTE VIEWING,' through Oct. 9. The vast information overload the world struggles with, scientific theory, technological data, geopolitical facts, historical material and on and on is whipped into visual cosmologies by eight painters of widely different approach and sensibility. If the premise is fuzzy, the show has some sharp art, including Carroll Dunham's witty ''Solar Eruption,'' a giant battered yellow sun that suggests a cell invaded by virus particles, its perimeter bursting with splatlike -- and sometimes unseemly -- extrusions. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212)570-3600. (Glueck)

Galleries: 57th Street

'GEE'S BEND QUILTS' Quilt's made by women of the tiny hamlet of Gee's Bend, Ala., have been making the rounds of United States museums since 2002.

Portrait of Washington By Peale to Be Sold
 The New York Public Library plans to sell two portraits of George Washington by Gilbert Stuart at Sotheby's in December, but that won't be the last chance for collectors and museums to buy an iconic image of the first president.
 On Jan. 21 Christie's will auction a full-length portrait of Washington by Charles Willson Peale. Experts say it could well bring $10 million to $15 million. Peale made eight full-length portraits of Washington during the Revolutionary War; only two are in private hands. (The other was last seen at an auction in London in the 1950's, and scholars say its whereabouts are unknown.) All of Peale's other full-length portraits of Washington are in American institutions, including the Metropolitan Museum, the Yale University Art Gallery, Colonial Williamsburg and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.
 ''This is a national treasure,'' said John Hays, Christie's deputy chairman in America and an expert on American art. ''It has special meaning because it depicts Washington directly after the battle that was the turning point in the war.'' The artist signed and dated the painting ''C.WPeale/Philadelphia 1779.''
 Of the eight portraits, this is the most complete. Its background depicts Nassau Hall in Princeton, where British soldiers had barricaded themselves before being captured. ''The pose is directly derived from Gainsborough and some of the great British portraitists,'' Mr. Hays said. ''But here Washington is leaning on one of two cannons, which are symbolic of the victories at the battles of Trenton and Princeton.''
 Most of Peale's portraits of Washington were shipped to allied countries immediately after they were painted as diplomatic gifts during the war. Several went to Cuba and France. Records show that this particular painting was to go to France, but the ship was forced to dock in Spain. William Carmichael, an American diplomat in Spain and a friend of Peale's, sold the portrait in 1782. It later went to a Spanish monastery before finding its way to the New York dealers French & Company in the early 1900's, when it was bought by Natalie Blair, the wife of a railroad tycoon. 
 Mrs. Blair was a pioneer collector of American decorative arts, some of which are now in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum. The portrait hung in her home in Tuxedo Park, N.Y., until her death in 1952. Most recently it was on loan to the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond. Mrs. Blair's heirs are selling the portrait at Christie's, along with her collection of American furniture and Chinese ceramics.
 In May Christie's placed an important painting by Edward Hopper in its auction of postwar and contemporary art rather than in its American paintings sale because experts there said they thought this was the best way to reach today's super-rich buyers. With the Peale, the auction house is again putting an American painting in another category, this time in its important January auction of American furniture and decorative arts. ''The January Winter Antiques Show will have a loan exhibition of works from Mount Vernon,'' Mr. Hays said. ''It just seemed right.''

Haring's Shop to Close
 In 1986, four years before dying of AIDS at 31, the 1980's art star Keith Haring opened the Pop Shop at 292 Layfayette Street in SoHo because, he said, he wanted to take art to the streets. A small space, covered floor to ceiling with the artist's murals, it has been selling everything from Haring-designed T-shirts to posters and toys. But the rising rents in SoHo have made it impossible for the artist's foundation to keep the shop going, and this week it announced that it planned to close at the end of August.
 ''We can't afford it anymore,'' said Julia Gruen, executive director of the Keith Haring Foundation. ''We have 500 square feet of selling space and a scandalous rent. It became too difficult.''
 ''When Keith opened the shop,'' Ms. Gruen added, ''he debuted a selection of merchandise that was 90 percent Keith Haring and 10 percent products by friends like Andy Warhol and Kenny Scharf. But gradually over time it morphed into all Haring all the time. After the artist's death, a lot changed. It's been a painful economic decision.''
 What has been something of a SoHo landmark for nearly 20 years will be gone, but Haring lovers will be able to see his art around the world. This week three of his 12-foot-tall sculptures have been installed at Lever House on Park Avenue, at 54th Street. On view for a year is ''Figure Balancing on Dog,'' a painted steel sculpture from 1986, along with two 1989 painted aluminum works, ''Two Dancing Figures'' and ''Three Dancing Figures.'' In Battery Park City, the Public Art Fund, a nonprofit organization that presents art around the city, has installed ''Acrobats,'' from 1986. In London, five monumental sculptures from 1987 and 1989 are on view at the River Terrace of Somerset House until Oct. 28. In Madrid, photographs from the artist's estate are on loan to the Fundacion ICO, along with Haring's earliest ephemeral works and murals.

High Fee but Free Audio
 The $20 admission fee at the Museum of Modern Art may be one of the most expensive in the world, but now, thanks to Bloomberg News, visitors can listen to the audio guides free. Over the years Bloomberg has sponsored audio guides for museums including the Metropolitan and the Tate in London. Starting next Friday, the Modern will offer free audio guides to both its permanent collections and its temporary exhibitions. Since reopening in November, it had been charging $4. The audio guides will be available in English, Spanish, French, German, Italian and Japanese. The museum's Web site, moma.org, will also provide free audio files that can be downloaded onto MP-3 players. ''It's important that the full range of educational materials be as accessible as possible,'' said Glenn D. Lowry, the Modern's director.

HEADLINE: Unocal Deal: A Lot More Than Money Is at Issue

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE and DAVID BARBOZA; Alexei Barrionuevo contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
The battle for Unocal, the large independent American oil company, is shaping into as much a test of Chinese-American strategic and economic relations as it is a boardroom showdown. 
 Most takeover battles can be settled by price -- the highest bidder wins. But judging by the sharp reaction yesterday in Washington, that may not be the case with Unocal. 
 Just a day after the China National Offshore Oil Corporation, or CNOOC, one of China's largest state-controlled oil companies, made an unsolicited bid of $18.5 billion for Unocal, senators and representatives, as well as lawyers, bankers and lobbyists, are taking jabs at what may become one of the thorniest strategic business challenges facing the administration.
 At issue is whether CNOOC can buy Unocal, which in April agreed to a $16.4 billion merger deal with Chevron, the American energy giant. 
 The unexpected foreign bid for Unocal comes at a time when oil prices are hitting $60 a barrel, energy reserves are gaining more value, and the United States is concerned about its own oil and gas resources. At the same time, the administration needs to work with China on trade and currency issues, even as concerns are increasing about the growing economic power of China. 
 ''It does raise questions about how much of the country we are willing to sell to a Communist country that we might be fighting someday,'' said Michael O'Hanlon, an international military specialist at the Brookings Institution. But he added, ''I'd be surprised if we really fall on our sword to prevent the sale.''
 CNOOC's bid is also forcing Unocal shareholders to weigh the higher price that the Chinese are willing to pay against the risks that the deal faces in Washington. On top of that, there is the possible backlash that might arise from selling a potentially strategic American asset to China. 
 Unocal said that it had received permission from Chevron to hold discussions with CNOOC. 
 The question is how -- if Unocal decides to switch from Chevron to CNOOC -- the politics will play out in Washington, where critics are already speaking out and where the deal would be subject to approval by the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States. The panel, a federal multiagency group, can prevent any foreign investment on the grounds of national security. 
 For years, the government has placed restrictions on the extent of foreign ownership in a variety of industries, from airlines to the media to military contractors. In the past, these restrictions have mostly affected developed countries like Japan and Britain. 
 ''This is a remarkable arrival of China into the world of global big business deals and international investing,'' said Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr., a former trade negotiator in the Reagan administration and president of the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington. ''And it does raise the issue of whether this gives influence or some kind of potential importance to a government that may not always be friendly to us.'' 
 In Washington, CNOOC is already laying the groundwork. It has hired Public Strategies, a public relations firm whose vice chairman, Mark McKinnon, led President Bush's media campaign in the 2004 election. The company has also lined up some of the nation's savviest financial advisers -- among them Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan -- as well as such well-connected legal and lobbying firms as Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld and Davis Polk & Wardell. 
 Many in Washington said that the deal, on its merits, might gain approval from the foreign investment committee. In any case, the committee would not review the case until a formal deal is completed. In recent deals involving China, the committee's responses have been mixed. 
 In 2003, a negative review by the foreign investment committee caused Hutchison Whampoa, which is based in Hong Kong, to withdraw a bid for Global Crossing, the telecommunications carrier that later filed for bankruptcy. But this year, the committee permitted the $1.75 billion sale of I.B.M.'s personal computer business to Lenovo of China. 
 ''The national security argument is a fair one,'' said William A. Reinsch, president of the National Foreign Trade Council and a former trade official in the Clinton administration. ''When you talk about energy supplies, and the market is tight, there is a national security issue. You are going to have a lot of people pounding the table.''
 CNOOC is already trying to play down any concerns that the transaction could hurt the American oil and gas markets. It is stressing that 70 percent of Unocal's oil and gas reserves are in Asia and that its American reserves amount to only about 1 percent of America's oil consumption, with none of it now supplying the military. 
 Unocal also has a pipeline hooked up to American strategic oil reserves, as well as a rare-earth mine, the only one in the United States. CNOOC has said it will consider selling these assets, if that is necessary to close the deal.
 In addition, CNOOC has promised not to take supplies from Unocal's oil and gas reserves in the United States and sell them outside the country. It also said it would retain ''substantially all'' of the American employees. 
 In Washington, two Republican congressmen, Richard W. Pombo, chairman of the House Committee on Resources, and Duncan Hunter, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, wrote to President Bush last week, saying that ''such an acquisition raises many concerns about U.S. jobs, energy production and energy security.''
 ''We fear that American companies will find it increasingly difficult to compete against China's state-owned and/or controlled energy companies, given their mandates to supply China's ever-growing demand for energy, which will increasingly need to come from foreign sources,'' the letter said. 
 For China, which is scouring the world for oil, gas and minerals to help power its economy, the deal is important. That puts the administration in an awkward position as it tries to negotiate a variety of trade frictions and geopolitical debates. 
 ''The deal has got the administration over a barrel,'' said Michael R. Wessel, a member of the United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission, a group established by Congress. Not only is the administration trying to work out trade issues with China over textiles, currency and a number of other matters, it is also increasingly relying on China to play a more aggressive role in containing North Korea. 
 ''We want the Chinese to invest part of their dollars in our economic system,'' Mr. Wessel said, ''yet we have to worry about the impact of this transaction on our national security. Everyone is concerned about the migration of jobs and research and development to China. Now we have oil hitting $60 a barrel. China is going to be on the center of our radar screen.'' 
 For CNOOC, an offshore oil company, Unocal offers huge gas reserves in 14 countries. It has Asia's largest storehouse of liquefied natural gas. A combined company would go from a Chinese offshore oil producer with high expenses, as it searches for oil around China, to a diversified oil and gas company with global reserves. 
 Oil industry analysts offered mixed views about a potential deal. 
 ''There are a lot of people in Washington who are really torn,'' said Robin West, chairman of PFC Energy, an oil consultant in Washington. ''They believe in open markets and don't want to exacerbate matters with China. Yet, do you want a Chinese company that doesn't play by American rules to take advantage of American rules and get an American company?''

HEADLINE: We Are All French Now?

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
Ah, those French. How silly can they be? The European Union wants to consolidate its integration and France, trying to protect its own 35-hour workweek and other welfare benefits, rejects the E.U. constitution. What a bunch of antiglobalist Gaullist Luddites! Yo, Jacques, what world do you think you're livin' in, pal? Get with the program! It's called Anglo-American capitalism, mon ami.
 Lordy, it is fun poking fun at France. But wait ... wait ... what is that noise I hear coming from the U.S. Congress? Is that ... is that members of the U.S. Congress -- many of them Democrats -- threatening to reject Cafta, the Central American Free Trade Agreement? Is that members of the U.S. Congress afraid to endorse a free-trade agreement, signed over a year ago, with El Salvador, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic? Mon Dieu! I am afraid it is. And for many of the same reasons France has resisted more integration: a protectionist fear of competition in a world without walls. 
 Yes, we are all Frenchmen now.
 Well, not quite. But that is where we are heading in the U.S. if we let the combination of the sugar lobby, which wants to block more imports from Central America; the A.F.L.-C.I.O., which doesn't like any free trade agreements; and Democrats who just want to defeat Cafta so they can make President Bush a lame duck have their way and block Cafta ratification. I understand Democrats want to stick it to Mr. Bush, but could they please defeat him on a policy he is wrong about (there are plenty) and not on expanding free trade in this hemisphere, which he is right about. 
 The French economic instinct is not one we want to start emulating now, just as the global playing field is being flattened, bringing in more competitors from Poland to China to India. This is a time to play to our strengths of openness, flexibility and willingness to embrace creative destruction, and lead on free trade.
 The McKinsey Global Institute just published a study of how both Germany and France have suffered, compared with the U.S., by trying to put up walls against outsourcing and offshoring. It noted: ''A new competitive dynamic is emerging: early movers in offshoring improve their cost position and boost their market share, creating new jobs in the process. Companies who resist the trend will see increasingly unfavorable cost positions that erode market share and eventually end in job destruction. This is why adopting protectionist policies to stop companies from offshoring would be a mistake. Offshoring is a powerful way for companies to reduce their costs and improve the quality and kinds of products they offer consumers, allowing them to invest in the next generation of technology and create the jobs of tomorrow.''
 Cafta is critical for enabling U.S. and Central American textile firms to compete with China. U.S. firms specialize in the more sophisticated work of making dyes, designing patterns and manufacturing specialized yarns, threads and fabrics, and the Cafta countries specialize in thelabor-intensive sewing. Because the Cafta countries are right next door, U.S. retailers can respond quickly to changes in the marketplace, which far-off Chinese factories cannot do as easily. That's also why, explains Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick, that a shirt that says ''Made in Honduras'' might contain 60 percent U.S. content, while a similar shirt that says ''Made in China'' most likely would have none.
 Finally, there is geopolitics. In the 1980's, we were worried Central America was going to go communist. Now we are worried it is going to go capitalist? We spent billions fighting communism there. Now we have a chance to help consolidate these fragile democracies by locking in a trading relationship with the U.S. that is critical for their development. Shame on us if we balk.
 But President Bush needs to spend some political capital and sell this deal in these terms. ''The administration has to get out and connect the dots for people,'' said Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations and author of a thoughtful new book on foreign policy, ''The Opportunity: America's Moment to Alter History's Course.'' ''Otherwise the vocal minority will trump the interests of the majority. We should not assume that this backlash [against free trade] that is going around is just a French malaise or Dutch elm disease. It could happen here.'' But if we think we can indulge protectionism and not worry about the geopolitical spillovers in our own backyard, that is a real illusion. ''The world is not Las Vegas,'' added Mr. Haass. ''What happens there will not stay there.''

HEADLINE: Iran Vote: Dark Horse Rises

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SLACKMAN; Nazila Fathi contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: TEHRAN, June 23 

 BODY:
The biggest surprise of last week's presidential contest was the emergence of the little-known mayor of Tehran as the second highest vote getter, putting him in Friday's runoff election. That has led to widespread charges of vote rigging and a systematic, organized conspiracy to alter the outcome.
 Yet conversations with a Western diplomat and a broad spectrum of Iranians suggest that the charges are overstated. 
 There does seem to have been an organized effort among military and religious leaders to put pressure on voters to back their candidates. But what really has people outraged is that the insurgent candidate, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who is 49 and not part of the political elite in Iran, has bucked the established order by running a most effective campaign. 
 Many people fear Mr. Ahmadinejad because his social and economic ideas are a throwback to the early days of the revolution. But others simply cannot believe that a man who has not been part of the political elite might leapfrog over elder statesmen of the country to take power. In one piece of campaign literature, Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, the other presidential candidate, simply lists his resume side by side with Mr. Ahmadinejad's, as though nothing more need be said. 
 Despite the claims of vote fraud, there was no investigation; the appointed religious officials simply dismissed the charges. But critics have not presented any evidence, and instead have talked about unfair and inappropriate influence peddling.
 ''Military commanders gave talks and encouraged people to vote a certain way,'' said Mehdi Karroubi, a former speaker of Parliament and candidate for president who created a scandal here when he charged vote rigging in the first round. ''We have evidence that the Basiji and military were interfering with the vote.'' The Basiji are volunteer militia members, some of whom enforce Islamic rules by beating demonstrators and whipping women who do not conform to religious dress codes.
 He added, ''Basiji are inspectors at polling places and have power to do a lot of things.''
 What things? Mr. Karroubi did not say.
 Instead, like many critics of the first round, he pointed to the numbers as proof that something must have gone wrong. For instance, how could a man like Mr. Ahmadinejad, largely unknown outside Tehran, manage to win 800,000 votes in Isfahan, the hometown of another candidate?
 It is a charge that has been repeated over and over, but to date has not been examined. But news reports in the Iranian newspaper that covered Mr. Ahmadinejad's trip to Isfahan this month reported that thousands of people had welcomed him in the streets. The report further said that Mr. Ahmadinejad's plane had been hours late, and that still the crowd had waited -- demonstrating, at least, some degree of support.
 A Western diplomat, who was preparing an analysis of the vote for his home office, said it did not appear that a huge, systemic fraud had occurred. The diplomat spoke on the condition of anonymity so as not to offend anyone in the government. 
 The diplomat said the country was too large, and the electorate too diverse, for anyone to orchestrate widespread fraud. He said many of the voting patterns that emerged, like most of the candidates' winning in their home provinces, made sense. 
 The diplomat noted, for example, that Mr. Rafsanjani came in first place in only three provinces but took second place in 19 provinces, another figure that seemed to make sense for a candidate whose support is wide, but not considered very deep.
 But the diplomat also noted that with seven candidates in the race -- an eighth dropped out in the final stages -- it was necessary to manipulate only a few hundred thousand votes to change the outcome. And that, he said, also appeared possible.
 More than that, there is undeniably a culture of leverage politics here where people with political, religious or economic influence use it to lean on others to vote a certain way. The effect of that kind of pressure can be insidious in a society where fear is a tool of the ruling class and where challenging those in power can come at a price. 
 Hamed Salamati, a Basiji member in Tehran, said he doubted that there had been any actual vote tampering. But he confirmed that the militia's leaders and hard-line clerics had tried to use all their influence to push the vote in the direction they wanted.
 He pointed to a dawn prayer session this week for Fatimah, one of the Prophet Muhammad's three daughters. Every year worshipers mourn her death, and a crowd had assembled in Tehran to listen, quietly, to the singing of the dirge, a mournful remembrance of Fatimah. 
 Suddenly, the person singing broke into a political diatribe, he said, telling the worshipers to vote for Mr. Ahmadinejad, while railing against Mr. Rafsanjani.
 ''He used very foul language against Rafsanjani,'' Mr. Salamati said.
 He also said commanders of the Revolutionary Guard had sent a letter to its members, and to Basiji, ordering them to vote for Muhammad Baqer Qalibaf, a former police chief who ended up in fourth place. But he said Basiji preferred to follow the lead of high-ranking clerics and so voted for Mr. Ahmadinejad, because he was the candidate the hard-line clerics said they should choose.
 ''The Basijis encouraged their families to vote for Mr. Ahmadinejad, and I think a lot of people voted for him,'' he said.
 Critics have called that inappropriate interference, especially in a society where clerics and the military rule by loyalty and fear. But such pressure politics are not only the province of the conservatives.
 Mr. Salamati's great uncle, Hassan, is a baker in Tehran. One day, he said, he went to pick up flour for his business and was given posters of Mr. Rafsanjani to put up in his shop. 
 He said a member of Parliament, who is often a big supporter of the bakers' union, ''told bakers to vote for Rafsanjani, and since he always helps the bakers, most of them did.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Sees Consensus That Syria Foments Strife in Lebanon and Iraq

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: LONDON, June 23 

 BODY:
Bush administration officials asserted Thursday that an international consensus had emerged that Syria had been stoking the violence in Lebanon and Iraq and against Israelis, and they said they were now certain that Syrian agents had been operating in Lebanon.
 The comments represented an escalation of the campaign by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to isolate Syria diplomatically as the administration has faced mounting violence against its interests throughout the Middle East. Ms. Rice has not said what other forms of pressure might be applied. 
 A senior State Department official, briefing reporters under ground rules that he not be identified, said there was ''widespread agreement'' at a meeting of leading foreign ministers on Thursday in London, and among the delegates at a conference on Iraq in Brussels on Wednesday, that Syria bore major responsibility for instability in the region.
 Ms. Rice, at the end of the foreign ministers' meeting, accused Syria of supporting the Iraq insurgency.
 ''Let's not have more words about what they are prepared to do,'' she said of Syrian promises to help Iraq with security on their mutual border. ''Let's have action. If they're prepared to do it, they should just do it.'' 
 The foreign ministers were briefed by James D. Wolfensohn, former president of the World Bank, on his three-year $3 billion proposal for the economic reconstruction of Palestinian areas, contingent on Israel's planned pullout from Gaza and the northern part of the West Bank.
 The package, which would effectively double levels of outside aid for the Palestinians, is tied to a variety of projects, including building facilities to help move goods and people into and out of Palestinian areas.
 The renewed pressure on Syria comes as an anti-Syrian majority in the Lebanese Parliament is set to form a government in Beirut and a series of assassinations have been carried out in Lebanon against anti-Syrian politicians and journalists.
 In the past, administration officials have said that Syria had a ''hit list'' for assassination in Lebanon, and they have recently suggested strongly that despite the withdrawal of 14,000 Syrian troops from Lebanon, it appeared that intelligence operatives had remained behind.
 A Western diplomat close to the Syrian situation, who asked not to be identified because he did not want to be seen characterizing the positions of other countries, said the consensus about Syria was propelled by European concerns about Lebanon and American concerns about Iraq.
 ''There's a lot of international pressure on the Syrians to cease and desist, and that's just not the United States,'' a senior State Department official said. The official said there was intelligence information that made clear that Syrian intelligence operatives remained in Lebanon. 
 That conclusion was not fully endorsed by the French foreign minister, Philippe Douste-Blazy. ''The withdrawal of Syrian troops has been observed,'' he said, but there is concern that Syrian intelligence agents might still operate in Lebanon. The meeting in London was of foreign ministers of the Group of 8 industrialized nations, which will hold a summit meeting to be attended by President Bush in July at Gleneagles, Scotland. Foreign Secretary Jack Straw of Britain said the ministers also discussed Iran, the Balkans, the war and genocide in Sudan, efforts to resume talks with North Korea and negotiations over China. 
 But the focus on Syria appeared to be the most intense part of the meetings here and in Brussels, suggesting that world pressure could increase. Syria and Iran sent delegates to the Brussels conference, but Ms. Rice declined to meet with them.

HEADLINE: JUSTICES UPHOLD TAKING PROPERTY FOR DEVELOPMENT

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 23 

 BODY:
The Supreme Court ruled on Thursday, in one of its most closely watched property rights cases in years, that fostering economic development is an appropriate use of the government's power of eminent domain.
 The 5-to-4 decision cleared the way for the City of New London, Conn., to proceed with a large-scale plan to replace a faded residential neighborhood with office space for research and development, a conference hotel, new residences and a pedestrian ''riverwalk'' along the Thames River.
 The project, to be leased and built by private developers, is intended to derive maximum benefit for the city from a $350million research center built nearby by the Pfizer pharmaceutical company. 
 New London, deemed a ''distressed municipality'' by the state 15 years ago, has a high unemployment rate and fewer residents today than it had in 1920.
 The owners of 15 homes in the Fort Trumbull neighborhood, including one woman who was born in her house 87 years ago and has lived there since, had resisted the plan and refused the city's offer of compensation. 
 After the city condemned the properties in November 2000, the homeowners went to state court to argue that the taking would be unconstitutional. The Connecticut Supreme Court upheld the use of eminent domain in a ruling last year.
 In affirming that decision, the majority opinion by Justice John Paul Stevens resolved a question that had surprisingly gone unanswered for all the myriad times that governments have used their power under the Fifth Amendment to take private property for public use. The question was the definition of ''public use.''
 The homeowners, represented by a public-interest law firm, the Institute for Justice, which has conducted a national litigation campaign against what it calls eminent domain abuse, argued that taking property to enable private economic development, even development that would provide a public benefit by enhancing the tax base, could never be a ''public use.'' 
 In its view, the only transfers of property that qualified were those that gave actual ownership or use to the public, like for a highway or a public utility. 
 But the majority concluded on Thursday that public use was properly defined more broadly as ''public purpose.'' Justice Stevens noted that earlier Supreme Court decisions interpreting the public use clause of the Fifth Amendment had allowed the use of eminent domain to redevelop a blighted neighborhood in Washington, to redistribute land ownership in Hawaii and to assist a gold-mining company, in a decision by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes in 1906.
 ''Promoting economic development is a traditional and long accepted function of government,'' Justice Stevens said, adding, ''Clearly, there is no basis for exempting economic development from our traditionally broad understanding of public purpose.''
 In a dissenting opinion, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor objected that ''the words 'for public use' do not realistically exclude any takings, and thus do not exert any constraint on the eminent domain power.'' 
 Justice O'Connor said, ''Under the banner of economic development, all private property is now vulnerable to being taken and transferred to another private owner, so long as it might be upgraded.''
 Justice Stevens, examining the New London plan in light of the majority's general analysis, said the plan ''unquestionably serves a public purpose,'' even though it was intended to increase jobs and tax revenue rather than remove blight. 
 He described the plan as ''carefully formulated'' and comprehensive. Sounding a federalism note, Justice Stevens said that state legislatures and courts were best at ''discerning local public needs'' and that the judgment of the New London officials was ''entitled to our deference.''
 Justices Stephen G. Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Anthony M. Kennedy and David H. Souter joined the majority opinion in Kelo v. City of New London, No. 04-108. Justice Kennedy also wrote a separate concurring opinion to emphasize that while there was no suggestion in this instance that the plan was intended to favor any individual developer, ''a court confronted with a plausible accusation of impermissible favoritism to private parties should treat the objection as a serious one and review the record to see it if has merit.''
 Justice O'Connor's dissenting opinion was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and by Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. She wrote that rather than adhering to its precedents, the court had strayed from them by endorsing economic development as an appropriate public use.
 ''Who among us can say she already makes the most productive or attractive use of her property?'' Justice O'Connor asked. 
 She added: ''The specter of condemnation hangs over all property. Nothing is to prevent the state from replacing any Motel 6 with a Ritz-Carlton, any home with a shopping mall or any farm with a factory.''
 Both Justice O'Connor and Justice Thomas, who also filed his own dissent, said the decision's burden would fall on the less powerful and wealthy.
 ''The government now has license to transfer property from those with fewer resources to those with more,'' Justice O'Connor said. ''The founders cannot have intended this perverse result.''
 Justice Thomas, who called the decision ''far reaching and dangerous,'' cited several studies showing that those displaced by urban renewal and ''slum clearance'' over the years tended to be lower-income minority residents. 
 ''The court has erased the Public Use Clause from our Constitution,'' he said.
 In the majority opinion, Justice Stevens said, ''The necessity and wisdom of using eminent domain power to promote economic development are certainly matters of legitimate public debate.'' 
 The court did not ''minimize the hardship that condemnations may entail,'' he said, despite the fact that the homeowners will receive ''just compensation.''
 Justice Stevens said that states remained free to place restrictions on their own use of eminent domain power through their own constitutions and laws, as many have; California, for example, has a law restricting to blighted areas the use of eminent domain for economic development.
 Scott G. Bullock, the lawyer who argued the case for the New London homeowners, said in an interview that his organization, the Institute for Justice, would accept the court's invitation and ''continue the fight in the state supreme courts.'' As a result of the decision, he said, ''we are going to see more eminent domain abuse and a growing grass-roots rebellion against this type of government action.''
 Allan B. Taylor, a partner in the Hartford law firm Day, Berry & Howard who filed a brief on New London's behalf for the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities and organizations of cities in 31 other states, said an opposite outcome in this case would have ushered in an ''extraordinary revolution.''
 If the court had not upheld the Connecticut Supreme Court, he said in an interview, ''it would greatly limit what cities and towns all over the country could do.'' Mr. Taylor said he read the opinion not as a green light for the wholesale use of eminent domain, but as ''a green light for continuing to do careful and responsible planning.''
 The decision was a clear defeat for the long-term effort by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice Scalia to limit government control over private property. Although a series of decisions from the mid-1980's through the early 90's had appeared to indicate a major shift in the court's traditional deference to government land-use policies, that effort has stalled in recent cases.
 By the same token, the decision was the latest success for Justice Stevens, the 85-year-old senior associate justice, who appears to be having one of the most productive terms in his 30 years on the Supreme Court.
 The New London case was among the final decisions the court was expected to make in this term. The court indicated that Monday would be the final day of the term.

HEADLINE: Capital Nearly Speechless on Big China Bid

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 23 

 BODY:
For the Bush administration and even for many members of Congress, China has become almost too big to bash.
 A day after one of China's state-controlled oil companies made an unsolicited $18.5 billion bid for Unocal, a California oil and gas company with extensive fields in Asia, administration officials and many lawmakers were almost tongue-tied about the implications.
 Treasury Secretary John W. Snow, asked whether he would lead a national security review of the deal, hesitantly told members of the Senate Finance Committee that the question was ''hypothetical'' because the transaction has yet to happen.
 Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said virtually nothing about the deal. But he used some of his bluntest language ever to warn lawmakers against imposing tariffs on China as a way to pressure it over its exchange rate policies. 
 For months, many lawmakers in both parties have become almost frantic about China's soaring trade surplus and its impact on American manufacturers. Anxiety is so high that Republican lawmakers from industrial states like Ohio and Pennsylvania are loath to vote for anything that sounds like a free-trade agreement.
 But anxiety is at least as great about a disruption of American business ties to China. 
 ''I think there is a reluctance to confront China,'' said Representative Phil English, a Republican from Pennsylvania and the leader of the Congressional steel caucus. ''The problem is that many companies are depending on Chinese inputs and on imported goods to sell at retailers.'' 
 China is also a leading creditor of the United States; it acquired more than $200 billion of Treasury securities over the last year.
 Moreover, China is already home to a growing number of American-owned factories, many of them exporting to the United States, and a large number of factories that are suppliers to American companies.
 For the last two years, the Bush administration has struggled to balance competing economic goals. It wants to persuade China to let its currency rise in value, which would make Chinese imports more expensive in dollar terms, even as it works to fend off proposals from Congress to impose high tariffs if China refuses to change its policies.
 On Thursday, Mr. Snow argued that it would be dangerous to impose ''punitive'' actions on China. Not only would it be a mistake to threaten China with tariffs if it refuses to let its currency float, he said, but it would also be a mistake to subject China to countervailing duties in cases where it illegally subsidizes exports.
 ''Acting on any of the punitive legislative proposals before Congress now would be counterproductive,'' Mr. Snow told lawmakers.
 Mr. Greenspan, testifying at the same hearing, said it was a major mistake to think that American jobs would be increased even if China did change its currency policies.
 ''I am aware of no credible evidence that supports such a conclusion,'' Mr. Greenspan said. Tariffs on Chinese imports would protect ''few, if any American jobs,'' he continued, and would ''materially lower our standard of living.''
 But the political debate about China is lagging behind events on the ground. The $18 billion bid for Unocal by the China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC), China's third-largest oil company, was merely the latest and by far the biggest move by a Chinese company to buy a formidable American company.
 The move represents an evolution for China from being a major exporter, using its earnings to acquire Treasury securities, to becoming a significant foreign investor in hard assets as well. 
 Administration officials made it clear Thursday that a deal with Unocal would almost certainly be subjected to an interagency review over its implications for national security. 
 But Mr. Snow was extremely hesitant when asked about it by Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon. 
 ''It's hypothetical at this point, because we don't have a transaction,'' Mr. Snow said, adding that a foreign company taking over a company in a potentially sensitive industry would normally ask for such a review itself. Indeed, CNOOC did just that Thursday, even before it was clear whether Unocal would accept the offer over its standing deal with Chevron.
 The diffidence of Mr. Snow startled Mr. Wyden, who has supported the administration on many trade issues. ''I'm a free trader, but being a free trader isn't synonymous with being a chump,'' Mr. Wyden remarked after the hearing. ''He should have said, 'You bet we're going to take a look at it.''' 
 Gary C. Hufbauer, a trade expert at the Institute for International Economics, said the administration wanted to keep the issues involving China as separate as possible, from its currency policy to its surging textile exports to its enforcement of American patent and copyrights.
 ''What the administration wants to do is avoid putting all these issues together into what some would want to call a single 'coherent' China policy,''' he said. ''A 'coherent' policy would probably be one that sees China as an emerging adversary.''
 Lawmakers are demanding a comprehensive approach to China.
 ''China's competitive challenge makes Americans nervous from Wall Street to Main Street,'' said Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana. ''What is the administration's plan? They have none.''
 Senator Jim Bunning, Republican of Kentucky, complained that the administration had made little progress in prodding China over its trade and currency policies. ''They've kind of told us to take a hike,'' Mr. Bunning said. 
 Mr. Snow responded, as he did several other times during the hearing, that ''we're not satisfied, and we want them to know that.''
 Despite the frustration among lawmakers, most avoided any criticism of the attempt by CNOOC to buy a major American oil company.
 Administration officials noted that China remains a minuscule direct investor in the United States, far smaller than the tiny European nation of Luxembourg. As a general matter, American officials have encouraged foreign companies to invest in the United States and refrained from interfering in all but a handful of cases.
 But critics of China hinted they might use the bid for Unocal as a way to pressure China on other issues.
 ''Does anybody honestly believe that the Chinese would ever let an American company take over a Chinese company?'' asked Senator Charles B. Schumer, Democrat of New York and sponsor of a bill that would impose a tariff of 27.5 percent on China's imports if it fails to change its currency policy.
 Other lawmakers stressed caution. ''We must be thoughtful in our actions and get it right,'' said Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Finance Committee. ''We can't afford to act rashly, and get it wrong.''

 CORRECTION:
A chart in Business Day on Friday listing acquisitions of foreign companies by Chinese companies misidentified one party to a deal. North of England was acquired by Gas Network, a British company that is 70 percent owned by Cheung Kong Infrastructure Holdings of Hong Kong -- not by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. The chart also referred incorrectly to a deal involving the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. The authority bought 8.9 percent of HSBC Holdings of Britain -- an investment, not an acquisition.

HEADLINE: National Briefing New England: Massachusetts: Shellfishing Disaster Claim Denied

BYLINE: By Katie Zezima (NYT)

 BODY:
The Federal Emergency Management Agency has decided that the outbreak of red tide, a toxic algae, in the state's shellfish beds does not qualify as a disaster. On June 10, Gov. Mitt Romney petitioned the agency to declare the outbreak, which forced officials to close most of the state's shellfish beds, a disaster so shellfishermen could qualify for federal unemployment benefits. Agency officials said data submitted by the state did not rise to the severity of a disaster declaration. A spokeswoman for Mr. Romney said the state planned to appeal the decision.

HEADLINE: Albany Passes Aid for Lower Manhattan

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
The State Legislature approved a broad package of incentives yesterday intended to revitalize the Lower Manhattan commercial district and to lure commercial tenants to the beleaguered World Trade Center site.
 The package would provide tax exemptions and rent subsidies potentially worth millions of dollars to companies that move to the site, where plans to erect the Freedom Tower have been hampered by security concerns, design squabbles and a lack of interested tenants.
 The legislation would also permanently eliminate the commercial rent tax for tenants at the trade center site and provide a five-year rent tax exemption for companies in buildings elsewhere in Lower Manhattan. There was also an agreement among officials from the city, the state and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to earmark $3.5 billion in tax-free bonds for downtown projects, with priority given to those at ground zero. 
 And as of June 30, 2006, it would end incentives for the conversion of office buildings to residential space.
 The package was seen as a victory for Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, who represents the neighborhood. Mr. Silver made downtown revitalization a hallmark of his legislative negotiations and effectively killed plans for a stadium on the Far West Side because he did not want the development of that neighborhood to come at the expense of Lower Manhattan's reconstruction.
 Mr. Silver and other state and city officials say they hope the package will kick-start commercial construction at the trade center site and leasing across Vesey Street at 7 World Trade Center, the nearly completed skyscraper that has yet to land an anchor tenant. The area has been plagued by relatively high vacancy rates for commercial space and reluctance by office tenants to move to an area that has been attacked twice by terrorists and may be a construction site for the next 10 years.
 The benefit package would also be available for tenants renewing leases or signing new leases at the World Financial Center office complex just to the west. Officials have their eye on not only Merrill Lynch, whose lease at the financial center expires in several years, but also Goldman Sachs & Company, which recently suspended plans to build a $2 billion headquarters on a vacant lot there. Goldman Sachs, the investment bank, is exploring alternative locations in Midtown, but city and state officials are hoping to lure it back to its original plan.
 ''This is the jump start that ground zero needs in order to be revitalized bigger and better than ever,'' Mr. Silver said. However, groups like the Fiscal Policy Institute oppose these kinds of steep subsidies for tenants and landlords because commercial rents downtown are already 35 percent cheaper than those uptown.
 David Dyssegaard Kallick, a fellow at the Fiscal Policy Institute, called the package a ''wheelbarrowful of subsidies to tenants in high-priced office buildings.''
 What the tenants want, Mr. Kallick said, ''is not subsidies, though they'll take them, but a well-managed process of rebuilding at ground zero and the right decisions about public investments in transportation and other infrastructure.''
 But Mr. Silver said the incentives were absolutely necessary. Fearing that plans for a $2.2 billion stadium and a new office district on the West Side would undermine rebuilding downtown, Mr. Silver killed the stadium project in Albany earlier this month, incurring the wrath of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. 
 The downtown incentive package, which ultimately had bipartisan support, did not come without a great deal of wrangling among the mayor, Gov. George E. Pataki, Mr. Silver and Joseph L. Bruno, the State Senate majority leader.
 Over the state's objections, city officials succeeded in including $75 million for a new Mets stadium and $75 million in bonds for garages at a new Yankee Stadium. In turn, Mr. Bruno, who is from Rensselaer County, demanded and won $75 million for economic development projects outside New York City.
 Mayor Bloomberg issued a statement yesterday calling Albany's action ''a shot in the arm to the redevelopment of Lower Manhattan,'' and thanking Governor Pataki, Mr. Silver and Mr. Bruno for their efforts.
 To promote leasing at the trade center site, the downtown legislation would give an incentive of $5 per square foot to companies leasing the first 750,000 square feet of space in any building. It also provide a $3.80 per square foot rent subsidy for the first 750,000 square feet at 7 World Trade Center, to be matched by the developer, Larry Silverstein.
 The package also includes sales tax exemptions for office furniture and other equipment for businesses leasing space in new buildings at the trade center site. And it expands the eligibility rules for a city program that provides companies moving employees downtown with tax credits worth $3,000 per employee per year.

HEADLINE: Orders for Durable Goods Off, When Planes Are Excluded

BYLINE: By JENNIFER BAYOT

 BODY:
Orders for business equipment stumbled last month, the government reported yesterday, but sales of new homes sprinted to an annual pace just shy of last October's record.
 Excluding contracts in the transportation sector, which vary widely from month to month, orders for durable goods slipped 0.2 percent in May, to $146 billion, after falling 0.7 percent in April, the Commerce Department said. 
 The slide contrasted with the 0.5 percent increase that economists survey conducted by Bloomberg News had forecast for durable goods, products meant to last three years or more. 
 Economists warned against putting too much stock into a single month, especially because the measure tends to be revised significantly, but they said the drift did raise questions about the long-awaited recovery in business spending, even prompting some of them to lower their forecasts for growth this quarter. 
 ''It was definitely weaker, but you have to put it in the context of the volatility of the report,'' said Ted Wieseman, an economist at Morgan Stanley. ''You get one bad month; you don't take it to mean that capital goods orders are collapsing.''
 The data prompted him to lower his forecast for gross domestic product growth to 3.6 percent in the second quarter, down from 4 percent.
 The bond market rose modestly after the durable goods report, as investors speculated that signs of slower growth would keep the Federal Reserve from accelerating its increases in short-term interest rates. 
 Including transportation, the nation's manufacturers reported the biggest jump in activity since March 2004, surging 5.5 percent, to $210.7 billion. It was sales of commercial aircraft that drove the increase, rather than renewed activity in factories everywhere, as Boeing recorded orders for 200 planes. While orders for electrical equipment continued to grow, orders for machinery, computers and fabricated metals all declined, the government reported. 
 Excluding military and aircraft contracts, spending on capital goods fell 2.3 percent. 
 ''It says that businesses are cautious, which maybe means that their profits weren't up to snuff for the quarter,'' said James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist of Wells Capital Management.
 In another report, newly built homes continued to attract buyers last month, pushing sales to levels that economists are increasingly describing as unsustainable, and home prices, while easing, remained high. Sales of new homes rose 2.1 percent in May, to an annual rate of 1.30 million, second only to 1.31 million in October. That keeps the year on pace to break last year's sales figure of 1.2 million, the highest on record. 
 Prices dropped 6.5 percent, to a median price of $217,000.
 ''Even for some of us who had been a little more skeptical on the housing bubble, it's becoming almost impossible to deny that there are some serious problems out there,'' Mr. Wieseman said, citing a rise in riskier loans like interest-only mortgages.
 Last month's pace fell short of the 1.32 million in sales forecast by economists in a Bloomberg News survey, but economists said they expected the buying to continue until mortgage rates rise. 
 Sales swelled 22.9 percent in the Midwest, to an annual rate of 268,000 units, the most ever. In the Northeast, where new homes account for far less of the housing market than in other regions, sales fell 24.5 percent, to 74,000.

HEADLINE: U.S. COURT BACKS BUSH'S REVISIONS IN CLEAN AIR ACT

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 24 

 BODY:
A federal appeals court sided with the Bush administration on Friday, upholding its revisions of the Clean Air Act to allow plant operators to modernize without installing expensive new pollution control equipment. The ruling turned back challenges to the revisions by New York, California and a dozen other states.
 In upholding central provisions of the regulations known as New Source Review, the court concluded that the Environmental Protection Agency had acted within its rights in issuing rules in 2002 that allowed operators of power plants, refineries, and factories greater flexibility in controlling emissions of air pollutants than they had previously.
 Representatives of the electric power industry, which had strongly supported the new regulations, hailed the ruling as a victory. The new rules require owners of older plants to upgrade emission-control equipment to standards for new plants only if they make substantial improvements. Plant owners and the E.P.A. have consistently disagreed over how to differentiate between routine maintenance and large-scale upgrades. 
 Jeffrey Holmstead, the agency's assistant administrator for air and radiation, said the court ''recognized the value of common sense reforms'' included in the new rules. Mr. Holmstead noted that the panel ''simply did not buy'' the argument made by the states and other critics that allowing the rules' provisions to remain intact would cause ''environmental devastation.''
 The ruling was issued in a unanimous opinion by a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. But the court also said that the E.P.A., in issuing the rules, had exceeded its authority in several areas, and representatives of the states and environmental groups also said they found enough to their liking in the 73-page opinion to claim successes.
 Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney general, said in an interview that the ruling was ''a win for us.'' Echoing a view expressed by environmental groups who were also involved in the case, Mr. Spitzer added: ''Anybody who cares about the quality of air can view the case a victory for enforcement and continued aggressive action to limit the violations of the Clean Air Act by power companies.'' 
 The revisions addressed in the court ruling are highly technical in nature and have been under legal assault since they became final in late 2002. Challenges to federal administrative rules bypass trial courts and proceed directly into the appeals court.
 The states, along with a dozen environmental groups, challenged some areas of the revisions, arguing that they reflected an administration that was too cozy with industry and that allowing plant operators more latitude would leave the air dirtier. Industry groups challenged other parts of the regulations as too onerous, warning that they would require plant operators to spend billions of dollars in upgrades and pass the costs on to consumers.
 As the respondent in the case, the E.P.A. argued that the revisions were appropriate and fair.
 The court agreed with no one entirely, as the three judges closely examined the areas under assault to determine whether the agency's interpretation exceeded the limits of the Clean Air Act. 
 The ruling is likely to have an impact in other cases pending in courts around the country involving the administration's rules on emission controls, including several cases in which New York is suing power companies.
 The ruling also sets up a possible Supreme Court review on the issue because of at least one other ruling, by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in Richmond, Va., last week involving Duke Energy. 
 David McIntosh, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council, one of the challengers, said, ''The polluter-friendly loopholes that the court struck down would have led to more asthma attacks, more hospitalizations and more sick days.''
 But Scott Segal, director of the Electric Reliability Coordinating Council, a trade organization, suggested that the environmentalists and states had misread a ruling that, by leaving sections unchanged, affirmed positions held by industry groups.
 ''On the whole, today is a very good day for common sense reform of the N.S.R. program,'' Mr. Segal said. ''As industries invest, one of the key impediments is that investment in new technology can trigger a punitive response from regulators. Today's decision brings certainty to major reform efforts.''
 The nature of the regulations under review by the court is intricate, and officials with otherwise opposing views cited the same part of the court ruling as a reason to claim victory. For example, the court denied an effort by a gold-mining company to change a provision that allows plant operators to select average emissions from any two consecutive years from the last 10 as a baseline toward measuring future emission levels.
 The mining company argued that its economic cycles are longer than 10 years, and that measuring emission levels should take that into account.
 Industry groups hailed the court ruling on this provision as a triumph for them because it would allow plant operators to pick a low two-year average. Then, if emission levels fell because of an economic downtown and reduced consumer demand, the operator would not be held to what might be only a temporarily low emissions level.
 Yet environmentalists also found benefits in the ruling, pointing out that the so-called ''10-year look-back'' provision does not apply to power plants, which account for the vast majority of industrial pollution.
 These are among the provisions that the court let stand, ruling that they were ''not otherwise arbitrary and capricious'':
 $(6$)In measuring increases of emissions, plant operators have to consider actual past and projected emission levels, not emission levels based on the potential output of a plant.
 $(6$)If an unexpected demand leads to suddenly higher emissions -- a possibility that could arise with a prolonged heat wave, for example -- the elevated levels would not be counted against the plant operators for purposes of measuring future emission levels against past levels.
 $(6$)Plants with multiple sources of pollution can count the aggregate levels of emissions for measurement comparisons.
 Among the provisions struck down was a decision by the agency to allow plants to avoid keeping records of their emissions if the plants do not anticipate a change in emission level that would spur New Source Review.
 The judges said the agency ''acted arbitrarily and capriciously'' in exempting those plants from keeping the same kinds of records required of other plants.
 The three-judge panel included Stephen F. Williams, a senior judge who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan; and two judges who were appointed by President Bill Clinton, Judith W. Rogers and David S. Tatel.

HEADLINE: Dining With Jeff

BYLINE: By PATRICIA NELSON LIMERICK. 
Maureen Dowd is on book leave.; Patricia Nelson Limerick, director of the Center of the American West at the University of Colorado and the author of ''The Legacy of Conquest'' and ''Something in the Soil,'' is a guest columnist for two weeks.; E-mail: limerick@nytimes.com

DATELINE: BOULDER, Colo. 

 BODY:
Founding a democracy, rather like living in a democracy, can be very tough on friendship. 
 John Adams and Thomas Jefferson began as friends. The tensions and frictions of the early Republic took care of that. Then, after years of silence between them, a mutual friend persuaded them to write to each other. In 1812, they launched into a correspondence that continued until it was ended by their deaths. 
 That ending point was on their minds and drove their correspondence. As Mr. Adams wrote Mr. Jefferson, ''You and I ought not to die, before we have explained ourselves to each other.'' 
 I fell in love with this quotation 30 years ago, about the same time that I fell in love with Jeff Limerick, and for some of the same reasons. Honest, self-aware and articulate, Jeff made ''explaining himself'' into an art form, but his performance soared past his fellow mortals when it came to the tougher side of this transaction. Jeff had a genius for listening and giving people the best opportunity to explain themselves and to become his friend.
 On Feb. 1, 2005, Jeff died of a stroke. Having trained with a master, I carry on with the methods I learned from him.
 When I find myself puzzled and even vexed by the opinions and beliefs of other people, I invite them to have lunch. Multiple experiments have supported what we will call, in Jeff's honor, the Limerick Hypothesis: in the bitter contests of values and political rhetoric that characterize our times, 90 percent of the uproar is noise, and 10 percent is what the scientists call ''signal,'' or solid, substantive information that will reward study and interpretation. If we could eliminate much of the noise, we might find that the actual, meaningful disagreements are on a scale we can manage.
 To put this hypothesis to the test, we will now apply it to two well-known people who are not, at this moment, friends. In a recent fray, escalated by the conflict-enhancing powers of the Internet, the journalist Bill Moyers misquoted James Watt, Ronald Reagan's first secretary of the interior. Mr. Moyers gave a speech last winter at Harvard, criticizing the Bush administration's environmental policies and making the case that an unfortunate theology, particularly a belief in an imminent Second Coming, was the driving force behind these policies. At the start of his speech, to illustrate this theology, Mr. Moyers shifted back in time and quoted Mr. Watt. Mr. Moyers said that Mr. Watt ''had told the U.S. Congress that protecting natural resources was unimportant in light of the imminent return of Jesus Christ. In public testimony, [Watt] said, 'After the last tree is felled, Christ will come back.'''
 But there is no evidence that Mr. Watt ever said this improbable thing, and Mr. Moyers acknowledged his ''mistake'' in quoting a remark that he could not confirm. But between these two very interesting Westerners remains a canyon of misunderstanding, in which people of Christian faith accuse each other of holding beliefs that jeopardize the well-being of the earth and its inhabitants.
 By casting many evangelical Christians as enemies of the earth's well-being, Mr. Moyers has made a not entirely strategic move to alienate people who could, should they be persuaded to recognize the hand of the Creator at work in the creation, prove to be remarkable and effective supporters for a cause that he considers urgent and crucial.
 It's surely time for lunch.
 So I invite Mr. Watt and Mr. Moyers to break bread with me, in a setting where a transcendent Western landscape both stirs our souls and reminds us of the economic, aesthetic, biological and spiritual riches at stake in our conversation. (The good news is that one man has already accepted.)
 My prospective companions are both people of earnest, generous, tested and resilient religious belief. It wouldn't take them long to find and face up to this common feature of their lives. And as a recovering secular humanist still struggling with my husband's death, I would find comfort in the company of people of faith.
 A successful outcome would be a vindication of the faith held by Jefferson, Adams and Jeff Limerick. But even if I dine alone, I'll still hold to the conviction that American citizens have the ability to explain themselves to one another, and to let friendship redeem the Republic.

HEADLINE: Good News for Oil Producers, Not So Good for Shares

BYLINE: By RIVA D. ATLAS

 BODY:
Is a rise in the price of oil bad news for stocks? 
 This week, the markets seemed to think so, as oil reached an intraday high of $60 a barrel, closing the week at $59.84.
 The decline in stock prices was particularly steep the last two days of the week. 
 On Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average dropped more than 166 points. 
 Yesterday, the Dow fell another 123.6 points, to close at 10,297.84. The index declined 3.1 percent for the week. 
 The decline came as the price of crude oil for August delivery in New York trading rose 42 cents for the day.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 9.16 points yesterday, to 1,191.57, bringing it down 25.39 points, or 2.1 percent, for the week. The S.&P. index is now showing a 1.68 percent loss for the year, reversing modest gains it posted as of the end of the previous week. 
 The Nasdaq composite index fell 17.39 points yesterday to close at 2,053.27, down 1.76 percent, or 36.84 points, for the week.
 Yields on the 10-year Treasury note also fell, after a government report yesterday indicated that orders for durable goods in May, excluding transportation, posted an unexpected decline of 0.2 percent, the third decline in four months. Over all, orders for durable goods rose by 5.5 percent last month.
 The report came on the heels of a decline in yields earlier in the week, after an influential bond fund manager, William Gross of Pimco, said in a speech at an investment conference that strong demand would keep Treasury yields low. 
 Yields on the 10-year notes ended the week at 3.9 percent, compared with 4.07 percent a week earlier.
 Several analysts and investors said yesterday that they thought the $60 level for oil had a psychological effect on traders, and that, at least for now, the price of oil was not high enough to hurt the profits of most companies.
 ''These headline numbers seem to scare the market, but this could just be a temporary blip,'' said James Swanson, chief investment strategist at MFS Investment Management.
 The high price of oil ''is a drag on earnings growth, but it's not lethal,'' Mr. Swanson said.
 Last year, traders similarly panicked when oil hit $55 a share, Mr. Swanson said, but corporate profits finished strongly for the year. 
 Henry McVey, chief investment strategist at Morgan Stanley, said that stocks had largely ignored the rise in oil prices because energy costs have a much smaller influence on the economy than they did when energy prices surged in the late 1970's and early 1980's.
 ''Manufacturing employed a third of the economy in the 1970's,'' Mr. McVey said. ''Today that number is 17 percent.'' 
 In contrast, service jobs, which are not always tied to energy prices, now account for 83 percent of employment. 
 Rising home prices also offset some of the economic impact of rising energy costs, Mr. McVey said.
 He added that it would take a rise in oil prices to about $85 a barrel before the economy would feel much of an impact. 
 One reason traders are having such a hard time figuring out the effect of rising oil prices on the stock market is because projections vary so widely. Mr. Swanson said he believed that oil would gradually drift down and be in the high $40's a year from now. 
 In contrast, analysts at Goldman Sachs have predicted that oil could trade as high as $105 a barrel by that time.
 Some companies are already suffering from rising energy costs. Alcoa, the aluminum manufacturer, cited rising energy costs as contributing to its decision to close plants and lay off 6,500 workers. 
 The announcement, made after the market close on Thursday, sent Alcoa's stock down 73 cents yesterday, to $26.46, making the stock one of the biggest decliners in the Dow Jones industrial average. Yesterday's loss came after a decline of 50 cents a share on Thursday, to $27.19. 
 While oil's impact is obvious on energy-dependent businesses like Alcoa, rising energy costs could also have a moderate impact on some companies that cater to lower-income consumers, said Robert W. Smith, portfolio manager of the $10 billion T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund. 
 He cited data from Wal-Mart Stores earlier this year, in which the company said that customers with just $50 a week in disposable income were spending $7 of that on gasoline.
 That statistic put a dent in Wal-Mart's stock, but Mr. Smith said he had taken advantage of the decline to add to an existing investment his fund had in the company.
 Companies like Wal-Mart ''should be fine once oil moderates,'' he said. 
 Over all for his fund, rising energy prices have been only a ''mild negative,'' Mr. Smith said.

HEADLINE: Philadelphia Mandates Black History for Graduation

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, June 22 

 BODY:
Angry that public schools here have always taught American history through a Eurocentric prism, parents of black children began pleading with local school officials to offer a course in African-American history.
 That was nearly 40 years ago.
 This year, their pleas were finally -- and emphatically -- answered. Starting in September, students entering city high schools as ninth graders will be required to take a course in African-American history, making Philadelphia the first major city to require such a course for high school graduation. 
 School officials here say the course carries huge benefits for all students and offers a perspective on American history that has been largely absent from most contemporary teaching guides. 
 ''You cannot understand American history without understanding the African-American experience; I don't care what anybody says,'' said Paul G. Vallas, the school system's chief executive, who is white. ''It benefits African-American children who need a more comprehensive understanding of their own culture, and it also benefits non-African-Americans to understand the full totality of the American experience.''
 Critics of the policy shift say it will further polarize the city by focusing attention on just one race and not dealing with other racial and ethnic groups like Mexicans, Chinese or Poles. 
 According to a course outline developed by district officials, the course will focus on how Africans became Americans through the colonial period, efforts of slaves to achieve freedom, the Civil War and its aftermath, economic development for blacks through the last century, the civil rights movement and the growth of modern black nationalist movements in the United States and Africa.
 Supporters say the course will place a new emphasis on historical African-American figures like Frederick Douglass, Ida B. Wells and Dr. Charles Drew, whose contributions to American life and culture seldom get more than a brief mention, if that, in the current textbooks that many schools use.
 The Philadelphia School District includes 185,000 students, two-thirds of whom are African-American, and only two in seven are white or Hispanic. The School Reform Commission, a panel that sets policy and is now composed of three whites and two blacks, voted 5 to 0 in February to make the course mandatory in all 53 high schools after some in recent years had offered African-American history as an elective. 
 The vote garnered little notice at the time, but in recent weeks as the school board began mailing out letters to parents informing them of next year's curriculum, pockets of local resistance began emerging. 
 The speaker of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, John M. Perzel, an otherwise strong supporter of the city's schools for recent improvements in test scores, asked the commission to reconsider making the course mandatory.
 Mr. Perzel, a Republican who represents a district in northeast Philadelphia that is largely white, said in a letter to the commission chairman, James E. Nevels, that he was concerned that the mandate ''will divide, rather than unite'' the city ''and thereby erode the positive learning environment.''
 Mr. Nevels, calling himself ''respectful of the points'' Mr. Perzel raised, said he was certain that district officials would not reverse their decision. ''There's no question about the commitment to African-American history by the Philadelphia School District,'' he said. 
 An aide to Mr. Perzel said the letter was prompted, in part, by complaints from constituents. Mr. Perzel declined a request for an interview, but his sentiments appear to reflect discomfort among some whites elsewhere in the city.
 Standing outside a recreation center in Fishtown, a largely white working-class neighborhood, Mike Budnick, 16, called the requirement ''a bad idea'' and said he was not especially interested in learning about black culture or heritage.
 ''I'm more interested in our history,'' he said.
 A friend of Mr. Budnick, Arbi Ferko, also 16, said, ''It's not our history to learn,'' and pointed out, as other critics have, that the school had not sought to create courses on the history of other groups.
 Supporters of the course are dismayed by such views, insisting that in large measure, African-Americans, like no other ethnic group, have been cheated by contemporary textbooks and social studies curriculums that introduce students to blacks in this country as slaves from Africa with no prior language, culture or heritage.
 ''Too often, African-Americans are marginalized in American society,'' said Sandra Dungee Glenn, a commission member who was the driving force behind making the course mandatory. ''People's views and understanding of who we are focus on us as descendents of slaves. It begins and ends there, giving us inferior status.'' 
 The course is designed to alter those perceptions by reviewing the origins of civilization in Africa and early developments in African history before tracking the movement of Africans to North America as slaves.
 From that point, the course follows the progress and travails of blacks throughout American history with a special emphasis on their contributions.
 As a pilot program, African history was offered in the spring semester this year in four high schools.
 Patricia Thomas Whyatt taught the course at Strawberry Mansion, a nearly all-black school of 900 students, and found that even her own students had misconceptions of their race.
 ''The first day I asked students to make a list of everything they knew about Africa, then we went through each item,'' Ms. Whyatt said. ''They thought Africa was all jungle, that people ran around with spears and lived in huts. A lot of crazy things like that.''
 By the end of school this month, she said, not only had perceptions changed but self-esteem had improved as well.
 One of her students, Christopher Davis, 18, said: ''In American society, we're known as gangsters, drug dealers and killers. People don't know all about our heritage, what we stood for, our accomplishments as a culture. I feel better now because I know a little bit more about how we lived before we got here.''

HEADLINE: Age 80 in Guernsey? Forget About Renting a Car

BYLINE: By Alina Tugend

 BODY:
MOST people may never need to know this, but if you were to rent a car in Morocco or New Caledonia, you better not be 65 or over years old. Or 70 in Egypt, Gibraltar, Kenya, Malta, New Guinea and Tasmania. And if you are that intrepid 80-year-old visiting the Isle of Man or Guernsey, you better take public transportation.
 That's because in those countries -- unlike the United States -- many rental car companies have upper age limits.
 This issue came up for my family several years ago when we were traveling in Ireland. My father rented a car over the Internet through Alamo. But when we arrived at the Dublin airport, the local rental car agency working with Alamo asked his age. He was 75 then, and in Ireland as we learned, no one 75 or over can rent a car. 
 The situation was perplexing as no one in the United States had warned him of this tiny detail. Fortunately, my husband and I could take over the driving, but it made me realize that there are many things about renting a car you may not even know you need to know.
 There are questions of varying costs, of insurance, and of customs and legislation, particularly internationally, which may come as an unwelcome surprise.
 For example, while those renting cars in the United States don't have to worry about being too old, drivers under age 25 cannot rent a car at all in most states. New York and Michigan are the exceptions, allowing those 18 and older to rent, but most rental companies tack on an additional fee to compensate for the higher liability risk, said Richard Broome, a spokesman for Hertz Rental Cars. 
 In most other countries, drivers 23 to 25 can rent, but also at a higher cost, he said.
 In terms of prices, one thing is certain: the number of car rentals starts climbing around the July 4th weekend and continues through August, so, not surprisingly, that is when rates start going up.
 In mid-June, for example, the average cost of a midsize car booked a week in advance is $43 daily from an airport location, according to the Abrams Consulting Group, an industry research firm.
 Over the last six months, the rate has been as low as $35 a day, said Neil Abrams, president of the firm. Based on his analysis, Mr. Abrams said, cars could go up another $15 or so during the summer.
 What is more, he said, it is almost always going to be more expensive to rent at an airport location because of surcharges and taxes that are passed on to the consumer.
 In a recent report on rental cars, Consumers Union noted that demand is highest at airports, where 90 percent of rentals originate. The report found that an economy car booked through Hertz at a downtown Boston location was $210 for the first week in May, including taxes and fees. Had the car been picked up at Logan Airport, it would have been $341, including $67 in taxes and fees.
 Indeed, Consumers Union said, taxes and fees can be as much as 30 percent of the bill.
 There is competition beyond the majors -- don't be afraid to check out independent rental companies, which may have the better rate.
 ''There's a lot of rental companies out there,'' Mr. Abrams said. ''Many are offering the same rentals as the big names do.''
 Experts advise doing research at Web sites like www.breezenet.com -- which also offers explanations about what insurance you may or may not need, and other handy tips -- or www.carrentalexpress.com.
 Do not wait until the last minute to book; all the discounts and more economical car models may be gone by then. But because rental companies do not have cancellation fees, you can do a last-minute price comparison 24 hours before you leave. If the price has dropped, you can always cancel and lock in at the lower rate. 
 When renting a car, I was always told by savvy travelers that I should always reject the insurance because personal auto insurance or credit cards provide the same coverage. The rental car insurance can add $12 to $25 a day to your final bill.
 Before you decline the insurance, though, it is a good idea to check out what your car insurance does cover in terms of collision damage or personal liability.
 The same is true for credit card coverage. For example, until I examined the policy, I never knew that my platinum MasterCard covered only 15 days of collision damage insurance on rental cars, while my American Express card lasted 30 days. 
 My MasterCard also excludes coverage on campers, recreational vehicles and off-road vehicles, as well as trucks, pickups and limousines.
 While it covers up to $50,000 worth of damage to the rental car, it does not cover personal injury, personal liability or personal property -- meaning if you hit someone's else's vehicle, the insurance will not pay for it. The MasterCard also kicks in only after my primary car insurance has paid its limit.
 Credit card coverage is especially important overseas, said Alfred Celentano, manager of the Manhattan-based company Europe by Car. Ninety-five percent of those renting cars from his agency use their credit cards for insurance, he said, as most personal auto policies do not extend to overseas rentals. 
 Customers should be aware that they need to have credit limits large enough to cover the deductible. ''If you only have $100 available, and you're trying to cover a $5,000 deductible, that's a problem,'' he said. 
 For those who are planning to travel by car for more than a few weeks around Europe, leasing may be a better option than buying. 
 ''Around 28 days, a lease almost always becomes more economical,'' Mr. Celentano said. But he also noted that when renting overseas, customers should be sure to ask if the car is standard or automatic. In the United States virtually all rentals are automatic, but the norm -- and usually the cheaper option -- in other countries tends to be manual transmission.
 If traveling with children, don't forget that you will have to pay extra for a child seat if you don't bring yours along. Such seats usually run $8 to $9 a day both in the United States and overseas.
 While renting cars in other countries is generally a pretty straightforward matter, it may help to know some of the local customs. 
 Most rental cars don't allow you to drive your rental from Western Europe into many Eastern European countries because of theft, Mr. Broome of Hertz said. The same is true for driving an expensive car like a Mercedes or a BMW into Italy.
 In Spain, if you wear glasses, by law you have to carry an extra pair with you in case the first pair is broken.
 In Switzerland, if you are behind two or more cars at a traffic light, you are required to turn off your engine.
 Sounding your horn in Finland is forbidden except in cases of immediate danger.
 The middle lane is the fast lane on three-lane roads in Italy.
 You can rent a car in China -- but if you want to drive it, you need a Chinese driver's license.

HEADLINE: The Mild, Mild West

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY. 
E-mail: tierney@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The actors from HBO's ''Deadwood'' are coming to the scene of their crimes today, and they can expect a hero's welcome when they pose for pictures on Main Street. Some people in the real Deadwood are offended by the series' lurid language and scenes, but the ones who work in the tourist industry recognize a central truth about the Old West: violence sells. 
 The casino operators here stage shootings on the hour. At 1, 3 and 5 p.m., you can sit inside Saloon No.10 and watch Wild Bill Hickok gunned down at a card table. At 2, 4 and 6 p.m., there are gunfights in the street. The bodies aren't being fed to hogs yet, as in the television series, perhaps because that would hurt the restaurant business. 
 Between the murders on ''Deadwood'' and the massacres on ''Into the West,'' the Steven Spielberg epic that seems to be playing round the clock on TNT, the popular version of the frontier looks scarier than ever. There's nothing like blood on high-def TV to illustrate Hobbes's theory that life before government was nasty, brutish and short.
 But if you talk to some historians and economists about Deadwood and the rest of the West, you get a much different picture from what's on television -- or what's been taught in history classes. 
 These revisionists' history, unlike the one now fashionable in academia, is not a grim saga of settlers exploiting one another, annihilating natives and despoiling nature. Nor is it like the previously fashionable history depicting the settlers as heroic individualists who tamed the frontier by developing the great American virtue of self-reliance.
 The Westerners in this history survived by learning to get along, as Terry Anderson and Peter Hill document in their new book, ''The Not So Wild, Wild West.'' These economists, both at the PERC think tank in Montana, argue that their Western ancestors were usually neither heroic enough to make it on their own nor strong enough to take it away from others. 
 Yes, some robbed and killed other settlers and Indians, but when they contemplated the basic economic question on the frontier -- to raid or to trade? -- they usually preferred trading to risking their own lives. They were entrepreneurs in what's now called institutional economics, inventing social systems to deal with chaotic situations like the California gold rush that started in 1848, when there were no established laws to govern mining. 
 It was Hobbes's prescription for ''war of every man against every man,'' and he was echoed by newspaper predictions of a ''theater of tragic events'' in which ''brute force will reign triumphant.'' But the miners peacefully worked out rules for delineating claims and resolving disputes so well that the system was adopted at later camps like Deadwood.
 Roger McGrath, a historian who studied dozens of Western mining camps and towns, found a high rate of homicide in them mainly because it was socially acceptable for young, drunk single men to resolve points of honor by fighting to the death. But other violence wasn't tolerated, he said.
 ''It was a rather polite and civil society enforced by armed men,'' Dr. McGrath said. ''The rate of burglary and robbery was lower than in American cities today. Claim-jumping was rare. Rape was extraordinarily rare -- you can argue it wasn't being reported, but I've never seen evidence hinting at that.''
 Deadwood's bad reputation was established by the famous killing of Wild Bill and enhanced with claims that the miners averaged a murder a day. But Deadwood historians like Watson Parker dismiss that statistic. 
 ''Pure bilge,'' Dr. Parker told me. ''There wasn't an awful lot of violence in Deadwood except for the crooks and drunks killing each other. When everybody has a gun on his hip, they tend to avoid confrontation.''
 Another Deadwood historian, Bob Lee, said that the best account of the two peak years of the gold rush, 1876 and 1877, lists only 77 violent deaths in all the Black Hills, most outside Deadwood, and most attributed to Indians, who were understandably angry at the invasion of their lands by both miners and troops under George Armstrong Custer.
 The Indians saw that Washington's new interest in the Black Hills would be disastrous for them (a topic for a later column). Raiding was no longer costlier than trading for the settlers because they could now let troops do the raiding for them. Hobbes had expected war in the absence of government, but the West didn't really get wild until the feds arrived.

HEADLINE: Next Wave From China: Exporting Cars to the West

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: XINSHA, China, June 24 

 BODY:
Honda Motor began loading cars onto a ship here on Friday for export to Europe in China's debut as a volume exporter of cars to the industrialized world.
 The shipment follows DaimlerChrysler's disclosure two months ago at the Shanghai Auto Show that it was negotiating to build a factory near Beijing to make small cars for export to North America. It comes at the end of a week when the Haier Group's bid for Maytag and the China National Offshore Oil Corporation's bid for Unocal have fed Western concerns about China's rapid economic rise.
 Automakers from around the globe, including General Motors, Ford Motor and Toyota Motor, are racing to build factories in China even as the rest of the world faces severe overcapacity in car manufacturing, raising the prospect that more factories may someday have to close in Western countries as Chinese exports grow. 
 China's swift development has already alarmed leaders of the United Automobile Workers and other Western labor unions, who say their members cannot compete with workers earning $100 a month in coastal Chinese provinces and who would earn half that at auto factories being built in inland provinces.
 Following a path already blazed by Korea and Japan, China has built a large auto industry with increasingly high quality over the last decade while protecting its home market behind steep trade barriers. China still imposes a tariff of close to 30 percent on imported family vehicles, compared with American tariffs of 2.5 percent on imported cars, minivans and sport utility vehicles and 25 percent on pickup trucks.
 What distinguishes China from its Asian rivals, however, is that China decided much earlier in its automotive development to welcome multinational companies -- although only through joint ventures with Chinese manufacturers, who are rapidly learning the latest manufacturing and engineering techniques from their partners.
 Particularly impressive, auto analysts said, has been the swift improvement in the quality of cars produced in China. Hironori Kanayama, president of the Honda subsidiary producing the cars here, exhorted employees at a ship-loading ceremony here to improve quality further.
 ''Our market is overseas,'' he said. ''Our competitors are strong international automakers; we have to exceed them. Our only way out is to make products equal to or exceeding those made in Japan.''
 During a brief interview, Mr. Kanayama conceded that the quality of cars assembled here was slightly worse than that of identical models made in Japan, but said that the difference was quite small and narrowing.
 Honda tried to play up Friday's shipment for Chinese audiences without feeding fears overseas of China's economic might. Honda paid to fly in scores of Chinese journalists for the ceremony but did little to alert Western journalists, and only three showed up.
 Honda employees began driving 150 Jazz wagons onto the Panamanian-registered Liberty Ace on Friday at a dock on the outskirts of Guangzhou, 80 miles northwest of Hong Kong. The ship was already carrying 5,000 cars from manufacturers in Japan, and will carry all of the cars to Ghent, Belgium.
 The first batch of Chinese-built Jazzes will then be trucked to German showrooms. Chinese-made and Japanese-made Jazzes will be sold interchangeably and for the same price at Honda dealerships, first in Germany, then in Italy, and eventually across Europe as Honda tests customer reaction.
 Slightly smaller than a Civic, the Jazz is sold in Asia and Europe but not the United States, where the market for small cars is limited. Honda executives said they had no immediate plans to start building any larger models for export.
 The cars being exported were assembled at a new Honda factory here that was built just to supply the European market. By agreeing to export all the cars, Honda won the right to own 65 percent of the factory while its local partners own the rest.
 China has a 50 percent cap on foreign investment in car factories that supply the domestic market.
 During a short press tour of the factory on Friday, it was apparent that Honda had invested in robots where they were needed for quality and safety reasons, in the welding of the automobile bodies. But the factory otherwise relied heavily on manual labor, which is very cheap, with workers pushing carts bearing partly completed bodies and auto parts in places where a larger factory in a Western country would probably have a conveyor belt.
 At Honda's huge factory in Marysville, Ohio, nearby suppliers deliver seats and other parts to the assembly line every few minutes, minimizing the need to keep costly inventory on hand. But briefly visible during the press tour here was a large hall full of stacks of spare parts and a couple of hundred gray car seats wrapped in plastic.
 Honda is still importing many of the parts used here, as was evident from stacks of wooden boxes stamped ''Made in Japan'' near the welding line. 
 Atsuyoshi Hyogo, the chairman of the Honda subsidiary here, said the company was rapidly increasing its reliance on locally made parts. The world's biggest auto parts companies have all built factories in China and plan to build more, initially to supply the local market but increasingly to supply assembly plants in industrialized countries as well.
 The journey from the factory to the port captures the swift and continuing industrialization of China. Close to the factory, the road passes miles of banana plantations, together with rows of single-story concrete barracks with corrugated steel roofs for the workers. Farther along are huge factories producing concrete and other industrial materials, with workers in hard hats clambering over the rising steel skeletons of more factories not yet completed.
 The Liberty Ace had tied up between a modern dock, with the latest giant cranes using steel talons to load 40-foot steel containers onto a barge, and an aging bulk cargo dock, the cranes equipped with steel buckets for unloading coal, but standing idle and with some rust showing Friday afternoon.
 Chinese and multinational automakers in China already export, but until now these shipments have been made on an extremely small scale. A Ford joint venture in China ships 1,000 vans a year to the Philippines. A G.M. joint venture ships up to 2,000 very small cars to Southeast Asia.
 Purely domestic Chinese automakers are starting to export. Brilliance Automotive has announced plans to export up to 2,000 Zhonghua sedans to Germany later this year, and Chery is laying plans to try to start selling cars in the United States in 2007 or 2008. But Honda's effort is much greater: its factory here is scheduled to export 10,000 cars during the rest of this year and reach 50,000 a year within five years.
 Robert A. Lutz, G.M.'s vice chairman, predicted at the Shanghai Auto Show that Chinese manufacturers would learn to export in large quantities on their own.
 ''We're rapidly approaching that point -- I wouldn't venture to say which one it will be,'' he told several journalists, later adding, ''One or more Chinese brands exported to other regions of the globe and selling successfully I would describe as a sure thing in the next five years.''

HEADLINE: Chevron Criticizes Rival Suitor

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO and ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
A top executive at Chevron yesterday sharply criticized the $18.5 billion bid by the China National Offshore Oil Corporation for Unocal, calling it an inferior combination that would end up producing less oil and natural gas than a Chevron acquisition and would turn Unocal into a company ''strategically focused on China.''
 The executive, Peter Robertson, Chevron's vice chairman, also accused the Chinese of not competing fairly.
 ''Clearly, this is not a commercial competition,'' Mr. Robertson said. ''We are competing with the Chinese government, and I think that is wrong.'' 
 Even so, Chevron -- despite an ostensibly lower bid -- may well hold a stronger position than the Chinese company in the unfolding takeover battle. Mr. Robertson said yesterday that Chevron believes that it is under no immediate pressure to improve its offer, even though the bid by the Chinese company is sharply higher than Chevron's offer and is all cash.
 The Chinese offer ''is not a knock-out blow,'' Mr. Robertson said. ''We are going to win this one. I am convinced of it.'' 
 On Wednesday, the Chinese company, that nation's third-largest state-owned oil company, known as CNOOC, made an audacious move to woo Unocal away from Chevron. On the heels of other moves by Chinese companies to take over American companies, the struggle for Unocal has quickly been elevated into a test of Chinese-American strategic and economic relations far beyond a standard corporate deal.
 Already, more than 40 members of Congress have signed a joint letter to President Bush, urging the administration to conduct a thorough review of the Chinese bid.
 Meanwhile, some prominent industry executives have warned against political meddling in a commercial deal.
 Lee R. Raymond, the chief executive of Exxon Mobil, said on Thursday that it would be a ''big mistake'' for Congress to interfere with a bid by CNOOC, saying intervention could backfire on American companies seeking to do business abroad.
 But for all the political attention the bid by CNOOC is receiving, it may never overcome a number of basic business obstacles that stand in the way. Chevron's ability to hold the line rests in large part on a provision in the merger agreement it signed with Unocal in April that gives Chevron the right to call a shareholder vote on its offer before Unocal can allow its shareholders to consider any other deal. Chevron is expected to call such a vote of Unocal shareholders in August.
 A spokesman for CNOOC said the company made its decision to bid for Unocal ''based solely on shareholder- value considerations.''
 Analysts agreed with Mr. Robertson that the Chinese bid was not high enough to dissuade Chevron. ''The Chinese could have discouraged Chevron from chasing them, but they kept their bid within striking distance,'' said Fadel Gheit, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Company, a brokerage firm. Mr. Gheit owns both Unocal and Chevron shares and the firm is recommending both stocks.
 Indeed, CNOOC is more likely to be pressed to raise its offer at least once to try to derail approval of Chevron's offer. 
 The other factor in Chevron's favor is time. Chevron could complete a deal almost immediately after approval from shareholders. The Chinese company, on the other hand, could not hope to complete a deal until at least six months after Unocal shareholders rejected the Chevron offer.
 And even that time frame might be considered optimistic, given the prospect of a government review over national security issues that have been raised by this deal. Unocal shareholders would also have to face the risk that if they voted down the Chevron deal, at that point there would technically be no other deal on the table. CNOOC is under no legal obligation to make its bid.
 As a result, some expect that CNOOC might, as a gesture of good faith and transparency, put $18.5 million in an escrow account as a sign that it will guarantee to come through with an offer.
 Unocal said on Thursday that it would begin talks with CNOOC. Executives briefed on the discussions said that while Unocal's executives would prefer to do a deal with Chevron, they hope to play off one competitor against the other, thereby securing an even higher price for the company.
 Bankers have also been trying to rustle up other energy companies that could put Unocal at the center of a full-blown bidding war. Yet while Eni of Italy had been interested in Unocal in the spring, it ultimately did not make a bid. New bidders like Total of France, which has nearly $10 billion in cash, are not likely to emerge, those close to the negotiations said.
 Chevron is offering Unocal shareholders a combination of 0.7725 share of Chevron stock and $16.25 in cash. Based on Chevron's closing price yesterday of $56.69, that offer is currently worth about $60 a share. CNOOC's offer is $67 a share in cash.
 In explaining their reasons for putting the company up for sale earlier this year, Unocal executives explained that the company had reached the limits of its ability to develop large-scale energy assets on its own. 
 Yesterday, Mr. Robertson contended that Chevron had more technology to develop those assets. He said Chevron and Unocal were currently jointly producing complicated discoveries in the Caspian Sea and others in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico that would bear more fruit if the technical skill of the two companies were combined. CNOOC has no deepwater operations.
 Mr. Robertson also said that the Chinese company might choose to steer natural gas produced in Unocal fields in Indonesia to the Chinese market as liquefied natural gas, rather than into the broader Asian liquefied gas market.
 A spokesman for CNOOC said the company planned to develop the oil and gas properties in the Gulf of Mexico fully and to increase production there and elsewhere. The spokesman, who also reiterated the company's vow to maintain energy supplies to the United States, said that it would retain more Unocal employees than Chevron would. 
 Mr. Robertson rejected that claim. ''I will not sit here and tell you there will be no job cuts,'' he said. ''But not much of the synergy in this merger comes from cutting people.''
 He noted that Unocal had a very small headquarters in El Segundo, Calif., and that most of Unocal's employees in the United States worked in Houston, where Chevron has a large operation. ''We need all of those people,'' he said.

HEADLINE: A Broadband Beat-Down

BYLINE: By DAN MITCHELL

 BODY:
IT looked for a while as if the United States was firmly entrenched as the world's leader in Internet innovation. President Bill Clinton and Al Gore, his vice president, did much to encourage development of the country's technology infrastructure, writes Thomas Bleha in an article accessible on the Foreign Affairs magazine Web site (www.foreignaffairs.org).
 From the 1960's until the day President Bush took office, he writes, ''The United States led the world in Internet development.'' 
 No longer. The Bush administration's policies, or lack thereof, have since allowed Asia -- Japan in particular -- to not only catch up in the development and expansion of broadband and mobile phone technology, but to roundly pound us into the dirt. ''The lag,'' he diplomatically asserts, ''is arguably the result of the Bush administration's failure to make a priority of developing these networks.'' 
 Japan instituted what used to be called an industrial policy, which provided incentives for expanding broadband and wireless technology to the masses. The United States, meanwhile, has done essentially nothing. Japan is now well ahead of us in the percentage of homes with broadband. And their broadband on average is about half the price and 16 times the speed of ours.
 Japan is even further ahead in mobile telephony. ''U.S. mobile phone service remains awful by European, let alone Japanese, standards,'' writes Mr. Bleha, who served as a Foreign Service officer in Japan for eight years and has a forthcoming book on the subject.
 Meanwhile, Japan, South Korea and other Asian countries are poised to leap ahead of the United States in any number of areas: teleconferencing, telecommuting, remote medical services, distance education, multimedia entertainment. 
 The economy as a whole is at risk because of broadband shortcomings, says Charles H. Ferguson of the Brookings Institution (brookings.edu). Last year, he asserted in a book, ''The Broadband Problem,'' that the United States might lose up to $1 trillion because of constraints on broadband deployment.
 SWEET JUSTICE -- Clicking into Business Week's Brand New Day blog brings up the striking photographic visage of a blogger, David Kiley. He looks so curmudgeonly that you immediately assume he takes on branding and marketing with a healthy dose of skepticism. He does not disappoint. On cereal packages, General Mills features its cartoon icons for Trix, Lucky Charms and Cocoa Puffs extolling the ''health benefits'' of its products. Kraft is using the Nickelodeon characters SpongeBob SquarePants and Dora the Explorer in much the same way. 
 ''Let's cut to the chase,'' he writes. ''This is all about creating cover in the debate over childhood obesity and whether or not sugary, fatty and otherwise heavily processed foods should be freely advertised directly to kids under 12.''
 ''Brand management should have credibility management at its center,'' he says. ''That's where marketing, smart public relations and reputation management converge when companies do it right.''
 PRIVATE WAR -- Frontline makes its documentaries available on its World Wide Web site (frontline.org), usually adding complete versions of interviews, source materials, transcripts and other goodies. The Frontline people know the power of the medium, and the site is far and away the best in all of public broadcasting. The latest show, ''Private Warriors,'' profiles the work of private contractors in Iraq, and the Web treatment is up to the show's usual standards.
 STOP BUGGING ME -- If newspaper marketers think they are receiving reliable user information via those annoying site registrations, they should run their Web addresses through bugmenot.com, which offers quick user names and passwords to people who click on a link only to be confronted by a mandatory registration page. Some examples of usernames: thisisannoying; iwantnews; thisisjustsilly; whydoyoudothis. DAN MITCHELL

HEADLINE: The Last Wound

BYLINE: By John Wheeler. 
John Wheeler, cofounder of the Vietnam Children's Fund, is a lawyer and Vietnam veteran.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
WHEN Prime Minister Phan Van Khai of Vietnam wraps up his trip to the United States today, he will have gathered with President Bush at the White House and Bill Gates of Microsoft in Seattle, rung the bell to open the New York Stock Exchange and met the presidents of Harvard and M.I.T.
 But two stops left off his itinerary were Los Angeles and Silicon Valley, home to the biggest communities of Vietnamese-Americans and epicenter of anti-Hanoi sentiment. 
 One million Vietnamese-Americans enrich the United States with their work ethic and vibrant culture. Yet many still feel animosity toward their homeland. They lobby against closer relations, boycott visits by officials like Mr. Khai and vilify the Vietnamese government on human rights. They consider the yellow and red flag of the old regime their own; a misguided bill pending in Sacramento would make California the 10th state to endorse that flag as the official banner for Vietnamese-Americans. 
 The impact of this breach is social and political but also economic, impeding the growth of trade and discouraging Vietnamese-American entrepreneurs from taking knowledge and values back to their homeland. Closing the rift would greatly benefit both our countries.
 I recently witnessed a hopeful sign in the reception of ''Journey from the Fall,'' a new film about the fall of Saigon, re-education camps and the boat people coming to America. For years the movie's star, Kieu Chinh, had been ostracized for serving as co-chair of the Vietnam Children's Fund, which builds schools in Vietnam. Yet at the Washington premiere, a big audience of Vietnamese-Americans roundly applauded her.
 While candid about the abandonment of South Vietnam by the United States and the severe abuses by the Hanoi government, the film provoked not enmity but a sense of healing among the tearful audience. It focuses on children and the future, representing the view of its young producers, Alan Ford and Lam Nguyen, whose parents fled Vietnam.
 Indeed, young Vietnamese-Americans are already helping to repair the breach. Huy Do, who fled Vietnam as a child with his family and settled in California, is chairman of the Vietnamese Silicon Valley Network, which fosters high-tech industry in Vietnam. Don Lam, whose parents fled Vietnam by boat in 1979, founded VinaCapital, which runs the $37 million Vietnam Opportunity Fund, an example of financial services firms now investing in insurance and real estate in Vietnam. And young Vietnamese-Americans staff the Vietnam offices of Intel and American Internet and phone companies.
 With a gross domestic product growing by more than 7 percent a year, Vietnam is a potentially valuable economic partner. Bilateral trade totaled $6.4 billion last year, 20 times higher than it was a decade ago. American exports to Vietnam were worth $1.2 billion in goods and an estimated $100 million in services. 
 Like recent immigrants from other countries, Vietnamese-Americans can be a central force in expanding ties to their homeland, not to mention promoting greater cooperation in efforts like fighting disease and stopping money-laundering.
 And there is a model for overcoming the bitterness of the past: America's Vietnam veterans helped rejuvenate Vietnam's economy by ending the trade embargo, founding the Vietnam Education Fund and starting charities and business activities in Vietnam after 1975. 
 Although Mr. Khai's visit has yielded new agreements on economic, political and military cooperation, stumbling blocks remain, including Vietnam's record on human rights.
 But Vietnam veterans like Senator John McCain, former Senator Bob Kerrey and FedEx founder Fred Smith have recognized that the best way to ensure that our future is brighter than our past is to work together, as partners and potential allies. For the sake of both countries, Vietnamese-Americans should embrace that wisdom.

HEADLINE: Bill Gates as Anthropologist

BYLINE: By PAUL B. BROWN

 BODY:
MARGARET MEAD. Louis Leakey. Bill Gates?
 Grouping the founder of Microsoft among great anthropologists is not as strange as it first sounds, according to the current issue of Fortune Small Business.
 In an effort to grow ever closer to its customers, Microsoft has hired numerous social scientists, including anthropologists, to help it understand the natives, who in this case are the small-business owners who use its software. 
 The research is part of Microsoft's effort to produce its Office Small Business Accounting software, although this approach to understanding customers would seem applicable not only for other Microsoft products, but also for just about every other company that sells a product.
 Microsoft's idea behind going into the field to study customers is simple, as Richard McGill Murphy writes in the article ''Getting to Know You'': the better you understand how your customers work, the easier it becomes to design products and services to meet their needs. 
 And the more you understand where the market is heading, the easier it is to get there first.
 Once upon a time, all Microsoft would have needed to do to understand the small-business market would be to look inside its own offices in Redmond, Wash. No more. Microsoft is now a company with $37 billion in annual sales and 57,000 employees, and so the need to hire anthropologists. 
 Maybe Harrison Ford can play Mr. Gates in the movie.
 LATER-LIFE PLANNING -- It isn't news that people are living longer in retirement. 
 But what is different is how they spend their money once they stop working, according to this month's Financial Planning, a magazine geared to financial advisers, which contends that there's a need to rethink how retirements are financed.
 Traditionally, financial planners have worried about making sure a retiree's money lasts, assuming expenses will be uniform throughout retirement. 
 But that doesn't reflect reality writes Len Reinhart, a financial planner, who says in his column ''Managed Money'' that people who retire seem to go through three distinct stages and that expenses vary during each one.
 ''As your clients enter the first phase of later life, they do all the things that you planned for -- they travel, make the gifts they want to make, and try the new hobbies and activities they never had time for when they were working,'' he writes.
 When they fulfill, or get tired of their dreams, ''most settle back into the way of life that made them comfortable in their preretirement years,'' Mr. Reinhart adds.
 And in the final phase, health problems tend to limit activities -- and increase expenses.
 The moral is that investments need to be timed to make sure that people can do what they want during each phase.
 AMERICA FOR SALE -- ''The same Chinese firms that have been crippling American manufacturers with cut-rate goods could soon be viewed in an entirely different light: As sugar daddies,'' Business 2.0 reports this month.
 It turns out that Americans are directly responsible for a possible Chinese buying spree on our shores. ''Because Americans have spent $390 billion more on Chinese goods during the past three years than China has spent on U.S. imports, China is flush with cash,'' Paul Kaihla writes. This year, China could spend as much as $15 billion on overseas acquisitions, says Don Straszheim, the former chief economist for Merrill Lynch. That is triple what it spent from 1979 to 2002.
 The article could not have been more timely; this week alone, there were two big deals. First, the Haier Group, a Chinese manufacturer, moved to acquire Maytag for $1.3 billion, surpassing a bid from a group of American investors. Then the China National Offshore Oil Corporation made a $18.5 billion unsolicited bid for Unocal. The bid comes two months after Unocal agreed to be sold to Chevron for $16.4 billion. The Lenovo Group's $1.75 billion purchase of I.B.M.'s personal computer division closed last month. PAUL B. BROWN

 BODY:
AT a time when Africa could achieve so much success in escaping poverty, America's strategy for helping the continent is in a shambles.
 The head of President Bush's Millennium Challenge Corporation recently resigned after failing to get the program moving. Democratically elected African leaders have criticized the lack of action by the United States. Recent Congressional hearings showed that America's efforts to control malaria in Africa have been more about advertising than controlling malaria. And, the president recently rebuffed a call by Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain to announce a worldwide effort to double aid to Africa before the Group of 8 summit meeting next month. 
 Contrary to a world lining up to back Mr. Blair, and to repeated studies showing that Africa could effectively use a doubling of aid by 2010, Mr. Bush instead announced a small additional amount of emergency food aid. This highlighted the gap between America's mistaken approach of shipping food relief versus helping Africans to grow more food.
 And while the Group of 8 nations have agreed to a new debt cancellation deal for Africa, it is only a small step, worth around $1.5 billion a year of the additional $25 billion a year that Africa needs. The Bush administration said the United States would offset its share of the cost (around $150 million a year) by cutting other aid.
 The mess is especially shocking because it amounts to a death sentence for more than 6 million Africans a year who die of preventable and treatable causes, including undernourishment, a lack of safe drinking water, malaria, tuberculosis and AIDS. The only bright spot in America's policy on Africa is the president's emergency program to fight AIDS, which is distributing antiretroviral medicine to more than 200,000 Africans, with a target of two million by 2008. 
 The lessons are clear from that success story and others like it. Foreign aid should be targeted to specific, measurable, achievable and bold goals. Proven technologies such as antiretroviral medicines should be featured. Timetables should be prepared. The United States should help countries that are prepared to help themselves. Americans should be encouraged to understand the roots of the African crisis and its solution. Bipartisan support should be sought.
 Here then is how President Bush and Congress could quickly fix the broken strategy on Africa.
 First, agree with Tony Blair, and most of the world, to double overall aid to Africa, focusing on four interconnected priorities: growing more food, fighting disease, ensuring that children are in school and building critical infrastructure (including roads, energy services, water and sanitation). In the worldwide package, the contribution from the United States would rise from $3 billion this year to around $15 billion by 2010.
 Second, set quantitative targets based on the Millennium Development Goals as agreed to by the United States and all other countries. These goals keep everybody accountable. They can be used to monitor progress and make midcourse corrections. 
 Third, get the Millennium Challenge Corporation running on a serious level. The program was supposed to have disbursed $10 billion from 2003 to 2005, including $5 billion this year -- but it has disbursed almost nothing. It should focus on practical investments in the four priority areas, disbursing at least $8 billion a year by 2010, directed mainly to Africa. 
 Fourth, explain the truth to the American people about the small level of United States aid to Africa. Of the $3 billion or so in American assistance this year, most pays for emergency food aid and for American salaries. Aid for actual investments, such as fighting malaria and promoting safe drinking water, isn't very much. It translates to perhaps $1 of aid for each African and a $2 contribution per American. 
 Increased investments could make all the difference. With a private philanthropic contribution to a group of villages in Western Kenya, the Earth Institute at Columbia University has helped farmers use improved seed varieties and replenish their soil nutrients, leading to an approximate tripling of food output in just one growing season. With a scaled response, Africans could enjoy a 21st-century Green Revolution, tripling the continent's food yields and escaping the chronic cycles of hunger, poverty and disease. 
 Similarly, Africans could fight and control malaria, which claims around 200,000 lives a month. About $3 billion a year would support a mass distribution of medicines and long-lasting insecticide-treated bed nets. The United States could contribute $1 billion, amounting to a little more than $3 from each American a year. Former President Jimmy Carter could lead the task, given his record of success in helping Africa control other diseases.
 Aid could also help ensure that every poor child in Africa attends school. Increased financing could help end school fees, pay for more classrooms and teachers, buy school meals that contain locally produced foods and invest in water and power so women and children do not continue to spend their lives fetching water and wood for fuel. 
 Inaction by the United States will claim millions of lives and add to global instability. By joining the new worldwide effort to support Africa, Mr. Bush would honor America's longstanding but unmet commitments, our security interests and our nation's generosity.

HEADLINE: Guidant Says Flaw Is Found In More Types Of Heart Units

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER

 BODY:
The Guidant Corporation, already under scrutiny for delaying disclosures about flawed products, urged doctors yesterday to stop implanting its most sophisticated heart devices because of a fault that might cause some of the 40,000 units already implanted not to work properly.
 The move could have significant financial consequences for Guidant because it affects, for now, sales of many of the company's heart devices in the fastest-growing part of the market: advanced defibrillators that also act as pacemakers for both sides of the heart.
 Yesterday, the company's stock fell $4.70, or 6.85 percent, to $63.90 as investors grew nervous over the fate of Johnson & Johnson's plan to acquire Guidant for $25.4 billion.
 Analysts said they thought Johnson & Johnson would probably cut that price. They also said the deal's planned closing in the third quarter of this year might be delayed. They added that the products involved in yesterday's move appeared to account for a substantial percentage of Guidant's defibrillator sales. 
 Both Johnson & Johnson and Guidant had no comment and declined to make their top executives available for interviews. 
 The flaw at issue in yesterday's announcement involves a magnetic switch that becomes stuck in the off position. For patients, the flaw poses less of a risk than some defects affecting other Guidant devices, doctors said. However, they said users would have to see physicians so they could disable the problem component.
 As proposed partners, Johnson & Johnson and Guidant have provided very different case studies of corporate responses to product problems.
 Johnson & Johnson, based in New Brunswick, N.J., withdrew all bottles of its pain reliever, Tylenol, from store shelves in 1982 after reports of product tampering. The company won praise at the time for its quick response.
 Guidant's problems began in late May, when it was disclosed that the company, based in Indianapolis, had not told doctors for three years that one type of its defibrillators had repeatedly failed because of an electrical defect. A defibrillator emits an electrical jolt that shocks a chaotically beating heart back into rhythm.
 Since then, the device maker has been buffeted by bad publicity because it has been forced to make repeated announcements about other device-related defects. Late last week, under pressure from the Food and Drug Administration, Guidant recalled 50,000 defibrillators, with thousands of them at risk of potentially short-circuiting just when needed to produce a life-saving shock.
 ''One thing that distinguishes this recall from others is the time gap from when it was discovered and when it was disclosed,'' said Alexander Arrow, an industry analyst with Lazard. ''It points to a corporate response that looks inappropriate, so that it potentially has more staying power on the reputational level.''
 Yesterday's announcement by Guidant affects several models: the Contak Renewal 3; Contak Renewal 4; Contak Renewal 3 and 4 AVT; and the Renewal RF. The company said it had received four reports of flawed switches among the 40,000 units implanted.
 However, the financial impact on Guidant could be substantial, at least in the short term, because the affected models appear to involve many of the company's advanced defibrillators. The use of such devices, which cost about $25,000 each, is growing rapidly in part because Medicare has greatly increased the number of older patients for whom it will pay for such devices. The units are used in patients who are at risk of cardiac arrest and have other heart problems.
 Dr. Eric N. Prystowsky, a heart specialist at St. Vincent Hospital in Indianapolis and a Guidant consultant, said company officials alerted him late Thursday about yesterday's announcement and told him they would pull back all affected units that had not been implanted, a number the company put at 6,000. As a result, he said, he would be using other companies' units for the moment.
 The company did not say how it planned to fix the problem, when it expected to do so or how it would fix units already implanted in patients. If a significant change must be made in the way units are made, the change could require F.D.A. approval before Guidant could make new units.
 Dr. Prystowsky said that until the problem was fixed, Guidant technicians might have to be on hand when patients were prepared for surgery so the technicians could deal with the affected magnetic switch.
 Guidant does not break out its sales by model types, but last year, defibrillator sales accounted for nearly 50 percent of its revenue of $3.8 billion. Analysts said they thought the types of models involved in yesterday's alert, which are known as cardiac resynchronization therapy, or C.R.T., devices, made up 40 percent to 50 percent of its defibrillator sales.
 C.R.T. devices are the fastest-growing part of the defibrillator market, which is expanding 20 percent annually. Guidant's heart device division was a major attraction to Johnson & Johnson, which wants to expand its presence in the device business.
 Joanne Wuensch, an industry analyst with Harris Nesbitt, said she believed that the financial effect of the latest alert on Guidant would be relatively short-lived. But she said she thought Johnson & Johnson would soon cut the price it was offering for Guidant. As it stands, that deal is valued at $76 a share to Guidant holders.
 ''We estimate it is going to be about $68 a share, or about 10 percent down,'' she said. Mr. Arrow, the Lazard analyst, also downgraded Guidant on Monday.
 Johnson & Johnson did not respond to a request to interview its chief executive, William C. Weldon. Guidant declined a request to interview its chief executive, Ronald W. Dollens. Guidant also would not say what percentage of its defibrillator sales were affected by the faulty switch. 
 While Guidant's shares sank yesterday, shares of its two rivals, Medtronic and St. Jude Medical, both rose, apparently in anticipation that their market share would increase, at least in the short term. A Guidant spokeswoman said the company was ''ramping up'' manufacture of two other C.R.T. models, the Contak Renewal 1 and Contak Renewal 2.
 Dr. Prystowsky said he thought the company had moved quickly yesterday to halt implants of any further devices with the flawed switch, given the controversy after it did not alert doctors to an electrical flaw in one model. In that case, a college student who had been implanted with one of the flawed units died in March, three years after Guidant discovered and fixed the problem.
 ''They said we have heard everyone loud and clear,'' he said. ''We are willing to take the economic hit.''

HEADLINE: A City of Hard Knocks and Hardwood

BYLINE: By Paul Clemens. 
Paul Clemens is the author of the forthcoming ''Made in Detroit: A South of 8 Mile Memoir''

DATELINE: Detroit 

 BODY:
THIS city, which has endured its share of doozies, had nonetheless seen better days than May 5, when the credit ratings of General Motors and Ford were reduced to junk status by Standard and Poor's. Conventional wisdom says that when G.M. gets a cold, Detroit gets pneumonia.
 The rating announcement prompted my father -- who worked for years at shops that did subcontracting work for G.M., making our family prone to the periodic case of the sniffles -- to buy 500 shares of Ford stock. ''I like that it's a family company,'' he said. Hard upon his purchase, the stock rose a quarter a share. ''You just made a killing,'' I told him.
Bad news abounds. G.M. is planning to shed 25,000 workers and wants to re-negotiate the United Auto Workers contract. The city has a budget deficit in the hundreds of millions of dollars, and the possibility of receivership looms. Things are so bad that the mayor, Kwame Kilpatrick, threatened to cancel the annual fireworks display, which draws a million people to downtown, a spot not overburdened with foot traffic the rest of the year. 
 Detroit's rate of depopulation is such that the possibility of turning vacant tracts in the city into farmland has been floated, if only half-seriously. Michigan's unemployment rate is the nation's highest, its economy the nation's weakest. Gov. Jennifer Granholm, by way of warning, has taken to waving a copy of ''The World Is Flat,'' by Thomas L. Friedman -- the thesis of which is likely familiar to readers of this page. 
 So, for the two weeks they lasted, the National Basketball Association Finals were a blessed distraction from our woes.
 Basketball as a metaphor -- the games gesturing beyond themselves to something larger -- first occurred to me during the late 1980's, when I was in my early teens and the Detroit Pistons were still unable to get past the Larry Bird-led Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference Finals. It seems clear what those Celtics and their great triumvirate of Danny Ainge, Kevin McHale and Bird represented to me, correctly or not: white suburbia. As a white city kid, I lacked sympathy for such folk, and the Celtics struck me as smug, powerful and deeply deserving of a comeuppance. I cheered when I saw fans holding signs that said ''I Hate Danny Ainge.'' 
 Bird broke my heart repeatedly, never more so than in Game 5 of the 1987 Eastern Conference Finals. Do I need to mention The Steal? Isiah Thomas inbounds, and then Bird -- but I can't go on. I was a Catholic schoolboy, and I swore like a sailor. That night, like my savior at the tomb of Lazarus, I wept.
 That was 18 years ago, and my battle with both the suburbs and the Celtics is long over. The suburbs of Detroit now have more than three million residents, while the city itself has less than a million. I have contributed to this imbalance.
 Before Game 3 of this year's NBA Finals between the Pistons and the San Antonio Spurs, the announcer Al Michaels provided the national TV audience with the lay of the land: ''We're here at the Palace of Auburn Hills, about 30 minutes north of downtown Detroit.'' These days, everything in Detroit is 30 minutes north of Detroit. 
 Though I still read the sports section first, I have developed a grudging interest in the global economy -- about the increasing market shares for Toyota and Nissan, about Chinese factory workers, Indian computer whizzes and Polish plumbers. For these past two weeks, however, I was primarily concerned with the San Antonio Spurs and their mercurial French point guard, backed up by a Slovenian point guard; their sometimes dazzling Argentine shooting guard; their MVP big man from the Virgin Islands, backed up by a guy from Slovenia. (Aren't any of these guys from French Lick, Indiana?)Though the composition of professional sports teams bears no necessary relationship to the city they represent, these Pistons -- a blue-collar, African-American team with no marquee name -- are a perfect fit for Detroit. The Pistons have tried to internationalize, taking the Serbian Darko Milicic with the second pick in the 2003 draft. But Milicic, as Al Michaels put it the other night, is ''a human victory cigar'': he plays only during mop-up time. We just can't tune in to the flattening world around here. 
 Last Saturday, with the series tied 2-2 and the Pistons resurgent, I went to John King Books in downtown Detroit, about 30 minutes south of the Palace of Auburn Hills. It's hard to imagine anything more Old Economy than a four-story brick business covered in peeling paint and specializing in used and rare books. For every hour I've spent at King's, I've heard the same three-word phrase repeated to customers a dozen times: ''We're not computerized.'' The staff is unfailingly polite as they jot down the title and author before searching the shelves. Like any inefficiency owned up to, the store's not being computerized becomes a source of strength -- a selling point. There are treasures here, but you have to do some digging. This is true of much of Detroit.
 From King's fourth floor (Plays, Philosophy, Death & Dying), one can see, looking east, the peak of Detroit's tallest building, the Renaissance Center, a blue-and-white G.M. logo affixed to its top. Visible to the west, in the direction of the Ford Rouge plant -- once the planet's largest industrial complex -- are mile after mile of downriver smokestacks.
 Someday, perhaps, Toyota's name will be on a Detroit skyscraper, and a Nissan smokestack will be visible in the downriver distance. What's good for Toyota, Mr. Friedman implied recently, is good for America. He argued for G.M. to go bankrupt, and for Toyota to buy it out. On my way home, driving along Jefferson Avenue, I passed the Chrysler plant -- now the DaimlerChrysler plant -- that builds Jeep Cherokees. Maybe this is all a good thing. The Spurs' Frenchman, Tony Parker, and their Argentine, Manu Ginobili, seem like fine fellows. Their accents are charming, and lend their complaints to the referees an endearing air of immigrant pleading. I certainly found these Spurs more likable than the Celtics of yesteryear. 
 Even the Japanese car companies seem more companionable than they did in the Buy American 1980's. Toyota and Nissan record huge profits and pay workers well, without any unions demanding that they do so. Detroit's way in the world is fading, which is bad enough. Worse is the thought that it's hard to dislike those pushing us into the twilight. An air of inevitability has crept in. What are you going to do? We're not computerized. 
 When the Pistons lost Game 7 of the N.B.A. Finals on Thursday night -- down in a state, Texas, to which Michigan continues to lose population and House seats; in a city, San Antonio, where Toyota will open a $800-million plant next year; in an arena, the SBC Center, whose very name bespeaks New Economy greatness -- I didn't swear or weep. I won't even hold a grudge against the Spurs.
 It wasn't always thus. In the early 1990's, after the Celtics dynasty had been dismantled -- Ainge, for his part, had moved on to Phoenix -- a reconstituted Celtics team came to town. Up in the nosebleeds, a Pistons fan who couldn't let go held a sign: ''I Still Hate Danny Ainge.'' A beautiful sentiment, born of simpler times, back when basketball, at least, was still round.

HEADLINE: Everybody Out?

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
NEARLY two years ago, Alistair and Catherine Economakis became the owners of a six-story tenement building at 47-49 East Third Street, between First and Second Avenues, in the East Village. The building has 15 apartments, with tenants paying rents of $500 to $950 a month.
 Within weeks, the Economakises began notifying tenants that their leases would not be renewed, even though the apartments were rent stabilized, because the couple planned to live in the building with their infant son and take over all 11,600 square feet.
The notices said the new owners planned to renovate the building, which has a total of 60 rooms, to create five bedrooms, six bathrooms, a den, a playroom, a gym, a library, a study area, a dining room, a kitchen and a living room. 
 Under the law, landlords have the right to terminate the leases of rent-stabilized tenants if they plan to use the space for themselves. They must notify the tenants at least four months before their leases expire. 
 ''It needs to be remembered that an owner owns his or her building and has a constitutional right to reside in that property,'' said Sherwin Belkin, a landlord lawyer in Manhattan. ''A tenant, on the other hand, has a privilege to occupy. And rights are superior to privilege.''
 The tenants at 47-49 East Third Street are fighting hard against being evicted. ''We were absolutely stunned when we got the first nonrenewal notice,'' said Ursula Kinzel, the president of the tenants association. ''It was totally unbelievable that someone would get a 15-unit, rent-stabilized building in order to turn it into a private home. The natural thing would be to just go out and buy a house.''
 In November, four tenants in the East Third Street building who have not yet received nonrenewal notices filed suit in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, asserting that the Economakis plan violates the rent-stabilization law on the ground that the law never contemplated an owner taking over an entire building for personal use. ''The idea,'' said Stephen Dobkin, the lawyer for the tenants association, ''is to prevent the landlord from starting proceedings against these tenants while the judge decides whether it is legal for a landlord to try to get an entire tenement building for his own use.'' Acting State Supreme Court Justice Paul G. Feinman has not yet ruled in the case brought by the four tenants. 
 Tenant lawyers say they have seen increasing numbers of such cases as neighborhoods gentrify. But there is no way to determine if there has been an upsurge because no government agency monitors how many are filed or whether the owner or a family member actually occupies the apartment or apartments. State Supreme Court Justice Fern A. Fisher, the administrative judge for the city's Civil Court, which includes Housing Court, said the system's computers are not programmed to specify owner-occupancy cases. 
 The rent-stabilization law does state that an owner can claim one or more apartments for his or her personal use. ''I don't believe the law is vague,'' said Todd Rose, the lawyer for the Economakises. ''It says that the standard for recovering all the apartments in a building is the same standard employed by the courts if a landlord is going to seek only one apartment -- the landlord must prove that he has a good faith intention to live in the apartments.''
 But Andrew Scherer, the author of ''Residential Landlord-Tenant Law in New York'' (West Group, 2005), said: ''The size of the space that somebody claims they intend to live in must pass what lawyers call the 'giggle test' -- the notion that the claim is believable and will not cause a judge to start to giggle. The idea that someone would take 15 units with 60 rooms as a primary residence is absurd.''
 By law, said Mr. Scherer, who is also executive director of Legal Services for New York City, which represents poor people in civil cases, a building owner can recover an apartment or apartments for use by himself or herself, a spouse, a child or stepchild, a parent or stepparent, a parent-in-law, a sibling, a sibling-in-law, a grandparent or a grandchild. And the apartment must be occupied by the family member for at least three years. 
 Although there are no hard numbers, Mr. Scherer believes there has been an increase in owner-occupancy litigation in recent years, including several high-profile cases like the one on East Third Street in which landlords have attempted to empty entire buildings. ''Anecdotally, at least, it appears that owner-occupancy proceedings are becoming increasingly common,'' he said.
 Samuel J. Himmelstein, a tenant lawyer in Manhattan, said he has handled 75 to 100 owner-occupancy cases in the last eight years. Previously, Mr. Himmelstein said, most of his cases involved claims by landlords that tenants were not using the apartment as their primary residences. But two to three years ago, he said, owner-occupancy proceedings became the bulk of his caseload.
 The litigation over 47-49 East Third Street, which has five residential floors over one commercial, may help answer the question of how many apartments an owner can recover.
 During pretrial depositions, Mr. Economakis testified that the only permanent residents would be himself, his wife and their infant son, but that they hoped to have other children. 
 In an interview, Mr. Economakis, a real estate management consultant, said, ''Absolutely, I intend to make 47 East Third Street my home for my family.'' He said he had offered to post a bond to assure that he would occupy the building, ''and, to date, we have never had one response from the tenants to our proposals on how we can guarantee our good faith.''
 The Economakises, who had been partners with 12 other people in a corporation that owned the building, would not disclose how much they had paid for the property in August 2003, after the corporation was reorganized under federal bankruptcy laws. By law only an individual owner, not a business entity, can recover an apartment or apartments for personal use.They decided to live in the building, Mr. Economakis said, after looking for a new home and finding nothing that appealed to them. ''When my wife became pregnant, we began looking for a home,'' he said. ''It is at that point it dawned on me that we already own a building. Once we decided to make this building our home, quite frankly there was nothing else that compared.'' 
 Mr. Economakis said the tenants have refused to meet with him. ''I believe my wife and I have approached this whole process with sensitivity and respect for the tenants affected,'' he said. 
 Mr. Dobkin said, however, that he and several members of the tenants association did meet with the Economakises. ''We've listened to their settlement proposals,'' he said, ''which always involve all the tenants giving up their apartments, which is something that the tenants will not do.''
 The fight has taken its toll on the tenants, many of whom have lived in the building for decades, and who were planning a rally in front of the building on June 25 to call attention to such battles. ''It's pretty much been a nightmare, the insecurity,'' Ms. Kinzel said. ''It's really turning our lives upside down.''
 ''I wake up around 4 in the morning and I can't sleep,'' she said. ''My thoughts are just turning around. How are we going to sustain the legal bills?'' So far, the 11 tenants represented by Mr. Dobkin have paid equal shares of the approximately $85,000 in legal fees. 
 ''Should we lose, where are we going to go?'' Ms. Kinzel asked. ''We'll probably have to leave Manhattan.''
 There is no precise way to determine whether landlords or tenants tend to prevail in owner-occupancy litigation. But of the 75 to 100 cases that Mr. Himmelstein has handled in the last eight years, he said, about one-fourth resulted in the landlord losing on procedural grounds. Almost all of the others, he said, were settled, with the tenants moving out after receiving payments of at least $10,000 (and, in six cases, more than $200,000). In a Brooklyn case not handled by Mr. Himmelstein, five of six tenants facing eviction received rent waivers or settlements of up to $6,500. 
 There were, however, no settlements in a convoluted case, won by three Manhattan tenants last year, in which the legal standard that the owner prove his intention to occupy the apartments was sorely tested.
 In that case, Mr. Himmelstein originally represented four tenants at 450 West 57th Street, where the landlord, Abe Haruvi, sought to recover all of their apartments so that he and his wife could create a 6,000-square-foot quadriplex. (For technical reasons, the Haruvis soon dropped one of the four cases.)
 During the trial, Mr. Himmelstein demonstrated that the Haruvis had a long history of owner-occupancy petitions. ''Other than the four at 450 West 57th Street,'' he said, ''there had been six prior owner-use cases commenced by the Haruvis in three other buildings.''
 In three of those earlier cases, the Haruvis simultaneously sought, in 1996, three apartments in different buildings for the same family member, Mr. Himmelstein said. In one of those cases, he said, ''they actually recovered possession, but never moved into the building and subsequently re-rented the apartment at a destabilized rent of at least $4,000.''
 Since then, the Haruvis have brought two other owner-use cases, he said, ''and in only one case did a family member, a daughter, actually take occupancy.''
 In her April 2004 ruling denying the Haruvi eviction requests at 540 West 57th Street, Judge Maria Milin of Housing Court wrote that the Haruvis had ''engaged in a pattern of commencing meritless owner-occupancy proceedings.'' 
 In a written statement read by his lawyer, Bruce H. Lederman, Mr. Haruvi said, in part: ''We strongly disagree with Judge Milan's decision. We believe she drew the wrong conclusion from completely lawful and proper actions on our part.''
 Mr. Haruvi pointed out that his brother, Arthur, had offered to post a $1 million bond to guarantee that the family would occupy the three recently sought apartments, at 450 West 57th Street. The prior owner-occupancy cases, Mr. Haruvi wrote, ''were dismissed for very technical reasons, or prior cases were settled or abandoned because of changed circumstances in the years it takes to go to trial.''
 ''The fact that we have kept trying unsuccessfully to enforce our rights to live in homes in property we own has been unfairly held against us,'' he wrote.
 Notable owner-occupancy cases are not restricted to Manhattan. In a four-story, 20-unit building in Borough Park, Brooklyn, six tenants received nonrenewal notices from the landlord, Harry Stern, in late 2003 and early 2004, so that Mr. Stern could give apartments to his two sons, two daughters, his wife's sister and her brother, even though four apartments were already vacant.
 Since then, said Irene Ginsburg, the Legal Services lawyer who represented one of the six tenants at the building, at 973 47th Street, the case against her client was dropped. But the other five, Ms. Ginsburg said, accepted settlements giving them varying combinations of a delayed move-out date, a rent waiver until they had to move out or a payment of $5,000 to $6,500.
 Two other apartments in the building became vacant after Mr. Stern sued the tenants on grounds other than owner-occupancy. ''So, that's a total of 11 apartments vacated in a 20-apartment building,'' Ms. Ginsburg said.
 ''To our knowledge,'' she continued, ''of the five apartments that the landlord obtained under owner-use, two have gone to new tenants who are not family members; one has gone to the landlord's daughter, who already lived in the building but expanded into the next apartment; a fourth apartment is still being renovated; and the fifth apartment, the tenant hasn't left yet.''
 Pointing out that the landlord also obtained six other apartments on grounds other than owner's use, Ms. Ginsburg said she wondered, ''If his family members needed to move into the building, why didn't he give those other apartments to his family?''
 Mr. Stern's lawyer, Scott Gross, said: ''Each and every owner's-use case brought by my client was settled amicably without the need for a formal trial. In each situation, my client has complied with his obligations under the rent-stabilization laws, and continued to comply with these laws.''
 Asked how many of Mr. Stern's family members have moved into the building, Mr. Gross said he had to check with his client, but then did not respond to four telephone messages.

HEADLINE: Mean Girls

BYLINE: By Marilyn Stasio

 BODY:
Here's a serious question: Where do regional authors go when they want to get out of town? Laura Lippman, who saturates her Baltimore mysteries in the vivid colorations of that quirky city, takes herself to a much darker and scarier place -- high school -- in TO THE POWER OF THREE (Morrow, $24.95). Unlike her Tess Monaghan series, which rambles freely over the urban landscape, this ambitious suspense story stays tightly focused on Glendale High School, a big school in suburban Maryland rocked by a school shooting. 
 ''I wouldn't characterize it so much as a school shooting, '' the principal protests, ''but as a shooting at the school. '' However this prissy administrator tries to crunch the facts, three seniors who had been best friends since grade school went into a girls' bathroom and one of them fired a gun. When the police arrive they find Kat Hartigan (''most popular, first in her class, prom queen'') dead, Perri Kahn (''the drama queen'') mortally wounded and Josie Patel (''the little hanger-on'') bleeding and in shock. 
 As the only witness, Josie is closely interrogated by Sgt. Harold Lenhardt, a decent family-guy cop who is sensitive to the feelings of the victims and their families, but uneasy about crime scene evidence -- shot angles, a missing shoe, bloodstains that go in the wrong direction -- that contradicts Josie's version of events. Lenhardt is a kind but unrelenting hound, and his persistence gives the book its grip. 
 But what Lippman is really going for here is an analysis of teenage friendship and how cultural pressures can twist it into something so ugly it becomes lethal. She shows great empathy for the smart, fiercely independent Perri, the desperate-to-please Josie, and a few students like Eve Muhly, the ''redneck'' farmer's child whose need for acceptance makes her the perfect victim for vicious peer pranks. Eve might not be in the same social league as Kat, but she carries herself far more believably than that shadowy ideal girl, and whenever she's on the scene, the ritual cruelties of high school take on a savage sting.
 After a while, though, Glendale's airless atmosphere begins to feel as stifling to the reader as it does to the sons and daughters of the town. No matter how hard she tries (and in dragging out an involving but less than suspenseful story to more than 400 pages, she is really pushing it), Lippman can't make the burghers of this affluent suburb anything more than what they are, which is dull. Even the young guidance counselor who represents the minority of enlightened thinkers is boring. With the exception of maybe a pig farmer and some really nasty girls on the school bus, the folks in Glendale would never make it on the streets of Baltimore.
 They're old, they're cranky, and they have chaotic work habits that invariably lead to disaster. But life always seems livelier whenever Arthur Bryant and John May are on a case for the London Peculiar Crimes Unit, the fanciful agency that Christopher Fowler dreamed up in ''Full Dark House'' (2004) to keep this unorthodox sleuthing team occupied. Faced with another bizarre case in THE WATER ROOM (Bantam, $24), the partners polish up the eccentricities that make them so endearing, while taking us into areas of London rarely seen by the light of day.
 Bryant, described as ''literate and secretive, with a sidelong, crafty mind,'' has taken an interest in the lost rivers that still run beneath the city. ''It seems there are entrances and exits to rivers all over London,'' he tells May. His partner, ''an attractive senior of considerable charisma,'' is more curious about the behavior of an academic friend who is obsessively mapping the subterranean pathways of these forgotten tributaries. Their interests converge in a horrid way when an elderly woman is discovered dead in her home -- her body seated upright in a chair, fully dressed and dry as a bone -- with her mouth filled with brackish Thames water. The plot isn't designed to make sense but to draw us into an imaginative funhouse of a world where sage minds go to expand their vistas and sharpen their wits. 
 With each mystery in her subtly developing series featuring Clare Fergusson, an Episcopal priest who left behind a rather more exciting career as an Army helicopter pilot to take up the ministry of a tiny town in the New York Adirondacks, Julia Spencer-Fleming presents a more complex view of the interdependent nature of life in rural communities like Millers Kill. The bishop is paying his annual visit to St. Alban's Church in TO DARKNESS AND TO DEATH (Thomas Dunne/St. Martin's Minotaur, $23.95), but Clare drops the trays of finger food and rushes to join the search and rescue team when Millie van der Hoeven, whose family owns a 250,000-acre estate in Adirondack State Park, is reported missing in the woods. 
 Thanks to Millie and other local environmentalists, the huge ''camp'' is about to be signed over to a local conservancy group that in the byzantine ways of such land transfers has partnered up with a multinational wood-products corporation that has already withdrawn timber rights from all the small pop-and-son logging companies making up the local economy. And while I don't mean to throw a wet blanket on a book that includes a delicate love story (between Clare and the married chief of police); a thrilling plot that involves murder, kidnapping and considerable brutality; and some gorgeous autumnal scenes in the Adirondack woods, the narrative really turns on the inside story of the logging industry in Millers Kill. Spencer-Fleming writes with grace and clarity about the environmental ideal of turning tracts of developed land back to their natural wilderness state. But she shows even more sensitivity in depicting the human cost when those complicated root systems that connect people to their communities are yanked out from under them.

HEADLINE: Worry. But Don't Stress Out.

BYLINE: By HENRY FOUNTAIN

 BODY:
THE theft of computer data at an Arizona company that put as many as 40 million credit card accounts at risk for fraud may have been the largest case of stolen consumer information yet. 
 But the incident, which was revealed last week and may have occurred months ago, surely will not be the last. In fact, the theft was only the latest in a series of incidents, not all of which involved criminal activity. Earlier this month, for example, United Parcel Service lost data tapes with personal information on nearly four million customers of Citigroup. 
The problem of keeping data secure ''exists on lots and lots of levels,'' said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington. ''You begin to see that the United States has an enormous problem that is spiraling out of control.''
 And like seismologists who can look at smaller tremors and know that a major quake is in the offing, consultants and others who study data security and identity theft can confidently predict that more trouble is ahead.
 The question, for them, is one of magnitude, whether there will be the electronic equivalent of the Big One, an incident so widespread, compromising so much personal information, that it devastates the system of financial transactions that underpins the consumer economy.
 Security experts acknowledge that while there will continue to be breaks in security, such a catastrophe is unlikely. Instead, they say, the threat is more insidious and gradual and involves more than just money, as other information like medical records are digitized and stored electronically.
 ''The long-term danger is extraction of self,'' Mr. Rotenberg said. ''That others know more about you than you know about yourself.''
 From a financial standpoint, the 40 million accounts at risk in the most recent theft may sound like the Big One. Yet officials with Visa, MasterCard and the Tucson, Ariz., company where the theft occurred, CardSystems Solutions, were quick to point out that the records known to be stolen involved about 200,000 accounts. And even 40 million is a tiny fraction of the billions of credit cards issued worldwide. 
 For all their high-tech nature, crimes involving electronic data can be very labor intensive. Account information may be stolen in bulk with a few efficient lines of software code, but they are sold in much smaller numbers to other criminals who withdraw money or buy goods one transaction at a time, and usually only for a short period until the fraudulent activity is detected. 
 ''Does anybody seriously think that a group of thieves are going to steal money from 40 million accounts?'' asked Clifford Stoll, a former security consultant and author of ''Cuckoo's Egg: Tracking a Spy Through the Maze of Computer Espionage.'' 
 Instead of a single devastating event, a more likely outcome, many security experts say, is that smaller data thefts will continue, with a gradual nibbling away at confidence in the system. Some consumers may become more wary of electronic commerce.
 ''My guess is that there will continue to be a lot of low-level crime,'' said Bruce Schneier, an influential security expert. ''But when grandmas start losing money, Congress will have to do something.''
 Specialists in data security have long thought that protections were inadequate. Edward Tenner, a columnist for Technology Review and the author of ''Why Things Bite Back,'' recalls speaking at security conferences nearly a decade ago ''where the risk of identity theft was already considered severe.'' 
 Data thefts and accidental losses have always occurred, Mr. Tenner said. What has changed is that there is now a law in California requiring companies to inform consumers when their information is breached. 
 Rebecca Bace, president of Infidel, a security consulting firm in Scotts Valley, Calif., said the law represented a fundamental change. ''You no longer have the prerogative of hiding that you've been hacked,'' she said. ''People knew it was bad, but no one adequately predicted the visceral impact of seeing the number and severity of cases that have occurred.''
 Ms. Bace said that the cumulative effect of such incidents might be that some people, particularly those who are already anxious about their financial situation, become more wary of electronic transactions. Reports of data thefts, she said, ''make people a little more loath to take the chance.''
 Fewer transactions would have a financial impact on the industry, which functions on volume, making a small amount of money on each of a huge number of transactions. ''Any appreciable drop off is going to cost people a lot of money,'' Ms. Bace said.
 Mr. Tenner said that if security problems become overwhelming, the government could revamp the Social Security numbering system. New security measures, like retinal scans and other so-called biometric markers, are already being tested. 
 ''Right now it is very easy to get somebody's identity,'' said Eugene H. Spafford, executive director of the Center for Education and Research in Information Assurance and Security at Purdue University. ''Plus there is a low threshold for authentication.'' To use someone else's credit card, for instance, all that is needed is the number, name, expiration date and, possibly, the three-digit security code. (In the CardSystems case, all that information was stolen.)
 What may be additionally required, Mr. Spafford said, are stronger authenticators like so-called digital wallets, which contain all the data needed for transactions in encrypted form. 
 Some experts argue that protecting personal data is a hopeless task, that the emphasis should be on making transactions more secure.''Making information harder to use is the key,'' Mr. Schneier said. ''Making it harder to steal is a dead end.''
 ONE problem is that there currently is little financial incentive to improve security for transactions. ''Credit card companies are putting the cost of fraud on the merchants, who put it on us the cardholders,'' Mr. Spafford said. A governmental role may be necessary, he said.
 Whatever the improvements, few experts envision a complete solution. ''Any security measures are at best only buying time,'' Mr. Tenner said. ''It's really like the development of antibiotics -- they are always trying to stay ahead of the problem.''
 ''For the optimist, this can go on indefinitely,'' he added. ''For the pessimist, it's like the man who jumped out of the 20th floor of a building. As he passed the 10th floor he said, 'So far, so good.'''

HEADLINE: It Was Built. They Are Coming.

BYLINE: By HARLAN J. LEVY

 BODY:
WHEN state lawmakers authorized spending $267 million more than five years ago to build the new, glass-dominated Connecticut Convention Center, a study then predicted that in its first year it would hold 167 events bringing in 192,000 people.
 Optimists predicted more.
Now, four years after breaking ground and almost a month after the opening of the 540,000-square-foot center in Hartford, the optimists appear to be right.
 Even though the 22-story, 409-room Marriott hotel connected to the center will not open until August, solid and tentative bookings for the center, the largest meeting space between Boston and New York, are already 20 percent ahead of what was predicted in that 2000 study.
 Convention center officials are now projecting 200 national, regional and local conventions, trade shows and meetings in the first year, with 250,000 visitors expected, including stamp collectors, fencers and math teachers, Shriners, Asian-American hotel owners and two Muslim groups. 
 Fred V. Carstensen, a University of Connecticut economist and author of the 2000 study, had thought that the center would not produce the economic benefit to justify the state's investment.
 ''I'm delighted,'' he said about the bookings. ''I was concerned whether they would be able to achieve even the forecasted level that the funding was based on, because nationally there has been a modest decline in the demand for convention space.''
 By July 3, the center will have attracted an estimated 35,000 people and been host to 28 events, said Kathleen Blint, communications director of the center. On opening day, June 2, 10,000 people attended the Connecticut Xpo 2005 for Business trade show and on July 3 there will be 7,000 members of the Islamic Circle of North America and the Muslim American Society.
 In September, the International Christian Education Association is coming, followed by the Federal Highway Administration. Then the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics comes in October, before the National Science Teachers Association convention.
 ''We have booked 11 citywide conventions and trade shows averaging 3.3 days and 1,200 people, and we're in final negotiations with 14 similar events, 57 other consumer shows, banquets, meetings and weddings with signed agreements and deposits, and we're under negotiations with an additional 75 events,'' said Jeanne O'Grady, the center's sales director. ''We're on target, and we're aggressively booking.''
 In the first year, officials expect visitors to stay an average of 3.6 days and spend $266 a day, for a total of $58 million. That will generate about $13 million in net state tax revenues.
 Still, not everything is rosy. Days after the center opened, the Legislature, as part of an effort to trim the state budget, cut the center's marketing and transportation funds by 22 percent. And growth in the number of conventions and trade shows has slowed while competition among convention centers has increased.
 Michael Hughes, associate editor and director of research of Tradeshow Week, an industry publication, said demand for space was not keeping up with a supply -- including that in New England -- that is expanding. 
 ''Connecticut is entering an extremely competitive industry,'' Mr. Hughes said. ''There has been a significant building boom in convention space over the last 20 years, and the boom is continuing. There's a significant amount of properties marketing to a relatively fixed number of events.'' 
 The budget cut came as more of a surprise. Less than a week after the convention center's June 2 opening -- touted by the governor and state lawmakers as the key to a new era of prosperity -- those same officials made cuts that shrunk the center's 2006 marketing and transportation budget to $4.7 million from $6 million. As a result, the center canceled a bus service that would shuttle guests to and from downtown hotels and stops in between.
 ''It's foolish and simply bizarre,'' Mr. Carstensen said. ''The whole point of the circulator is to make the whole downtown accessible to visitors, and they've undermined that.''
 Also, the first year's $2.4 million marketing budget dropped to $2 million.
 ''The state just made a huge investment in this building,'' said Dean Pagani, the spokesman of the Capital City Economic Development Authority. ''It just seems ironic that just as the building is opening and attempting to put its best foot forward that we are going to have to reduce marketing efforts.''
 H. Scott Phelps, the president of the Convention and Visitors Bureau, said the moves were frustrating. 
 ''We've put the convention center and Hartford on the map, and we really need to build on that momentum and not go backward,'' he said.
 Gov. M. Jodi Rell proposed cutting the convention center's funds by $500,000, but there was one proposal to trim the budget by $2.3 million. After negotiations, the budget was reduced by $1.3 million.
 "The governor was very concerned with the consequence on the future of the convention center,'' said Dennis Schain, the spokesman for Mrs. Rell. ''She stressed the need to restore that funding, and she did manage to get a significant portion of it put back."
 The biggest challenge is the increasing competition. Between July 2004 and June 2005, nine new convention centers opened, Connecticut's being the largest. There are convention centers in Providence, R.I., and Worcester, Mass., and the MassMutual Center in Springfield, Mass., is scheduled to open in October. And 13 others will complete expansions, including the Springfield Civic Center.
 The keys to faring well are product differentiation and brand building, said Brian Whiting, head of the Providence Convention and Visitors Bureau. ''Those that are lacking are falling by the wayside and are really, really starting to struggle to attract business.''
 Mr. Hughes said the Connecticut center's advantage was that it has more than 40 percent more space than Providence and Worcester, and three times the space that will open in Springfield.
 The Hartford center -- as long as three football fields and as wide as a football field and a half -- features a 140,000-square-foot exhibit hall that can hold 800 trade-show booths, a 40,000-square-foot ballroom, 16 meeting rooms and a glass-enclosed atrium 10 stories high. 
 With 1,600 rooms among six hotels, the center also has more accommodations within walking distance than Providence (1,500 rooms), Springfield (1,100) and Worcester (473). 
 While 1,600 rooms are adequate for regional conventions, they aren't enough to get large national shows.
 ''The lack of major convention hotels right in the downtown area is our greatest weakness,'' said Michael Van Parys, vice president of the Greater Hartford Convention and Visitors Bureau. ''We have to go to numerous hotels in order to fill large convention blocks of 600-plus rooms.''
 The Hartford center has a definite size advantage over Worcester's, said James E. Rooney, executive director of the Massachusetts Convention Center Authority. ''It will be a tough challenge. Hartford as a city probably has greater name recognition within the convention and meetings community.''
 There are enough events for both without cutting into each other's business, Mr. Rooney said. ''Both have potential for different reasons. Do I believe they both can succeed? Yes, with the right execution.''
 Connecticut's convention center has ''excellent demographics,'' Mr. Hughes said, with 23 million people living within a two-hour drive and easy accessibility to major highways and an international airport only 12 miles away. ''Event planners will value the abilityto reach those demographics,'' he said. ''That's its main selling point and strength.''
 That factor and the convention center's size is attracting conventions that previously passed on Connecticut because of the lack of space. The 1,500 members of the National Music Educators Association and 30 invited school performing groups are coming to Hartford for three days in March 2007 for their Eastern Division biennial conference. This year, the conference was in Baltimore. In 2003, Providence was host to it. Philadelphia, Boston, Hartford, Buffalo and New York City vied for the 2007 prize, said Margaret Jamborsky, director of meetings and conventions.
 ''It came down to Philadelphia and Hartford,'' she said. Why Hartford?
 ''Affordability and location, location, location,'' she said. ''It's absolutely dead center in our eastern division. But price was probably the biggest factor, and size. We didn't have the option of coming to Hartford before the convention center was built.''

HEADLINE: Saving a Career Threatened by 9/11

BYLINE: By Joseph P. Fried. 
This column about the local economy appears every other week. E-mail address: homefront@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
BECAUSE of a leg injury she suffered while on duty, Myrna Franceschis was forced to retire prematurely as a New York City police officer, a job she loved. 
 But her 12 years on the force gave her an advantage in building a new career -- and in saving it when the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks threatened to end it just as it was taking off.
 Ms. Franceschis, 44, is the owner of a Brooklyn travel agency that she bought in August 2001, after working for it for five years. The business, Monteli Travel in Park Slope, was the second travel agency she had worked for, having started in the business as a part-time agent in early 1995, while still on the police force. 
 ''I wanted to earn a little cash on the side,'' she said recently. ''Other cops do security work'' when moonlighting. ''I didn't find it interesting to stand around inside a department store.'' 
 While on the police force, Officer Franceschis patrolled the East Side of Manhattan, worked undercover in a public morals unit in Upper Manhattan, and served in a squad that policed Midtown street vendors. She was injured while helping to remove food carts from a street in 1995.
 ''I slipped off the truck and twisted my ankle and tore ligaments,'' she said. ''I had nerve damage and damage to my leg, and I couldn't run.'' She retired with a disability pension in 1997. 
 ''I was devastated,'' she said. ''If I didn't get hurt, I would have been there forever.'' In any case, she said, at 37 she was ''not ready to retire'' from all work. 
 She had already increased her hours with the travel agency while recuperating, working from her Brooklyn home. Much of her work involved arranging group trips for police officers and their families. 
 ''I would find out if they were planning an outing for the command,'' and make the arrangements, Ms. Franceschis said. ''A lot of bus trips to Atlantic City, trips to the Jersey Shore, to Disney World.'' 
 She moved to Monteli in 1996, and when the owners decided to sell it in 2001, she bought it for $20,000. ''They wanted out bad,'' she said. The deal closed in August 2001.
 After the terrorist attacks weeks later, travel plunged worldwide.
 ''For the first few weeks after 9/11, our only business was from people who wanted to get out of the city, buying one-way tickets,'' she recalled. ''We were lucky some weeks if we made $50 in commissions.'' Other travel agencies in the area closed.
 Over all, the impact of 9/11 was less significant in terms of the decline in the number of travel agencies in the country than in the total volume of business that agencies did, said one expert, Allan Muten, director of corporate communications for the Airlines Reporting Corporation. The organization facilitates dealings between airlines and American travel agencies. 
 He said total sales by all agencies had been growing before 9/11, and plunged afterward. But the decrease in the number of agencies had already been under way before the attacks, which furthered the slide, Mr. Muten said. He cited factors like the airlines' reduction or elimination of agents' commissions on ticket sales in the 1990's.
 He said it was hard to say how the Internet had affected the business, because while online booking has cut the use of agents, many travelers rely on them to help wade through the mass of information online.
 In her storefront on Fifth Avenue near 13th Street in Park Slope, Ms. Franceschis focused on survival after 9/11.
 She obtained a $40,000 disaster loan from the federal Small Business Administration. Her husband, Frank Rivera, left his job at his father's liquor store to work at his wife's agency, whose four employees had departed when business dried up. He is still there.
 And Ms. Franceschis again capitalized on her old connections. Cruise lines and amusement park operators began offering deep discounts to police officers, firefighters and other emergency workers who had responded to the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. 
 ''I went to ground zero, telling them these programs were available,'' she said. ''I faxed fliers to every command.'' Making the arrangements for those who were interested began the revival of Monteli. 
 The agency showed red ink in 2002 and 2003, but last year more than $800,000 in sales generated about $75,000 in commissions and, after expenses, about $20,000 in profit, she said. She expects better numbers this year.
 But numbers apart, ''I still have my store,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Their Unexpected Adolescence

BYLINE: By Jonathan Dee. 
Jonathan Dee is a novelist and a contributing writer for the magazine. His last article was about Christian video games.

 BODY:
When Dr. Elaine Abrams founded the Family Care Center at Harlem Hospital Center, one of New York's first clinics for the treatment of children with H.I.V. and AIDS, that ''treatment'' consisted mostly of easing their deaths. Through the early 90's, 10 to 20 babies were dying at F.C.C. every year; at one point, an H.I.V.-infected patient lived to the age of 6, and the doctors considered that child a medical miracle. Today -- thanks to protease inhibitors, combination therapy and other improvements in the treatment of the virus -- the average age of the approximately 135 H.I.V.-infected children being treated at F.C.C. is 13 and rising. It's possible to imagine the day when the clinic itself will be obsolete. ''Over the years,'' Abrams says, ''we've turned from a medical program with mental-health support to a mental-health program with medical support. It's the last leg of the journey.'' 
 But that last leg has involved psychological complexities no one could have foreseen. Children born with the virus also aren't born with the knowledge that they carry it; this was a nonissue when few survived infancy, but as their prognosis improved, the whole issue of disclosure -- of what they know about their own disease, and who tells them, and when, and how -- began to reveal its intricacies. ''I used to believe that all the kids knew,'' Abrams says. She tells of one 14-year-old who knew all about T-cell counts and taking meds but had never contemplated being H.I.V.-positive. ''The kid had been taking these drugs every day for three years without knowing,'' Abrams says.
 The fact is, they often don't know, and it isn't a simple thing to tell them. Over the last decade, the revolution in medical treatment of H.I.V. has created a generation of young people whose unexpected maturation is both a miracle and an extraordinary challenge. According to Claude Mellins, co-founder and co-director of the Special Needs Clinic at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia hospital in New York, about 70 percent of her young patients with H.I.V. do know their status by the time they're 10 or 11. Still, from the outside, the idea that any H.I.V.-infected child -- that other 30 percent -- could reach adolescence without knowing he or she has the disease threatens to beggar belief. For starters, the children have usually spent most of their lives taking several different drugs several times a day, drugs notorious for their foul taste and vicious gastrointestinal side effects. Many of them have spent time in the hospital, a setting in which the likelihood of their overhearing a diagnosis of their own disease by accident is high. How can they not know? How can their parents justify not telling them? And what happens when a child finds out?
The walls of A.'s living room are covered with framed photographs of her six children and stepchildren -- most of them school portraits in the familiar three-quarter pose, forming a kind of time-lapse of their youth -- and to look at them, you would never know which child was the chronically ill one. But then to look at A., an attractive young mother, soft-spoken and articulate, you wouldn't know that she has been, like the second of her four boys, H.I.V.-positive for more than a decade. It is so easy, in fact, to conceal her son's H.I.V. status that she has successfully kept it a secret from nearly everyone: her friends and neighbors, her other children and even, amazing as it seems, from the boy himself. Infected in the womb, he has taken medication nearly every day of his life and has never really been told why. She points out his picture on the paneled wall. He is 11.
 ''I have not yet discussed it with him,'' she says. ''He's sweet, but he's still a little immature, and I don't think he's ready to handle it. His siblings either. I don't think that they would understand right now. I'm planning on trying to disclose to him at the beginning of next school year. He's very popular in school. It'll be hard for him if people find out. Not only do I have to be careful of maybe he might blame me for his illness, but people might treat him bad because he has it.''
 A. lives with her husband and children in a dark, toy-strewn, spacious apartment in the South Bronx. Her own health is very good, though she was asleep when I arrived -- the aftermath of one of the migraine headaches that have begun plaguing her lately, whether from her medication or from some other, perhaps stress-related cause, she isn't sure.
 ''We've done very well for the last 11 years hiding it,'' she told me. The ''we'' refers to her husband, who is H.I.V.-positive as well. ''It's difficult, because I'm running back and forth to the hospital. I'm always in an appointment; my husband is in an appointment. We tell the other kids when my son is taking his meds to leave the room, because they ask questions. Why does he have to take medicine? Why does he always get sick? Why does he see Dr. Champion and I don't?'' Susan Champion is a pediatrician at the Family Care Center, which provides complete medical and mental-health treatment for children with H.I.V. and their families. They do everything for these children except the one thing that by law they are barred from doing without the parents' explicit consent, and that is to disclose to children the reason they are at the Family Care Center in the first place. 
 When A.'s son asks questions -- which he does -- she tells him he has a blood disease, which, as she points out, is not untrue. ''I'm terrified of people knowing,'' she says, ''very terrified even for myself. No one knows. My brother is the only one in my family that knows. Not my dad, not my sisters, my stepmom, no one.'' What is she most worried about? ''The simple things, you know. If it's not the sympathy, it's the pushing away. It's either one or the other. You either get the sympathy, or you get the boot. No one wants to be bothered. No one wants to touch you -- don't come over here, don't get nowhere near her, you know. And that's what I'm afraid of for my boy with the other kids, because kids are cruel. And there are a lot of parents that are cruel too.''
 There are two issues here, of course: 1) what's best for the long-term physical and mental health of A.'s son as he grows older and inevitably more aware that an enormous secret has been kept from him; and 2) the prospect of a happy, charismatic, handsome young boy approaching the age of sexual activity who has H.I.V. and doesn't know it.
 And then there is a separate and, within some families, greater concern: that the child, once in possession of the family secret, will not prove adept at keeping it from those outside the family. One study found that 45 percent of children, upon being told they had H.I.V., were also told that they were not allowed to share that information with anyone else, period. Charging them with the responsibility of keeping such a secret ratchets up the stress level for everyone involved.
 ''To tell you the truth, I'm not ready,'' A. says. ''I think it's more me than him. Maybe he can understand. You know, the doctors are like, 'O.K., are you talking to him about it?' Once in a while we discuss things. I'm not so much scared that he'll blame me, because if he does, it is my fault, because I should have been tested. It was only because I had unprotected sex. It's not like I was shooting up drugs and things like that. But at the time, we weren't very educated about what could happen. I'm afraid that he won't feel like he's the same as everybody else. He thinks he's a little teenager. He's into the music, the TV, into girls and wrestling. And I think if I tell him, he won't feel the same. I think he'll be a different person. And I don't want him to change. I want him to always be himself.'' 
 At the end of our conversation, footsteps came crashing down the hallway, and her son walked into the living room. We were introduced, and he nodded shyly. He is poised between impish and handsome. It was not so very long ago that to meet such an 11-year-old boy would have been unimaginable.
By 1990, as many as 2,000 children nationwide were being born perinatally infected -- that is, infected in the womb -- with H.I.V. Few were expected to live more than two or three years. (Recent news reports have raised the possibility that in the 1980's and into the early 90's, AIDS drugs were tested on foster children in New York City, and elsewhere, without adequate precautions.) By 1994, a major study was under way to determine whether the relatively new AIDS drug AZT, if administered to H.I.V.-positive pregnant mothers, would influence in any way the transmission rate of the virus to their unborn children; the results were so immediate and decisive that the tests were unblinded, and AZT therapy was made generally available. With the new treatment, the so-called vertical transmission rate was reduced from roughly 25 percent to 8 percent. Since then, a host of factors -- including the adoption of recommendations against breast-feeding -- have combined to all but eliminate vertical H.I.V. transmission. Women who have been H.I.V.-positive for a decade or more can, with early and consistent drug treatment, bear children with very little risk of transmitting the disease. The transmission rate is now 1 percent to 2 percent, which translates to about 200 H.I.V.-infected infants born each year nationwide. In New York City in 2003, the total number of perinatal H.I.V. transmissions was five. Harlem Hospital has had just two in the last four years.
 And the advances in the medical treatment of H.I.V. wrought a similar change in the lives of the perinatally infected themselves. By 1999, the life span for children infected in the womb ranged from 8.6 to 13 years; today that life span -- provided the children stay on their drug regimens -- is open-ended, and their illness has turned strikingly from terminal to chronic. Though this can be viewed only as a blessing, it is simultaneously true that these children tended to be raised with little thought of preparing them for an independent adulthood that seemed not just unlikely but also out of the question. ''I spoiled her rotten, because I thought she was going to die,'' one adoptive mother told me. ''How could you not?'' 
 A significant part of ''spoiling'' them, in most cases, was withholding the information that they had H.I.V. at all. Now, as these children grow older and savvier, a small culture of medical professionals -- men and (mostly) women who have been on the front lines of this initially hopeless battle from the beginning -- struggle to influence what their patients are told about their conditions, and when, and by whom, without further damaging a family framework that's often extremely fragile to begin with. Their success rate is astonishingly high. At one end of the spectrum are young adults who have developed a precocious sense of self-reliance and a fearlessness in the face of others' prejudices; at the other end is a case like A.'s son -- a child at the cusp of sexual activity, ignorant of carrying an infectious and potentially lethal disease, surrounded by adults who either can't make themselves tell him or are forbidden to do so by law.
K. is a 20-year-old Bronx woman who has been positive since birth but didn't find out until she was 13 -- very shortly, by her own account, before she became sexually active. In her case, it wasn't simply a question of her mother's not being able to bring herself to tell her: her mother, having learned of her own positive status three years earlier, couldn't bring herself to have K. tested at all, so great was her fear of what the test result would be. K. learned the truth when visiting a doctor to try to discover why she had stopped growing. (In the early years of the epidemic, H.I.V.-positive children were often marked by significantly retarded physical development; with improved medication, that's much less the case.) ''It was one big snowball for me,'' she says. ''I found out I'd stopped growing, I found out I was positive, that my mother was positive, that my father gave it to my mother, all at the same time. It was like, my first week in high school. As soon as they told us, this stream of tears just came. But it wasn't like a big sob story. It just happened. We got over it, and then we went shopping. I guess as the years go on, I still process it, but at that moment it was like, if I ignore it, then it's not gonna bother me.'' 
 This is an attitude, as she recognizes, that she picked up from her mother. ''She's a very secretive person,'' K. says, shrugging. ''She doesn't tell us things. My grandmother too. She runs a whole AIDS section of her church, but she won't tell people that I'm positive, or that her daughter's positive, or that her son'' -- K.'s uncle -- ''is positive. I think secretly she's kind of ashamed. She wants to appear as this good Samaritan, where she's helping out strangers, whereas she's really doing it because someone in her own life is affected by it. She doesn't want that dirty little secret, I guess, in her life.'' 
 Some families decide that that burden of secrecy is so great, and so unjust, that the best response is to disclose to everyone, to turn their plight into a means of educating their own community or society at large. Many parents also expect, not unreasonably, that such proactive honesty will make their children feel better about themselves. But studies show that such broadly public disclosure -- appearing on TV, going on speaking tours -- actually turns out, in terms of the children's self-esteem, to be a mixed bag. Not to mention that the community at large sometimes resists being educated.
 Most everyone old enough to remember the worst days of the AIDS crisis remembers Act Up, the confrontational activist group instrumental in raising AIDS awareness throughout the 80's and 90's; less well remembered is that there was an offshoot of Act Up devoted to the cause of H.I.V.-positive children, called the Just Kids Foundation. E., for example, was eager to do something to help in the fight against the epidemic; she decided to become a foster parent to a child with the disease, knowing full well that that child's life would probably be a short and difficult one. In fact, doctors gave the infant girl she took responsibility for and later adopted, who was born not only H.I.V.-infected but also addicted to crack cocaine, two to three years to live. E. is enough of an old-time lefty herself to quote Eldridge Cleaver in conversation, but when she went to those Just Kids meetings, she sometimes found she didn't agree with what she heard. (The initials throughout this article are derived from people's actual names. In this case, the initial is not; it was chosen to further protect E.'s daughter's privacy.) 
 ''It was very similar, very radical,'' she says. ''Heavy pressure to disclose to the children at a very early age, to start certain medications at a very early age.'' But broader disclosure was frowned on. ''It was 'don't ask, don't tell.' If the teachers at the child's school don't know enough to wear rubber gloves if a kid bleeds, then that's too bad for them. But I didn't feel that was fair to the teacher. I felt it was my responsibility, and if there were consequences, then I would take those consequences.'' 
 The radical approach to disclosure -- that the child must know everything, because there is nothing to be ashamed of, and that no one else has the right to know anything, because it's none of their business -- was a defensible one, but also one containing a seeming contradiction whose subtleties were bound to be lost on the children themselves. E.'s daughter's own experience wound up bearing out that very contradiction. When she started asking questions, around age 8, E. (who had by then adopted her) told her the truth with the help of a children's book written specifically for children with H.I.V. As children's books tend to do, it represented a difficult experience in an honest but also optimistic light, its primary goal being to strengthen the reader's self-esteem. It went well. It went so well, in fact, that when the girl returned to school, she decided to tell her news to her friends. ''Her teacher was beside herself,'' E. says. '''What are the parents going to do?' And this was a very progressive school. There were all these conferences. They hushed it over. They told the girl to keep it to herself.'' To make matters worse, one parent who expressed alarm about this one-girl disclosure campaign was, according to E., one of the girl's own doctors. 
 Some kids, like E.'s daughter, enter the foster-care system virtually from the moment they're born; for others, foster care is a later stage in a childhood marked by progressive loss. V., who works in a Manhattan bakery, lost his mother to AIDS when he was 7, and in the years when they were together, they were both sick all the time. ''The hospital was like my second home,'' he says -- in many ways a more stable home than his primary one. ''All the nurses knew me. They took care of me like I was their son. It wasn't scary at all. Now it's scary, because I know what the situation is. If I'm in there now, I want to try to get out as fast as possible.''
 V. went into the foster-care system after his mother's death. Eventually he found a stable home, and when he was 13 that family adopted him. ''It was O.K.,'' he says. ''I mean, it was family, but it can never happen like family family. I will never know what family is.'' As he grew older and more independent, things became more argumentative at home, until it reached the point where he moved out and went voluntarily into a group home for H.I.V.-positive teenagers; at 18 he moved into his own apartment in Washington Heights. ''I grew up faster than I was supposed to,'' he says. ''Everybody, they look at me, they're like, No way you're 20.'' 
 He dreams of opening his own bakery, maybe in New York or Miami. He dates, but right now he is disconcerted to be facing the end of the most solid, long-term relationship in his life, and that's with his pediatrician. ''I've know him since I was 18 months,'' he says, ''longer than I've known myself.'' As for many in his generation, the necessary transition to an adult doctor is psychologically fraught; patients like V. haven't had many stable adults in their lives, and so it's not so easy to give one up. ''I don't trust a lot of people,'' he says. ''That's the problem I have now. Like, I could trust you. But I don't trust you. You know what I mean?''
 It's a transition a lot of H.I.V.-positive young people find traumatic. Their doctors are quite often the most long-term, if not the only, responsible and reliable adults in their lives. ''There's this one patient of mine, a young woman,'' says Dr. Stephen Arpadi, who started one of New York's first family AIDS clinics at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital. ''Her parents both died by the time she was 10. Her older brother was really incapable of taking care of her. She had her own adolescent issues about taking medication, and she became quite sick and at some point lost her ability to walk. Now she's on the other side of adolescence, and she's actually a fairly hopeful character right now. But whenever I'm with her, she never fails to say to whomever we come across: 'That's Dr. Arpadi. He knew my mother. He knew my father.'''
It's the families most in need of the mental-health services that a place like F.C.C. provides that prove the most difficult to engage. It can take months, or years, and sometimes it doesn't work out. ''This is not like cancer,'' says Sheila Ryan, program director of the Special Needs Clinic at Columbia-Presbyterian. ''These families are not a cross-section of the population. These issues would be agonizing for any family to deal with, but the families that are likely to be dealing with H.I.V. are more likely to have problems with substance abuse and mental illness. These are poor families, and even within the poor community more likely to be fragile than others on the same block.'' 
 It was partly in an effort to shore up the fragility of these families that a movement to safeguard their privacy grew up in the wake of the AZT trials in the mid-90's. With such a remarkably effective treatment newly available, the issue became whether H.I.V. testing for pregnant mothers should be mandatory, for the sake of the health of their children. But this was at the height of the epidemic and the panic it engendered; the specter of discrimination against the mothers themselves -- including the possibility of their being judged unfit on the basis of those tests and having their children pre-emptively taken away from them -- kept this initiative from becoming law. H.I.V.-confidentiality statutes are state-specific; today in New York, testing newborns for H.I.V. is mandatory, but testing their mothers is not.
 Such sweeping policies, whether they come from a group like Act Up or from the government it opposes, will always have unintended consequences. Q., a 47-year-old woman who lives in the Bronx -- active, physically fit, a self-professed vitamin devotee -- is the mother of five children. The fourth, a daughter, was born at Harlem Hospital Center in 1993, and unlike her siblings, she was sick from Day 1. She had recurring yeast and sinus infections and difficulty walking and crawling, and though she could clearly hear and understand others, she never tried to speak. Q. hadn't returned to Harlem Hospital Center since the birth, going instead to a variety of hospitals and clinics closer to her home, where doctors dispensed antibiotics to treat the infections, which partly cleared up for a day or two and then came right back. She was sure there was something wrong with her daughter's immune system. She even asked one doctor to test her daughter for H.I.V., and he wouldn't, saying that the test was too painful to perform on a clearly healthy child and accusing Q. of something he called parent paranoia. 
 Two months later, Q. took a vacation to visit an old friend in North Carolina. Q.'s daughter was sick again. Q. took her to Duke University Medical Center, without an appointment, and after sitting there for a while, she rev.finally stopped a doctor in the hallway.
 ''I said, 'I think she's H.I.V.-positive,''' Q. remembers. ''The doctor said, 'What do you want me to do?' I said, 'I want you to test her for everything.' That was on a Monday. She said, 'Come back in on Thursday and we'll give you the answer.'''
 The answer was that the girl was indeed H.I.V.-positive. Q., having rev.finally found a doctor capable of listening to her, now had to explain that she was only there on vacation. Could the doctor recommend a good facility for the treatment of pediatric H.I.V. back in New York?
 ''Do you know,'' the doctor asked her, ''where Harlem Hospital is?''
 Thus, Q. returned to the hospital where her daughter was born. Dr. Abrams and her colleagues immediately started aggressive drug therapy for the child, who not only didn't die but thrived: now 12, she's an honors student who also excels at tae kwon do and basketball. 
 The push for openness with children about their own condition is far more likely to come from the doctors themselves and toward parents or caregivers whose reluctance or fear or denial grows more entrenched with the years. The doctors' experience has tended to bear out what common sense might suggest -- that the outlook for the child's emotional well-being in the wake of disclosure is greatly improved if the bad news has come from his or her own family members, rather than despite them. ''Trust is most important,'' says Dr. Lori Wiener, coordinator of the Pediatric H.I.V. Psychosocial Support and Research Program at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. ''It's very hard to swim back up that river. You don't want them to be saying to you, 'What else have you lied to me about?''' 
 At the same time, the doctors worry that putting too much pressure on the parents to disclose might lead them, in an effort to escape that pressure, to stop bringing the children in for regular treatment at all.
 ''The typical response is, 'He hasn't asked, so I haven't told him,''' Abrams says. ''But ultimately most families do what's best for their child. Just not necessarily on my time line.''
 Part of the tendency toward silence has its roots in the bitter experience of the families themselves. As one early research study dryly phrased it: ''The overwhelming majority of pediatric H.I.V. cases occurs in urban minority families that have experienced poverty, early or violent family deaths, racial discrimination, lack of basic services, drug addiction and unstable family configurations. Strategies for coping with the pervasive losses these families have encountered on all fronts generally do not include full and open discussion.''
 But in the end, most of the reasons that parents have such a hard time delivering such monumentally bad news to their own children transcend any social or economic circumstances. Parents often experience their reluctance to tell the truth as protective. There's the constant fear that it's too soon, too early, that the child is not ready to make sense of it, as if there were any sense to be made of such news. ''They'll say, 'Look at her,''' Wiener says. '''She's out there playing. She's happy. Why would I want to burden her with this information that will change her life forever?' Or, 'She's too young to understand anyway, so what difference will it make except to add something that's really stressful for her?''' 
 Many parents also fear that the news itself will make the child's condition worse by adversely affecting his or her will to live. It's worth noting that while the disease itself may be relatively new, this sort of secrecy -- even on the professional level -- is not: as recently as the 1960's, it was not unusual for cancer patients to die without the word ''cancer'' once being uttered in their hearing, not even by their doctors. Avoiding the subject was presumed to be merciful, whereas honesty was simply hope-killing.
 The subject is even more charged when the H.I.V.-positive child lives with a biological parent. Such parents have good reason to fear, at least initially, anger and rejection from their own children; they may also dread the prospect that the conversation will have to include a disclosure of their own H.I.V. status, as well as the behavior that led to it. ''It's a web,'' Wiener says. ''You can't just go to the child and say, O.K., this is what you have. It means disclosing other family events.''
 Sometimes the child himself will force the issue, even if unknowingly. Dr. Warren Ng, chief psychiatrist and co-director at Columbia-Presbyterian's Special Needs Clinic, remembers a patient whose ignorance of his own condition suddenly became an issue when he started talking about his desire to have sex on his 15th birthday, which was quickly approaching. In that case, the clinic not only called in the boy's parents but also put them through family counseling in order to find for them, Ng says, ''a script they were comfortable with.'' 
 But the greatest inhibitor -- which the child's good health and outwardly normal childhood only aggravates -- is guilt. When Q. faced her own diagnosis shortly after learning her baby daughter's, her eldest child was 16, old enough to handle the information in a mature way; still, Q. couldn't bring herself to tell that daughter for two more years. ''They knew their sister took meds,'' she says of her other children. ''And they knew I took meds. They just didn't know why. They knew it was important. They'd say, 'Mom, did you remember to take your meds?' But they didn't know what it was for.''
 The doctors at the Family Care Center urged her to start discussing it directly with her family. ''But I'm not a person who's easily swayed,'' Q. says. ''It wasn't that I wasn't ready to discuss it with my child but that I wasn't ready to deal with the fact that she might feel ashamed of me over it, or angry with me. I wasn't willing to hear her say: 'Ma, how could you have done that? What kind of life was you living?''' 
Sometimes the disclosure conversation itself, when it rev.finally occurs, can become another variant of denial: parents rush through it in the vain hope that having talked about it once, it will thus be dismissed, and they won't need to talk about it anymore. What they learn instead is that children don't process information -- especially difficult information -- in the same way adults do. The mantra of the doctors and social workers is that disclosure is not an event but a process; usually the conversation needs to take place several times before its reality sets in for good. Mellins tells the admittedly extreme story of a graduate assistant in a research study who went in to interview a child in the Family Care Center for a study on some element of the psychological fallout of his ailment. She began by asking him what he could recall about his reaction to the news that he had H.I.V. 
 The boy stared at her. ''I have H.I.V.?'' he said. 
 In fact, this child had been told of the diagnosis not just once but several times; the doctors called in the people who were caring for him and went over everything again.
 How do children react to the news when it sinks in? Surprisingly, perhaps, they tend not to ask about death right away. ''The issues about death come out in other ways,'' Mellins says. ''They try to make certain things happen quickly, like wanting to have a baby or get married. At age 14 or 15, they want these things to happen. And if you press, you start to learn that it's because they're afraid they won't have a regular life span.''
 ''The two issues they keep coming back to,'' Sheila Ryan of Columbia-Presbyterian says, ''are the permanence of the virus -- the idea that there's nothing you can do to get rid of it -- and what kind of impact it will have on their capacity to have children, which is partly a question about the ways in which they might be impaired or maimed or less than others.'' 
 ''Sometimes kids find ways of protecting themselves from the information,'' Ryan adds. ''One girl who was in here, at the time we rev.finally said the word H.I.V., she said, 'But I know I don't have AIDS.' I said, 'How'd you figure that out?' And she said, 'Because if you have AIDS, you're skinny and living in Africa, so I know I don't have it.' Or another girl who was 15 -- her mother told her the week before she came in here for the first time, and her response to that was simply that her mother had lied to her.''
 In the end, it was Q.'s daughter who forced the conversation with her mother. Like some who live with H.I.V., she takes the medicine via a surgically implanted feeding tube; after asking for years, and being put off with answers like, ''Because I'm your mother and I say so,'' she demanded to know why she had to take all this medicine daily that no one else she knew in her family, apart from her mother, ever had to take. They had the conversation, and now the child herself is part of the stressful balancing act -- on the one hand, H.I.V. is nothing to be ashamed of; on the other hand, don't go telling your friends about it because it's none of their business. 
 Does Q. worry that as her daughter gets older and more independent, she'll start making those decisions -- whom to tell about the family secret, whom not to tell -- on her own? ''Right now, it's nothing she would share,'' she says. ''She's at the age when children don't want to be different from their friends. She would not want to stand out. She would not say anything about H.I.V., or the people who have it, that would make her friends turn around and say, 'How would you know?'''
There was no one moment when all of these parents, who once thought their time with their children would be so limited, were told that the old prognoses had been thrown out the window; the necessary emotional adjustments had to be made gradually, not to mention improvisationally. P. is a former New York City employee who went on permanent disability after developing a work-related lung ailment. She became a foster parent -- ''I didn't even know you got paid for doing it,'' she says. ''I just thought that if it was something you could manage to do, you did it'' -- and over the last 15 years, some 60 children have lived in the Bronx apartment she shares with her sister. (In fact, foster parents of H.I.V.-positive children under the age of 5 may be paid triple the usual rate.) Some stay for a short time, some for a long time, and she has legally adopted two of them, including a boy, now 12 and positive since birth. He went into the foster-care system in 1994 when his aunt, with whom he was living, learned that the boy's mother had H.I.V. and announced that she no longer wanted the 16-month-old baby in her house.
 The aunt never even had him tested. That fell to P., and when the results came back positive, the doctors at Harlem Hospital told her that the boy might not live to the age of 4. ''I used to ask him,'' P. remembers, '''Did you have a good day today?' Every day had to be a good day. Because I was really afraid he might not make it.'' She still remembers the party they gave when, against expectations, he turned 4 after all.
 He turned 5, and 6, and then one day -- still unaware of his own condition, though he would complain about the AZT he had to take as often as every 12 hours -- he had a surprising request. ''He asked for a brother,'' P. says. ''He said, 'I need someone to play with.''' She thought over his request, and then she went to the foster-care agency with an unusual request of her own. She wanted to adopt another child, with three conditions: it had to be a boy, he had to be younger and he had to be H.I.V.-positive.
 ''They really thought I was crazy,'' she says. ''But if, God forbid, anything ever happened to my older boy, I didn't want him to be able to look at me and say: 'You knew all along. That's why you let me have this brother, so that you could have a healthy child, so you could replace me with a normal person.'''
 His little brother is now 6 and has not yet been told he's positive. His older brother helps encourage him to stay on his medicine. It's four years now since he learned of his own H.I.V. status. He had his suspicions, in part because of the children's books about H.I.V. and AIDS that P. made sure were on the bookshelf in his bedroom. rev.finally the doctors convinced her that her son needed to hear, as she says, ''the letters that go with the problem.''
 She tells the story of how she then took him to a restaurant for lunch, just before one of his scheduled appointments at the hospital. She let him pick out whatever he wanted; when the waitress came and took their order, she said, ''There's something I'd like to talk to you about.'' 
 ''It can wait,'' he said.
 The appetizers came, and then the main courses, and she said she really needed to talk to him. ''I know you do,'' he said. ''Don't ruin the food.'' They finished their lunch, paid the check and walked all the way to the hospital before she could make herself go through with it.
 ''Come here,'' she said. 
 ''Don't,'' he replied.
 But she did. And when it was over, she was in tears, and he seemed fairly calm. ''Is that all it is?'' he said. ''I thought you were going to tell me I had asthma, like you.'' Seeing her struggle for breath, that was what scared him. 
 He sometimes asks about his biological mother; P. is legally forbidden to give him any information that might help him contact her until he turns 18. But the fact is, not only does she know the identity of her son's biological mother; she saw her once in a while. She seemed healthy and has other children.
 One Sunday, P. recalls, she and her son met one of these children. They ran into his aunt -- the same one who put him into foster care as a baby because she suspected he might be ill -- with another of her nephews, his half-brother. To P.'s son, both of these people were strangers.
 ''Is that who I think it is?'' the aunt said pleasantly.
 ''Well, of course it is,'' P. said -- and, not knowing what else to do, she introduced the children to each other.
 Her son, who lives in a home where a premium is placed on etiquette, said, ''Pleased to meet you'' to the other child and put out his hand.
 ''Don't touch him,'' the boys' aunt said.
Those on the leading edge of this unexpected generation are just now moving into the adult phase of their suddenly open-ended lives; after childhoods marked by secrecy and fatalism and prejudice and loss, it seems too much to expect that they should figure out how to become responsible adults. But it happens every day. Ben Banks, a 26-year-old who lives in Virginia, had a rare form of cancer in infancy; on the day of the physical exam that was supposed to mark his 10-year freedom from that cancer, when he was 12, it was discovered that he had contracted H.I.V. from a blood transfusion. (The blood supply began to be screened in 1985.) He came home from school, walked up the stairs and found his mother sitting on the bed sobbing, having just hung up the phone. ''That was the doctor,'' she said. ''You're H.I.V.-positive.''
 No elaborately planned, properly tempered disclosure conversation for him. Still, this was in 1991- six months before Magic Johnson's public disclosure of his diagnosis -- and he had to be careful, much more careful than those who would follow in his footsteps, about what he said and to whom. His school gave him special permission not to go to the nurse -- to take his own medication in private, in the bathroom before lunch -- because of the panic they feared would ensue if anyone recognized the name of the drug he was taking. On one particularly harrowing day, he sat in health class and watched the TV movie ''The Ryan White Story'' while his classmates joked cruelly all around him. 
 But Banks, having already survived cancer, was a remarkably resourceful teenager. He told his best friend, and then a few other friends, and then a group of his classmates at James Madison University, and he now serves as a spokesman for the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation. In 2003, he married. As for the turning point in his own understanding of his disease -- from death sentence to manageable illness -- it may have come when he was 17 and applied to the Make-a-Wish Foundation, which grants the wishes of extremely ill children. His application was disqualified. Stung, he called up his doctor. ''Ben,'' the doctor said, ''why don't you give that wish to a child who really needs it. You're not going anywhere.'' 
Their continued good health, indeed their survival, depends on their continued adherence to the same strict drug regimen that has kept them alive thus far. Keep taking your medicine: another simple idea that in the lives of these young people turns out to be burdened with psychological complexities -- this despite the fact that even a few missed doses can allow the virus to develop a resistance to a given drug, permanently compromising or nullifying that course of treatment. What, apart from the desire for a respite from the sometimes grievous side effects, would induce someone to stop taking lifesaving medication? Primarily stress and depression -- circumstances to which any teenager might be considered at risk, but to which an adolescent concealing a stigmatizing condition is especially prone. ''There is definitely a relationship between adherence and depression,'' Wiener says. ''There's a tremendous amount of stress associated with lying, with living a life of secrecy.'' Going off meds can also be an adolescent's expression of the desire to hold the reins of his or her own life for a change, even unto self-destruction, broadly analogous to an anorexic's refusal to eat. 
 But others simply overlook their own welfare, often because even as children, their first responsibility was the welfare of others. Siomara Cruz is an effervescent 21-year-old, the fourth of six children; she and her two younger siblings were born with H.I.V. Those siblings each died at the age of 5; the eldest child in the family, eight years Cruz's senior, was so unstrung by the deaths that he left home. Their mother passed away when Cruz was 11. She and her older sister moved in with their grandmother, but that didn't last long; she has been looking after herself since she was 16. Now she works at an office-supply store in Manhattan; some of her co-workers know her status and some don't. ''When you hear people just talking and joking around, you can get a sense of the type of person they are,'' she says, ''and I don't think a lot of them can handle it, honestly. I don't want to have to do a 'Philadelphia' on them.'' 
 In the summers she serves as a counselor at the Joey Dipaolo AIDS Foundation's camp in upstate New York for kids with H.I.V. Counselors frequently have a hard time getting campers -- who are enjoying a rare interlude from anxiety about their disease -- to take their meds; one way they do it is by bargaining with them, saying: ''Look, if you take all your pills, then I'll take one of the purple ones with you. We'll do it at the same time.'' This, even if the ''purple one'' is not a medication prescribed for them; indeed, some counselors aren't H.I.V.-positive at all. Then they stay up all night thrashing and moaning and admitting that they had no idea how justified all the reluctance to take the medication really is.
 Cruz laughs affectionately as she recounts this story. Then I ask her if she suffers any such side effects from the medication she's taking.
 ''The ones I'm supposed to be taking?'' she says, laughing. ''Yeah.''
 She doesn't take them?
 ''I just can't deal with them. They make me feel worse. I just don't want to live my life like that. If I didn't have to take medicine, if I could drink something that would help me or take like a Flintstones vitamin, I would. I spoke to my doctor. She's like, 'Siomara, we have to talk.' It's like seven pills I'm supposed to take. If I take them in the morning, then when I get to work I'm just ready to hit the floor. But then I try at night, and I can't sleep because I'm so sick. I live with my boyfriend, and when I'm sick like that, there's nothing he can do. He feels so helpless. I can't put him through that.''
However understandable the desire to deny, if only for a little while, the burden of their illness, neglecting to take meds consistently is about the most unwise thing H.I.V.-positive young people can do. There's the risk of undermining their own course of treatment. And as if that weren't enough, they could develop (and potentially could transmit) a strain of the virus that has built up all sorts of resistances to existing medication. As Mellins says, ''How do you instill within kids a healthy sense of sexuality and at the same time a sense of fear?''
 Thus, the doctors say, the next frontier in the lives of this generation is ''peer disclosure'' -- the tricky process of telling friends and especially potential sexual partners about their status. The mercurial quality of romance in your teens and 20's makes the disclosure question especially risky: the boy you think you'll be with forever may be a distant memory in a month or two, but if you tell him in an intimate moment that you're H.I.V.-positive, the stakes of normal adolescent gossip will be exponentially raised. 
 K. says that she would never date anybody in school or anybody who lives in her neighborhood. In high school she had a boyfriend who found out her status by accident, through something he found in her backpack, and she has resolved not to let that kind of thing happen again, for everybody's sake. ''Now I just think of it as the first thing that needs to be done, before the first physical thing happens,'' she says. ''I just have to get up the nerve to do it. It's like you have to find the right moment, feel the person out. Usually I go down the line of different diseases -- what would you do if you had this disease, that disease, what would you do if your arm was chopped off? I kind of try to play with it -- would you still be with me if I had no left pinkie or something?'' 
 The prejudices for which she feels them out are by far the most significant obstacle between those in her position and a ''normal'' love life -- up to and including starting families of their own. The same safe-sex practices that are drummed into the heads of every teenager and young adult these days are sufficient to keep them and their partners safe as well. And today's low vertical transmission rate means that -- with the same AZT therapy, recommendations against breast-feeding, etc. -- their own chances of having uninfected children are excellent. The perinatally-infected patients in Abrams's and Mellins's clinics tend, Mellins says, to be pretty savvy about such cutting-edge insemination techniques as ''sperm spinning'' designed to help them conceive without endangering the health of their partners.
 It should be said, of course, that the conditions that allow such a relatively sunny image of pediatric H.I.V. as a manageable disease -- one whose transmission from mother to child it is possible to stop -- belong exclusively, at the present time, to the developed world. Recommendations against breast-feeding, for instance: not so simple in impoverished places or where access to clean water can't be taken for granted. Abrams says that until recently children ''have not really been included in the international dialogue around H.I.V. care and treatment. In terms of the number of individuals treated in Africa, they've been neglected.'' And so, even as the Family Care Center she founded at Harlem Hospital Center moves blessedly in the direction of obsolescence, she has spent the past two years with a team helping to establish family-care pilot programs on the F.C.C. model in South Africa and elsewhere. ''So they don't have to start from scratch,'' she says. 
But here in the United States, K., like her peers, has come to terms with the idea that what once amounted to a death sentence has been lifted. The air of provisionality that hung over her childhood is not easily dismissed, but she has turned it into a kind of motivation. ''A lot of my friends my age that don't have H.I.V. are like losers,'' she says. ''They sit on their rear all day and do nothing. I have a job, I go to school, I do everything I need to do, and I think it's because I want to make sure I do it before I pass. It's my goal to just get it all done.'' 
 She works full time while going to college in the hope of becoming an architect. No one who meets her would doubt that she has the resources to achieve such a goal; for others, though, with different goals, their H.I.V. status -- no matter how easily controlled or concealed -- isn't so easily denied.
 ''I have two patients,'' Ng, the psychiatrist at the Special Needs Clinic, says, ''17 and 18 years old. One wants to be in the Armed Forces, and the other wants to be a pilot. Given their status, they've heard plenty about issues related to their having sexual partners and how to remain safe. But now they're hearing about how they're not able to do something they want to do with their lives, and once again, H.I.V. is there.''
 ''This epidemic just marches on,'' Arpadi says. ''You and I will go to our graves, and there will still be this terrible epidemic. But in this country we've effectively stopped transmission to babies, so now we have this sort of cohort of aging kids. And I really wonder how they're going to make any sense of their lives. Everyone before them died earlier on, and there's no more kids like them behind.''

HEADLINE: Burglaries Decrease In Nassau, But Police Feel Strain

BYLINE: By PHILLIP LUTZ

 BODY:
A YEAR ago, the Nassau County Police Department reassigned Detective Ron Burk from his job investigating burglaries in a North Shore precinct to a countywide burglary task force. That left the precinct shorthanded, Detective Burk said, but residential burglaries in the county had risen for the first time in more than a decade and the task force needed his 30-plus years of experience. 
 ''We were really battling,'' said James H. Lawrence, the county police commissioner.
The situation has largely turned around. The number of residential burglaries in the Nassau Police District, which covers most of the county, increased 25 percent from Dec. 30, 2003, through the June 7, 2004, compared with a similar period a year earlier. But, according to the latest police statistics available, they have dropped this year by 27 percent, to 534. 
 That is the lowest level in at least four years. And the declines were generally countywide, including Detective Burk's old precinct, the Sixth. 
 The police attributed the decline in part to success in disrupting burglary rings operating out of New York City. Together, the New York and Nassau Police Departments have arrested about two dozen members of one ring, the Nassau police said. 
 But the arrests were also aided by the creation of the burglary task force, which now has four officers, the police said. They also credited stepped-up street patrols and the increased use of new technology to track burglaries and develop evidence from seized computers. 
 The task force has been crucial in coordinating with the New York police and identifying crime patterns across jurisdictions, said Detective Sgt. James E. Tilton, the deputy commander of the crimes-against-property squad, which includes the task force.
 But aside from the decrease in burglaries and a 5 percent drop in grand larceny, the number of almost all other major crimes has increased this year, the police said. 
 It is unclear whether the shift of focus to burglaries might have been a factor in the increases of other crimes. But those who have studied the crime figures generally credited the efforts of the police, not demographic or economic trends, for the drop in burglaries.
 ''It's probably true that police work has helped drive this figure down,'' said Harvey W. Kushner, chairman of the criminal justice department at the C.W. Post Campus of Long Island University, in Brookville.
 Suffolk County did not experience the same increase in burglaries in 2004; in fact, burglaries decreased by nearly 12 percent, according to police statistics. The difference could be a result of geography. Given its proximity to New York City, Nassau presents a more tempting target for city burglary rings that have sprung up in the past couple of years, the Nassau police said. 
 The turnaround in residential burglaries in Nassau runs somewhat counter to general trends there. 
 In 2004, residential burglaries rose while crime in most other categories fell, according to the police figures. 
 This year, the total number of crimes fell for the second consecutive year, mainly because the number of residential burglaries dropped so sharply and because of the continued decline in grand larceny. But the rate of decline has slowed because crime has increased in several categories, led by robberies. Total robberies, including commercial robberies, fell by 12 percent through the first week in June 2004 but rose in the same period this year by 23 percent, to 342, the highest level in at least four years.
 Mr. Lawrence, the Nassau police commissioner, said that the increase could be explained in part by a rise in bank robberies as branches opened without bulletproof plexiglass partitions, called bandit barriers, and other deterrents. There were 31 bank robberies through mid-June this year but only 15 through the end of June last year.
 But he could not explain the increase in street robberies. Asked whether the heightened attention to burglaries was drawing members of the force needed to fight other types of crime, Commissioner Lawrence said, ''Not that it would impact on us addressing the other issues.'' 
 But James Carver, the first vice president of the Nassau Police Benevolent Association, said that the department was inadequately staffed and that the increase in some crimes might reflect a strain on the department. 
 While the number of officers has begun to rise after bottoming out in the last year, staffing levels -- 2,636 sworn officers, of which 387 are detectives -- remain far below those of 1999 (3,145 officers and 458 detectives). 
 Police supervisors said the force was stretched thin but would not link staffing levels to the increase in some crimes. 
 ''The replacement rate has been slower than I'm sure I would have liked,'' said Deputy Inspector Jay Caputo, commander of the major-offense squads, which include those for the district attorney, arson, crimes against property, homicide, robbery and special services.
 Asked whether there were significant holes in coverage, he said no. Asked whether there were some holes, he said yes. 
 Detective Sgt. Lucy Graziano, the commander of the crimes-against-property squad, said that before the old burglary squad was folded into a property-crimes squad in 1992 -- one of four units to be consolidated -- Nassau had at least eight detectives who worked full time on a countywide burglary detail. Now it has one detective permanently assigned to investigate burglaries, plus three others assigned for now to the task force.
 In the early 1990's, when crack cocaine was more of a problem, burglaries were running at twice the level of recent years, but then the numbers began to fall. The decline in the number of detectives dedicated to burglaries paralleled the decline in the number of such crimes, and so the sudden rise in burglaries late in 2003 left her squad shorthanded, Sergeant Graziano said. 
 The experienced detectives transferred to Sergeant Graziano's squad a year ago have not been easily replaced on the precinct level. ''They're shorthanded everywhere,'' she said. 
 ''We're doing more with less,'' said Detective Wayne Mathison, the only member of the burglary task force who is permanently assigned to the crimes-against-property squad.
 On a recent weekday patrol that included a reporter, Detectives Mathison and Burk covered a two-square-mile area straddling the Sixth and Third Precincts, a generally affluent part of northwestern Nassau. About a dozen homes there had been burglarized since the beginning of the year, Detective Mathison said. 
 The detectives spent part of their nine-hour shift cruising streets and parking in cul-de-sacs, where with the aid of binoculars or night-vision equipment, they hoped to spot anyone or anything that looked out of place or fit a pattern associated with previous crimes. At one point, they drove past two plainclothes officers and a plainclothes detective on foot taking photos of roads and paths that burglars might use for getaways. 
 As they patrolled, Detectives Burk and Mathison pointed to houses where burglars had circumvented alarm systems by entering through vents and dropping into attics. They also pointed to new condominium developments where burglars had bypassed entrance gates by scaling fences. The growth of such communities has attracted burglars, but public education may have helped drive down the number of burglaries, the detectives said.
 Also helping has been the arrest of those who might have committed other burglaries, the police said. One wave of arrests took place late in 2003, after the first annual increase in residential burglaries in 11 years (16 percent); burglary arrests jumped 10 percent, to 369, Sergeant Tilton said. He said the Nassau police had made 349 burglary arrests last year and 90 through the end of April this year. 
 Working with the New York City police, the Nassau police have identified a loosely organized group of about 80 people operating out of Elmhurst, Queens, Sergeant Tilton said. The group, working in teams of three or four, has burglarized homes near the Long Island Expressway and the Northern State Parkway in Manhasset, Searingtown, East Hills, Syosset and Plainview, he said. 
 Last September, the Nassau police began piecing together information from informers. The occasional witness, including a woman who was at home in January 2004 when her house in Syosset was broken into, has also helped. 
 To counter sophisticated organized burglary rings, the Nassau police are relying more on their computer forensics lab, staffed by three detectives. The senior member of the lab, Detective Bill Moylan, said it was struggling to keep up with technologically savvy burglars and the demand for evidence from cellphones, personal digital assistants and computers recovered from suspects. 
 The Nassau police are also beginning to use DNA. Burglars often wear gloves to avoid leaving fingerprints, but they are less conscious of DNA, traces of which can be found in the smallest bodily particles. Last July, for example, the police extracted DNA from a small quantity of blood left by the burglar who broke into a church in Sea Cliff. It matched DNA in a state database, and a suspect was identified and arrested, Sergeant Tilton said. 
 As the DNA database grows, ''you're going to hear more and more of these cases,'' said Professor Kushner of C.W. Post. 
 Meanwhile, more common methods will be used to fight the surge in robberies, Commissioner Lawrence said. He said he would begin deploying a ''pretty substantial'' contingent of plainclothes officers on overtime in areas where robberies seem likely.
 ''Robberies are something we're really focusing on now,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Shortchanged by Good Intentions

BYLINE: By Sharon Lerner. 
Sharon Lerner is a senior fellow at the Center for New York City Affairs at the New School.

 BODY:
TO New York State policymakers, a rule tightening the collection of child support must have seemed like a smart way to save money and make fathers responsible for their children. But in fact it is driving many poor children from good, safe, affordable child care centers. 
 The regulation, which went into effect in much of the state a year ago, requires that single parents, mostly mothers, sue the other parent for financial support to receive government help to pay for child care. But many low-income single mothers would rather forgo financial aid than sue the fathers of their children. 
According to Jill Rooney, executive director of Harbor Child Care, which runs five nonprofit programs on Long Island, about 50 single mothers have removed their children from Harbor's programs in the last year because of the rule. At St. Peter's Child Care Center in Yonkers, Laura Strong, the executive director, has seen enrollment drop by more than half in the last year. She attributes most of that decrease to the new requirement. And at the Ossining Children's Center, there has been a 38 percent decrease in enrollment of children receiving subsidies, with more than 33 children leaving since the rule was implemented, said Howard Milbert, executive director of the center.
 The losses are taking a toll on these programs, which often care for children across the economic spectrum. Ellen Farrar, the coordinator of early childhood programs at the Westchester Community Opportunity Program, which runs 16 child care centers in the county, says the new rule is responsible for a $340,000 decline in revenue for the organization over the last year. 
 But the children are losing the most. With subsidies, they have access to regulated centers with trained teachers. Without them, they end up ''underground,'' as those in the field refer to the vast terrain of unregulated care. 
 Why would mothers sacrifice such a precious resource? For some who have amicable, though informal, arrangements with their exes, a father's financial contributions and his good relationship with the children are too valuable to risk by entering the adversarial legal system. 
 Some single mothers have even more reason to fear antagonizing their exes. Although the state allows exemptions for victims of domestic violence, women must produce documentation of the abuse to qualify. Many women who do not have these records may suffer dire consequences by suing the fathers of their children.
 Mothers who are illegal immigrants are also likely to want to avoid court. Fear of jeopardizing their lives in this country often runs deeper than the need for help with caring for their children.
 Even parents willing to jump through the legal hoops may be stuck if their employers are not amenable to their taking at least three days off to handle the paperwork in court.
 Such details probably escaped regulators at the State Office of Children and Family Services when they were drafting the rule. Had they wanted a preview of the havoc they might wreak, New York policymakers could have looked to Utah and Pennsylvania, two states that implemented similar requirements. 
 Utah rescinded its rule in April, after child care workers complained of burdensome paperwork and delays in enrolling low-income children. In Pennsylvania, the number of poor children getting reduced-cost care plummeted after the rule went into effect. As a result, the state is taking the rule off the books on July 1.
 Next month, New York City, the only jurisdiction not yet affected by the state regulation, is scheduled to begin requiring single parents seeking subsidized care to get child support orders. But the state would do well to avert the mess that is sure to ensue, when the rule is applied to as many as 33,000 parents in the city, many of whom will flood the already overwhelmed family courts. 
 Why not, instead, go straight to the cleanup phase and rescind this requirement before it does any more damage? Gov. George E. Pataki could accomplish this with the stroke of a pen.
 The state should encourage single mothers to legally establish paternity. Educating them about the possible benefits, including matters of inheritance and Social Security, would help them and their children. But requiring them to sue for child support at the peril of losing affordable child care is not the answer.

HEADLINE: This Land Is My Land

BYLINE: By Walter Olson. 
Walter Olson, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, is the author, most recently, of ''The Rule of Lawyers.''

 BODY:
THIS is a club Southamptonites were hoping not to join. 
 Tribal land claims have wrought havoc across the Northeast for decades, mostly in less-than-glamorous localities like Bridgeport, Conn., and Seneca Falls, N.Y. Now the casino-eager Shinnecocks are asserting a claim to some of the nation's priciest acreage. Outraged Hamptonites should start organizing now and should demand action from elected officials, particularly those in Congress.
Three decades of title-deed trench warfare in New England and upstate New York should give us a good idea of what to expect: 
 Things will get bigger and messier. The Shinnecocks already want billions of dollars in ''back rent'' and other damages and are promising much bigger land claims soon. Elsewhere in the state, the zones under dispute have grown to include the land under entire cities like Syracuse and Binghamton. 
 Thousands of innocent landowners will suffer as hostages. Title disputes don't stop real estate markets from functioning, but they do scare off some buyers and lenders, resulting in genuine if hard-to-measure damage to property values. And while the Shinnecocks say they are not asking the court to eject homeowners, both the Oneidas and the Cayugas initially put out similarly soothing words and then changed their tune. 
 Even battles involving weak claims can drag on and on. It is true the state-recognized Shinnecocks lack federal recognition as a tribe, which ordinarily counts as a threshold requirement for asserting land claims, thus leaving a big gap in their case. But the self-proclaimed Golden Hill Paugussetts of Connecticut, unrecognized at any level and with claims far weaker than those of the Shinnecocks, have managed to keep land suits hanging over homeowners for years. Nor is the tribe likely to run out of money for legal fees: as is typical in such cases, wealthy investors have helped pay the initial costs in exchange for a share in any future casino. 
 Albany probably will help; Congress probably won't. Gov. George E. Pataki and his predecessors have helped homeowners with legal defense on the theory that the state, with its deep pockets, would in the end be obliged to bail out losing owners and is thus the ultimate party on the hook. In Washington, the Department of Justice has grown friendlier to homeowners, but Congress almost entirely ignores their plight; tribal casino interests are central players on the K Street lobbying scene. 
 And yet it is bad federal law that got us into this mess. For centuries, our legal system recognized, through statutes of limitation and related concepts, that it is unfair and economically destructive to hold the door open for the revival of long-dormant grievances. But in a profoundly misguided 5-to-4 decision in a 1985 case involving the Oneidas, the United States Supreme Court, influenced by guilt over the nation's sorry history in this area, decided that Indian land claims were an exception and not subject to time limits. 
 Justice John Paul Stevens wrote an eloquent dissent. ''This decision upsets long-settled expectations in the ownership of real property,'' he noted. ''The court, no doubt, believes that it is undoing a grave historical injustice, but in doing so it has caused another, which only Congress may now rectify.'' 
 And Justice Stevens quoted an 1831 case, Lewis v. Marshall: ''Nothing so much retards the growth and prosperity of a country as insecurity of titles to real estate. Labor is paralyzed where the enjoyment of its fruits is uncertain; and litigation without limit produces ruinous consequences to individuals.''
 Indian land claims in the Northeast arise from alleged violations of the federal Nonintercourse Act of 1790 and related legislation, under which states were supposed to acquire Indian lands only with case-by-case approval from the national government. Eastern governments (unlike frontier states) did not believe they fell under the scope of the act and did not ask for federal permission when buying land from tribes.
 Their stance was ratified at the time by practice and custom. Most tribes now asserting land claims did not object to the original sales because they wanted the money, and they cannot plausibly claim duress or lack of consideration. The Shinnecocks are evidently planning to argue that they are exceptions.
 Because the mess originates in federal law, it's up to Congress to fix it. Ideally, it should reverse the 1985 Oneida decision with legislation that says the limit for contesting violations of the Nonintercourse Act is not open-ended and expired long ago. In practice, because of sympathy toward the Indians and their financial clout, that is going to be a hard slog unless public opinion can be mobilized broadly.
 Swaying public opinion in Congress is one area where Hamptonites can contribute something distinctive. For years, upstate landowners have held bottle drives and bake sales to raise money in hopes of holding onto modest homes and farms that date back generations. They have had little success attracting wider attention to their plight. But if there is one thing the Hamptons aren't short on, it is publicity value. Why shouldn't Hamptonites throw a fund-raiser to help the upstate landowners' cause, which, given the tendency of legal precedents to apply across the board, is also theirs? 
 With luck and hard work, the mess our legal system has made of Indian land claim litigation can finally get the national scrutiny it deserves.

HEADLINE: Missing Links

BYLINE: By RICHARD KORMAN

 BODY:
ONCE, when the suburbs were new and booming, gasoline retailers had to update their handout maps of Long Island almost yearly. Each new edition bore more dashed lines for highways under construction and dotted ones for proposed routes, promising more convenient travel all over an island where traffic was building as fast as the tract housing.
 Now an era is ending. The widening of the Long Island Expressway to add high-occupancy-vehicle lanes, which should be completed the first week of July, is likely to be the last major addition to the Island's network of expressways and highways. Experts agree that it is now all but impossible to build new trunk roads, at least in Nassau and western Suffolk and probably on the whole island. Neither the land nor the money nor the political will exists to do it.
So, while there are still plans to upgrade some roads, the highway network the Island has now is essentially the one it will have to live with. 
 And judging both by today's traffic jams and by the dotted lines on yesterday's maps, that network is missing some significant links.
 Thanks in part to Robert Moses, the planner who starved mass transit for decades to lace the region with bridges, expressways and winding, scenic parkways, Long Island life today cannot help but revolve around the automobile. From 1973 to 2003, the number of registered vehicles on the Island grew three times as fast as the population, according to the Regional Plan Association.
 But the business of building roads has become much harder since Moses' time. Rights of way have disappeared, environmental reviews have become more far-reaching, community activism has grown more potent, and land values have skyrocketed.
 Now, even to talk about a new exit ramp in many neighborhoods is to know how an I.R.S. agent feels walking up to a ranch in North Dakota. State highway officials, whose 720 miles of roads on Long Island carry nearly half its traffic, are now cautious and consensus-minded, a far cry from the push-it-through, come-what-may style of the Moses years.
 As a result, the pace of improvements to the road network lags far behind the need, according to Lee Koppelman, director of the Center for Regional Policy Studies at Stony Brook University. Anything that is done now, he said, ''is strictly Band-Aids.''
 Looking back, the missed road-building opportunities are legion: ghost interchanges never set in concrete, bridges that died on paper and highways that failed to rumble from imagination to reality.
 To be sure, some of the projects would probably have been magnificent disasters. In the 1960's, for the sake of adding links to the web of roads serving the whole Northeast megalopolis, Moses and like-minded planners considered extending the expressway system deep into both forks, encircling the harbors and bays of the North Shore with a belt of steel highway bridges, and even flinging a span from Orient Point to Rhode Island. The damage done to some of Long Island's most scenic and historic communities would have been incalculable.
 Even the more reasonable of the unbuilt projects, though, would have shaped a different Long Island, experts and historians say, by pushing development into still-fallow corners, splitting neighborhoods, displacing families and businesses and changing property values. 
 On the other hand, one expert suggests that limited-access highways might actually have reduced sprawl in some towns, the way a rail line can, by concentrating development near the access points.
 With the road-building era ending, most of the public emphasis today is on mass transit improvements for commuters, like a new Long Island Rail Road link to the East Side of Manhattan and more express-bus service, perhaps using lanes reserved for buses.
 But some experts question the wisdom of the new emphasis. Since much of the driving Long Islanders do is unrelated to commuting, ''how wise is public policy that makes people miserable in their cars?'' said Frank Braconi, an economist who splits his time between homes in New York City and Suffolk County. ''That can only discourage spending and make people consider living in Asheville, N.C.''
 There are other reasons, besides a maddeningly slow commute, to regret some of the gaps in the Island's highway network. They force cars and trucks onto local streets, setting the stage for more accidents. Towns respond by posting more stoplights and stop signs, slowing travel further. Shipping costs rise for the vast majority of goods, which travel by truck. And the added wear on local streets pushes up taxes.
 Here are some of the notable highway projects that got away.

Double-Decking the L.I.E.
Proposed -- 1963.
Purpose -- Adding through lanes for Island-to-city traffic.
Problem -- Aesthetics.
Fate -- Dropped within a few years.
 The Long Island Expressway was far from finished, but it was already well on its way to infamy. Commuters clogged the western section with 130,000 trips a day through Queens, according to nycroads.com, a Web site that collects historical information about the region's highways. 
 The New York City transportation commissioner at the time was Henry Barnes, the engineer who came up with the timing of green lights on major avenues to speed traffic flow, among other innovations. 
 In 1963, Mr. Barnes had an idea for expanding the expressway's capacity in Queens: three more lanes in each direction, plus a four-lane second deck above, supported on huge T-shaped concrete pillars. 
 The upper deck would have been an express causeway with no exits or entrances from the Nassau line to the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway in Maspeth. All four lanes would have run inbound in the morning and outbound in the evening. 
 But the road would have been a hulking intrusion through the Queens neighborhoods it traversed but did not serve, a weakness that Mr. Barnes himself acknowledged.

Next Exit, New England
Proposed -- Around 1968.
Purpose -- A sound crossing that avoids the city.
Problem -- Opposition from coastal communities on both ends.
Fate -- Allowed to languish.
 To link Long Island to the mainland with a path of steel and concrete over Long Island Sound has been a dream of many planners and officials. Robert Moses wanted a bridge between Bayville and Rye, N.Y., in part to speed truck traffic on the East Coast. An engineer who studied the proposal in 1968 breezily concluded that such a bridge would quickly pay for itself. 
 Construction was begun on Route 135 to feed the bridge, but residents of Oyster Bay and Bayville dug in to fight it. Despite the economic benefits and convenience for drivers, the bridge would have blighted ''one of the few areas left that still look like they did 100 years ago,'' said Geri Solomon, assistant dean for special collections at Hofstra University.
 Meanwhile, competing proposals divided bridge supporters. A state study group recommended a 10-mile causeway from Rocky Point to Old Saybrook, Conn.; a plan for a 24.6-mile chain of bridges linking Orient Point and Napatree, R.I., would have cost twice as much. 
 Planners still talk about a Sound crossing, but give it little emphasis today. In a study of Long Island's needs after 2000, the state Department of Transportation said a Sound crossing would have been a wash, in terms of relieving congestion. 

A New ExpresswayFor the North Shore
Proposed -- 1970.
Purpose -- Relieve congestion on the L. I. E., remove through traffic from local roads.
Problems -- Cost, local opposition.
Fate -- Allowed to languish for years, eventually abandoned.
 Rona Wafajow of Huntington enjoys driving the curving tree-shaded stretches of Route 25A near her home -- until she finds herself stuck behind a five-ton truck. 
 An expressway to sweep the trucks and commuters off North Shore secondary roads would have made sense, Ms. Wafajow said. As it is now, Route 25A is often jammed, and ''everybody wants to jump ahead of one another,'' she said, especially where the road narrows to a single lane each way.
 East-west secondary roads like Route 25A, Jericho Turnpike, Old Country Road and Pulaski Road bear unusual burdens on Long Island, as many drivers try to avoid choked expressways and parkways. In 1970, the Nassau-Suffolk Regional Planning Board estimated that 15 more lanes of east-west highway were needed. It recommended a new 40-mile expressway to be built somewhere between the Northern State Parkway and the Sound. 
 The precise right of way was never spelled out, but it probably would have replaced at least some stretches of Northern Boulevard, and would have required condemnation of some very expensive real estate. 
 A preview of the likely community reaction came in 1957, when the state proposed realigning Northern Boulevard in Manhasset to bypass a steep curving hill -- and half of the Miracle Mile shopping strip. After fierce opposition peaked at a long, raucous public hearing at Manhasset High School that was interrupted by a bomb scare, that plan was shelved.

A New ExpresswayFor the South Shore
Proposed -- 1936 and later.
Purpose -- Relieve or replace Sunrise Highway in Nassau.
Problem -- Community disruption.
Fate -- Abandoned in 1966.
 Access to Nassau County's South Shore is one of the major deficiencies of Long Island's highway network, with the only choices the cars-only Southern State Parkway and the endless traffic lights of Sunrise Highway. ''The whole southern half of the Island is underserved,'' said Mark Kulewicz, director of traffic engineering and safety for the Automobile Club of New York.
 In the 1960's, the Tri-State Transportation Commission laid out a plan for an Atlantic Expressway in Nassau, in place of Sunrise Highway or parallel to it. From the Queens line to Wantagh, the highway was pictured as an elevated eight-lane roadway on columns or earth fill, according to nycroads.com. From there east to Amityville, it would narrow to four lanes and be below grade, with service roads on each side. 
 Steve Anderson, the former Long Island resident who created nycroads.com, said building it would have been hard even then. But had it been built, he said, an Atlantic Expressway would greatly help move traffic through the area, just as the expressway-grade stretch of Sunrise Highway has in Suffolk. 
 But now, even a modest upgrade along the Nassau portion is out of the question, Mr. Kulewicz said, because the business corridor that has grown up around Sunrise Highway is too important to demolish. ''If you could have seen 50 years into the future to build it, then maybe,'' he said.

Cedarhurst to Roslyn In Less Than an Hour
Proposed -- 1952.
Purpose -- Creating a north-south through road in western Nassau.
Problems -- Cost, community disruption.
Fate -- Abandoned in the 1970's.
 Lee Koppelman of Stony Brook University calls it a textbook example of bad planning. On many days, a driver can go from Suffolk County all the way to Manhattan faster than from Great Neck to Woodmere, a distance of just 18 miles, because western Nassau, one of the most densely developed areas of Long Island, has no north-south expressway or parkway of its own. 
 ''Further east you have the Seaford-Oyster Bay Expressway and the Wantagh and Sagtikos State Parkways,'' said Sheila Pantuliano, a Baldwin resident, ''but there's nothing in western Nassau except the Meadowbrook, which is always backed up.'' 
 Not that people haven't tried to build one. As far back as early 1952, the state pushed a plan for a six-lane expressway from Atlantic Avenue in Freeport to Northern Boulevard in Roslyn. But hundreds of homes and businesses would have been displaced. Opponents won an agreement to extend the Meadowbrook State Parkway north instead; it linked with the Northern State Parkway in 1957.
 State officials tried again in 1963, with a route that was to start at Sunrise Highway in Valley Stream, and snake northward along the Long Island Rail Road West Hempstead branch and some disused tracks in Hempstead and Garden City, finally curving northwest to Middle Neck Road in Port Washington, according to nycroads.com. But problems with the right of way made it unfeasible. 

A Parkway Past Stony Brook
Proposed -- 1960's and 1970's.
Purpose -- Extend the Northern State to north-central Suffolk.
Problems -- Rapid development, environmental issues.
Fate -- Shelved repeatedly.
 When Smithtown and northern Brookhaven began to develop rapidly in the 1960's, it was obvious to planners that a road would be needed from Hauppauge to Port Jefferson Station, through what was largely empty land in those days. To serve the area, Robert Moses proposed extending the Northern State Parkway along a right of way that Suffolk County already owned. 
 But it never happened, and Route 347 was built instead. Now, with that road choked with traffic and development and the state planning costly and excruciating upgrades for it, the failure to extend the parkway looks like a costly error to some. 
 ''Had the road been maintained as a limited-access highway as originally envisioned, perhaps we would have fewer of the local traffic issues,'' said John Kennedy, a Suffolk legislator from Hauppauge. ''It would have obviated the gridlock,'' he added.
 Michael and Mary Mart of Port Jefferson, who have operated a bookstore in the village since 1972, said that in hindsight a parkway would have been a better choice than Route 347, which they now try to avoid. 
 ''It would have made sense if we knew what the population was going to be now,'' Mr. Mart said. ''But then, Port Jefferson was considered extremely out of the way. It was considered the end of the world then.''
 The state last studied extending the parkway in the 1970's, and found that rapidly rising land costs, environmental problems and community opposition would make it impossible. Later plans to upgrade Route 347 to an expressway have also foundered. 

Easing the Squeeze On the South Fork
Proposed -- Early 1980's.
Purpose -- Relieve the bottleneck near the Shinnecock Canal.
Problem -- Environmental issues.
Fate -- Shelved in 1984.
 Hardly anyone who lives in or visits the East End wants an expressway barging through it. But though travel times there have become a maddening guessing game, urgent road upgrades remain years away. Motorists can only sit and suffer, and wish the work had started long ago.
 State officials were ready in 1969 to extend Sunrise Highway 23 miles from Shinnecock Hills along Peconic Bay to Amagansett, but local opposition was stiff. 
 ''The money was appropriated, and D.O.T. was summarily left at the altar,'' said Ann LaWall, a Southampton traffic commissioner and executive director of the Southampton Business Alliance. ''That route would have traveled over very sensitive terrain. I wasn't for it then, and I'm not for it now.'' 
 In the late 1970's, Suffolk County offered an alternative, widening and upgrading 11 miles of County Road 39 in Southampton. It, too, met intense opposition. ''They didn't want it then, but they want it all now,'' said William Hillman, Suffolk County's chief highway engineer. 
 Now that the situation has reached what Ms. LaWall called a crisis stage, the county has revived the proposal, but Mr. Hillman said work could not begin until 2008 at the soonest -- and then only if federal financing becomes available.

Here are some of the most prominent unbuilt projects.OYSTER BAY-RYE BRIDGEA road link to the mainland that bypassed New York City would have made the Island much more accessible, but some experts say it would have introduced as much traffic pressure as it relieved. It was the most famous case of a project killed by the bitter opposition of local residents, many of them wealthy and influential. Some of the right of way to extend Route 135 to the bridge is still in state hands.NORTH SHORE EXPRESSWAYMeant to bypass or replace Northern Boulevard
a specific right of way was never chosen.SOUND SHORE PARKWAYLinking several state parks and the Oyster Bay-Rye bridge, it would have closed off several bays and harbors with bridges, intruded on beaches and all but obliterated the village of Asharoken
it never moved past preliminary planning.ATLANTIC EXPRESSWAYPlanned to run the width of Nassau, just north of the L.I.R.R. Babylon branch and Sunrise Highway
it would have displaced or isolated parts of a dozen village business districts that grew up around the train.WESTERN NASSAU EXPRESSWAYCommunity opposition halted it in the 1950's, when 365 houses stood in its way
the area has since been developed so densely that building it now might mean condemning three times as many properties.CAUMSETT PARKWAYWould have extended the Bethpage Parkway north to Cold Spring Harbor and Lloyd Neck
 much of the right of way later became a linear state park.NORTHERN STATE PARKWAY EXTENSIONRobert Moses meant to use the Nesconset Highway right of way to extend the parkway to Mount Sinai, but he left office before the plan could advance. The route is now among the most congested on the Island.Maps of Long Island show the locations of the aforementioned proposed projects. (pg. 3)

HEADLINE: Former Executive Chosen to Lead N.A.A.C.P.

BYLINE: By ANNE BERRYMAN

DATELINE: ATLANTA, June 25 

 BODY:
The N.A.A.C.P., departing from a custom of looking to political or religious figures to lead the organization, named a former business executive, Bruce S. Gordon, as its president and chief executive on Saturday.
 Meeting in private, about 60 members of the organization's board voted unanimously to choose Mr. Gordon, 59, who retired in 2003 as president of the retail markets group for Verizon Communications. Mr. Gordon will now negotiate a contract with the N.A.A.C.P.'s executive committee; if they reach a deal, the board will formally vote on Mr. Gordon's appointment at its convention next month in Milwaukee. 
 A force in the 1960's civil rights movement and still a leading voice for African-Americans, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has recently faced criticism for its lack of membership growth. The current membership is about 500,000, said John White, a spokesman for the group. 
 The group has also faced financial woes, accusations of misconduct by its former president, and an Internal Revenue Service inquiry into its tax-exempt status prompted by criticism of the Bush administration last year by Julian Bond, the N.A.A.C.P. chairman. Tax-exempt organizations are supposed to be nonpartisan; Mr. Bond has said he was objecting to policies, not a party, and he continues to speak against goals of the Bush administration, including private accounts within Social Security, and what he calls ''tax giveaways to the rich.'' 
 In a news conference Saturday after the vote, Mr. Gordon said, ''The N.A.A.C.P. should have a relationship with whoever is in the White House, regardless of whether he was put there by a blue state or a red state.''
 ''I hope we can find some ways to work together,'' he said of President Bush.
 If approved, Mr. Gordon would succeed Kweisi Mfume, who resigned in December, initially citing his desire for a vacation and to spend more time with his youngest son. But more recently, Mr. Mfume, just after announcing his intentions to run for a Senate seat from Maryland, was accused of giving raises and promotions to women at the N.A.A.C.P. with whom he had had relationships. He denied the accusations.
 Mr. Gordon was born in Camden, N.J., where his father founded a chapter of the association. By age 8 he was attending N.A.A.C.P. meetings with his parents, both teachers. He earned a bachelor's degree from Gettysburg College and a master's degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
 He began working at Bell of Pennsylvania as a management trainee in 1968 and spent 35 years in the telecommunications industry.
 He serves on the Executive Leadership Council, a national organization of black executives that trains high school and college students for corporate careers. Mr. Gordon and his wife, Tawana, live in New York City, and they have a 27-year-old son.
 Sensitive to the N.A.A.C.P.'s recent difficulties, Mr. Gordon spoke of cohesiveness in the organization several times during the news conference. He promised that the group ''will function in a united, consistent, respectful way.''
 Mr. Gordon spoke of trying to increase membership, work with other organizations, create an endowment and get the organization, which ran a deficit last year, on strong financial footing.
 Mr. Gordon said he would like the N.A.A.C.P. to address economic issues like the unemployment rate among African-American men; access to health care benefits; opportunities for black-owned companies to manage large pension funds; and representation for African-Americans in all levels of employment in corporations. 
 He said his own ''bias'' was that ''economic power and economic equality enables social justice.''
 ''The facts are as clear as can be that people of color are treated by a different standard,'' Mr. Gordon said. He said his goal was to ''change the deficit that exists between our community and the community at large.'' 
 When asked afterward whether that represented a decreased emphasis on politics, Mr. Gordon said, ''I'm going where the trouble is.'' 
 At the start of his news conference, he said, ''This day will stand out in my life as no other,'' adding, ''My biggest hope is that many days from now this day will stand out in the history of the N.A.A.C.P.''

HEADLINE: Sharing Housing Costs And Herb Gardens In Oregon's Largest City 

BYLINE: By LINDA BAKER

DATELINE: Portland, Ore. 

 BODY:
SHELLEY FLYNN, a program director for Volunteers of America, had considered buying the two-bedroom house she had been renting in the southeast part of the city, but she worried about stretching her budget to pay the $200,000 mortgage.
 So last summer, Ms. Flynn, who is 32, bought a $246,000 bungalow in the same neighborhood with her friend Janet Bartholomew, a sales manager at the Bullseye Glass Company, a glass manufacturer for artists and architects. Ms. Bartholomew's boyfriend, Woody Sleeper, shares the house with the two women as a renter. 
 ''I realized that economically it would have been really challenging for me to buy a house alone, and even if I did do it alone I still would have had to take on roommates,'' said Ms. Flynn, who moved to Portland six years ago from Boston. ''So why not look at doing it with friends, where there's at least a better chance of having a living situation that works?'' 
 As housing prices in Portland enter a second year of double-digit appreciation, a growing number of first-time home buyers are seeking entry into the market by purchasing houses with friends. Although no exact figures are available, local realtors, mortgage brokers and other housing experts say co-ownership arrangements are springing up with increasing frequency. 
 ''The cost of the market has gotten so high that many people are priced out if they buy alone,'' said Michelle Puggarana, a trainer with the Portland Housing Center, a nonprofit group that connects buyers to housing options. At least two people in each of her biweekly workshops expresses interest in some kind of joint tenancy with friends, Ms. Puggarana said. ''The reality is that we will see more and more of these types of purchases.'' 
 In the metropolitan Portland area, the median home price was $230,000 in May, 12.7 percent higher than the price in the comparable month in 2004, $204,000. 
 The trend toward co-ownership is also fueled by the city's high proportion of young adults, many of whom express interest in pursuing alternative, community-oriented lifestyles. 
 According to a recent study of migration by 25- to 34-year-olds, the Portland area ranks eighth in attracting that group -- the top three cities are Las Vegas, Austin, Tex., and Phoenix -- and it is fourth in attracting people in that age group with college degrees. The report -- published in 2004 and sponsored by the Portland Development Commission and the Westside Economic Alliance, an economic development association -- says young adults like the city's distinctive neighborhoods, public transportation, bike friendliness and environmental ethic, as well as its open-minded, tolerant attitudes. 
 Ms. Bartholomew, who rented an apartment with Mr. Sleeper before buying her current home with Ms. Flynn, said she prefers communal houses. ''In a romantic situation, you act as a unit,'' Ms. Bartholomew said. ''When you're living with friends, you're more of an individual. It feels healthy, fresh.'' 
 Eli Spevak, 34, who develops affordable housing, and his friend Jim Labbe, 33, an urban conservationist with the Audubon Society of Portland, also fit the progressive Portland demographic. In 2003, the two men converted a run-down seven-unit apartment complex, Peninsula Park Commons, into an affordable condominium community for their friends and acquaintances, including one couple with a 15-month-old child. 
 Mr. Spevak and Mr. Labbe sold the 630-square-foot one-bedroom units for around $90,000 each; the 720-square-foot two-bedrooms went for about $112,000. Mr. Spevak plans to build several three-bedroom units in a lot next to the existing complex, which is in a gentrifying neighborhood several miles northeast of downtown Portland.
 Profit was not a motivator, he said. ''We wanted to live among friends and informally share things like a canoe and lawnmower,'' he said. 
 Peninsula Park Commons is fronted by a landscaped courtyard featuring native plants, a vegetable garden and patio furniture where residents can gather to share evening meals. 
 A communal unit, which Mr. Labbe and Mr. Spevak set aside as a shared space for all residents, includes high-speed computer access, a discreetly covered television and a bedroom for out-of-town guests. Earlier in the week, Mr. Spevak said, residents held a T-shirt-making party in the common room to prepare for Pedalpalooza, an annual citywide bicycle celebration.
 Mr. Spevak and Mr. Labbe formed a limited liability corporation, Peninsula Park Commons, to buy and operate the complex, then converted the building into condominium units, which they sold to themselves and their friends.
 In most cases when friends share a house, they follow standard home loan and payment procedures. ''It's one of those places where lenders just don't care,'' said Julee Felsman, a senior loan consultant with Equity Home Mortgage in Portland. ''They throw the income into one pot.''
 Ms. Felsman, though, did advise prospective buyers to talk to a lawyer and think about an exit strategy. ''One party might get on someone's nerves or get married,'' she said. 
 Ms. Flynn and Ms. Bartholomew, who had discussed several ''what if'' scenarios but never put anything in writing, said the household weathered its first crisis a few weeks ago when Ms. Flynn broke with the threesome's vegetarian philosophy. ''Shelley left a greasy chicken pan in the sink,'' Ms. Bartholomew said. ''It was a blowout ordeal.'' 
 Portland residents who have remained in joint households for several years have benefited from the region's strong price appreciation. In 1999, Saima Gillette, a special-education teacher, bought a three-bedroom, $140,000 house in North Portland -- about a mile south of Peninsula Park Commons -- with her married friends Tom and Shelley Butler. ''I wanted to live in a community, and it seemed like a good way to invest money,'' said Ms. Gillette, who had contributed $3,000 as a down payment. 
 When Ms. Gillette decided to move out last summer, the house had almost doubled in value. Her friends bought her out for $30,000. 
 ''Tom and Shelley had a baby last summer, and I said, 'O.K., I'm not into that,''' said Ms. Gillette, who now lives alone in a rented studio loft. ''Things have their season.''

HEADLINE: Welcome to Asbury Park, a Work in Progress

BYLINE: By ROBERT STRAUSS

DATELINE: ASBURY PARK 

 BODY:
IT is a breezy, sunny Thursday -- full of promise, it would seem, for the summer ahead. Yet in downtown Asbury Park, the streets are empty, eerily so. This compact seaside city -- founded with a somewhat religious fervor in the late 1800's -- has experienced many revivals in the century or so since then.
 Bettye Atkins is a believer.
 ''It's exciting and I feel it coming,'' said Ms. Atkins, who for the past eight years has owned Footsteps in Paradise, a shoe store downtown. ''I am one of the pioneers and I am looking forward to the new faces.'' 
 Eight years can seem like forever, but Ms. Atkins said she is not worried if she has to wait a little bit more. ''Some people say the time is now, but I say it will take 5 or 10 years. Still, you keep a positive spiritual attitude and it will come around.''
 The next couple of years will be crucial for this city of almost 17,000, which watched its fortunes plummet in the latter part of the 20th century, and for a time the city struggled to reinvent itself as it shrugged off shaky developers and shady elected officials. 
 Until now, redevelopment has been scattered and slow, and a stroll through this faded resort can still be a grim experience. Several years ago, gays -- who had grown tired of the scene, the schlep and the soaring prices of the Hamptons and Fire Island -- were attracted to Asbury Park by the affordable housing and beautiful if tattered architecture. And these days million-dollar condominiums are selling briskly and a milelong swath of the boardwalk has been repaired. 
 The next hurdle is simply whether enough people will buy into something that is at once a dream and a memory. 
 The statistics can push the story either way. On the plus side, the big numbers seem to be 44 and $1.1 million, as in 44 of 48 condominiums ranging in price from the mid-$400,000's to $1.1 million already sold in the new eight-story Barcelona -- a three-building beachfront condominium complex that is expected to be completed next year.
 Yet there are other daunting numbers. There is the poverty rate: 36.1 percent of the city's residents live below the poverty level -- the highest rate of any city in New Jersey except for Camden. And there are 20.5 violent crimes per 1,000 citizens, double the rate of any other municipality in Monmouth County. 
 Nor does it stop there. The unemployment rate in Asbury Park is 12 percent, more than three times the state average. There are 100 women for every 88 men; 30 percent of the population is younger than 18 and more than 40 percent of the children live in poverty. In 2002, only 25 percent of the city's high school graduates went on to college, and 51 percent of the middle school students had either been suspended at one time or expelled completely.
 For a city investing so heavily on its future, Larry Fishman, chief operating officer of Asbury Partners -- the lead developer for the city's waterfront properties -- is unusually blunt. Earlier this year, he said that he would still recommend that families with children not buy in Asbury Park because of its troubled school system.
 ''In some ways, I regret that statement because it came off so negative,'' Mr. Fishman said. ''But you have to understand that there is still a way to go in Asbury Park and buyers of expensive properties might not want to use a school system that will eventually improve.
 ''The city was hit particularly hard by the urban unrest of late 1970's and early 1980's. A large part of the tax base disappeared and there was a general disregard for the important qualities the city had, either by the former municipal governments or people who might have been potential investors for the city.''
 Still, Asbury Partners -- a private developer -- has glorious plans. There are 3,000 new housing units envisioned over the next 10 years, 525 of which should be finished by the end of next year, he said. In addition, there are also plans for nearly a half-million square feet of commercial and retail space along the oceanfront, and a similar amount among scattered developers downtown.

Not There Yet
 But the city is not there yet. Construction cranes dot the oceanfront and some buildings downtown show signs of renovation -- a piece of latticework scaffolding here, a Dumpster there, newly polished windows or pointed bricks on a building or two.
 Steven Troy owns one of those buildings, where he and his partner, Robert Legere -- both in life and in business -- have owned Robert Legere Home, a home-furnishings and interior-design company for almost three years, what Mr. Troy describes as an eternity here.
 ''I think we are going to be the first business to record a year with $1 million in sales in downtown Asbury Park in a long, long time,'' said Mr. Troy, who admitted that most of the firm's business was not derived from customers who walked in off the street. 
 On the other hand, he said that he and Mr. Legere had renovated the apartments above their business and recently sold one to a married couple, both doctors.
 ''It's just the type of sale the city is looking for,'' said Mr. Troy, who was recently appointed to the Asbury Park planning board. ''It's exciting. We just have to reach critical mass and things will snowball.''
 For a long time, the snowball had been rolling the other way -- eventually reaching an avalanche of bad news. Asbury Park's precipitous slide -- depending on whom you ask -- began in the late 1940's, the mid-50's, or the late 60's. 
 The reasons offered for Asbury Park's disintegration are many -- from the emergence of suburban living after World War II to construction of the Garden State Parkway to better airline travel to the city's racial upheaval to shopping malls to Great Adventure to the release of mental patients to ethically-challenged developers and city officials. There is even an excuse that Asbury Park was too fancy to keep up.
 ''Asbury Park had these magnificent structures, some built as early as the turn of the 20th century,'' said the city's historian, Werner Baumgartner. ''As the tourist trade started to decline in the 1960's and 1970's, and you were left with a large hotel, what could you do? The state started to mainstream people with controllable mental disorders and Asbury had these big places to accommodate them. It just furthered the city's growing bad rap. Its elegance pushed its demise.''
 Yet it was the buzz of nostalgia -- along with skyrocketing real estate prices up and down the New Jersey coast -- that kept Asbury Park going. 
 ''Homes that no one wanted five years ago, that may have gone for $150,000, are double and sometimes triple that now,'' said Gwen Pastorelli of the Mary Holder Agency in nearby Sea Girt. ''And people, in lots of cases New Yorkers, are buying them expecting the same thing to happen in the next five years.''
 Ms. Pastorelli, who went to kindergarten in Asbury Park, said that while local residents may still be somewhat skeptical of the boom here, New Yorkers -- particularly artists fleeing Greenwich Village and Brooklyn -- are enthusiastic.
 ''When artists come -- and Asbury is getting more and more a reputation of being an artsy community -- it's a win,'' she said. ''It gives the community a positive image.''
 Years before the artists arrived, there were great efforts on the part of Bruce Springsteen and his musical heirs, yet the city's boardwalk amusements declined to nearly nothing. While neighboring towns like Ocean Grove and Loch Arbor thrived, and other communities not too far away -- Rumson, Deal and Spring Lake -- went over the top in prestige and price, Asbury was mired in despair.

Developers Look to Future
 These days, developers are no longer disturbed by old news. Metro Homes, one of the subdevelopers with Asbury Partners, has done much of its work in Hoboken, another New Jersey city that was down on its luck and is now thriving.
 ''It is an energy you feel right now,'' said Paul Fried, a general partner of Metro Homes, which is building the Esperanza, a 224-unit condominium complex a block from the ocean. 
 There will be two towers of 16 and 10 stories, and a design that Mr. Fried said is the architect's interpretation of wind and waves. 
 ''This is a place people have long looked to for fun, and we want to do as much as we can to bring it back,'' he said. ''It is true that it is a long way back, a lot of it in memories, but the time seems to finally be right.''
 The city manager, Terence J. Reidy, who generally speaks for the city on development issues, said things are happening in Asbury Park now because of stability in city government and, to be sure, the lack of other places along the New Jersey Shore that have land to develop.
 ''The mayor and the current council came in after a long time of failed development and municipal corruption,'' said Mr. Reidy, referring to the 2003 conviction of former Mayor Kenneth E. Saunders and the indictment of several of his aides and political associates for fraud and tax evasion related to development. ''They went about this latest round of redevelopment methodically with competent developers. I won't say there won't ever be another mistake or slip-up, but there are checks in place, and things seem to finally be going well.''
 In part, Asbury Park may have an easier time in terms of redevelopment than, say, Atlantic City because of the compactness of the city; the 2000 census showed 16,930 residents in a city of only about 1.5 square miles.
 ''You can compare it, I guess, with Atlantic City, which was bigger and really bad,'' said James Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. ''There may not be as much to overcome. Plus, there is a real boom going on in oceanfront property. Asbury Park has a lot of it, and they aren't making any more.''
 So while the lack of schools and services may deter families from settling in Asbury Park in the near future, Mr. Hughes said, that should not keep away the panoply of empty nesters, from retirees to young singles to the gay community. 
 Mr. Troy was looking for just such a place after he retired early from his advertising career.
 ''I had lived for 27 years in California before I came to New York,'' he said. ''Then I spent two summers in Provincetown and two on Fire Island. Every time I bid for a place in Fire Island, boom, I'd get outbid right away.''
 He read about the possibility of Asbury Park becoming a gay enclave, and he ventured down in April 2000.
 ''I was shocked by what I saw,'' he said. ''These grand homes on the North End with such great potential. We were able to buy one without a problem.''
 Mr. Troy and Mr. Legere, who left a successful fashion design business, saw in the aftermath of Sept. 11 a need among people to get out of the major cities, yet stay nearby. They started their home-furnishings and interior-design business and became active in city planning and other organizations.
 ''I really believe that this will be the next great city of the sea,'' Mr. Troy said. ''I believe it more than I did the day I came here five years ago.''
 But not quite yet. Those condominiums on the waterfront -- even those 44 already sold -- have not yet been built, and the first is not expected to be finished before the end of 2006. The smattering of new restaurants that have opened are generally not open early in the week but fill up quickly on the weekends. 
 For now, people are renting summer homes and apartments in neighboring Ocean Grove. The Stone Pony, the premier rock club, is on Preservation New Jersey's list of endangered places, and the crime and poverty rates in the residential areas have not changed appreciably in years.
 But as long as there are people like Mr. Troy and Mr. Fishman making investments and Ms. Atkins willing to wait, the revival of Asbury Park may not be so bizarre a dream. After all, its was belief that gave birth to Asbury Park in the first place.

Founded as a Christian Resort
 It was founded as a Christian resort by a New York brush manufacturer and real estate speculator, James A. Bradley, who named it after Francis Asbury, a circuit-riding preacher who was the first Methodist bishop in the United States. The town grew considerably in the 1880's and 90's, particularly after an outbreak of diphtheria in Long Branch in 1887.
 ''I came here from Fair Haven, which is a pretty affluent town, because I had a girlfriend on her deathbed who saw me opening a shoe store and being successful,'' Ms. Atkins said. ''I don't know, this was her dream, so it became my goal. I didn't know anything about the retail business. I was a social worker.
 ''But here I am eight years later and I have customers from everywhere and I'm hanging in there,'' said Ms. Atkins, who has also done social work and run food concessions on the boardwalk to make ends meet.
 ''Now maybe the redevelopment will take off and I'll be ready,'' she said. ''I'm not afraid if it doesn't again this time, though. I'm happy to be here and I'm ready to stick it out longer.''

HEADLINE: Some Summer Moments to Remember (or Perhaps Forget)

BYLINE: By Neil Genzlinger

 BODY:
NEW JERSEY'S summer officially began on Tuesday, causing we at the Jersey Column to wonder: What would a collage of the Garden State's most memorable summer moments look like? We didn't know, so we sought input from an assortment of history buffs, longtime residents and ordinary smart alecks. We asked them to pick a pivotal moment from summers of yore, one that they would have liked to experience or, if they were there for the original, would like to experience again. 
 The results were nothing if not eclectic -- kind of like New Jersey summers themselves:

MONMOUTH COUNTY, 1778: Late June, of course, brought the Battle of Monmouth. Richard Veit, a professor at Monmouth University who wrote ''Digging New Jersey's Past,'' would like to have seen it (''from a distance,'' he notes), partly to compare how archaeological efforts at the battlefield match up with how things actually unfolded, but partly for a somewhat less scholarly reason.
 ''George Washington is reputed to have used foul language with General Lee at the battle,'' he said. ''Historians have long debated what was said, by whom and in what tone. I would love to know. Was Lee called a damned poltroon, or something stronger?'' 

HADDONFIELD, 1858: Hoag Levins, editor of HistoricCamdenCounty.com, wishes he had accompanied a visiting Philadelphian named William Foulke to one particular dinner in Haddonfield that summer. The dinner's host told Foulke, an amateur fossil collector, of some curiously large bones seen in a marl pit.
 ''That conversation,'' Mr. Levins said in an e-mail message, ''led to the digging that by fall had unearthed Hadrosaurus foulkii, the fossil skeleton that gave science its first look at the full and quite peculiar anatomy of a dinosaur.'' 

OCEAN CITY, 1880: Paul S. Anselm, president of the Ocean City Historical Museum, wishes he could travel back 125 years to see for himself the summer when a famed resort was basically created from scratch on a slip of land now known as Ocean City.
 ''Seven and a half miles long, nothing but grass and dunes: that's what it was when they started,'' Mr. Anselm said. The founders, he said, ''were good Christian men, but they knew their business'' -- if they wanted the crowds to come, they realized, they had to have something for them to come to.
 ''That first year must have been unbelievably busy,'' he said. If he is preoccupied with 1880, it's understandable: a recent museum renovation turned up a previously unknown diary written by one founder, S. Wesley Lake, during the period.

OVER THE DELAWARE, 1926: Sandy Levins, program director at the Camden County Historical Society (and wife of the aforementioned Mr. Levins), would have liked to be among the thousands who turned out on the first day of July to tread on the region's newest marvel: the Delaware River Bridge, since renamed for Benjamin Franklin. People were invited to walk across the span before it was opened to traffic, and the experience was as scary as it was amazing.
 ''Fashionable ladies, accompanied by men in straw boaters, shuddered as they looked down at the river 135 feet below them, and then up at the bridge's massive steel towers,'' Ms. Levins said. 
 The region's economics were in for some shuddering as well, she said: the bridge put river ferries out of business, opened South Jersey to development and let Philadelphians more easily escape the city to head ''down the shore.''

ASBURY PARK, 1963: The place, says Helen-Chantal Pike, who wrote ''Asbury Park's Glory Days: The Story of an American Resort,'' was the Panorama Room of the local Howard Johnson. The occasion, that June, was the quaffing of the first alcohol on the boardwalk since the ''dry'' resort was founded in 1871.
 ''I was in the single digits then, so my HoJo elbow-bending was connected to a coffee ice-cream soda,'' she said, but what made the moment possible was a liquor license that was restricted to the restaurant's second floor. 

LONG BRANCH, 1881: Though it's out of chronological sequence, the suggestion from Andy Breckman of Summit, creator of the USA Network's nutty detective show ''Monk,'' has been saved for last because of its sheer audacity. In July 1881 a gunman shot President James A. Garfield in Washington; later he was brought to Long Branch in the futile hope that the sea air would help him recover. Why would Mr. Breckman have liked to be on hand when Garfield succumbed on Sept. 19?
 ''I'd always have the best story at any dinner party,'' he said, adding with his tongue buried in cheek, ''but I'm sure that's what everybody's going to say.''

HEADLINE: Revenge Of the Sniff

BYLINE: By TAMMY LA GORCE

 BODY:
FIRST, a couple of questions:
 Is it appropriate to tell a man that his fly is open? Answer: Yes, according to most manners experts.
Is it O.K. to pick your teeth with a business card that has just been handed to you? Answer: If you have to ask, you may as well crumple up this newspaper, toss it to the floor of your train and go back to bellowing into your cellphone.
 Yes, manners are back. And the etiquette business is booming in, of all places, New Jersey. Unlikely as it seems, corporations both in and out of the state are turning to a new generation of proper New Jerseyans for guidance on exceedingly good behavior. 
 In the last five years alone nearly a dozen businesses specializing in excellent posture and using the right fork -- from Cape May to Chatham -- have shepherded tens of thousands of trainees into straightening up and flying right. And they are persuading limp handshakers, clumsy small-talkers and all kinds of boarish boors nationwide to be next in line for class at an increasing clip.
 (Purists, of course, will sniff that the Garden State's penchant for good manners truly started with Millicent Fenwick, the iconoclastic congresswoman from Bernardsville who, as an associate editor at Vogue in the 1940's, wrote the pleasingly rigid ''Vogue's Book of Etiquette.'')
 Nonresidents -- having seen way too many episodes of ''The Sopranos'' -- might snicker, ascribing about as much faith in a New Jersey-led surge in manners awareness as a Texas-rooted trend toward daintiness, but Jonathan Reader, a sociology professor at Drew University in Madison, says the trend actually makes sense. 
 ''More white-collar people are coming to New Jersey,'' he said, ''and they're looking for comparable positions in management. They want to know what etiquette is.'' 
 More important, he added, ''is that any edge in the marketplace counts these days. That New Jersey would be a place companies outside the state would look for etiquette training isn't surprising. There are a lot of corporations here, and more and more that are turning to suburbia. In turn, New Jersey has influence.'' 
 And with New York City across the Hudson and the state's own swollen population, he said, ''people here need to know how to be forcefully polite.'' Or just plain polite. 
 ''I can't believe people don't know this, but you're not supposed to clip your fingernails or floss your teeth in front of other people,'' said Corby O'Connor, who runs Corby O'Connor and Company, a business etiquette and protocol training firm in Essex Fells. ''Employers are dismayed with the level of sophistication of their employees, and a lot of times they should be. It's dreadful. Kids show up for interviews wearing flip-flops and holding Starbucks cups. There are no standards.'' 
 What there is, says Ms. O'Connor -- who started her company in 1999 and who says she has conducted programs on dining etiquette, image and ''meeting and cubicle etiquette'' for employees at Merck, Prudential, Merrill Lynch and other major corporations in New Jersey and New York -- is hope.
 ''A lot of times people are really receptive to what we have to say. There's plenty of interest -- the business has been growing every year since I started it -- and it's all from word of mouth and referrals,'' she says. ''In a word, what we're offering is confidence. People want to be socially aware. They want to walk into a room and feel at ease.'' 
 The need for manners makeovers knows no geographic boundaries. Students in South Carolina are just as apt to flunk Barbara Pachter's etiquette awareness quiz as they are near Pachter and Associates' Cherry Hill headquarters, said Ms. Pachter, who travels for nearly half of the 100 seminars she holds annually. The demand for such training, propelled in New Jersey by Izod-clad country clubbers and shlubs alike, she says, squares with the economic reasons cited by Professor Reader.
 ''We're in an up cycle now,'' said Ms. Pachter, who co-wrote ''The Complete Business Etiquette Handbook'' (Prentice Hall), and has followed it with others, including ''The Jerk With the Cell Phone: A Survival Guide for the Rest of Us'' (Marlowe). ''In New Jersey we have a lot of pharmaceutical companies and a lot of financial companies, and the economy has gotten more competitive. I did a workshop at a major financial consulting company recently where the director lost a $30 million deal because he offended the client by licking his knife. When an incident like that happens, all of a sudden it's 'Uh-oh, we better do something.'''
 More broadly, manners mavens say, the rush to civility was brought on by a generation coming to terms with its somewhat slovenly upbringing. 
 ''People in business now never had a dress code when they were growing up, and schools got so fearful of litigation for a while that nobody wanted to be the one to say, 'You can't come to my class looking like that,''' said Maureen Sanders, president of High Road Solutions in Martinsville. ''Now young employees are kind of clueless. They aren't catching on, and they don't want to look like a lout. I'm always surprised at how eager kids are to learn.'' 
 For Ms. Sanders, who says her business has grown 100 percent since it started in 2000, ''kids'' can mean college students -- for several years she has conducted an annual ''quick and dirty'' on dining etiquette and presentation skills at Rutgers, Kean and Seton Hall -- or young professionals in accounting firms or insurance companies or, even, actual children. 
 But the real challenge is the adult who acts like a child. After watching executives pick inappropriate protuberances, a woman saunter barefoot into a corporate training session and more than their share of business diners sipping from -- oh, the utter shame -- the wrong glass of water, Ms. Sanders, Ms. Pachter and Ms. O'Connor would probably agree. So would Ann Nicol, of Nicol Associates in Glen Ridge, who regularly rails against casual Fridays at some of the state's most prominent law firms, which she declined to name. 
 ''Clothes are an issue, and people get very confused,'' she said. ''You have to explain that you can't wear flip-flops or dress like you're going to a garden party. People are starting to realize it's vital that they learn what's correct to be successful.'' 
 There are those, of course, who never forgot. And perhaps the real trick when it comes to etiquette, if you don't want an account executive to amuse clients by burping the company's name, is to snag future leaders when they're children.
 Lois Thomson, president of the Barclay School in Westfield, makes a practice of preserving propriety's old ways, right down to the starched party dresses and crystal punch bowls. ''We've been around for 75 years -- we started in Summit -- and we've always accepted children to our program by invitation only,'' said Ms. Thomson, who now operates her school in 17 communities across New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Connecticut. ''Children in third grade up through sixth and seventh learn for whom to stand, how to seat a partner, how to share a plate of cookies or a bowl of chips.'' 
 And they do it while wearing jackets and ties or white gloves and Mary Janes.
 For some children, this has resulted in ''wet pants and throwing up,'' she conceded, but evidence of its appeal has been renewed lately. ''Our enrollment has gone up in the last few years, and naturally we can't take everybody. But parents who were raised in the 70's under the 'live and let live' idea are anxious for their childrento have a little more control. People want this.''

HEADLINE: An Overhaul of the Horse Racing Industry in New York Is Recommended in a Study

BYLINE: By JOE DRAPE

 BODY:
New York's three major thoroughbred racetracks should be run as a business for profit in partnership with the state, all off-track betting outlets should be folded into the enterprise, and video lottery terminals should be allowed at Belmont Park, according to a study by an independent advocacy group to be released tomorrow.
 The group, Friends of New York Racing, said that by replacing the New York Racing Association with such a model, the state would attract capital investment of $500 million to $1 billion. It would produce more than $6 billion for education in its first 10 years and, by increasing current purses and breeder awards by more than 60 percent, assure the state's horse racing future, according to an executive summary of the report, which was obtained by The New York Times.
 ''No serious analyst would suggest if the policymakers and the industry were starting fresh, that New York horse racing and wagering would be organized as it is today,'' said the report, written by Tim Smith, the president and chief executive of the Friends of New York Racing. ''Based on the current circumstances -- fiscal, political, legal and otherwise -- there is perhaps the best chance in several decades to create a new and better model.'' 
 The New York Racing Association's franchise to run Belmont, Aqueduct and Saratoga Race Course expires after 2007, and on Friday the State Legislature established an oversight board that could take over the operations of the tracks if NYRA does not overcome its legal problems. Federal monitors have overseen its operations as part of a plea agreement for its role in a 2003 tax-evasion scandal involving several mutuel clerks.
 As early as August perhaps, they will issue a report to the United States Attorney's office on whether or not the association has carried out anti-corruption measures and good business practices. If so, the charges will be dropped against the association, which has paid a $3 million fine.
 Gov. George E. Pataki will appoint a nine-member ad hoc committee perhaps as early as July to come up with a process to put the racetracks up for bid. With 4,500 video lottery terminals to be in place at Aqueduct by next summer, New York's racing franchise is expected to attract numerous bids from well-heeled racetrack operators, casino companies, private equity firms and perhaps even technology companies. NYRA handles more than $2.7 billion in horse racing bets annually.
 In fact, the board of Friends of New York Racing includes some possible bidders for the association franchise, including the racetrack operators Churchill Downs Inc. and Magna Entertainment Corporation.
 But the two proposed business models in the study also reflect the goals of New York horse owners and breeders on the board who want to maintain a racing product that is considered second to none in the nation and that has an economic impact of $1.3 billion to the state, provides 16,900 jobs and encompasses more than 152,000 people, including owners, service providers, employees and volunteers.
 The first recommended model is a public-private partnership in which the state and participating local governments own 40 percent of the tracks and receive upfront fees totaling an estimated $150 million for the racing franchise and off-track betting jurisdictions and an equity ownership estimated to generate $695 million from 2007 to 2012. In the privatization model, the state would receive nearly $500 million up front, but no continuing ownership.
 The report notes that ''the creation of the New York City OTB in 1970 was perhaps the single biggest blow to NYRA's original business model, since it effectively eliminated a large percentage of NYRA's customers and revenues.'' It details the ''persistent insolvency'' of the racing association for the past 35 years, culling from audit reports by the state comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, and a criminal investigation by state Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, who concluded in a 2003 report, ''The current structure has not, does not and will not work.''
 With NYRA losing $10 million annually and the Off-Track Betting Corporation's fighting to stay afloat, the study recommends consolidating operations. 
 By installing an additional 5,000 video lottery terminals at Belmont Park, a mammoth and underused facility accessible from New York City and Long Island, the franchise would be attractive to outside investors.
 ''The current structures for horse racing and off-track wagering in New York are 50 and 30 years old, respectively,'' the report said. ''Today, there is broad agreement among policymakers, industry leaders, academics and others that the current NYRA and OTB business models are 'broken' in numerous ways and should be replaced.''

HEADLINE: Jeb Bush, a Fan of Surrealism

BYLINE: By DOMINIC PATTEN

 BODY:

In the land of the hurricane, the higher and more inland museum is king. The Salvador Dali Museum in St. Petersburg, Fla., home of the largest collection of Dali's work outside Spain -- and a place where visitors can buy flip-flops and lip balm bearing his visage -- wants a new building to battle the triple threat of too many storms, not enough space and not enough money. Recently, its hopes seemed as forlorn as the downcast face in ''The Average Bureaucrat,'' one of the paintings in its collection: Florida newspapers reported that Gov. Jeb Bush would veto relocation funds because he thought them an inappropriate use of the state's Conservation and Recreational Land Fund.

But late last month, Mr. Bush and the mayor of St. Petersburg, Rick Baker, reached a deal. The governor would let the $4 million allocation stand, and the city would spend $2 million to turn a parking lot across the street from the new museum site into a waterfront park. The museum also promised to match the state's contribution through local fund-raising; Mr. Baker said that close to $3.3 million had already been pledged.

The city's efforts on behalf of Dali, the Surrealist master, who died in 1989, are firmly based in reality. In 2004 the museum attracted more than 220,000 visitors (just 30,000 fewer than the city's population), who contributed an estimated $65 million to the local economy. In that year, Florida was hit with four hurricanes, which all posed a serious risk to St. Petersburg. Hank Hine, the museum's director, said the Dali had to move its collection of 100 paintings and more than 1,000 other works into storage twice because of the threat of flooding. The museum wants to move from its one-story structure on the waterfront, left, to a new three-story building downtown that would double its floor space to 20,000 square feet and, Mr. Hine said, ''get the collection up higher, away from any flooding.'' He estimated the total cost of the move at $25 million, some of which would come from the sale of the present building. Jacob DiPietre, Governor Bush's spokesman, said last week that Mr. Bush believed the Dali was ''an important museum, a great place to visit, and after the city made their own funding commitment, he felt releasing the funds was the right thing to do.''

HEADLINE: 'Watch Your Step' vs. 'Step Right In'

BYLINE: By AMY GUNDERSON

 BODY:
ANXIOUS Americans planning a trip to Bolivia the first week of June were probably spending as much time surfing the Web as they were packing their suitcases. On June 1, amid reports of volatile street protests calling for President Carlos Mesa to resign, the United States State Department posted an advisory on its Web site telling visitors to ''consider the potential for disruptions.'' Six days later, with gas and food shortages in La Paz and just days before the country's new president, Eduardo Rodriguez, was appointed, the message from the State Department was much more direct: Don't go.
 The quick shuffling of advisories, as with Bolivia, isn't unusual. In May alone six travel warnings were issued, including a softening of advice for Colombia after a drop in violence in big cities like Bogota. That same month there were seven public announcements, generally considered less serious than travel warnings, including one for a tropical storm barreling toward Central America and another that warned of terrorist threats against Americans in Uzbekistan (later upgraded to a warning). 
 These days, if you are traveling anywhere even remotely off the beaten track, you've probably made a stop on the State Department's Web site, www.travel.state.gov, to check the consular information sheets, public announcements and travel warnings that alert travelers to anything from potential terrorist activity to the likelihood of a natural disaster. But tour operators and private security companies, as well as government officials from the countries listed, complain that the advice is often not timely, too broad or politically motivated. 
 Bruce McIndoe, the chief executive of iJet Intelligent Risk Systems, a security firm that advises corporations and individuals on travel risks, says that the advisories -- specifically the ''warnings'' category -- often tend to ''paint an entire country with a brush.
 ''Any country is diverse,'' Mr. McIndoe continued. ''I would be very confident of taking my family on safari in Kenya. I would not want to hang out in Nairobi too long.'' 
 James Dobbins, a former State Department official and now the director of the International Security and Defense Policy Center at the RAND Corporation, disputes that travel advisories are politically motivated but acknowledges that they are often put out with a just-in-case element. ''It's not a practical possibility for the government to ignore a threat even if a country might be annoyed by an advisory,'' Mr. Dobbins said. 
 And there certainly is an annoyance factor. Since the impact on tourism can be great, the release of an advisory is often greeted by political wrangling to get the advice reworded. For example, two years ago concerns about terrorist activity in Kenya prompted travel warnings from the United States and Britain urging visitors to defer nonessential travel there. Tour operators canceled trips, British Airways halted Kenya-bound flights and the number of American visitors dropped by 42 percent, according to the Kenya Tourist Board. 
 The British government has since canceled its warning but as of press time Kenya remained on the State Department's list. Though the advice was softened in May 2004, to encourage travelers to consider the risks of visiting Kenya rather than avoid it altogether, the Kenyan government, as well as tour operators, have been on a crusade to get the warning reclassified as a public announcement. But the risks in the country were not of a short-term nature, which would qualify it for a public announcement, said Angela Aggeler, a spokeswoman for the Bureau of Consular Affairs of the State Department, who notes that travel warnings are typically reviewed every six months. 
 Many tour operators are baffled as to why the Kenya warning is there at all. ''One has to accept that the State Department may know more than the rest of us,'' said Dennis Pinto, managing director of Micato Safaris, which operates trips into Kenya's game parks. ''But after all the steps that have been taken to beef up security, it seems there is no valid reason for continuing it.''
 Despite the criticism, tour operators often do react swiftly to the notices. Butterfield & Robinson, which offers bicycling and hiking trips, has not gone to Nepal since 2001 because of American and Canadian travel alerts. Tauck World Discovery used to include a three-night stay in Bali as part of its Southeast Asia tour, but has not returned since the night club bombing in 2002. ''Bali is perfectly safe but there is a fairly strong wording on the advisory,'' said Scott Supernaw, Tauck's vice president for sales and marketing.
 Surprisingly, not much has changed since Sept. 11, 2001, in the way that the State Department has issued advisories. The biggest change in the system came more than a decade earlier when the government made it a policy to share with the public the travel information it was giving to diplomats.
 Britain, however, reviewed its travel advisories last spring. ''We wanted to be more descriptive than prescriptive,'' a spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said. Notices are now more detailed and make a recommendation to not travel to all or parts of a country only if there is a major war, civil unrest, natural disaster or an extreme specific threat of terrorist activity. 
 While the lists of American, Canadian and British travel advisories contain many of the same countries, there are some noticeable differences. The United States encourages travelers to defer all nonessential travel to Indonesia, while Britain advises against travel to just certain regions of the country. Nepal and Egypt don't appear on any British travel warnings but do crop up on those of the United States and Canada. 
 That said, there are destinations with travel warnings that have done little to curb tourism interest. Geographic Expeditions has not made any changes to its 11-day trip to Bolivia in July, and Abercrombie & Kent is still planning to send travelers to Bolivia this fall. Travel restrictions to Libya were lifted last year, and since then, there has been a flood of interest, despite a warning that urges visitors to exercise caution when visiting the country. 
 Over time, some travel warnings start to lose their impact. Since the United States softened its language about Kenya last spring, travel has rebounded. Micato Safaris is reporting its best year ever, with trips to Kenya nearly sold out. Tauck is returning to Kenya next year. Yet there remains the push to have the State Department warning reclassified as a public announcement. ''Everyone has been pressuring for the U.S. to take another look at the situation,'' said Maisa Fernandez, spokeswoman for the Kenya Tourist Board. ''Right now, this is a pivotal time -- people are on pins and needles.'' 

WHETHER TO VISIT DEPENDS ON WHOSE ADVICE YOU'RE TAKING
 When is a country considered too dangerous for travelers? In some cases, the answer lies in the eye of the beholder, as different governments attach varying degrees of danger to different situations. Australia, Britain and Canada have gray areas built into their warning systems through the use of separate lists. For example, Australia (online at www.smartraveller.gov.au) has two main lists, one that discourages all travel and one addressing only ''essential travel''; Britain (www.fco.gov.uk) has four categories; Canada (www.voyage.gc.ca), nine. In addition to its travel warnings, the United States State Department's Bureau of Consular Affairs (www.travel.state.gov) issues public announcements, usually in effect for shorter periods than warnings, and consular information sheets for all countries. Details were current in mid-June. 

Bolivia -- The country was added to the United States list of travel warnings after recent episodes of political unrest. Americans are urged to ''defer nonessential travel.'' Britain advises against ''all but essential travel to parts'' of the country. Canada discourages travel to ''specified regions.'' The country does not appear on Australian warning lists.

Colombia -- The United States recently softened the language in its warning about ''threats, kidnappings and other violence,'' noting that ''violence has decreased markedly in most urban centers.'' Canada advises against all travel to most regions. Britain advises ''against all travel to parts'' of the country and Australia advises against ''nonessential travel'' there.

Ecuador -- Britain advises ''against all travel to parts'' of the country, citing a June 7, 2004, bombing at the British Consulate in Guayaquil. The United States, Canada and Australia have no warnings.

India -- The United States has issued neither a travel warning nor a public announcement, but travel to Jammu and Kashmir, except for the Ladakh region, is particularly discouraged in the consular information sheet. Australia does not list India. Britain and Canada have issued warnings, advising against visiting areas along the Pakistani border and northeastern areas near Myanmar.

Kenya -- Despite efforts by the Kenyan government to improve security after terrorist attacks there in 1998 and 2002 and the recent removal of Kenya from all warning lists by Britain, the State Department maintains its warning. Canada places Kenya on its list of countries in which Canadians should not visit ''specified regions.'' Australia does not place the country on a warning list. AUSTIN CONSIDINE

HEADLINE: In Buying A Home, You Are What You Do

BYLINE: By TERI KARUSH ROGERS

 BODY:
CONSCIOUSLY or not, Manhattanites tend to subscribe to the you-are-what-you-do-for-a-living notion. So perhaps it's not surprising that from the vantage of real estate brokers who shepherd, coax, bully and pander to them, an apartment-hunter's behavior can play out in striking sync with his or her occupation. 
 Take Wall Street types, dissected with greatest avidity by real estate brokers asked to serve up generalities. While bubble phobia is hardly uncommon in this market, it haunts financial professionals the most, brokers say.
''They always think that they're buying at the top, and they want to buy at the bottom,'' said Charles Russell, a senior vice president at the Corcoran Group who has worked on Wall Street as a petrochemicals broker. ''Every Wall Streeter I've worked with in the last five years, they say, 'I don't want to buy now, the bubble is about to burst,' and then they come back to me a year later and have to pay a million more for the same apartment.'' 
 Quantification is the name of the game for finance workers. ''Some bankers, every time they look at an apartment they like, they say, 'We've got to go home and put it on the spreadsheet,''' said Mitzie Lau, a Corcoran sales agent, echoing her peers. ''It is very funny because you start thinking: 'What else do they do with their life? Do they put everything on a spreadsheet?'''
 Ann M. Kim, an agent at Halstead Property, said all her finance clients look for the same information. ''When it comes down to putting their money in something, they're going to look at the yield basis, how much they're going to rent the property for if they were to move out, and what type of return they're going to get if they're going to own long term,'' she said.
 In drilling down through the quantitative bedrock, this type of buyer can be oblivious to the gut appeal of a place. Bruce Bennett, another Corcoran agent, recalled the middle-aged private banker to whom he showed a two-bedroom, $1.1 million apartment at Fifth Avenue and East 35th Street in January. The client peppered him with questions about the building's reserve fund, price per square foot and amperage in the kitchen. 
 ''This guy was buried into the listing looking into the numbers,'' Mr. Bennett said, but the client ignored the high-quality kitchen renovation and the south- and east-facing windows spilling sunshine into the corner dwelling. ''I said, 'Have you noticed the view?''' Mr. Bennett recalled. ''You have a Fifth Avenue address and Fifth Avenue view. He looked over and said, 'Oh, yeah, I guess that will be good for resale.'''
 Those who toil at hedge funds amass fortunes by leveraging little-known information. Perhaps as a result, they suffer from a ''need-to-know-more syndrome'' -- as in more than the broker -- when hunting for real estate, said Frederick W. Peters, president of Warburg Realty. He compared this typically young group with the similarly youthful mergers-and-acquisitions bankers he dealt with in the 1980's. 
 ''I'm not suggesting that the younger guys are disrespectful,'' Mr. Peters said. ''It's more that they're sure they know what is going to happen.'' He offered his merchant-banking clients, in their 40's and 50's, as a study in contrast. ''When I deal with people who are a little older, they're more comfortable knowing what they know and letting me know what I know,'' he said. ''They don't sweat the small stuff. They just decided that they want what they want and they're prepared to pay what it costs to get it. The whole issue of winning isn't in the picture so much.''
 The propensity among the hedge-fund set for making large bets -- combined with the Monopoly-money feel of overnight fortunes -- can translate into bidding-war gusto. Not so for lawyers, whose comparatively thin bank accounts accrete more incrementally and whose jobs often depend on negotiating a meeting of the minds.
 ''The idea that there's anything that should be non-negotiable is extremely hard for them to deal with,'' Mr. Peters said. ''A market like that of the first quarter, in which for many properties you only get to negotiate up, that's very hard for them.'' He added, ''The main thing about lawyers is they tend to be kind of hypervigilant, since they're trained to think about every contingency, and it's very hard for them to turn that off when they're dealing on their own account. So my experience with lawyers is that you have to get every detail nailed down.''
 In general, some brokers say, older lawyers who have achieved major career milestones are easier to work with, just as older Wall Street executives tend to revel less in a masters-of-the-universe persona than do rising stars. ''They know what they have to spend, what they want, and they'll negotiate but they're not unreasonable,'' said Susan Gerard, a broker at Halstead. ''The ones who can be the most unreasonable are the junior associates who have just gotten a taste of a good salary but haven't quite made their mark yet. I find they can be a lot more demanding. They can have a whole laundry list of demands that are not always rational.''
 On the bright side, lawyers excel at providing the sort of minutiae required for board packages, unlike those in the creative fields, who are said by brokers to be less practical-minded -- a minus when it comes to closing a deal, but a plus when finding a property to buy.
 ''Creatives are often more open on where they will go,'' said Kathleen M. Sloane, a vice president and director at Brown Harris Stevens. ''They're more apt to say: 'Can you find me a penthouse in Hell's Kitchen, or one anywhere that's quirky? We don't care about the location; we care about being at the top of the building and having light.' They would be willing to buy the penthouse to which the elevator doesn't go. They're willing to make sacrifices in their lives.''
 The subset of creatives known as celebrities can be surprisingly pleasant to work with, brokers say, once the phalanx of money managers and advisers is pierced and communication occurs directly with the client. Perhaps because they're accustomed to listening to advisers, this group is said to be more trusting. ''With people in finance, when the selling broker says they have another offer, the person in finance will always say, 'Do you believe that?''' said Wendy J. Sarasohn, a senior vice president at Corcoran ''whereas the creative people will trust it.''
 Buyers from the media industry often try to ''scoop'' their broker with unpublicized information about recent sales. Ms. Lau of Corcoran says: ''I think they do that because that's part of what they do every day, so even in their personal life they do the same thing. They always try to feel more justified and validated by something you don't know already.'' On the positive side, she said, ''If you get one media person you get a whole bunch, because they tend to talk a lot with their friends.''
 Doctors tend to be viewed by brokers as an amenable if not particularly high-flying group, with location -- near their practice -- among their biggest concerns. After a typically half-hearted attempt to negotiate a lower commission, they tend to undertake a deliberate search.
 ''They are very good about seeing all the apartments and they remember very well the details,'' Ms. Lau said. ''And then what they usually do is they tell you why they pass on the apartment rather than the other way around. It's sort of like a diagnosis. But once they find something they like, they really stick to it, because they've analyzed all the facts, but it takes them a little longer.'' 
 Yet once the diagnosis is made and a contract is signed, said Andrew A. Fine, president of the real estate brokerage A. Fine Company, doctors don't want to deal with the details. ''They tend to think about things for a long time,'' he said. ''And they seem to have an attitude that once they go into contract, they really don't want to deal with the details. They just want to snap their fingers and have it done.''
 Teachers pose a different kind of frustration for brokers. ''Teachers are kind of hard because they like to study everything,'' Ms. Lau said. ''I mean, they sometimes make you feel like you're the dumb one, because they take so long looking at a neighborhood that they even remember lines of the apartments and names of buildings and their numbers.'' On the other hand, she added, ''Once they find something they like that they can live with, they will not be nickel and diming the price.''
 On the subject of nickel-and-diming, such behavior is also infrequent among captains of industry, according to Leighton Candler, a senior vice president at Corcoran whose clients include a fair number of such figures. Not that this crowd moves very often. ''When you're in one of the rare, beautiful pieces of real estate in Manhattan, you don't give it up until you've found the one perfect thing that's a little different,'' Ms. Candler said.
 Stereotypes are just that, of course, with many exceptions to the rule. But the canniest brokers recognize that one person's stereotype is another's marketing tool. Mr. Bennett of Corcoran said he positions properties according to buyers' occupations. 
 ''If I know they come out of heavy-duty strategic, financial or analytical background, I start talking about what the building's financials are, the requirements financially they'll need to get into the building,'' Mr. Bennett said. ''If it's a person who is a touchy-feely kind, you know, who works in entertainment or creative writing or that kind of stuff, then I will go into the sunlight and the spaciousness of the space and how oversized the windows are.'' He added, ''When you position yourself that way, people end up thinking that you're very much connecting to them and listening to them.''
 And what of brokers turned buyers? Does their up-close view of others' peccadilloes translate into model buying behavior? Not by a long shot, says Mr. Peters of Warburg Realty, who has often observed the imperfect metamorphosis among his own agents.
 ''In general, the minute you put them in the position of being a buyer or a seller, they behave exactly like a buyer or a seller, and everything they know about the market goes completely out the window,'' said Mr. Peters, who has watched agents become huffy over routine board questions that suddenly seem invasive. ''I say that to them all the time -- 'You're acting like the client you wish you never had.'''

HEADLINE: From Staples To Shanghai

BYLINE: By Robert Johnson

 BODY:
Here's another sign that free enterprise has a huge future in China: Thomas G. Stemberg, the serial entrepreneur, was in Shanghai this month scouting for young companies to back with venture capital.
 Mr. Stemberg, 56, of Boston, who founded Staples Inc. and later a dry-cleaning company and a children's shoe retailer, is ready to start something again. And again and again. 
 ''I can't think of anything more fun to do with my life than helping some young people make their enterprising dreams come true the way I have been fortunate enough to do,'' he said, speaking by cellphone while looking for his luggage after landing in Shanghai.
 Accompanying him were several colleagues from Highland Capital Partners in Lexington, Mass., where Mr. Stemberg is a partner. His first assignment was to find worthy candidates for some of the firm's $1.8 billion in committed capital. 
 Mr. Stemberg, who has an M.B.A. from Harvard, spent 12 years climbing the corporate ladders of two supermarket chains before deciding to apply some retailing fundamentals to office products. He opened the first Staples store in Brighton, Mass., in 1986. The company now has almost 1,700 stores and revenue of more than $14 billion.
 Mr. Stemberg, who took Staples public in 1989, retired as C.E.O. in 2002 and as chairman in March this year. In his last few years at Staples, he was also working on new ventures, founding Zoots, the dry-cleaning company, in 1998. It specializes in home-delivery routes in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Hampshire and Virginia. He also helped to start Olly Shoes, a chain of children's footwear stores, in 2001.
 Corporate board memberships also consume some of Mr. Stemberg's time. He is a director of CarMax Inc., the seller of used cars; Petsmart, the pet-supply chain; Polycom, the audio- and video-conferencing equipment maker; and the Nasdaq. His favorite nonprofit work is serving as a trustee of the Boston Symphony Orchestra.
 When he isn't traveling, he likes to rise early to play squash at the Harvard Club or tennis at the Longwood Cricket Club.
 Fitting in exercise is easier now than it was when he ran Staples.
 ''I have ratcheted down my work schedule to 60 or 70 hours a week from 110,'' he said. Robert Johnson

HEADLINE: The Reasonable One-Star Grows Rarer in Manhattan

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER and JO CRAVEN McGINTY

 BODY:
There was a restaurant in Greenwich Village called Le Zoo, and it was good, and it was cheap, and now, like so many others of its kind, it is gone.
 It was not the sort of place that drew tourists clutching their Zagats, but it swelled each night with young hipsters and people from the neighborhood, who sipped red wine at the bar and ate $6.50 trout salad and $13 salmon at the crammed-together tables, and yes, smoked.
 But last year a new restaurant, the Spotted Pig, arose in Le Zoo's spot on West 11th Street, and it quickly became a destination for patrons with deeper pockets and expense accounts. Pub classics like sauteed veal kidneys are $18, and desserts are $6, not $4. The average bottle of wine is $30. 
 Restaurants like Le Zoo -- small, with a decent and inexpensive wine list, a memorable special, a total bill for two of $50 -- used to be easy to recognize, the high-quality neighborhood places that were one of New York's pleasures. But now, in Manhattan, they are increasingly becoming a memory.
 In interviews, several restaurateurs confirmed what many New York diners have long suspected: it is becoming impossible to serve innovative and high-quality food at reasonable prices in Manhattan. Melissa O'Donnell, formerly one of the chefs at Le Zoo and now the owner of Salt in SoHo -- where the entrees are 30 percent higher than at Le Zoo -- said one more rent increase could be the end of her restaurant.
 ''I'm from Manhattan, my client base is here, I have been working in downtown Manhattan since I went to cooking school,'' she said. ''This is my home. But I think my type of place here is going to be a thing of the past.''
 To get a rough gauge of how much more diners now have to pay, The New York Times compared the average price of a 1994 meal in Manhattan restaurants given one star in the newspaper's restaurant reviews with last year's average. In 1994, the average one-star meal cost $33; it now costs a little more than $50, pushing it outside many people's weekend budgets. That is a 51 percent increase, and even after adjusting for inflation, it represents an 18 percent increase. 
 Prices, which provide a snapshot of city dining, were taken from the Zagat Guides for 1994 and 2004.
 The analysis of prices did not try to measure Greek diners, corner Chinese restaurants or chicken spots, no matter how sublime their wings. There remain many satisfying and inexpensive restaurants in what is arguably the nation's greatest food city -- restaurants filled with patrons who are not seeking a memorable dining experience each and every night that they disdain their stoves.
 But the high-quality bistros, trattorias and American comfort-food outposts, where diners flocked for a good meal, quite possibly served on a tablecloth, have greatly increased their prices, or moved outside Manhattan. The new hotbeds of affordable innovative cuisine are increasingly in places like Park Slope and Carroll Gardens in Brooklyn, or Astoria in Queens, having been pushed out by higher rents in Greenwich Village and Chelsea. 
 Increasingly rare in Manhattan are places like Mary's, which a few years ago sold fillet of striped bass for $13.50 in a noisy, happy spot on Bedford Street, and is now a private townhouse. Or Spartina on Greenwich Street, where locals filed the tables, dined on $11.50 plates of black linguine with calamari, and dreaded uptown interlopers.
 Reflecting the endless transformation of Lower Manhattan, Spartina was replaced with the Harrison, a far more expensive hot spot where the peeky toe crab salad alone is $15 and local denizens press up against Upper East Side investment bankers and Upper West Side moms in search of a big night out. Order a salad, an entree, a glass of wine or two and dessert, and by the time you've paid the check, you have easily spent $150 for two.
 Even at the restaurants reviewed in The Times's ''$25 and Under'' column, the analysis showed, a couple that does not choose carefully may, together, spend well over $50 for an appetizer, entree and dessert -- and that is if they drink only tap water. Last year, Times critics searching for meals of distinction for the $25 column traveled to Brooklyn more than twice as often as they did in 1994.
 Ethnic fare that even 10 years ago was generally considered inexpensive if seductive has also gone upscale in Manhattan. Consider Devi, an Indian place on East 18th Street where the cheapest entree hovers around $15, and Onera, ostensibly an Upper West Side neighborhood Greek spot were appetizers range from $8 to $11.
 To some degree, the price increases reflect Manhattan's increasingly concentrated wealth, and the food fetishes of those who are willing to spend it. The higher checks often include a $10 bottle of water, frothy cocktails and organic produce, driven by both their availability and the consumer's demand for them.
 But more significant, restaurateurs have been forced to pass on the costs of the febrile real estate market. Restaurant leases have more than tripled in many neighborhoods, which has greatly raised prices on even the most prosaic of hash.
 ''You can't just be a neighborhood restaurant anymore,'' said Robert K. Futterman, who owns his own real estate firm. ''You have to be a destination for people from other neighborhoods if you are going to make the rents.'' 
 Price increases in the Times analysis were most extreme in the high and lower end of the fine dining scale, which suggest that increased food costs alone do not drive the increases. At two-star restaurants, price increases matched the rate of inflation, and at three-star restaurants, increases were below the rate of inflation, suggesting that their owners had less flexibility to raise their prices. 
 Menu prices also seem to be holding steady among the great middle, those restaurants that serve decent but forgettable food, get scant attention from the food press and stick to basic food without flair. Such restaurants have always lined the main avenues on the Upper East Side and Columbus Avenue, and their numbers are growing, according to Tim Zagat, the guidebook publisher.
 Mr. Zagat estimated that only about 10 or 15 restaurants north of 50th Street on the East and West Sides rise above that crowd.
 The affordable high-quality restaurants that were once so common in Manhattan are not quite dodos, but rather like kakapos, ground parrots that are endangered on the island of their birth. Like the kakapo, they have been transported from their natural habitat to other terrain. In the restaurants' case, that place is Brooklyn.
 In 2003, this dawned on the chef Frank Falcinelli, of Moomba fame, when he scoured his own neighborhood, Greenwich Village, for a spot to open an Italian restaurant. He knew the lease was up at Grange Hall, his neighbor on Commerce Street, but said the landlord demanded $23,000 a month. Next, he looked in the East Village, searching in vain for 1,000 square feet for $3,500 a month. 
 ''I was like, where can I get space, light and a basement and all the clientele I want?'' he said. ''People that are my age, 39, and really smart 30-year-olds, and the I-have-no-choice artists and producers and directors. The choices were Park Slope and Carroll Gardens.'' 
 Carroll Gardens it was, and for less than half the price of the East Village, he said, he found an old blacksmith shop to serve up inventive Italian food for $2 to $14. It is called Frankies 457 Court Street Spuntino, and he compares its cuisine to Bar Patti in Greenwich Village, where three courses run well over $50. 
 ''The quality of the one-star restaurants in Manhattan are going down to the ground because they can't afford it anymore,'' Mr. Falcinelli said. ''The average restaurant profit is 10 cents on the dollar. And when too many paper towels get wasted, it is four cents. I don't have any regrets.''

HEADLINE: Two Years After Killings, Painful Search Is Revived

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK

DATELINE: HILLSBOROUGH, N.H., June 22 

 BODY:
It is merciful that Teresa Knight rarely has dreams these days, as they tend to dredge up images that are too painful to bear. 
 Like the time she envisioned her daughter Sarah shrieking so uncontrollably that nothing could comfort her.
 ''In the dream, I was saying to her, 'Do you know what happened?''' Ms. Knight recalled. '''Do you know what Daddy did to you?''' 
 What Sarah's father did was shoot her and her younger brother, Philip, to death in his minivan, investigators say, after they argued at a Fourth of July fireworks display two years ago in Concord, N.H.
 Then their father, Manuel Gehring, buckled seatbelts over his dead children so their bodies would not fall to the floor. And he drove across the country, stopping to bury them, probably somewhere in the Midwest, with crosses made of duct tape on their chests.
 The bodies of Sarah Nicole Gehring, 14, and Philip Palacios Gehring, 11, have never been found.
 Mr. Gehring, a 44-year-old unemployed accountant who investigators believe killed the children because he feared losing custody of them to Ms. Knight, his former wife, was arrested in Gilroy, Calif., six days after the killings. Blood, brain matter and bullet shards were found in his minivan, and he told investigators that he had buried the children in a desolate area off Interstate 80.
 Mr. Gehring killed himself in prison last year before his trial, and with him perished the possibility of more clues to the missing children.
 Now Ms. Knight, a 43-year-old nurse, is starting her own search, making her first trip to the Midwest next month. She will scour every exit along a 650-mile stretch of I-80 from Grove City, Pa., where Mr. Gehring stopped at a Wal-Mart to buy the arsenal of a gravedigger -- shovel, pick axe, garbage bags, duct tape, razor blades, gloves -- to Iowa City, where, rid of the bodies, he doused himself in a campground lake.
 Ms. Knight hopes local police departments will arrange and publicize searches to coincide with hers to rekindle interest and jog the memories of people who might have seen something.
 ''I recently had someone ask me why don't I just let it go and give up,'' Ms. Knight said in her home here on a gravel road overlooking a finger of Franklin Pierce Lake. ''I have to go out there. I just want to bring my children home.''
 Ms. Knight, who remarried just before the killings and gave birth to twin girls, Mallory and Molly, a few months later, has worked to layer her life back together, but she has also spent months doing horrifying homework.
 ''It's every day; it's the new normal,'' Ms. Knight said. ''One day we'll be talking about whether Mallory has blond hair or brown hair, and the next we'll be saying, 'If we search the area from Iowa on Day 2 '''
 Ms. Knight has memorized what Mr. Gehring told investigators about the burial site: for example, that he dug an L-shaped grave because Sarah's body had stiffened in a seated position.
 Mr. Gehring said the site had a large yellow building near the highway, tall grass with tan-colored seeds, five or six large cement cylinders that could be sewer pipes, a slab of concrete, a mound of rocks, a clump of shade trees, a six-foot wire fence, and an old hand-powered water pump with a green lever.
 But such details are generic in the Midwest.
 ''I had this arrogant attitude initially here in New Hampshire that, hey, you should just be able to take these details and go out and find the bodies,'' said Jeffery A. Strelzin, chief of homicide for the New Hampshire attorney general's office, who traveled to the region in 2003 to investigate a report by a couple who saw a van matching Mr. Gehring's in Maumee, Ohio, on July 5. ''But going out there quickly made me realize what a daunting task it was.''
 Ms. Knight has pored over road maps, digital satellite maps and topographical maps, and has studied highway intersections online using aerial photographs and travelers' vacation pictures.
 She has examined a timeline of Mr. Gehring's travels, documented by receipts and convenience store surveillance tapes that indicate it took him 25 hours to get from Grove City to a Citgo station in Joliet, Ill., a trip that should have taken about 7 hours. 
 And she has listened to eight hours of taped police interviews with Mr. Gehring, who initially cooperated with investigators. Ms. Knight had hoped to divine something from ''the hesitation, the tones of voice,'' but instead heard details like ''how refreshing the lake was and how clean he felt'' after the swim, she said.
 Investigators say they think Mr. Gehring did not always tell them the truth; they do not believe his contention that the children were asleep when he shot them, because the patterns of the bullet holes suggest that they were moving. But they say they do feel that Mr. Gehring was sincerely trying to describe the grave site, either because he was remorseful or was hoping for a lenient sentence.
 Investigators, who drove along I-80 with Mr. Gehring after his arrest and conducted searches with dogs and helicopters, say they support Ms. Knight's quest, but point out that two years of weather and the decomposition of the bodies may make it difficult.
 ''Whatever she needs, we're trying to provide,'' Mr. Strelzin said, adding that detectives will be sent if Ms. Knight finds a promising site.
 To help with the search, the Federal Bureau of Investigation on Thursday released a 15-minute excerpt of the interrogation tapes, in which Mr. Gehring describes the burial site in a soft voice and says ''it was like a dumping area.''
 Mr. Strelzin says he believes the children's bodies are in western Pennsylvania or eastern Ohio. Pollen found in the van came not from a dry Iowa cornfield, but from a wetter environment consistent with that area. There was also residue from a sweet birch tree, which are not found west of Ohio, he said.
 Also, the couple who saw the van in Maumee said it was dirty, suggesting that Mr. Gehring had already been to the burial site, Mr. Strelzin said.
 But Jay Fallon, the F.B.I. supervisor for New Hampshire, noting that Mr. Gehring said he buried the children around 2:30 p.m. but did not say which day, said, ''there are good, lucid arguments to make that the children are buried between Grove City and Joliet, and also equally strong arguments for between Joliet and Iowa City.''
 Ms. Knight has received tips from people fascinated by the mystery: a 14-year-old girl from Florida and a Ouija-board aficionado who said the children were in Wyoming. 
 Ms. Knight pounces on any news item mentioning a body found in the Midwest, alerting investigators, who gladly check it out. And although skeptical of psychics, she has consulted some, figuring that ''there's no harm, no foul.''
 Some people, meanwhile, have been moved to conduct their own investigations.
 Erik Nikodem, an insurance broker and father of two in Concord who does not know the family, has made two trips to Interstate 80 and handed out flyers at the Wal-Mart store in Grove City.
 Mr. Nikodem thinks the Grove City area is a likely place for the burial site, because he believes that the cement cylinders, pump and other features point to a wetlands area, a sewer project or a mining reclamation site, which are common in western Pennsylvania. He studies local wetlands permits and contacts environmental groups, historical societies, cemetery groups, hunting organizations, Audubon societies and even biology professors who might know about the pollen and plant evidence.
 Last fall Mr. Nikodem found a site in Polk, Pa., with all the landmarks. The F.B.I. investigated but found nothing.
 ''None of this is any of my business,'' Mr. Nikodem said. ''I'm simply a resident of Concord, and we're a small town, and I've just taken it upon myself to do what I can do.''
 While hopeful, Ms. Knight is also realistic. Her house is full of photographs of Sarah, a cheerleader, and Philip, an imaginative preteen. But she has cleaned out Philip's room and made it a nursery for the twins. So thankful is she for their lives that most of the stresses of motherhood bounce off her.
 ''So your babies are waking up and crying,'' she said. ''You know where they are. They're fine. Why should that be a stressful thing?''
 But every once in a while, the dreams come.
 ''I had a dream that Philip and I were playing that game where you bundle them up in a blanket and open it up and say, 'There you are,''' Ms. Knight said. ''But when I opened up the blanket, he said, 'Mommy, I'm so cold.' When I woke up, I learned that that night snow fell on the Midwest. And I knew that as long as there was snow cover, nothing's going to be found.''

HEADLINE: Endangered Species Act Faces Broad New Challenges

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 22 

 BODY:
More than three decades after the Endangered Species Act gave the federal government tools and a mandate to protect animals, insects and plants threatened with extinction, the landmark law is facing the most intense efforts ever by the White House, Congress, landowners and industry to limit its reach.
 More than any time in the law's 32-year history, the obligations it imposes on government and, indirectly, on landowners are being challenged in the courts, reworked in the agencies responsible for enforcing it and re-examined in Congress.
 In some cases, the challenges are broad and sweeping, as when the Bush administration, in a legal battle over the best way to protect endangered salmon, declared Western dams to be as much a part of the landscape as the rivers they control. In others, the actions are deep in the realm of regulatory bureaucracy, as when a White House appointee at the Interior Department sought to influence scientific recommendations involving the sage grouse, a bird whose habitat includes areas of likely oil and gas deposits.
 Some environmentalists readily concede that the law has long overemphasized the stick and provided fewer carrots for private interests than it might. But some of them also fear that the law's defects will be used as a justification for a wholesale evisceration. 
 ''There's an alignment of the planets of people against the Endangered Species Act in Congress, in the White House and in the agencies,'' said Jamie Rappaport Clark, executive vice president of Defenders of Wildlife, a lobbying group based in Washington.
 On the opposite side, Robert D. Thornton, a lawyer for developers and Indian tribes in Southern California, has argued for years that the government goes too far to protect threatened species and curtails people's ability to use their own land.
 ''I've raised a child and sent him through college waiting for Congress to amend the Endangered Species Act,'' he said. ''But I do think that a lot of forces are joining now.'' 
 The Endangered Species Act of 1973 set out a goal that, polls show, is still widely admired: ensuring that species facing extinction be saved and robust populations be restored.
 Currently 1,264 species are considered threatened or endangered. Some, like the bighorn sheep of the Southern California mountains, have obvious popular appeal and a constituency, while others, like the Kretschmarr Cave mold beetle in South Texas, are an acquired taste.
 But in the past 30 years lawsuits from all sides have proliferated. And more private land, particularly in the West, has been designated critical habitat for species, potentially subjecting it to federal controls that could limit construction, logging, fishing and other activities.
 A ''critical habitat'' designation gives the federal government no direct authority to regulate private land use, but it does require federal agencies to take the issue into account when making regulatory decisions about private development.
 The conflicts are becoming sharper as the needs of newly recognized endangered species are interfering more often with the demands of exurban development.
 Western governors, who convened in San Diego last year in a mini-summit on the act, are also weighing in with Congress, for the most part seeking to explore new means of species conservation while clarifying -- or limiting -- local and state government obligations under the law.
 And Representative Richard W. Pombo, the Republican chairman of the House Resources Committee, whose district near the Central Valley of California was the epicenter of a battle over the delta smelt, is preparing legislation that is likely to curb how much land or water can be defined as critical habitat. 
 Mr. Pombo, who attended the gathering in San Diego, said in an interview that there was some common ground on the critical-habitat issue. But, he added, consensus will be harder to find on proposals he is considering that would change how the agencies weigh available science.
 Even without Congressional rewriting, the federal agencies involved have taken a different attitude in the past four years, sometimes raising the bar of scientific proof and giving more weight than before to the economic impact of Endangered Species Act decisions.
 In one instance, a top aide to Craig Manson, the assistant interior secretary who oversees the Fish and Wildlife Service, edited the scientific assessment of the sage grouse's status, playing down accounts of its range and population declines. The edited assessment and the original document prepared by scientists were sent to an expert panel, which recommended against listing the grouse as endangered; the Interior Department did not list it.
 In the case of the salmon, a federal district judge in Portland, Ore., last month rejected the Bush administration's interpretation of its obligation to endangered fish, including its argument that dams should be considered part of the landscape.
 Noah Greenwald, a biologist with the Center for Biological Diversity, said the Interior Department under President Bush has been much less aggressive than under President Bill Clinton in putting species on the endangered list. 
 Under Mr. Clinton, he said, the Interior Department agreed to place a species on the list in 88 percent of the instances in which it made a decision. Under Mr. Bush, the figure is 52 percent, according to Mr. Greenwald's analysis of federal data.
 The Bush administration has expanded on the Clinton administration's reluctance to delineate critical habitat. The administration includes a statement in all documents on the subject saying that the designation of critical habitat ''provides little real conservation benefit, is driven by litigation rather than biology, forces designations to be made before complete scientific information is available'' and ''imposes huge social and economic costs.''
 Economic analyses, which the law allows for in decisions on territory, are now the leading reason for reducing the size of species' critical habitat, according to a report by the National Wildlife Federation. 
 In 2003, the report says, lands proposed as critical habitat by biologists were reduced by one-third; 69 percent of those reductions were based on economic factors, up from fewer than 1 percent in 2001. Territory can also be removed from proposed critical habitat if higher-ranking officials believe a species does not need it.
 Mr. Manson, the assistant interior secretary, said in an interview that the interior secretary has discretion to make such decisions, and that guidelines from the Office of Management and Budget are followed in performing economic analyses. 
 The National Wildlife Federation argues that the administration assigns little economic benefit to habitat designations, to which Mr. Manson responded: ''The National Wildlife Federation and other groups have a different view of what ought to count as benefits. That's a legitimate policy difference.''
 Environmental groups argue that the land-use provisions of the law have been working, because federal data shows that 68 percent of listed species whose statuses are known have stable or recovering populations.
 Even so, some environmentalists indicate gingerly that some of their number may have overreached or, more precisely, over-sued.
 ''Litigation is a hammer, but not every problem is a nail,'' said Michael Bean, a co-director of the Center for Conservation Incentives at Environmental Defense. ''The good news about litigation has been that it has forced the government to take seriously its obligations.'' 
 Environmentalists have had considerable success in the courts, most memorably in 1978, when the Supreme Court blocked -- temporarily -- construction of the Tellico Dam in Tennessee to preserve a tiny fish, the snail darter. 
 This month, the Supreme Court refused to hear a case challenging enforcement of the law, in a dispute involving six endangered species of small insects that live in caves in Texas, including the Kretschmarr Cave mold beetle. Developers said the property would be worth $60 million if development were not limited by the Endangered Species Act.
 And in the desert around Palm Springs, Calif., the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians is suing the government because more than half the tribe's 31,000 acres fall into an area the Fish and Wildlife Service says is critical to the conservation of the endangered bighorn sheep. The sheep's numbers in the area were down to about 280 when they were listed as endangered in 1998. A recent count put the number above 700.
 The tribe says the designation creates ''an economic impact of hundreds of millions of dollars'' by complicating plans to develop resort condominiums and a golf course near tribal land.
 There have been compromises on habitats. In hundreds of areas, the various groups with an interest have cooperated on ''habitat conservation plans'' to help species on the brink. 
 Such plans, like one around Tucson regarding the endangered pygmy owl, have been promoted by the Clinton and Bush administrations. 
 But the plans do not tend to flourish where litigation is rife. And Steven P. Quarles, an industry lawyer with the Washington firm of Crowell & Moring, said that until there was a legislative compromise that Senate moderates could support, ''what we'll see is a chipping away at the act by federal rules and guidances from the executive branch, and litigation from both sides.''

HEADLINE: How Home Prices Can Be Hot but Inflation Cool

BYLINE: By DANIEL GROSS. 
Daniel Gross writes the ''Moneybox'' column for Slate.com.

 BODY:
ANYBODY who has bought or sold a home recently -- or who has picked up a newspaper -- knows that housing prices are rising rapidly. The National Association of Realtors projects that the median sales price of an existing home will rise 8.8 percent this year, after climbing 8.3 percent in 2004. 
 Yet the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the government agency that collects, mixes and distills data into the Consumer Price Index, says the increase in housing costs has been muted. The index, the broadest measure of inflation for consumer activity, shows that housing costs rose just 0.1 percent in May and 3 percent in the last 12 months. That begs a question: When housing is the biggest single expenditure for most Americans, and when half of the nation is fretting about a housing bubble and the other half is logging on to CondoFlip.com, how can inflation remain tame? 
 The answer has to do with the occasionally strange way the government produces the numbers that define our economic life -- numbers on which vast sums are wagered every day. 
 Until 1983, the bureau measured housing inflation by looking at what it cost to buy and own homes, considering factors like house prices, mortgage interest costs and property taxes. But given the shifts in interest rates and housing prices, those measures could show big bounces from month to month. Besides, homes are a strange hybrid of a consumable good and a long-term investment. As part of a long-running evaluation, the bureau wanted to ''separate out the investment component from the consumption component'' of the housing market, said Patrick C. Jackman, an economist at the bureau. 
 In other words, a home isn't just where you hang your hat or an investment in the future (or, in the case of visitors to CondoFlip.com, for two days). It's something that is consumed, the way potato chips, gasoline or a barber's skills are. So the bureau decided to track a measure that represents only the consumption of housing: rent. And rents had much to recommend themselves as a long-term inflationary yardstick -- they don't jump significantly from month to month -- and as a proxy for home prices. Over time, after all, rents correlated very closely to home prices.
 ''It's important to separate the decision that people make about housing as an investment and housing as a consumption of services,'' said Ted Wieseman, an economist at Morgan Stanley. Especially when you're trying to measure inflation. Consider the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index: it cost three times as much to buy it in 2000 than it did in 1992. But that climb didn't signify rampant inflation in the United States. The Bureau of Labor Statistics is trying to measure consumer price inflation, not asset price inflation. 
 So, for the past 22 years, it has measured inflation in the cost of housing in a rather indirect way. As part of its Consumer Expenditure Survey, the bureau collects information from thousands of Americans about how much they pay for rent. But because renters are only a small part of the population, it also tries to measure how much homeowners are essentially paying themselves in rent. To determine the so-called owners' equivalent rent, it asks homeowners how much they would have to pay to rent the house in which they live. That figure constitutes about 23.2 percent of the Consumer Price Index, by far its largest component. Food is 14.3 percent and transportation is 17.4 percent, for example.
 But there are a few problems with using owners' equivalent rent as a measure of inflation for shelter costs. First, rent and home prices have become decoupled over the last several years, as Richard J. Rosen, an economist who is an adviser to the Chicago Federal Reserve, has observed. In the last 12 months, owners' equivalent rent has risen only by 2.3 percent, while housing prices have risen by a much larger amount. 
 ''Of course, some of this decoupling has been a response to the low mortgage rates,'' Mr. Rosen said, adding that it was an open question whether it signaled an enduring disconnection between rents and home prices. 
 Second, years of falling interest rates and the vast expansion of the mortgage industry have changed the historical dynamics between renting and owning. From 1994 to 2004, the percentage of home-owning households rose to 69.2 percent from 64.2 percent, according to the Census Bureau. What's the point of measuring rents if fewer and fewer people are actually renting?
 Finally, shifts in Americans' relative desire to own rather than rent can play havoc with inflation measures. Rising home prices -- and rising interest in owning homes -- have helped to keep housing rents in check in recent years. So even though the rampant housing market is forcing home buyers to cough up more of their income for the same amount of shelter, the comparatively soft rental market is holding down inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index. 
 CONVERSELY, when housing prices fall, a trend that most people would deem anti-inflationary, and renting becomes more attractive than owning, the index might process the information as evidence that inflation is on the rise. ''We got a great deal of criticism that we were overstating inflation in the early 1990's, because housing prices were declining and rents were going up steadily,'' Mr. Jackman said. 
 The housing market today is a polarizing force. On one side are those who are convinced that the market is a bubble about to pop. On the other side are those who believe that we are in the midst of a long-term boom. But at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Mr. Jackman notes, ''We're pretty much conditioned to be in the middle.''

HEADLINE: Shortchanged by Good Intentions

BYLINE: By Sharon Lerner. 
Sharon Lerner is a senior fellow at the Center for New York City Affairs at the New School.

 BODY:
TO New York State policymakers, a rule tightening the collection of child support must have seemed like a smart way to save money and make fathers responsible for their children. But in fact it is driving many poor children from good, safe, affordable child care centers. 
 The regulation, which went into effect in much of the state a year ago, requires that single parents, mostly mothers, sue the other parent for financial support to receive government help to pay for child care. But many low-income single mothers would rather forgo financial aid than sue the fathers of their children. 
According to Jill Rooney, executive director of Harbor Child Care, which runs five nonprofit programs on Long Island, about 50 single mothers have removed their children from Harbor's programs in the last year because of the rule. At St. Peter's Child Care Center in Yonkers, Laura Strong, the executive director, has seen enrollment drop by more than half in the last year. She attributes most of that decrease to the new requirement. And at the Ossining Children's Center, there has been a 38 percent decrease in enrollment of children receiving subsidies, with more than 33 children leaving since the rule was implemented, said Howard Milbert, executive director of the center.
 The losses are taking a toll on these programs, which often care for children across the economic spectrum. Ellen Farrar, the coordinator of early childhood programs at the Westchester Community Opportunity Program, which runs 16 child care centers in the county, says the new rule is responsible for a $340,000 decline in revenue for the organization over the last year. 
 But the children are losing the most. With subsidies, they have access to regulated centers with trained teachers. Without them, they end up ''underground,'' as those in the field refer to the vast terrain of unregulated care. 
 Why would mothers sacrifice such a precious resource? For some who have amicable, though informal, arrangements with their exes, a father's financial contributions and his good relationship with the children are too valuable to risk by entering the adversarial legal system. 
 Some single mothers have even more reason to fear antagonizing their exes. Although the state allows exemptions for victims of domestic violence, women must produce documentation of the abuse to qualify. Many women who do not have these records may suffer dire consequences by suing the fathers of their children.
 Mothers who are illegal immigrants are also likely to want to avoid court. Fear of jeopardizing their lives in this country often runs deeper than the need for help with caring for their children.
 Even parents willing to jump through the legal hoops may be stuck if their employers are not amenable to their taking at least three days off to handle the paperwork in court.
 Such details probably escaped regulators at the State Office of Children and Family Services when they were drafting the rule. Had they wanted a preview of the havoc they might wreak, New York policymakers could have looked to Utah and Pennsylvania, two states that implemented similar requirements. 
 Utah rescinded its rule in April, after child care workers complained of burdensome paperwork and delays in enrolling low-income children. In Pennsylvania, the number of poor children getting reduced-cost care plummeted after the rule went into effect. As a result, the state is taking the rule off the books on July 1.
 Next month, New York City, the only jurisdiction not yet affected by the state regulation, is scheduled to begin requiring single parents seeking subsidized care to get child support orders. But the state would do well to avert the mess that is sure to ensue, when the rule is applied to as many as 33,000 parents in the city, many of whom will flood the already overwhelmed family courts. 
 Why not, instead, go straight to the cleanup phase and rescind this requirement before it does any more damage? Gov. George E. Pataki could accomplish this with the stroke of a pen.
 The state should encourage single mothers to legally establish paternity. Educating them about the possible benefits, including matters of inheritance and Social Security, would help them and their children. But requiring them to sue for child support at the peril of losing affordable child care is not the answer.

HEADLINE: Changing Tides on the Hudson

BYLINE: By Julia Vitullo-Martin. 
Julia Vitullo-Martin is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute.

 BODY:
THE Hudson is one of America's great rivers -- so magnificent and awesome, tidal all the way to Troy, 150 miles upstream from New York City, that the early explorers thought it was a passage to the distant sea. Yet its very power made it susceptible to industrial abuse, since it seemed to carry away and disperse large quantities of pollutants. 
 In the 20th century, this vulnerability nearly ruined it. Industry dumped poisons like mercury, benzene and PCB's that sank to the river's bottom, where they remain, leaching toxins in the water. In the 1960's, citizens began forming coalitions to expose the Hudson's near destruction and to lobby successfully for its protection. Today's Hudson, while not fully pristine, is cleaner than it's been since the mid-19th century. 
Unfortunately, the region's environmental groups downplay their success, emphasizing the river's decline, not its rebirth. Given the river's unhappy history of exploitation, they continue to look at the Hudson and see a river in peril. 
 The most recent example of this view comes in the form of a Pace Poll, conducted in conjunction with the Pace Academy for the Environment at Pace University, that explored the attitudes toward the river of residents of the 17 counties along the Hudson. The much-trumpeted survey, according to its press release, concluded that these residents had become ''complacent'' on environmental issues. John Cronin, the Hudson's first Riverkeeper and now the director of the academy, says the survey highlights a ''disturbing trend that if left alone will prove catastrophic for the river's future.'' 
 But that's not the case, and the survey proves no such thing. In fact, its results are more nuanced. They reflect the belief by most respondents that the river can be protected and developed at the same time. 
 Let's look at the numbers. Sixty-six percent of those polled rate the environment as ''very important'' in relation to other issues, while an additional 12 percent rate it as ''most important.'' These numbers hardly reflect complacency. 
 Furthermore, the poll showed that residents are generally satisfied with their local environment. A majority, 55 percent, rate their environment as very good or excellent, and only 44 percent as fair or poor. At the same time, the poll showed that the majority, or 53 percent, of those surveyed say they support some new industrial development. 
 This last finding doesn't mean residents support all and every industrial development -- they defeated a coal-fired cement plant in Columbia County, after all. A closer look at the answers shows that of the 43 percent who oppose development, 28 percent strongly endorse ''no development'' because of the risk to the ''natural splendor'' of the river. Fifteen percent, however, only ''somewhat agreed'' with no development. Another 28 percent ''somewhat agreed'' with limited development. And 25 percent strongly endorse ''limited'' development. While a small minority supports blocking all development on the riverfront, more than two-thirds support varying amounts of limited industrial development on the river.
 Hudson residents recognize that sound development can bring good things, including new jobs, new residents and a reduced tax burden. Sure there are pockets of wealth along the Hudson, but most communities are poor, with high unemployment rates. Newburgh, for example, has an unemployment rate of 11.3 percent, compared with a statewide rate of 4.6 percent. 
 When asked to name the most important problems facing the Hudson River area, 17 percent say jobs and the economy, 16 percent say taxes, 14 percent say education and schools and 10 percent say affordable housing. 
 What the Pace Poll shows is that far from being complacent on environmental issues, residents along the Hudson River are sophisticated. They know that they don't have to choose between environmental stewardship and development. No company will again be allowed to build a plant like General Electric's, which spewed PCB's directly into the Hudson for years. New companies will be required to invest in ''clean'' technology. New residential developments will not be allowed to channel sewage into the waterways. 
 And this is all good news. The Hudson River and the residents along its shore have moved beyond the past and embraced the subtle balance that will provide a prosperous future and a healthy environment. Let's hope the environmentalists do, too.

HEADLINE: How Green Is My Yellow Cab

 BODY:
In theory, at least, there seems to be agreement that hybrid taxicabs are a good idea. Curtailing pollution from New York's nearly 13,000 cabs could only help air quality in the city, among the worst in the nation. Moreover, the bigger energy picture points to the necessity of finding alternatives to fossil fuels -- or at least more efficient ways of using fossil fuels -- and easing Americans' unsustainable dependence on them. 
 Hybrids, which run on a combination of gas and electricity and are far more fuel efficient than ordinary cars, are an inevitable part of that search. Now would be a good time to embrace them. 
 In reality, however, hybrid cabs have gone nowhere in New York. The city's Taxi and Limousine Commission, which once put television screens in back seats, has not hurried to put alternative fuel taxis on the road. Now the City Council, in legislation being ushered through by David Yassky of Brooklyn and John Liu of Queens, plans to force the issue. The legislation would allow taxi owners to have the option of using a hybrid vehicle as a yellow cab, maybe as soon as the fall.
 It's about time. Hybrids are no longer newfangled creations. San Francisco has been using 10 Ford Escape hybrids in its taxi fleet and is expected to increase the numbers next year. Many Americans have purchased hybrids for personal use, and in some areas, the wait for delivery on a new vehicle is months long. Demand is so high that the problem may be finding available vehicles once taxi medallion owners finally get the green light.
 Most cabdrivers currently use the Crown Victoria stretch model made by Ford. It's a big car and, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council, gets about 12 miles a gallon on congested city streets. A cabdriver can pay as much as $100 a day to keep the tank full. Even though the cars are equipped with catalytic converters, they inevitably add to the city's air pollution, contributing to asthma, other respiratory diseases and global warming. Hybrids might get three times the miles per gallon, meaning we could all breath a bit easier.
 Converting some of the city's taxi fleet to hybrids would also dovetail nicely with other efforts to clean New York's air. With a push from environmental groups, the city has gradually been replacing its dirty, older diesel buses with cleaner natural-gas vehicles and diesel-electric hybrids. More than 10 percent of New York City Transit's 4,500-bus fleet now consists of natural-gas or diesel-electric hybrids, with welcome reductions in particulates and nitrogen and sulfur oxides.
 Hybrid taxis make similar environmental sense. And even though hybrids cost more initially, with tax breaks and fuel savings, they seem to make economic sense as well.
 The main complaint about hybrids has to do with comfort. But the battle is over inches, as few as three, in the back seats of some hybrid models. And the suffering, if it could be called that, would be brief. The average ride in a New York cab is two and a half miles and about eight minutes. And, let's face it, most passengers are not the Knicks or even the Rockettes, and they won't be doing yoga in the back seat. While most cab owners might want larger cars, it would be heartening to see a smaller hybrid, like a smooth-riding Toyota Prius, as part of the New York yellow cab fleet.
 The city, with its legions of cabs, has an opportunity to set an example for other urban areas. And like it or not, gas-guzzling big taxis will eventually go the way of the dinosaur, bringing the issue of fossil fuel full circle.

HEADLINE: Social Security: The Battle Goes On

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 It's time to involve all Americans in the solution to the Social Security problem, not just tomorrow's beneficiaries.
 Discussions about Social Security repair have emphasized the economics of future payments to current workers, overlooking the economics of what is being paid to current Social Security beneficiaries. Yet a big reason that the system needs repair is that today's beneficiaries have paid in only a fraction of what today's workers are paying in.
 Even so, discussion focuses on how to curtail what will go out to people who are paying top dollar for their future benefits while ignoring any serious adjustment to what is paid to today's subsidized retirees.
 America has a duty to support its needy elderly. Indeed, we could perhaps increase their benefits if there were real means testing. But it is wrong to ask today's workers to finance payments that they will not themselves receive without ensuring that those getting those higher benefits truly need them.

HEADLINE: Stadium, Anyone? 

BYLINE: By Deborah Solomon

 BODY:
Q: How do you explain the sudden vogue for stadiums and arenas? So many teams want a new home -- the Mets in Queens, the Yankees in the Bronx, the Jets with their doomed project in Manhattan. And you're building a new arena for the Nets in Brooklyn. 
 It has to do with the economics of sports. The high salaries of athletes drive the whole thing, because it creates a need for revenue. In the case of the Nets, we need an arena that has suites and luxury seating, and where you can put up advertisements all over the place. 
 Since you're the principal owner of the Nets and paying Vince Carter $15 million a year, why not just slash players' salaries, lower ticket costs and preserve the old, historic stadiums? 
 Is that a joke? We have to be competitive. 
 You and your fellow investors bought the Nets last August for $300 million. Have you always loved basketball? 
 I was never a basketball fan, but I wanted to bring a team to Brooklyn, a team that could be like the Brooklyn Dodgers. There's something intangible that a team contributes, something as intangible as a soul. 
 When did you get so spiritual? I would think the arena serves your interests as a real-estate developer and will boost the value of the apartments, condominiums and stores that make up your development in progress, the Atlantic Yards. 
 Not necessarily. Your friends who have bought brownstones in Park Slope and Fort Greene have inflated neighborhood values more than an arena would. 
 Even though the arena is being designed by Frank Gehry? Look what his curving titanium museum did for Bilbao, Spain.
 Brooklyn is already a world-class destination. And it's a completely different building than Bilbao. It will have more glass and transparency. And it's obviously a different shape for basketball. 
 What do you think of the Meadowlands, out in Jersey, where the Nets currently play? 
 It's hard to get to the Meadowlands if you don't have a car. There's no train from New York, and you can't take the bus because when the game is done, you've got to wait.
 What's wrong with waiting for a bus? 
 Nothing. I love waiting for buses! I love Port Authority! I spend my afternoons there! 
 I love panhandlers! 
 Shouldn't you be more bus-friendly as a former civil servant and the commissioner of consumer affairs under Mayor Koch? What led you to give that up for a career as a real-estate developer? 
 At first I was very embarrassed to be in real estate. As someone who attended Columbia Law School in a socially conscious era and then worked in government, I was taught to be suspicious of businesspeople. But I try to run my business in a way that has some social value.
 How would you define the social value of the Nets? 
 The players are terrific. They are of good character. They are incredibly charitable. They are family-oriented. They have integrity. 
 You make them sound like Boy Scouts. But at least N.B.A. players don't appear to take steroids. Do you take steroids? 
 Do I look like I take steroids? Is this the body of a steroid? This is not the body produced by human-growth hormones or, for that matter, even working out. 
 You don't exercise? 
 No. I ran in six marathons, and then I just got lazy. I don't work out. I like to walk.
 Do you collect sports memorabilia? 
 I'm not a collector. Honestly, I like to throw stuff out. I'm not acquisition-oriented. 
 Well, you and your fellow investors did acquire a whole team. Was that a complicated process? 
 We were the highest bidder for the team. Like so many things in life, it was just a matter of money. Deborah Solomon

HEADLINE: The Hidden Benefits of China's Shopping Spree

BYLINE: By Andrew Ross Sorkin

 BODY:
REMEMBER when people worried that an Asian country would buy everything in the American economy that wasn't nailed down? Well, those complaints are coming back, except that the nation doing the buying is China, not Japan. 
 With the China National Offshore Oil Corporation's $18.5 billion unsolicited bid for Unocal last week, Washington bigwigs and corner-office executives are making their wrinkle lines worse fretting that the Chinese may buy another slice of America.
 Some cringing began earlier in the week, when the Haier Group, one of China's biggest companies, bid to acquire the Maytag Corporation, the appliance maker, for about $1.3 billion, surpassing an offer from a group of American investors. Add to that Lenovo's recent $1.75 billion acquisition of I.B.M.'s legendary personal computing business, and some would have you believe that we should be in full panic mode. 
 While there are clearly important foreign policy and trade questions raised by China's emergence as a deal maker in the United States, it is less clear that these deals -- and others that will surely follow -- are as problematic as they may appear at first.
 Many deals with Chinese companies -- and, by extension, the Chinese government -- may actually help the United States economy, just as China has helped prop up the nation by buying Treasury bonds en masse.
 Indeed, so far, the businesses in which China has taken an interest could be categorized as ''least likely to succeed.'' And the Chinese may eventually revive them.
 Look at Maytag. That struggling company is a business that no other strategic rival in the world -- yes, the entire world -- was prepared to bid on. Before Haier expressed interest, the only potential buyer was a consortium of private equity players led by Ripplewood Holdings of New York. And what do you think they would likely have done with the company? The Maytag repairman would almost certainly have lost his job, along with dozens if not hundreds of others until the private equity group trimmed enough costs that it could take some cash out by flipping the business to another private equity team. This hot-potato game might have gone on for a decade or two until the company was milked of its very last dollar.
 Haier, on the other hand, wants Maytag for its brand and its managers' experience, so it can have some help building the business. While Haier is also likely to cut jobs, pink slips will probably come much slower in the United States. And the Maytag brand, its culture and legacy will probably live on much longer.
 Wall Street bankers who have been plying the Kennedy Airport-Beijing route say the Chinese are expected to come searching for more underperformers in the United States. Not so much for their current business prospects, but for the overnight brand awareness and legitimacy they lend. Just as important, they want American managements and their institutional memory to help guide them.
 The sale of I.B.M.'s PC business to Lenovo, which also had some of those Washingtonians in a huff talking about national security issues, is a perfect example of a deal in which a Chinese company wanted American management and skill. After all, the product itself -- I.B.M.'s PC -- was going nowhere fast. 
 And if these companies are really going to die anyway, the Chinese will be left holding the bag.
 To be fair, the bid by CNOOC, as the Chinese oil company is called, is considerably more complicated. But at base, lawmakers and investors should remember that despite Unocal's history -- it was founded in 1890 as the Union Oil Company of California -- it is already more Asian than ''made in America.'' About 73 percent of its proven natural-gas reserves are in Asia. And if CNOOC acquired Unocal, it ''would not increase energy flows to the Chinese market, because most of Unocal's upstream assets are locked up by long-term contracts to supply other regional markets,'' according to Jason Kindopp, an analyst at the Eurasia Group.
 And then there is the even more basic argument about capitalism. ''U.S. oil companies need to play on an equal playing field around the world,'' said Larry Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. ''The prospects of that happening are diminished if the U.S. government interferes in a deal like this,'' he said. 
 Mr. Kindopp makes the point even stronger, with a slight twist: ''The main long-term risk is if the economic nationalism driving Beijing's quest for energy becomes the norm, compelling Washington, Tokyo, New Dehli and others to adopt an equally strategic view of energy security.''
 But in the end, the Washington brow-furrowers probably won't need that Botox anyway: Chevron, not CNOOC, is likely to win Unocal. 
 Chevron, whose earlier $16.4 billion bid for Unocal was topped by CNOOC, is likely to prevail with that lower bid. Investors, you see, are likely to side with Chevron, not because they are xenophobic but because they most certainly hate political uncertainty.

HEADLINE: A Rank Habit, in a County Full of Achievers

BYLINE: By Kate Stone Lombardi

 BODY:
WHO is the valedictorian? Which schools made it to the top 10? What are the 50 greatest oldies of all time? Who are the 100 most beautiful people?
 Westchester locales have appeared on all kinds of ratings, rankings and lists lately, some more desirable than others.
A recent issue of Men's Health magazine listed Yonkers as America's 14th most-depressed city. This was not an economic rating, but an assessment of psychological health. You may well ask how anyone would know if Yonkers was feeling lower than, say, Port Chester. The magazine says its ratings were based on antidepressant sales, suicide rates and the number of days that residents reported being depressed to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
 It's not that Yonkers doesn't have its reasons to feel gloomy, especially given a dysfunctional, scandal-plagued school system. But for all we know, Briarcliff Manor may be feeling far more down in the dumps. Sad old Yonkers was the only Westchester municipality to be evaluated in the study, because it was the only one with enough residents to qualify as a midsize city. 
 By the way, Philadelphia, which some people consider a pretty nice place to live, was ranked the most depressed city in the country, while Laredo, Tex. -- a place that few Westchesterites would probably consider moving to -- was rated the happiest. So go figure. 
 Yonkers was also given a D in a survey called ''Is Your City Stupid?'' conducted by a group called BestPlaces.net, which ranked midsize cities based on SAT scores, the number of bachelor's degrees per capita, the number of universities and a creativity index that would take far too long to explain here. Personally, I have experienced immense stupidity in all sorts of communities in the county, particularly in those with the highest-ranked school systems, so I really think Yonkers is getting a bad rap here. 
 If it's any comfort to anyone in Yonkers, BestPlaces.net reports the city to be one of the least likely places to contract a sexually transmitted disease (based on data from the C.D.C.). Also, its lung-cancer rates are quite low. So residents are having safe sex and living longer, which doesn't sound too dumb to me. (Of course, statistics are notoriously hard to interpret. It could be that people in Yonkers are having less sex, and therefore fewer cigarettes. But I digress.)
 Rye has the dubious honor of having been ranked by Forbes magazine as the 61st most expensive place to live in the nation, with a median home price of $1,050,691. Rye Neck High School squeaked into the top 100 on Newsweek's America's Best High Schools list. It was in 97th place, just after Briarcliff, at 96, and before Bronxville, at 98. Edgemont, at 26, Horace Greeley in Chappaqua, at 42, and Dobbs Ferry, at 49, made the cut with a little more wiggle room. 
 If you think ratings like ''depressed'' or ''stupid'' are subjective to the point of worthlessness, stick a big toe into the school-ranking waters. Newsweek based its rankings on percentages of students who in 2004 took Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate tests (which measure success in rigorous course work). Many educators dismiss such assessments, saying they in no way represent the many factors that contribute to a good education. 
 But school officials often make dismissive comments while protesting their own rankings, which brings us back to Rye -- not to be confused with Rye Neck. Rye High School was listed as 703rd, but insists that there was a reporting error, and that its rightful place is 85. Not that this stuff is meaningful or anything.
 Some local colleges landed on lists compiled by The Princeton Review. Sarah Lawrence, for instance, came in second on the list of most ''strained town-gown relations'' in the country, third on the list of most ''Birkenstock-wearing, tree-hugging, clove-smoking vegetarians'' and 11th on the list of colleges having the most ''professors who bring material to life.'' 
 Purchase College ranked 14th for having ''dorms like dungeons,'' 15th for being a bargain and, curiously, 20th for having ''students who ignore God on a regular basis.'' I can only imagine the accuracy of these particular statistics. 
 At least two Westchester residents -- Bill Clinton and Martha Stewart -- made Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People listing this year. So, Westchester, let's go for broke. My son has a big foam-rubber finger that you can wear on your hand that says, ''We're No. 1.''
 The question is, at what?

HEADLINE: Chinese Strength, U.S. Weakness

 BODY:
If China's attempt to buy an American oil company does nothing else, it should, at long last, force the United States to decide how it plans to protect its economy, husband its resources and grow in a world where it is no longer the only economic powerhouse.
 With China on a buying binge for raw materials to feed its ever-expanding economy, it was inevitable that it would eventually go beyond the more modest corporate purchases it has already begun and make a grab for something the United States really cares about. Last week, history's biggest Communist country made the ultimate capitalist play: an $18.5 billion all-cash takeover bid by the state-controlled China National Offshore Oil Corporation for the American oil company Unocal. 
The bid landed with the impact of an unexploded missile in Washington, where anti-China sentiment has been running high. From both sides of the aisle, members of Congress sounded the alarm that China was threatening to gobble up world energy resources. There is politics in that: Congress has an election next year and gasoline prices are already high. But whatever happens to the deal, Americans should be glad China reminded them that it is time to examine this country's economic strategy.

China's New Power
 The chairman and chief executive of the Chinese company, Fu Chengyu, insisted that American national security was not an issue and called the unsolicited bid friendly. ''This transaction is purely a commercial transaction,'' he told reporters. That's a bit disingenuous considering the money he is using is mostly from the Chinese government and his company owes its first allegiance to Beijing authorities, not world markets. And it raises the interesting question of whether the China National Offshore Oil Corporation can have it both ways: playing by Chinese rules at home while taking advantage of American rules abroad to buy an American business. After all, this is a government-owned company operating in an authoritarian state that limits the ability of foreign companies to take their profits out of China.
 ''Does anybody honestly believe that the Chinese would ever let an American company take over a Chinese company?'' asked Senator Charles Schumer, Democrat of New York. Actually, they have, although on a scale that hardly raised national security issues. Last year, Anheuser-Busch won a takeover battle for the Harbin Brewery Group.
 The CNOOC bid is of a much higher order and deserves examination above and beyond the regulatory scrutiny normally given to corporate mergers and acquisitions. But Mr. Schumer's question ignores the way American companies have been buying up stakes in Chinese companies. Bank of America just agreed to pay $2.5 billion for a 9 percent stake in the state-run China Construction Bank. According to The Wall Street Journal, even Chevron, the rival bidder for Unocal, has a stake in a chemical plant in China and is exploring for oil in China.
 So in some ways, the opposition to the CNOOC bid is the latest installment in the anti-China fervor already gripping Washington. There are a half-dozen proposals in Congress for across-the-board tariffs against Chinese imports, spurred in part by American manufacturers who complain that China's currency, the yuan, is undervalued, which results in cheaper Chinese goods coming into America and hurting American jobs. This comes on top of moves by the administration -- urged on by Congress and a huge trade deficit -- to forcibly stem the importing of Chinese textiles this year. 
 Beating up on the Chinese is fine for sound bites to convince voters that politicians care. But the real problem has less to do with China's current strength than America's current weakness. A far more rational approach to China's economic ascendancy would be to consider what steps the United States should be taking to protect itself and to grow.

America's Energy Policies
 The national security of the United States is already at risk because the nation depends on imported oil for nearly 60 percent of its daily needs. That will only grow as demand increases and domestic supplies dwindle. Much of that oil comes from volatile countries in the Persian Gulf region, and the American money flowing there does nothing to encourage either more-balanced economic development or democracy. The rest comes from other parts of the world -- often the most unstable parts. In any case, it all contributes to America's monstrous trade deficit and worries about what would happen to the economy if some international crisis disrupted the supply. 
 The antidotes are simple. Americans need to use far less oil than they do now, which means requiring more fuel-efficient vehicles and finding an alternative to refined oil to power cars and trucks.
 Beijing's desire for Unocal is fueled in part by the company's natural gas reserves, most of which are in Asia. The United States cannot claim much of a national security threat from that. North American gas supplies are still fairly robust if you count Canada, and the United States can always fall back on coal to keep the lights on. Coal now provides more than half of the country's electricity anyway. 
 But none of that should lead to complacency. The United States needs open, accessible markets. And no fuel source is free from the effects of rising demand around the world. Natural gas prices are rising rapidly, and Americans need more-efficient power plants and more-efficient appliances to reduce demand, just as we need to develop more-efficient transportation to reduce dependency on oil.

Trade, Currencies and Debt
 Congress's fixation with devaluing China's yuan to help cut American job losses is another example of blaming China for what the United States is not doing. There is no reason to think that revaluing the yuan would lead to American job growth. Indeed, Alan Greenspan said Thursday that he saw no credible evidence that a stronger yuan would increase American manufacturing activity and jobs. 
 Instead of bashing China, Congress and the Bush administration should be putting money into bolstering retraining programs to help American workers whose jobs migrate overseas. American school systems, American parents and American students are going to have to focus on the fact that young people with mediocre educations are not going to be able to compete with energetic, educated young people in places like China. 
 The United States also cannot blame the Chinese government for the weak position that its own policies have created. The Bush administration's damaging practice of combining profligate deficit spending with huge tax cuts for the rich feeds the need for Washington to borrow hundreds of billions of dollars a year just to keep things going. China has become a major buyer of the Treasury bonds that finance that debt, and because of that, the American economy depends more and more on the willingness of our Chinese underwriters to buy and hold our Treasuries. A sudden decision by China to invest elsewhere would very likely have a far more devastating effect on the country than a withdrawal of Unocal's resources.
 But the solution is not to blame China. It is to institute more sensible economic policies, including revoking the unnecessary gifts that President Bush has given to very wealthy Americans at tax time.
 Despite Mr. Fu's claim about China's friendly bid, it is a contested one, coming two months after Unocal agreed to be sold to Chevron for $16.4 billion. There are many shots that remain to be fired in the trench warfare of this corporate takeover battle. China may or may not come out on top. But even if China loses this skirmish, it is part of a longer struggle, and those charged with leading America would do well to spend this time strengthening America from within. No matter how big and powerful China becomes, it is no match for the United States when this country is at its best.

HEADLINE: Liberals, Conservatives and Aid

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS. 
E-mail: dabrooks@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Karl Rove has his theories about what separates liberals from conservatives and I have mine. Mine include the differences between Jeffrey Sachs and George Bush.
 Jeffrey Sachs, as you may know, is the Columbia University economist who has done more to put poverty in Africa atop the global agenda than anybody else. He has hectored and lobbied the developed world to forgive debts, set goals and increase aid to ameliorate the suffering of the extremely poor. 
 But Sachs is a child of the French Enlightenment. At the end of his new book, ''The End of Poverty,'' he delivers an unreconstructed tribute to the 18th-century Enlightenment, when leading thinkers had an amazing confidence in their ability to refashion reality so that it would conform to reason. 
 Throughout the book, Sachs comes across as a philosophe for our times. He is, he writes, a ''clinical economist,'' who diagnoses the maladies that affect nations the way a doctor diagnoses and holds life-or-death sway over a human organism. One of the striking features of his book is the absence of individual Africans. There is just the undifferentiated mass of the suffering poor, trapped in systems, and Sachs traveling around the globe prescribing treatments.
 Sachs is also a materialist. He dismisses or downplays those who believe that human factors like corruption, greed, institutions, governance, conflict and traditions have contributed importantly to Africa's suffering. Instead, he emphasizes material causes: lack of natural resources, lack of technology, bad geography and poverty itself as a self-perpetuating trap.
 This gives him an impressive confidence on the malleability of human societies. Though $2.3 trillion has been spent over the past 50 years to address global poverty, without producing anything like the results we would have hoped for, Sachs is sure that with his insights, and most important, with more money, extreme poverty can be eliminated with one big, final push. ''We can realistically envision a world without extreme poverty by the year 2025,'' he writes. ''Ending the poverty trap will be much easier than it appears,'' he declares. 
 Sachs, who tends to regard anyone who disagrees with him as immoral, is contemptuous of the Bush administration. The Bush folks, he charges, have failed the poor.
 The Bush administration has nearly doubled foreign aid, but it will not spend the amounts Sachs wants. The Bush folks, at least when it comes to Africa policy, have learned from centuries of conservative teaching -- from Burke to Oakeshott to Hayek -- to be skeptical of Sachsian grand plans. Conservatives emphasize that it is a fatal conceit to think we can understand complex societies, or rescue them from above with technocratic planning.
 The Bush folks, like most conservatives, tend to emphasize nonmaterial causes of poverty: corrupt governments, perverse incentives, institutions that crush freedom. Conservatives appreciate the crooked timber of humanity -- that human beings are not simply organisms within systems, but have minds and inclinations of their own that usually defy planners. You can give people mosquito nets to prevent malaria, but they might use them instead to catch fish.
 Instead of Sachs's monumental grand push to end poverty, the Bush administration has devised the Millennium Challenge Account, which is not dismissed by Sachs, but not heralded either. This program is built upon the assumption that aid works only where there is good governance and good governance exists only where the local folks originate and believe in the programs. M.C.A. directs aid to countries that have taken responsibility for their own reform. 
 It has the faults of its gradualist virtues. I recently sat in on a meeting in Mozambique between local and American officials. It was clear that the program, while well conceived, has been horribly executed. The locals had been given only the vaguest notions of what sort of projects the U.S. is willing to finance. After two years of trying they had received nothing. 
 Nonetheless, the Bush approach, when reformed, at least builds on the experience of the past decades, while Sachs, as reviewers have noticed, repeats the 1960's. If, a la Sachs, we assume money translates easily into growth, if we pour aid into Africa without regard to local institutions, we will do little good, we will exhaust donors and we will discredit the aid enterprise for years to come.

HEADLINE: Maybe Saving Money Is Just for Chumps

BYLINE: By DANIEL AKST. 
Daniel Akst is a journalist and novelist who writes often about business. E-mail: culmoney@nytimes.com

 BODY:
ON a recent tour of Europe, Treasury Secretary John W. Snow talked about the need for Americans to save more. Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, recently told Congress that ''our household saving rate remains negligible.'' From time to time, various economists, pundits and others in the financial peanut gallery chime in on this theme as well. If there's one thing Americans have to do more of, everyone seems to agree, it's save.
 But why should we? What if there are good reasons for the seemingly low savings rate? If there really is such a thing as the wisdom of crowds, maybe it makes sense to consider whether most Americans know something that all the worrywarts don't. 
 I think they do. I think they've noticed that, given the way society is organized and the way the securities markets have been acting lately, saving doesn't make a lot of sense.
 First, how can anybody take savings exhortations seriously from a government that seems to revel in fiscal profligacy? Secretary Snow is part of an administration whose policies have plunged the federal budget deep into the red with tax cuts, an expensive prescription plan for older Americans and a costly war in Iraq.
 The government's shortfalls are seriously undermining national savings, and they strongly imply higher taxes down the road. Somebody will have to cover all those deficits, and a climbing ratio of retirees to workers will mean increased levies to pay for Social Security and health care for the elderly. 
 Higher taxes tomorrow make saving less appealing by reducing future after-tax investment returns. That is especially the case for tax-deferred retirement savings: why defer taxes if they're going only higher? 
 Retirement savers may also worry that when the great waves of baby-boomer retirees hit the Social Security system without adequate private savings, the prudent will be taxed even more to cover the costs of the imprudent. That's another reason not to save.
 Maybe parents have noticed that the same reasoning can be applied to saving for college -- a process that is unlikely to help get financial aid. Why show up on campus with your piggy bank full if the bursar is likely to expropriate the money?
 Taxpayers have had decades to notice that the income tax system, which penalizes working and saving by taxing the earnings from each, is yet another good reason not to save. 
 In a rational world, we would have a progressive consumption tax that would penalize high levels of spending instead of earning and saving. As it stands now, the system encourages gigantic homes and commensurately large mortgages, because mortgage interest is tax deductible.
 Potential savers have certainly noticed, too, that there is no good place to invest their money. Returns are dismal across the board. That makes saving less attractive -- and requires extra risk to achieve any given level of reward.
 There is also the problem of purchasing power. Signs that inflation may be reviving suggest that your money may be worth less later than it is now. And sooner or later, the dollar will fall against the yuan, making much of what we buy -- from China, anyway -- cost more.
 Given all this, perhaps what we have here is not truly a failure to save. Perhaps it's something closer to rational profligacy. 
 Under the circumstances, is it any wonder that our main savings vehicle is our homes -- or that home prices are soaring? In the long run, houses outperform inflation, provide tax-advantaged financing and capital gains, tend not to implode like Enron and, at the very least, provide a comfortable place to live.
 The funny thing is that while society discourages saving, Americans probably save more than the numbers suggest. The government's system of measuring personal saving fails to capture changing asset values, mishandles pensions and has other shortcomings that cause it to understate actual savings, at least in the opinion of some economists. 
 EVERYONE needs a rainy-day fund, of course. But if we really want society to save more, we have to stop penalizing thrift, stop taxing earned income and stop the federal deficits. 
 Until that happens, consider the bright side. If Americans started saving seriously, they would have to cut back on consumer spending. That would kick the last prop out from under the global economy. Instead, we're gamely fighting world poverty, one purchase at a time.

HEADLINE: WINNER IN IRAN CALLS FOR UNITY; REFORMISTS REEL

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SLACKMAN

DATELINE: TEHRAN, June 25 

 BODY:
Iran's newly elected president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, said Saturday that he wanted to create a strong Islamic nation and issued a call for unity in his first comments after a landslide victory that left the country's reformist movement virtually powerless and threatened to further complicate relations with the United States.
 In an address on state radio, Mr. Ahmadinejad, a religious conservative, said he would work toward building ''an Islamic, exemplary, advanced and powerful nation,'' and urged Iranians to ''forget all our rivalries and turn them into friendships.''
 But his rival in the race, Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, was anything but conciliatory, lashing out in a statement that accused his opponents of smearing him during the campaign. ''I am sure that those who spent billions from the public funds to ruin the reputation of me and my family in a vicious way, and those who took advantage of the regime's tools and intervened in the elections in an organized way will pay back in life and after death,'' he said in the statement. 
 Mr. Ahmadinejad's rise to the presidency -- the most important elected post in the country -- reflected a desire by Iranian voters to change the economy and rid the nation of corruption.
 In his campaign, Mr. Ahmadinejad (pronounced ah-ma-DEE-nay-jahd), who came from humble origins as a blacksmith's son to become an engineer and in 2003 the mayor of Tehran, outlined a domestic agenda that can be described as Islamic socialism -- protecting the core values of the Islamic revolution while using state resources to provide a financial safety net for all Iranian families, especially the poor. 
 But the consolidation of power in the hands of conservatives could prove troublesome for United States and the European Union, which is scheduled to resume talks with Iran in July over its nuclear program. While the election might not fundamentally change the country's foreign policy positions, which are controlled by the clerics who have final say over all government actions, Mr. Ahmadinejad's fierce nationalism could undermine any chance of a reconciliation with the United States, as well as complicate the nuclear talks.
 Members of the European Union expressed concern about those talks on Saturday. The British foreign secretary, Jack Straw, said he hoped Iran under Mr. Ahmadinejad would ''take early steps to address international concerns about its nuclear program.'' 
 The White House responded to the election result by reiterating charges made previously by President Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice over the legitimacy of the vote, noting that ''over 1,000 candidates were disqualified from running and there were many allegations of election fraud and interference.''
 Mr. Ahmadinejad's victory, like the victory in 1997 of the departing president Mohammad Khatami, amounted to protest votes by an electorate eager for change. In Mr. Khatami's case, it was a desire for social change -- this time for economic change. But in both elections, the vote was a rebuff of the candidates voters perceived as representing the ruling elite. 
 Mr. Ahmadinejad's opponent in the runoff election on Friday, the former two-term president Mr. Rafsanjani, saw his prospect for victory fade in part because he was widely viewed as the candidate of the system that voters wanted to reform. 
 Yet Mr. Ahmadinejad is also an insider. He has long worked with some of this country's most conservative institutions, from the Basij -- the militia that often patrols the streets and enforces strict codes of dress and conduct -- to the Revolutionary Guards. In addition, his main support came from the conservatives, including the supreme religious leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who control the most powerful institutions in the country. His victory on Friday gives the conservatives a monopoly on power and is expected to give those forces a freer hand in running the country.
 The nation's leading reformers seemed stunned by the victory of Mr. Ahmadinejad. Mohammad Ali Abtahi, a former vice president and chief aid to the departing president, said in an analysis posted on his popular blog that Mr. Ahmadinejad won in part because of missteps by reformists, from offering unrealistic campaign promises, to losing touch with average people.
 ''In the political atmosphere of the advertisements, little was said about the economic issues,'' he wrote. ''We focused our attention on elites and forgot the ordinary people who are trying to get their daily bread.''
 Assadolah Athari, a political analyst with close ties to the reform movement said Iranians were ''just frustrated with the bad economy and high prices.''
 ''They are frustrated with a small group that is in power and is filthy rich,'' he said. Part of the vote was also a protest vote for the founders of the revolution. They wanted to vote for somebody else to get rid of the older leaders.
 In the runoff election on Friday, voters chose between candidates with very different visions for the country: Mr. Rafsanjani, 70, who promised social changes, privatization and better relations with the United States; and Mr. Ahmadinejad, 49, who focused almost exclusively on the nation's economic needs and appealed to Iranians' national pride.
 According to final figures issued Saturday by the Interior Ministry, Mr. Ahmadinejad won 17.2 million votes compared with just over 10 million for Mr. Rafsanjani. The ministry said about 28 million voters went to the polls, for a turnout of about 60 percent, about the same as in the first round.
 In his campaign, Mr. Ahmadinejad presented himself as eager to help Iran improve its international relations, acknowledging that it is impossible for Iran to cut itself off. But he has maintained that foreign relations must always be on Iran's terms.
 ''In our foreign policy, in addition to the Islamic world and the Iranian domain of civilization, any country that has no intention of enmity with the Islamic Republic can enjoy broad relations with us,'' he said at a news conference last week when he announced he had made it into the runoff.
 But Mr. Ahmadinejad has lashed out at foreign governments he views as hostile. In 2001, for example, when German officials formally complained about the arrest and conviction of reformers who had taken part in a conference in Berlin and Chancellor Gerhard Schroder then postponed a trip to Tehran, Mr. Ahmadinejad was quoted in the Iranian daily Resalat as saying, ''Germany's mentality is exactly the same as during the Hitler era.'' At the time he was a leading member of the Islamic Association of Engineers, a conservative group.
 But that kind of vitriolic language was largely missing from the campaign for the presidency. Mr. Ahmadinejad and his campaign surrogates rejected extremism, refusing even to publicly criticize Mr. Rafsanjani, whom they complimented as a leader and a statesman whom they would turn to for advice if Mr. Ahmadinejad were elected.
 Mr. Ahmadinejad instead emphasized his piety and independence, insisting that he did not represent any political party but was a man of the people. His core supporters, the ultrareligious, spoke of him with reverence, as though he were a religious figure and not a politician. It was his everyman posture, compared to the regal style of Mr. Rafsanjani, that won many people over. On election day, Mr. Ahmadinejad waited with average citizens before casting his vote.
 ''All through my life I have never seen a presidential candidate standing in a queue like ordinary people,'' said Seyed Mohammad Shekarabi, 75, who broke into tears when he saw Mr. Ahmadinejad take his place in the line.
 It was Mr. Rafsanjani whom voters perceived as the embodiment of a system they have grown to distrust. A former president and cleric, who has become a very wealthy businessman, Mr. Rafsanjani carried himself as royalty during the campaign, never taking to the streets, and never seeming to understand that his history as an elder statesman of the republic was viewed as a liability, not an asset.
 Sadeq Zibakalam, a political analyst and supporter of Mr. Rafsanjani, said conservatives had a core support of 7 million to 10 million voters nationwide.
 ''The rest of the votes,'' Mr. Zibakalam said, ''were from people convinced it was Rafsanjani who was responsible for the awful mess of the economy.''
 Mr. Rafsanjani tried to win by taking his cues from Mr. Khatami's playbook, holding campaign events with loud rock music where young men and women mingled, and promising to protect social freedoms.
 But interviews with voters, political analysts and politicians demonstrated that Mr. Rafsanjani did not understand the priorities of the public. With modest social successes already achieved, many voters said they turned their attention to more immediate concerns like jobs, food prices, health insurance and, perhaps most of all, a perception of honesty.
 Some said that they valued the social reforms that had given them more control over their personal lives, but that they were voting for Mr. Ahmadinejad because they wanted better management of the country and because they no longer viewed reformist parties as viable vehicles of change.
 President Khatami's failure to push through significant social and economic reforms during his eight years in office left many people as distrustful of the left as the right. 
 ''Iranians are not fed up with reforms because they are still interested in change,'' said Amir Ali Nourbakhsh, a political and economic consultant based in Tehran. ''But what they are looking for is someone they can trust.''
 Mehdi Ebrahimi, 32, is exactly the kind of voter Mr. Rafsanjani should have been able to attract. He is upper middle class and lives in the leafy neighborhood of northeast Tehran. Mr. Ebrahimi, who is married and is not conservative in his religious views, owns a business that does landscaping for the city of Tehran.
 Under previous mayors, Mr. Ebrahimi said, his company was often paid as late as six months after completing the work. He said he found that especially annoying, given the lavish lifestyles of the former officials. But, he said, since Mr. Ahmadinejad became mayor, the city has been paying on time while the mayor has continued to live as an average citizen.
 This mayor streamlined the municipal bureaucracy, Mr. Ebrahimi said of Mr. Ahmadinejad. ''He is not like other mayors. He is simple. He has been able to cut spending in the city. He is honest.''

HEADLINE: A Glide Path To Ruin

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF. 
E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The biggest risk we Americans face to our way of life and our place in the world probably doesn't come from Al Qaeda or the Iraq war.
 Rather, the biggest risk may come from this administration's fiscal recklessness and the way this is putting us in hock to China.
''I think the greatest threat to our future is our fiscal irresponsibility,'' warns David Walker, the comptroller general of the United States. Mr. Walker, an accountant by training, asserts that last year may have been the most fiscally reckless in the history of our Republic. Aside from the budget deficit, Congress enacted the prescription drug benefit -- possibly an $8 trillion obligation -- without figuring out how to pay for it. 
 Mr. Walker, America's watchdog in chief and head of the Government Accountability Office, is no Bush-basher. He started out his career as a conservative Democrat, then became a moderate Republican and has been an independent since 1997.
 Now he's running around with his hair on fire, shrieking about America's finances. Well, as much as any accountant ever shrieks.
 I asked Mr. Walker about Paul Volcker's warning that within five years we face a 75 percent chance of a serious financial crisis.
 ''If we don't get serious soon,'' Mr. Walker replied, ''it's not a question of whether it'll come, but when and how serious.''
 Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel-winning economist, says he is also ''very worried.''
 ''I find it very difficult to know how to put a number'' on the probability of a crisis, he added, ''but there's a widespread sense in the market that there is a substantial chance.''
 Another issue is that three-fourths of our new debt is now being purchased by foreigners, with China the biggest buyer of all. That gives China leverage over us, and it undermines our national security.
 On fiscal matters both parties have much to be ashamed of, but Republicans should be particularly embarrassed at their tumble. Traditionally, Republicans were prudent, while Democrats held great parties. But these days, the Bush administration is managing America's finances like a team of drunken sailors, and most Republicans keep quiet in a way that betrays their conservative principles.
 Senator Chuck Hagel, a Republican, wrote a couple of years ago: ''Republicans used to believe in balanced budgets. We have lost our way." He's right. 
 Critics have pounded the Bush administration for its faulty intelligence in the run-up to the war in Iraq. But President Bush peddled tax cuts with data that ultimately proved equally faulty -- yet the tax cuts remain cemented in place.
 Go to www.whitehouse.gov and read Mr. Bush's speech when he presented his first budget in February 2001. He foresaw a $5.6 trillion surplus over 10 years and emphasized that much of that would go to paying down the debt.
 ''I hope you will join me to pay down $2 trillion in debt during the next 10 years,'' Mr. Bush said then, between his calls for tax cuts. ''That is more debt, repaid more quickly, than has ever been repaid by any nation at any time in history.'' His budget message that year promised that the U.S. would be ''on a glide path toward zero debt.''
 Oh?
 More than two centuries of American government produced a cumulative national debt of $5.7 trillion when Mr. Bush was elected in 2000. And now that is expected to almost double by 2010, to $10.8 trillion.
 Some readers may be surprised to see me fulminating about budget deficits, since often I'm bouncing over ruts abroad trying to call attention to some forgotten crisis, like Darfur. But there is a common thread: These are issues that aren't sexy, that don't get television time and that most Americans tune out -- yet demand action on our part for both moral and practical reasons.
 America's fiscal mess may be even harder to write about engagingly than Darfur, because the victims of our fiscal recklessness aren't weeping widows whose children were heaved onto bonfires. But if you need to visualize the victims, think of your child's face, or your grandchild's.
 President Bush has excoriated the ''death tax,'' as he calls the estate tax. But his profligacy will leave every American child facing a ''birth tax'' of about $150,000.
 That's right: every American child arrives owing that much, partly to babies in China and Japan. No wonder babies cry.

HEADLINE: The Fed, Under a Microscope

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
IF you're a fan of economic news, you'll get your fill this week -- and then some. The Federal Reserve policy makers' meeting is on the agenda, along with widely followed snapshots of manufacturing, personal income and consumer confidence.
 It's hard to find anyone who doubts that the Federal Open Market Committee will announce its ninth consecutive quarter-point increase in its short-term interest rate target, to 3.25 percent, when its meeting ends on Thursday afternoon. 
 ''The market would be entirely shocked if there were not a quarter-point hike,'' said Jonathan Golub, a strategist at J.P. Morgan Funds. ''The debate is over what the language is going to look like.''
 Analysts will pore over the statement accompanying the rate decision, hoping to detect hints of how many more increases may be in store. An additional increase in August is regarded as almost definite, Mr. Golub said, while September is seen as more iffy. Wall Street should view favorably any new phrasing that suggests the end is nigh for this round of rate increases, he added.
 ''The stock market is probably assuming the language is going to remain the same, so if the market is going to be surprised, it's going to be surprised on the upside,'' Mr. Golub explained. ''If the Fed says it's no longer being accommodative, the market's going to love that,'' he said, because it would show that the Fed thought it had raised rates to a level likely to prevent an outbreak of inflation.
 But he emphasized that the more probable sequence of events remains more of the same from Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, who seems to have accomplished the improbable feat of saying the same thing over and over again while keeping an industry of very smart people wondering what's on his mind.
 ''Autopilot is working fine for Alan Greenspan,'' Mr. Golub said. ''Why would he want to change?''

DATA WATCH -- The first big number of the week comes on Tuesday, when the Conference Board publishes its survey of consumer confidence for June. The consensus among economists polled by Bloomberg News was for an increase to 104.4, from 102.2 in May.
 On Thursday, before the Fed decision, the Labor Department will report personal income and spending for May. The Bloomberg poll foresees 0.3 percent growth in income, down from 0.7 percent growth the previous month, and 0.1 percent growth in spending, down from 0.6 percent growth in April.
 On Friday, the University of Michigan will weigh in with its gauge of consumer sentiment. And the Institute for Supply Management manufacturing survey is expected to show a slight gain, to 51.5, from 51.4 in May. Any reading above 50 implies expansion in the sector.


CORRECTION-DATE: July 10, 2005

 CORRECTION:
A brief entry in the Market Week column on June 26 about monthly economic reports misidentified the source of data on personal income and spending. It was the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis, not the Labor Department.

HEADLINE: Blacksmith's Son Emphasized His Modest Roots

BYLINE: By NAZILA FATHI

DATELINE: TEHRAN, June 25 

 BODY:
In choosing Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Iranian voters elevated a blacksmith's son who has made more of his modest background and frugal ways than his revolutionary credentials or political experience.
 In part, that is because Mr. Ahmadinejad, 49, is a new face on the political scene even to most Iranians. In a few years, he has risen from governor of a backwater province to mayor of Iran's premier city to the presidency, his way cleared by support from conservative clerical leaders. 
 ''He was not a prominent political figure until two months ago, when he announced his candidacy,'' said Alireza Akbari, a former deputy defense minister and senior official with the Revolutionary Guards. ''We heard about his background after he became mayor of Tehran.''
 According to the biography posted on his Web site, mardomyar.com (which means ''friend of the people''), he holds a doctorate in civil engineering and is a teacher at the University of Science and Industry in Tehran. 
 After growing up in a Tehran suburb, he came of age in the turbulent years leading to Iran's Islamic revolution in 1979. He volunteered for military service after his country went to war with Iraq, and he rose to the hard-line Revolutionary Guards. Later, he was also active in the Basij religious militia, known for policing strict adherence to conservative dress codes for women.
 He was appointed governor of Ardabil, a province in the northwest, from 1993 through 1997. In 2003, the country's ruling ayatollahs appointed him mayor of Tehran, at the front of a wave of hard-line politicians swept into city government after low voter turnout marred elections. 
 Mr. Ahmadinejad's close affiliation to Iran's religious establishment and his decisions as mayor have raised concerns that his presidency could bring an era of social and political repression. He turned cultural centers into prayer halls for several months after his appointment, and he canceled many concerts and secular programs.
 In his campaign, he brushed off questions on tolerance for political dissent and release of political prisoners. ''Which political prisoners? The ones in the United States?'' he asked sarcastically when a reporter asked what he would do for more than a dozen political prisoners here. 
 Mr. Ahmadinejad has played down fears of repression. ''People think a return to revolutionary values is only a matter of wearing the head scarf,'' Reuters quoted him as saying. ''The country's true problem is employment and housing, not what to wear.''
 What probably gained him his landslide victory on Friday, however, were his pledges to end government corruption and to raise people's incomes. He has presented himself as a simple man, stressing his modest upbringing and lifestyle. His direct manner and his blunt criticism of the wealthy attracted the support of millions of voters from the lower and middle classes. 
 In his two interviews broadcast last week on the state-run television, he offered simple solutions to the problems of some ordinary Iranians. ''Teachers in our society have been making a lot of sacrifice and lived on small salaries,'' he said. ''We can increase their incomes by economizing our expenditure in other government sectors.'' Teachers have been protesting low incomes for years. 
 In addition, he has shown a sense of humor rare for an Iranian politician. He caused a sensation when he began laughing heartily during a broadcast interview after a reporter told him a joke making the rounds that he would change the name of the ubiquitous Iranian car, Samand, meaning horse, into Zol-Jalal, the name of the horse of Imam Hussein, one of the Prophet Muhammad's successors in the Shiite tradition.

HEADLINE: Spending More, Mayor Refines Voter Strategy

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG

 BODY:
Four years after he won City Hall as a novice politician, Michael R. Bloomberg is far outpacing his record-breaking spending in that race, and is well into a far more sophisticated second campaign for mayor -- one that uses a multimillion-dollar vote-getting machine that mimics many of the techniques used by the 2004 Bush presidential campaign.
 Behind the re-election drive is the most comprehensive database of information about New Yorkers -- their income levels, occupations, religious faith and interests -- collected by a mayoral campaign, devised to help Mr. Bloomberg's team tailor messages to specific voters based on their profiles.
 Mr. Bloomberg, a billionaire businessman and a Republican, has ordered his team to spare no expense in securing a second term, and since he is spending only his own money, he has a special ability to give those instructions. 
 And his team, led largely by seasoned Democratic hands, is obeying his charge, spending in ways that have left his potential rivals agape while following a far more rigid game plan than in 2001. 
 Mr. Bloomberg's campaign has already spent more than $15 million, more than three times the amount spent by his four Democratic rivals combined. That is far ahead of his spending at this point in the 2001 race, when he smashed records for a New York City campaign by spending $74 million, more than three times the previous record, even after accounting for inflation.
 ''I suppose I can't spend any more than I have,'' the mayor said, joking during a recent interview when asked how much he would spend. But he added, ''I think it would be a great shame if you didn't have a second term to continue doing what you're doing, because almost everything that we've done would get rolled back.''
 The mayor added that this time the election would be a referendum on his stewardship of the city, and that his victory in 2001, which enabled him to succeed Rudolph W. Giuliani, was more a vote against his Democratic opponent, Mark Green, than for him. Mr. Bloomberg won that race, with 50 percent of the vote to Mr. Green's 47 percent, despite various missteps and misstatements.
 The latest poll has shown Mr. Bloomberg leading all his Democratic opponents by comfortable margins, though the polls have been volatile. His opponents are attacking him, saying he is too closely aligned with Washington Republicans and has the wrong priorities for the city.
 Mr. Bloomberg, his strategists say, learned through his gaffes in 2001 -- including his statement that year that sanitation workers had more dangerous jobs than police officers -- that a candidate can have as much to fear from himself as from his opponents, and that fact has driven him to be more disciplined. 
 Aides were also chastened by the 2003 defeat of a citywide referendum for nonpartisan elections pushed by Mr. Bloomberg, a disappointment that proved a campaign can spend huge sums and still fail if it neglects to build a coalition of support. 
 At the heart of the re-election drive is an aggressive television, radio and Internet campaign that began last month with glowing ads promoting the mayor's record on crime, schools and jobs. The ads are meant to deny the Democrats any issues to use against the mayor as they approach their Sept. 13 primary, campaign aides said. 
 The campaign's approach also includes calling on a large number of volunteers trained to spread Mr. Bloomberg's message to their neighbors. This effort is akin to that of the 2004 campaign of President Bush, with whose political advisers the Bloomberg team has consulted. The mayor's team, which is led by former aides to Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan and includes former Democratic presidential campaign strategists for Bill Clinton and John Kerry, is also making a behind-the-scenes push to win over important Democratic groups -- gay men and lesbians, unions, housing advocates -- or, at least, to placate them enough to take the passion out of their opposition.
 Mr. Bloomberg's campaign manager, Kevin Sheekey, is leading the re-election effort, and has been meeting with various leaders, especially union chiefs. The campaign hopes that he will steal away at least some unions, especially in the construction trades, that traditionally get behind the Democrats.
 ''They are building a tank -- financially, politically, operationally,'' Mr. Green said. ''With the disparate resources plus incumbency, some see the Democratic nominee like that brave Chinese student standing in front of that tank at Tiananmen Square.'' 
 While the campaign is being methodically planned, one great uncertainty is who will emerge as the mayor's Democratic opponent. A perceived front-runner, Fernando Ferrer, has stumbled in recent months, but aides to the Bloomberg campaign say they believe Mr. Ferrer will most likely win the primary.
 Politically, Mr. Bloomberg is now free of what was the largest perceived drag on his standing in public opinion polls: his plan for a West Side stadium. His overall popularity ratings are at their highest levels since his honeymoon nearly four years ago. 
 Yet none of this negates the fact that voters in this overwhelmingly Democratic city are often reluctant to back a Republican. Polls also show that many voters still have doubts about whether Mr. Bloomberg, a former Democrat, cares about the problems of the average New Yorker and whether his priorities extend beyond Manhattan. And one top campaign aide said the team's greatest challenge will come if Democrats unite behind their nominee.
 In that case, the winner of the Democratic nomination would have the support of the traditional party organization, including major labor unions and political clubs, whose reach and resources surpass those of the city's tiny Republican Party. Mr. Bloomberg and his aides say his work will be cut out for him, especially against Mr. Ferrer, the former Bronx borough president, who is expected to cut significantly into the large share of the Hispanic vote Mr. Bloomberg received in 2001. 
 ''If the candidate that runs against me is a Latino, there will be a great deal of ethnic pride,'' Mr. Bloomberg said in the interview, with reporters and editors of The New York Times. Alluding to C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president and Mr. Ferrer's closest primary opponent in recent polls, Mr. Bloomberg said, ''If the candidate that runs against me is a black woman, there will be a great deal of ethnic pride.''
 But there are two other potential opponents, both of whom are white and have shown little traction in polls so far: City Council Speaker Gifford Miller and United States Representative Anthony D. Weiner. 
 Mr. Bloomberg has asked his campaign to look at every ethnic group with equal force in terms of spending and strategy. ''I will reach out to every single group in this city,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. 
 The mayor is taking a special interest in his campaign's huge collection of voter data, aides say. He meets with his team at its Midtown headquarters at least once a week. As one senior strategist, William T. Cunningham, put it, ''He's a very competitive guy.''
 But aides acknowledge that he is making their jobs far easier this time, becoming a more disciplined campaigner who makes fewer gaffes than he did four years ago, with a much deeper understanding of the city.
 He has spent more than $5 million on his voter database, which is being developed by his pollster, Doug Schoen, a former adviser to Mr. Clinton. That amount is roughly as much as Mr. Bush's campaign spent for a national voter list last year. 
 Mr. Cunningham said Mr. Bloomberg's 2001 campaign used a voter list that was sophisticated by the standards of the time, but technology has improved. ''It's the difference between going from X-ray machines to M.R.I.'s,'' Mr. Cunningham said.
 Mr. Cunningham would not share specifics about what personal information the list includes, but Jerry Skurnick, whose company, Prime New York, collects voter data, said the possibilities were nearly endless.
 ''They could conceivably identify somebody with a child in the public schools for specific mailings about Bloomberg and education,'' Mr. Skurnick said. ''Or, if they find somebody who's contributed to environmental groups, make phone calls and do mailings about what Bloomberg has done on recycling.''
 Mr. Bloomberg has yet to send out such mailings in any significant way, but he has begun a precise advertising blitz. Already, at a time when none of his potential opponents are in a position to do so, Mr. Bloomberg is running ads on Spanish-language stations like Telemundo and Univision, and ads on the Web sites of newspapers like El Diario. 
 One television ad, about a boy with cerebral palsy whose parents say he benefited greatly from Mr. Bloomberg's personal help, is running on cable networks aimed at women, including Lifetime, We and Home and Garden Television. A spot promoting his record on crime and featuring Mr. Giuliani is running heavily on cable networks that particularly appeal to men, such as Fox News Channel, TNT and the Yes Network.
 Mr. Cunningham said the voter list would also be used as a tool for Mr. Bloomberg's volunteers as they go door to door this summer. The list will alert them to particular issues that neighbors may be interested in. 
 ''The point is, if they say they're going to talk to 5 or 10 of their neighbors, we can get them what they need,'' Mr. Cunningham said.
 Mr. Sheekey, the Bloomberg campaign manager, said he hoped to put 50,000 volunteers to work. So far, the campaign says, 15,000 have signed up. 
 The volunteer effort mirrors Mr. Bush's campaign, which set out to build a huge network of supporters to counter the Democrats' traditional organizational muscle in getting voters to the polls.
 ''I think they recognize what they don't have: they don't have a ground operation, they don't have an infrastructure, an apparatus to support a field operation,'' said Howard Wolfson, a senior adviser to the state Democratic Party. 
 On the Democratic side, he said, ''You've got unions and political clubs reaching out to memberships, and they don't have a membership.''
 But no matter how comfortable things may seem now, Mr. Bloomberg's team says that November is a long way away.
 ''We don't know what's going to happen between now and Election Day, and we would be foolish not to be looking at every eventuality and trying to deal with it,'' Mr. Cunningham said. ''One thing we do know about New York City politics is something will happen that nobody can forecast -- Sept. 11, the Crown Heights riots -- there is always some event that descends upon the city.''

HEADLINE: 'King Of The Hill' Democrats?

BYLINE: By Matt Bai. 
Matt Bai, a contributing writer for the magazine, is writing a book about the future of the Democrats.

 BODY:
If you watch a lot of cable news, by now you've probably heard someone refer to a bloc of voters known as '' 'South Park' conservatives.'' The term comes from the title of a new book by Brian C. Anderson, a conservative pundit who adapted it from the writer Andrew Sullivan, and it refers to the notion that Comedy Central's obscene spoof of life in small-town America, with its hilarious skewering of liberal snobbery, is somehow the perfect crucible for understanding a new breed of brash and irreverent Republican voters. In truth, aside from its title, Anderson's book has very little to say about ''South Park'' itself; it's really just a retread of the argument that the mainstream media is losing its grip on world domination, marketed rather cynically to appeal to the same red-state radio hosts and book clubs that make so many right-wing polemics best sellers. 
 If politicians and pundits are really so desperate to understand the values of conservative America without leaving their living rooms, then they should start setting the TiVo to record another animated sitcom, which Anderson mentions only in passing and which, despite its general policy of eschewing politics, somehow continues to offer the most subtle and complex portrayal of small-town voters on television: ''King of the Hill,'' on Fox. North Carolina's two-term Democratic governor, Mike Easley, is so obsessed with the show that he instructs his pollster to separate the state's voters into those who watch ''King of the Hill'' and those who don't so he can find out whether his arguments on social and economic issues are making sense to the sitcom's fans.
 For those who have somehow missed ''King of the Hill'' during its nine-year run, here's a lightning-quick primer: It revolves around a classic American everyman, the earnest Hank Hill, who sells ''propane and propane accessories'' in the small town of Arlen, Tex. Hank lives with his wife, Peggy, a substitute Spanish teacher who can't really speak Spanish, and his son, Bobby, a sensitive class clown who exhibits none of his father's manliness. (''This is a carburetor,'' Hank tells his son. ''Take it apart, put it back together; repeat until you're normal.'') 
 The important thing here is that Hank Hill may be a Texan, but he and his friends could live in any of the fast-developing rural and exurban areas around Columbus or Phoenix or Atlanta that are bound to become the political weathervanes of the new century. The families in Arlen buy American-made pickups, eat at chain restaurants, maniacally water their lawns and do their shopping at the huge Mega Lo Mart. This could easily be the setup for a mean parody about rural life in America, in the same vein as ''South Park,'' but ''King of the Hill,'' which was created by Mike Judge (who is the voice of Hank and who also created ''Beavis and Butt-head''), has never been so crass. The show's central theme has always been transformation -- economic, demographic and cultural. Hank embodies all the traditional conservative values of those Americans who, as Bill Clinton famously put it, ''work hard and play by the rules.'' He's a proud gun owner and a Nascar fan. When Bobby announces that he has landed a job selling soda at the track, Hank solemnly responds, ''If you weren't my son, I'd hug you.''
 As Arlen becomes more built up and more diverse, however, Hank finds himself struggling to adapt to new phenomena: art galleries and yoga studios, latte-sipping parents who ask their kids to call them by their first names and encourage them to drink responsibly. The show gently pokes fun at liberal and conservative stereotypes, but the real point is not to eviscerate so much as to watch Hank struggle mightily to adapt to a world of political correctness and moral ambiguity. When Peggy tells him he'll look like a racist for snubbing his Laotian neighbor, Hank replies, ''What the hell kind of country is this where I can only hate a man if he's white?'' And yet, like a lot of the basically conservative voters you meet in rural America -- and here's where Democrats should pay close attention -- Hank never professes an explicit party loyalty, and he and his buddies who sip beer in the alley don't talk like their fellow Texan Tom DeLay. If Hank votes Republican, it's because, as a voter who cares about religious and rural values, he probably doesn't see much choice. But Hank and his neighbors resemble many independent voters, open to proposals that challenge their assumptions about the world, as long as those ideas don't come from someone who seems to disrespect what they believe.
 The composition of the audience for ''King of the Hill'' is telling. You might expect that a spoof of a small-town propane salesman and his beer-drinking buddies would attract mostly urban intellectuals, with their highly developed sense of irony. In fact, as Governor Easley long ago realized, the show's primary viewer looks a lot like Hank Hill. According to Nielsen Media Research, the largest group of ''King of the Hill'' viewers is made up of men between the ages of 18 and 49, and almost a quarter of those men own pickup trucks. ''This is only the second show that's a comedy about the South -- this and 'Andy Griffith' -- that doesn't make fun of Southerners,'' Easley told me recently, adding that Hank and his neighbors remind him of the people he grew up with in the hills near Greenville. (Which is probably why Easley does startlingly good impressions of the various characters, including the verbally challenged Boomhauer.) 
 Easley polls surprisingly well for a Democrat among these voters, and he says he thinks that understanding the show's viewers might resolve some of the mysteries confronting his party about the vast swaths of red on the electoral map. Easley is reasonably progressive -- he raised taxes during his first term to protect education spending -- but he's also known as a guy who cracked up a race car during a spin on a Nascar course. When the governor, a former prosecutor, prepares to make his case on a partisan issue, he likes to imagine that he's explaining his position to Hank -- an exercise that might be useful for his colleagues in Washington too. For instance, Easley told me that Hank would never support a budget like the one North Carolina's Senate recently passed, which would drop some 65,000 mostly elderly citizens from the Medicaid rolls; Hank, after all, has pitched in to support his own father, a brutish war veteran, and he would never condone a community's walking away from its ailing parents. Similarly, Hank may be a lover of the environment -- he was furious when kids trashed the local campground -- but he resents self-righteous environmentalists like the ones who forced Arlen to install those annoying low-flow toilets. Voters like Hank, if they had heard about it on the evening news, would have supported Easley's ''Clean Smokestacks'' law, which forced North Carolina's coal-powered electric plants to burn cleaner, but only because industry was a partner in the final bill, rather than its target.
 If other Democrats want to learn from ''King of the Hill,'' they may need to act fast. John Altschuler, one of the show's executive producers, fears that the show's 10th season next year could be its last; despite decent ratings, Fox has been buying fewer episodes and shifting its time slot, and there are rumors that the network may want to substitute yet another new reality show in its place. This is odd: after all, there is more reality about American life in five minutes of ''King of the Hill'' than in a full season of watching Paris Hilton prance around a farm in high heels. But none of this would come as much of a surprise to Hank Hill and his neighbors, who realized long ago that, as a nation, we often discard the things we once cherished in favor of a more synthetic modernity. ''The only place you can find a Main Street these days is in Disneyland,'' Hank once said. ''And just try to buy a gun there.''

HEADLINE: In Unocal Bid, U.S. Struggles With China Policies

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON; David E. Sanger and Jeff Gerth contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 25 

 BODY:
President Bush's initial response to the proposed takeover of a major American oil company by a Chinese rival has been to duck. It is not hard to see why.
 The $18.5 billion offer by the China National Offshore Oil Corporation for Unocal, which had already made a deal to be acquired by the American oil giant, Chevron, is forcing the administration to confront its own internal rifts over whether China should be viewed as friend, foe or something in between. 
 It is putting a spotlight on a host of related economic and foreign-policy issues -- from North Korea's nuclear program to America's growing dependence on foreign capital and the upward pressure on gasoline prices caused by China's thirst for oil -- that defy easy solutions.
 Hardly a week goes by without Mr. Bush vowing to make America less dependent on foreign sources of energy, so any deal that increases that dependence -- or is even perceived as doing so -- would create a problem for him. 
 And the situation has left the administration once again confronting the likelihood that its numerous ties to the oil industry will become a political issue.
 ''It's nothing but a headache for them,'' said James B. Steinberg, who was deputy national security adviser under President Bill Clinton. 
 For now, the administration is in a holding pattern. With no deal yet agreed to, Treasury Secretary John W. Snow told the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday that the issue remained hypothetical. The White House has avoided substantive comment on the matter.
 People inside and outside the administration who are involved in the matter said the White House would do its best to avoid taking a position for a while by referring a deal, if one is completed, to a body known as the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States, which reviews sensitive acquisitions by companies from abroad on the basis of national security.
 ''We have so much on the plate with China,'' said an adviser to Mr. Bush, who would speak only on the condition of anonymity because the president discourages unauthorized discussions about internal deliberations. ''How do you come down hard on them for this deal?'' 
 Dealing with energy policy has always been politically fraught for Mr. Bush, who got his start in business in the mid-1970's as an independent oilman in West Texas and who has often been cast by his opponents as a tool of the oil industry. Vice President Dick Cheney is even more of a lightning rod for that type of criticism, having led Halliburton, the giant oilfield services company, before joining the Republican ticket in 2000.
 Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was a director of Chevron for a decade before Mr. Bush's election, and even had a Chevron tanker named for her. (The tanker has subsequently been renamed.)
 Even if he were inclined to take a strong stand on the takeover, Mr. Bush would still have to navigate divisions among his advisers over how to proceed. 
 In recent months, the Pentagon and the State Department have been taking a harder line toward China, reflecting a broader push by conservatives in and out of government.
 In a speech in Singapore this month, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld criticized China for stepping up military spending in the absence of an obvious threat, and said growth in political freedom in China has not matched economic growth. State Department officials have been blunt in stating that China has not done enough to use its economic clout to press North Korea into serious negotiations about ending its nuclear program. 
 Even before the oil deal was in the headlines, the White House was working furiously to file the rough edges off a soon-to-be-released Pentagon report on China that described the country as a potential military threat. And in just two weeks, Ms. Rice is expected to land in Beijing, pressing anew for help on North Korea and making the point that if the North refuses to give up its nuclear program, the administration wants China to join in on sanctions. The Chinese have made clear they want to avoid that at all costs.
 But if Mr. Bush's national security advisers have tended toward a more hawkish view of late, his economic team has by and large viewed China as a vast market to be opened, a vital source of capital for the United States and a country whose political liberalization can be encouraged through economic engagement. Taking punitive action against China now, Mr. Snow told the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday, would be counterproductive.
 It is still not clear where some of the major players in the internal debate, especially Mr. Cheney, the primary architect of the administration's energy policy, may come out. 
 ''It will require some presidential leadership to address this array of issues and assign priorities and deal with the politics,'' said Richard C. Bush, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who is an authority on China.
 The coming talks with Beijing over North Korea's nuclear threat come against the backdrop of a trans-Pacific relationship that grew warmer after a rocky start at the beginning of the Bush administration. But the diplomatic maneuvering has been subject to periodic flare-ups of tension over a variety of issues, including Taiwan and China's support for Iran, a major supplier of China's oil.
 ''Remember, to the Chinese everything is related: the economics, the diplomacy, the military posture. It's all one,'' said a senior administration official, who declined to speak on the record because of the sensitivity of the diplomacy.
 The White House's reasons for playing for time, and avoiding any immediate escalation of tensions with Beijing, start with the fact that its most urgent diplomatic priority right now -- defusing the nuclear threat from North Korea -- depends to a great extent on cooperation from China. That effort is entering a crucial phase.
 But there are other strategic reasons to keep the relationship on an even keel. The financial stability of the United States, with its chronic budget deficits and propensity to spend far more than its saves, depends increasingly on the willingness of China to buy American government bonds. Any breach in relations could lead to higher interest rates.
 At the same time, the administration is trying to contain a protectionist backlash aimed not just at China but at Mr. Bush's free-trade philosophy in general. Congress has already grown impatient with what many members of both parties see as China's unwillingness to play by the rules of the global economy; any steps that inflame anti-China feelings could give new impetus to efforts to impose tariffs or other trade sanctions over the White House's objections. 
 The proposed deal presents Mr. Bush himself with a tough trade-off when it comes to economic openness. Mr. Bush has long lauded the benefits of reduced barriers to the flow of goods, services and money, and for the most part his administration has welcomed investment by China in American companies. This year, the administration approved I.B.M.'s sale of its personal computer business to a Chinese company, Lenovo. This openness also works in the other direction: Bank of America said earlier this month that it would pay $2.5 billion for a stake in China Construction Bank.
 Mr. Bush has made ''energy independence'' one of his defining themes. While the Chinese in this case say they would not be taking oil away from the United States, the deal's opponents suggest that it would place a vital resource in the hands of a nation that has a voracious and growing appetite for energy to fuel its rip-roaring economic expansion.
 The proposed oil deal is also a window into a much broader and even more complex topic: how the United States should manage its role in the global economy. 
 In the Clinton administration, globalization framed much of the debate about foreign and economic policy. Mr. Bush has tended not to view the world through the same prism, and, especially since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, globalization has been distinctly subordinated to security issues as a policy consideration. 
 But the forces that globalization encompasses have continued to reshape national economies and individual lives as jobs and money migrate across borders, and companies and markets adapt. And because of its high profile, the Chinese offer for Unocal could lead Mr. Bush to enunciate more of the principles he thinks should guide the painful trade-offs that globalization often requires.
 ''This is a piece of the larger and single most important challenge facing Americans,'' said Rahm Emanuel, who was a senior adviser to Mr. Clinton before being elected to Congress as a Democrat from Illinois in 2002. ''How do we compete in a global economy we know is good for us but that individually leads to less security rather than more opportunity? Unless we deal with that as a country, we will lose our predominant position.''

HEADLINE: New Hybrid May Curb Trucks' Thirst

BYLINE: By BRADLEY BERMAN

 BODY:
FOR all the hoopla over hybrids, sales of the high-efficiency gas-electric vehicles in the United States are still just a small slice -- about 1 percent -- of the new-car market. 
 Until recently, hybrid vehicles, too, were small. But a growing stream of sport utilities and midsize sedans with hybrid powertrains is changing that profile.
For instance, Toyota's line of hybrid models has expanded from the first-generation Prius, a pipsqueak that arrived in the United States in 2001 with a 70-horsepower gasoline engine and a 44-horsepower electric motor, to include larger vehicles like the Highlander, a hybrid utility wagon with a total of 268 horsepower from its gas and electric power plants. Hybrid luxury sedans that promise V-8 performance from 6-cylinder engines, like the Lexus GS450h that goes on sale next spring, are in the works. 
 The perception of hybrid vehicles broadened again with the announcement last December that DaimlerChysler had joined General Motors in developing a ''two mode'' hybrid system. To be used initially in full-size S.U.V.'s and pickups, the new system also represented a fundamental shift in the mechanical arrangement of hybrids: in contrast to the layouts used by Honda and Toyota, the two-mode hybrid places its electric motors inside the transmission housing, an arrangement made possible by the compact size of the motors.
 The design, according to G.M., is part of a strategy to develop hybrids that improve fuel economy at highway speeds as well as in the city, using two separate modes of operation. The electric motors deliver their power through variable-ratio gear sets, which allows them to be smaller and lighter while drawing less electricity. Smaller batteries and power controls than those required by single-mode systems can also be used. 
 G.M. says that the ability to package the electric motors directly within the transmission housing also offers a competitive advantage, making it easier to adapt hybrid technology to the wide range of vehicle sizes, engine types and drive systems in its global model portfolio.
 Rather than develop hybrid systems first for small vehicles and then scale it up for trucks -- as other carmakers have done -- G.M. borrowed the two-mode design from a system pioneered by its Allison division that is currently used in 350 city buses. G.M.'s position is that incremental economy gains on popular large vehicles -- full-size pickups are best-sellers in the United States -- will have a greater effect than big improvements on smaller, less popular cars. 
 The two-mode hybrid system will make its debut in the Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon in late 2007, and is expected in pickups the following year. (It is unrelated to the system currently used in Chevrolet and GMC pickups, which G.M., in something of a stretch, also labels a hybrid.) A hybrid Dodge Durango is expected soon after G.M. introduces its S.U.V.'s; Mercedes-Benz cars will use the two-mode design, too.
 In designing a hybrid system for pickups and large S.U.V.'s , G.M. engineers took to heart the strong preference expressed by customers for V-8 engines. To minimize the V-8's fuel consumption, the two-mode system makes use of existing technologies like cylinder deactivation -- a system G.M. calls ''displacement on demand'' -- to shut down half the engine when full power is not needed. Like other hybrids, the engine shuts off when the vehicle comes to a stop, then instantly restarts when the accelerator is pressed.
 The main distinction of the two-mode hybrid, though, is the use of a second set of gears configured specifically for moving big vehicles at highway speeds. The Honda and Toyota systems (and the Ford Escape Hybrid, which shares Toyota technology) use a single set of gears for both city and highway driving. 
 Larry Nitz, executive director for hybrid power train engineering at G.M., explained: ''It's two electronically controlled, continuously variable modes, and they have a point, a gear ratio, at which all the speeds synchronize. At that gear ratio, the engine switches from one mode to the other mode without a speed change.'' As a result, Mr. Nitz said, the transition between modes, at a speed that is equivalent to second gear in a conventional car, is nearly imperceptible. 
 ''When you're in the economy or city mode, you lean on the electric motors more, because the electric side allows you to operate more efficiently at light loads,'' Tim Grewe, chief engineer for rear-drive hybrids at G.M., said. ''When you are in performance or highway mode, you use more gears, because gears operate more efficiently for the high loads.''
 Each of the two-mode hybrid's two electric motors is about half the size of a motor used in today's hybrids. Even so, the two-mode system is powerful enough to move a full-size pickup through stop-and-go traffic without assistance from the gasoline engine, a trait that qualifies it as a full hybrid. 
 At high speeds, the second of the two gearing sets is engaged, essentially to reduce the demands placed on the electric components and to allow the V-8 engine to do what it does best: accelerate briskly and cope with high loads and towing. 
 The two-mode system is expected to achieve the same levels of fuel economy in both city and highway driving; typically, full hybrids get better fuel economy in the city than they do on the highway. 
 G.M. has not revealed exactly how it will pack so much functionality into such tight quarters, how much the system will cost or how many it expects to sell.
 Competitors remain skeptical about the benefits of a hybrid with two modes and two sets of gears. ''Until you see the mechanization, you don't know what those words mean,'' David W. Hermance, executive engineer for environmental engineering at Toyota, said, referring to the two-mode name. 
 Dave Reuter, a hybrid engineering consultant who worked on the Ford Escape Hybrid, sees the two-mode system as a logical evolution of the technology. ''Hybrids started with a single motor concept, then a motor-generator was added, allowing multiple configurations for splitting the power between gas and electricity.'' Mr. Reuter considers this development another venture in the ''discovery and development curve.''
 While small hybrid cars may carry fuel economy ratings that promise a savings of 40 percent compared with conventional vehicles of similar size (though it can be hard to make direct comparisons), G.M.'s projected improvement for the two-mode system is just 25 percent. But a 10 percent increase in fuel economy across the entire large-pickup truck market would save more than twice as many gallons of gasoline as an equal percentage gain in small cars, according to Walter McManus, director of the Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation at the University of Michigan. 
 The reason is simple: Americans buy millions of pickups every year. And while the mileage figures may be less remarkable than those of small cars, the savings are significant and the potentially high production volumes open opportunities to cut the cost of future hybrids.

HEADLINE: Web Merchants Brace For the Inevitable

BYLINE: By Bob Tedeschi

 BODY:
THOSE who believe death and taxes are the only sure things in life haven't spent much time with online retailers, which have largely avoided paying most sales taxes. 
 But that loophole appears to be closing.
Late last month, a California state appeals court found Borders.com, the online arm of the bookseller Borders Group, liable for $167,000 in taxes from April 1998 to September 1999, because the company had commingled the operations of its online subsidiary and its stores in that state. 
 That ruling, along with other efforts by state tax collectors to focus on Internet sales, could signal that the era of tax-free online sales is nearing an end. 
 A Supreme Court decision in 1992 said that mail-order merchants, and, by extension, online retailers, need not collect taxes on behalf of their customers' local jurisdictions unless those customers were in a state where the business operated. 
 Land-based retailers have long decried the fact that Amazon and others have largely avoided state tax collection, because such practices allow online companies to sell their goods at lower prices -- and at higher profit margins. Officials in the 45 states with a sales tax have bemoaned the revenues they have forgone particularly since 2000, when Internet sales spiked and the economy slowed, pushing many states into fiscal crisis.
 Scott L. Brandman, a lawyer with the firm Baker & McKenzie, which represented Borders in the California case, said the appellate court's decision ''could be used by states to reach out to new levels they haven't reached out to before.''
 Mr. Brandman said the California court failed to account for the fact that Borders.com and Borders Group were two separate corporate entities. So states could, he said, rely on this decision to say that when online companies use an unrelated offline business to promote the dot-com, the online company would have to collect taxes in states where the offline business operates. 
 That could, in theory, include the country's largest online retailer, Amazon.com, which now operates Borders' online store. 
 Borders had argued that because it set up a separate company to run its online operations -- and that company had no offices or staff in California -- it was not obliged to collect sales taxes from California residents, even though there were 129 Borders and Waldenbooks stores and a distribution center in that state. 
 The court said that because Borders's California stores essentially acted as agents for Borders.com by, among other things, accepting book returns from online customers, it must collect the state's tax.
 Craig Berman, an Amazon spokesman, said the California decision would not change its tax policies. ''We have no ownership interests in any of Border's entities, so we still don't have a physical presence in California,'' he said. The company currently collects tax from customers in Washington, where Amazon is based, and North Dakota and Kansas, where it has warehouses and customer service centers.
 Bill Fox, a professor of economics at the University of Tennessee, said states would lose at least $18 billion this year in tax revenues tied to online purchases. State tax officials have sought to close the loophole opened by the 1992 Supreme Court decision, Quill v. North Dakota, that held that it would be too burdensome on businesses if they were required to collect and remit sales taxes on behalf of the 7,600 state and local taxing jurisdictions across the country.
 Since 2002, more than 20 states have participated in the Streamlined Sales Tax Project, which, among other things, seeks to establish common sales tax rules and collection methods across states, and to distribute free software to businesses to help them collect the taxes easily. 
 By showing that tax collection represents no substantial burden to businesses, the Streamlined Sales Tax Project aims to spur federal legislation allowing states that have simplified their collection methods to mandate tax collection from retailers that do not have a physical presence in their state.
 Diane L. Hardt, the tax administrator for the Wisconsin Department of Revenue and the co-chairwoman of the project, said the effort would culminate late this month at a meeting in Chicago, at which she expected at least 10 states to announce that they had simplified their tax methods. Twenty-one states, she said, have passed legislation at least partly doing so.
 Ms. Hardt said she expected federal legislation supporting sales tax collection would be introduced in Congress ''within days'' of the Chicago meeting. Already, though, tax and business officials said the success of that legislation could hinge on a lobbying battle between the twin giants of online commerce, eBay and Amazon. 
 EBay's position is that any legislation requiring sellers to collect state sales tax should exempt businesses that sell ''in the range of $5 million'' or less annually, said Hani Durzy, an eBay spokesman. 
 ''For a small business to have to track all the taxing jurisdictions is enough a burden as to possibly risk putting them out of business,'' he said.
 Mr. Berman, of Amazon, takes issue with the $5 million floor. ''A far more reasonable threshold would be $10,000 a year,'' he said. ''Businesses who sell up to $5 million are not small.''
 Whatever tax burdens are placed on online businesses, consumers are not likely to notice, said Patti Freeman Evans, an analyst at Jupiter Research. She said retailers like Wal-Mart and Macy's already collected sales taxes for online purchases, since they wanted to offer services like in-store returns for their dot-com customers, and use their stores to help promote their Web sites.
 Just 9 percent of consumers surveyed by Jupiter said they would buy less or stop buying from an online store if it charged sales tax. 
 ''It's not that big a deal to consumers,'' Ms. Evans said. ''So there will be little loss.''

HEADLINE: From the Rubble: A City of Old? Or All Shiny and New?

BYLINE: By CARLOTTA GALL

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan, June 25 

 BODY:
Kabul was once a fabled city of gardens and fruit orchards beloved by the Mogul emperor Babur and serenaded by Persian poets, but little of its glorious past is evident today. Whole districts remain in ruins from the fighting of the 1990's, and the construction boom of the last three years since the arrival of Western aid, and the return of millions of refugees, have turned the city into a hodgepodge of overcrowding and chaotic building. 
 According to the Afghan government, 63,000 of the city's homes were destroyed and 60 percent of its streets were damaged during two decades of war. The infrastructure has been so neglected that the city has slipped backward in terms of amenities and services. Meanwhile, the population has boomed from less than a million during the Taliban period, which ended with their ouster in late 2001, to three or four million today -- no one knows the true number -- making it the fastest growing city in this part of Asia. 
 What can be done with a city destroyed by war? The country's urban development minister, Muhammad Yousuf Pashtun, mused over dinner recently. Bulldoze it and create a new city of modern high-rises along the lines of Beirut or Dubai, as an architect from Iraq proposed recently? Or try to resurrect the old, even though the people and their way of life have changed? It is supposed to be Mr. Pashtun's job to decide such things, and he is being pulled in every direction.
 ''The traditional Afghan style may not be enough for the 21st century, but we should definitely keep the color,'' he recently told a group of architectural students from Columbia University who presented him with their ideas for developing Kabul's airport road. ''I do not want New York, but I want the functions of New York.'' 
 In fact the minister appears to have little control over what is happening to the capital, and even less in Afghanistan's provincial cities.
 In Kabul, foreign donors are financing a dozen programs to improve the water and power supply and trash collection, but residents hardly notice an improvement.
 ''The city is really shameful,'' said Nasir Saberi, a former deputy minister in the Ministry of Urban Development, who now runs his own architectural consultancy in Kabul. 
 ''At present the city is distinguished by chaos, anarchy and corruption,'' Mr. Pashtun conceded in a recent presentation. Not only are the structures in ruins, but the social system is fragmented from the civil war and displacement, which further hampers reconstruction efforts, he said. 
 One of the most threatened areas of Kabul is the old city, a warren of small tradesman's streets and old houses, dotted with ancient shrines and mosques, nestled beneath the famous fortress of Bala Hissar. As long ago as the 1950's the old quarters had degenerated into slums. The area was further damaged by shelling during factional fighting in the 1990's, and abandoned as families fled. Some residents have returned, but many have not, unable to afford to rebuild their homes. Now commercial developers are moving in, threatening to demolish the city's historical heart. 
 Mr. Pashtun, and a few fans of the old Kabul, won a stay of execution in 2002, when President Hamid Karzai ordered a halt on all new building in the old city until a development plan can be completed. 
 The mayor's office, pressed and courted by developers, favors modernization, though. ''For three years the ministry have been working on their plan,'' said Mayor Ghulam Sakhi Noorzad. ''They will preserve a few houses, and then the rest can be modern, five or six stories, or even higher if the people can afford it.'' 
 Zahra Breshna, an Afghan returnee from Germany with an architectural degree and now a consultant at the Urban Development Ministry, is working on the development plan. Her idea is to save what remains and recreate a community that can build on and thrive from its surroundings through tourism, crafts and traditional trades. ''People want to live here and stay here,'' she said. ''If it is developed, they will lose everything.'' 
 ''It is not just an aesthetic ideal; it is preserving the way people lived, which represents their religion, climate, and history,'' she said, standing in the courtyard of Kabul's most venerated seventh-century shrine, Ashukhan-o-Arufan -- literally ''of lovers and intellectuals.'' 
 ''If we just had the ruins, no one would believe that Kabul once had such beautiful places,'' said Ms. Breshna, whose doctoral thesis was on the beauties of the old Kabul. 
 Yet Ms. Breshna and the Urban Development Ministry may be losing the race to save the old city. Landowners and developers are already dodging the rules and buying up ruined houses and converting them into commercial premises. 
 The Aga Khan Trust for Culture, run by the billionaire leader of the Ismaili Muslim sect, is financing the repair and restoration of the most valuable buildings in the old city, hoping to save what it can. 
 So many cities in the region have been inappropriately developed or poorly managed, that to lose Afghanistan's urban heritage (it was an important part of the Silk Road) would be a great historical loss for the world, said Jolyon Leslie, an architect and manager of the Aga Khan trust in Kabul.
 ''If there are islands of historic fabric saved, then the rest can redevelop in an appropriate way,'' he said. In some of the most decrepit quarters of the old city, carpenters and builders are at work under the Aga Khan project, painstakingly repairing old mosques, shrines and courtyard houses, reproducing the intricate wood carving of Mogul-style inner balconies and screens, and paving and putting in drainage in the narrow streets. 
 Nasir, 24, a builder and local resident who was mud-plastering an old courtyard house as part of the effort on a recent day, put it this way, ''It's our tradition and it's good to keep it this way.''

HEADLINE: The Chinese Challenge

BYLINE: By Paul Krugman. 
E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Fifteen years ago, when Japanese companies were busily buying up chunks of corporate America, I was one of those urging Americans not to panic. You might therefore expect me to offer similar soothing words now that the Chinese are doing the same thing. But the Chinese challenge -- highlighted by the bids for Maytag and Unocal -- looks a lot more serious than the Japanese challenge ever did.
 There's nothing shocking per se about the fact that Chinese buyers are now seeking control over some American companies. After all, there's no natural law that says Americans will always be in charge. Power usually ends up in the hands of those who hold the purse strings. America, which imports far more than it exports, has been living for years on borrowed funds, and lately China has been buying many of our I.O.U.'s. 
Until now, the Chinese have mainly invested in U.S. government bonds. But bonds yield neither a high rate of return nor control over how the money is spent. The only reason for China to acquire lots of U.S. bonds is for protection against currency speculators -- and at this point China's reserves of dollars are so large that a speculative attack on the dollar looks far more likely than a speculative attack on the yuan. 
 So it was predictable that, sooner or later, the Chinese would stop buying so many dollar bonds. Either they would stop buying American I.O.U.'s altogether, causing a plunge in the dollar, or they would stop being satisfied with the role of passive financiers, and demand the power that comes with ownership. And we should be relieved that at least for now the Chinese aren't dumping their dollars; they're using them to buy American companies.
 Yet there are two reasons that Chinese investment in America seems different from Japanese investment 15 years ago.
 One difference is that, judging from early indications, the Chinese won't squander their money as badly as the Japanese did.
 The Japanese, back in the day, tended to go for prestige investments -- Rockefeller Center, movie studios -- that transferred lots of money to the American sellers, but never generated much return for the buyers. The result was, in effect, a subsidy to the United States.
 The Chinese seem shrewder than that. Although Maytag is a piece of American business history, it isn't a prestige buy for Haier, the Chinese appliance manufacturer. Instead, it's a reasonable way to acquire a brand name and a distribution network to serve Haier's growing manufacturing capability.
 That doesn't mean that America will lose from the deal. Maytag's stockholders will gain, and the company will probably shed fewer American workers under Chinese ownership than it would have otherwise. Still, the deal won't be as one-sided as the deals with the Japanese often were.
 The more important difference from Japan's investment is that China, unlike Japan, really does seem to be emerging as America's strategic rival and a competitor for scarce resources -- which makes last week's other big Chinese offer more than just a business proposition.
 The China National Offshore Oil Corporation, a company that is 70 percent owned by the Chinese government, is seeking to acquire control of Unocal, an energy company with global reach. In particular, Unocal has a history -- oddly ignored in much reporting on the Chinese offer -- of doing business with problematic regimes in difficult places, including the Burmese junta and the Taliban. One indication of Unocal's reach: Zalmay Khalilzad, who was U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan for 18 months and was just confirmed as ambassador to Iraq, was a Unocal consultant.
 Unocal sounds, in other words, like exactly the kind of company the Chinese government might want to control if it envisions a sort of ''great game'' in which major economic powers scramble for access to far-flung oil and natural gas reserves. (Buying a company is a lot cheaper, in lives and money, than invading an oil-producing country.) So the Unocal story gains extra resonance from the latest surge in oil prices.
 If it were up to me, I'd block the Chinese bid for Unocal. But it would be a lot easier to take that position if the United States weren't so dependent on China right now, not just to buy our I.O.U.'s, but to help us deal with North Korea now that our military is bogged down in Iraq.

HEADLINE: In Effort to Pare Medicaid Rolls, Long-Term Care Is the Focus

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS

 BODY:
Congress is holding hearings. The governors have a plan. The Bush administration has named a commission. Insurance companies have weighed in, and so have lawyers and the AARP.
 The idea is to restrain the explosive growth in the taxpayers' contribution to the cost of long-term care for middle-class Americans in frail old age by making it harder to qualify for government benefits and shifting costs to individuals and private insurers.
 Lawmakers, health policy experts and stakeholders in the long-term-care industry are rushing forward with proposals to remove from the Medicaid rolls people who are not poor by standard definitions, but who rather have exhausted a lifetime of resources or used legal strategies to give their money away. 
 There is plenty of argument about which proposals are best, but the broad consensus is that none, alone or in combination, will do much to cut government spending or provide older Americans an affordable and ethical way to pay for long-term care. And the need for a solution is critical; Medicaid, a government program created for the poor, is straining to cover two-thirds of the nation's 1.6 million nursing home residents, many of them real estate rich but cash poor.
 Experts agree that many of the proposals are likely to be enacted in the coming year. ''The governors are screaming bloody murder,'' said Keith D. Lind, a senior policy adviser at the AARP Public Policy Institute. ''There is a consensus that something has to be done that will significantly change the program.''
 The most popular idea is to slow eligibility by extending the so-called lookback period, during which older people can give away or shelter assets and not be penalized when applying for Medicaid. Now, those gifts need to be made at least three years before a Medicaid application; soon, experts expect the period to be extended to five years. 
 Another proposal would require owners of family homes, many of which are now exempt from Medicaid calculation, to take out reverse mortgages to pay for nursing home care. Other proposals would encourage states to put liens on these houses when nursing home residents die to reimburse Medicaid for the cost of their care.
 Most of the proposals that encourage private insurance would offer tax credits or tax deductions to those who purchase long-term-care policies, a relatively new product that has been slow to catch on. Equally popular is expanding the use of so-called partnership policies -- now allowed in New York, California, Connecticut and Indiana -- under which individuals who purchase insurance and exhaust its benefits are eligible for Medicaid and able to protect a fixed amount of money for their heirs.
 But these are considered small fixes, not the overhaul that health policy experts say is the only way to save the system. 
 ''What we have at the moment is a flawed public policy,'' said Larry Minnix, president of the American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging, a trade group for nonprofit providers of long-term care. ''The current two alternatives -- spending it all or gaming the system -- are not psychologically healthy for what I call the middle-class poor, which is what most of us will become if we live long enough.''
 Long-term care is but a piece of the huge Medicaid pie, about a quarter of the $321 billion that will be spent by the program this year, according to the Congressional Budget Office. But it holds a disproportionate place on the national agenda because of the baby boom generation, 78 million strong. Many of the boomers are managing their parents' care, snarled in Medicaid's regulations and hoping to preserve an inheritance to pay for their own old age.
 The conundrum Dr. Minnix describes -- spending it all on long-term care or gaming the system -- is peculiar to Medicaid. Unlike Social Security or Medicare, to which all Americans contribute during their working years in exchange for a modest monthly check and medical care in retirement, Medicaid is a means-tested program.
 It is Medicaid's demand of impoverishment -- to be eligible, applicants must have just $2,000 in cash -- that has spurred the growth of a cottage industry of elder-care lawyers. They counsel older middle-class people, sometimes at the behest of their children, how to legally rid themselves of assets in the face of nursing home bills that, in major metropolitan areas like New York City, often exceed $100,000 a year. 
 Methods include outright gifts of cash or real estate, certain kinds of trusts and annuities, and an emotionally difficult process whereby one spouse disavows financial responsibility for the other. It is widely assumed that many such loopholes will soon close under pressure from the states, which shoulder almost half of Medicaid's costs, or about $138 billion this year.
 At a recent hearing in Washington, the director of the Congressional Budget Office, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, supported tightening regulations, with a caveat. ''It is unlikely,'' Mr. Holtz-Eakin testified, ''that imposing those additional restrictions would have more than a modest impact on Medicaid's expenditures'' for long-term care. 
 Mr. Holtz-Eakin estimated that the savings would be $3 billion over 10 years, or less than one one-hundredth of the government's costs.
 According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency that runs the two programs, national spending on nursing home care in 2003 was $111 billion. Medicaid paid almost half, followed by out-of-pocket payment by residents, which covered almost a third. Included in this category is Social Security, the primary source of income for seniors. Private insurance paid less than 8 percent.
 Demographic pressure on nursing home financing is enormous, with the number of people over 85, nearly half of them nursing home residents, expected to triple by 2050. And baby boomers will begin turning 65 in six years. In addition, the ability to care for the aged at home is being eroded by social change, including smaller and more scattered families.
 President Bush has shown less interest in Medicaid than in Social Security, which is being destabilized by the same forces. But the administration has created a commission to suggest ways to cut $10 billion in Medicaid's growth over the next five years. A report is due in September.
 In April, at a hearing before the House of Representatives, Mr. Holtz-Eakin argued that government aid stood in the way of people buying long-term-care insurance and that rule changes ''might encourage'' the purchase of those policies. But he said there were other reasons not to buy them, including inadequate inflation protection, generally 5 percent in the best policies, which has not kept pace with nursing home costs. And few people ages 65 to 85 can afford such insurance or meet the underwriting requirements.
 One criticism of Medicaid's regulations is that people are allowed to retain ownership of their homes, using various legal strategies, thus sheltering their biggest asset. According to the National Council on Aging, three-quarters of older Americans own homes free of mortgages, worth an average of nearly $80,000. The council estimates that older Americans have a total of $1.9 trillion in home equity.
 Stephen A. Moses, the president of the Center for Long-Term Care Financing and a longtime critic of what he called ''welfare-financed nursing homes,'' proposes requiring all homeowners to take out a reverse mortgage and spend that money before applying for Medicaid. This approach would end what he calls ''inheritance protection for middle-class boomers.''
 The National Governors Association, in a report issued in June, said it favored reverse mortgages, but not if they left the children of today's nursing home residents with no legacy while America's wealthiest citizens could protect inheritances through estate planning. The governors suggested that anyone using a reverse mortgage be permitted to hold onto $50,000 or ''some other appropriate amount that would be indexed to inflation.''
 A more aggressive approach is putting liens on houses, some bought in the 1950s for $20,000 that now would fetch a million dollars. Elder-care lawyers say that in areas of steep real estate appreciation, like California and the suburban counties that ring New York City, such recovery efforts are more frequent. 
 The dated notion of ''Medicaid millionaires'' giving away their money and draining the system was debunked last month in a report by the Health Policy Institute at Georgetown University. After an analysis of several federal studies, the report, written by Ellen O'Brien, found that people qualifying for Medicaid gave gifts of less than $5,000 on average, with a minimal impact on the program.
 On the other hand, Dr. O'Brien said in an interview this week, there is compelling data on the typical trajectory to poverty from ages 65 to 85. In those two decades, Dr. O'Brien and others say, a healthy, middle-class woman spends considerable money on her husband's long-term care, is widowed and left to manage on the meager benefits of a surviving spouse, spends almost a third of her income on medical expenses not covered by Medicare, assumes she will never wind up in a nursing home and then does. 
 ''That's the heart of the Medicaid story,'' Dr. O'Brien said. ''It's the 'poor widow' scenario, and it's just horrible.''

Bombs Kill 38 in Iraq; Rumsfeld Issues Warning
Four suicide bomb attacks struck Iraqi police and an army base in a 16-hour wave of insurgent violence in the northern city of Mosul, killing 38 people and wounding scores more. The attacks came as Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld echoed remarks by his advisers suggesting that the insurgency could last as long as a dozen years and that Iraq would become more violent before elections. A1

As Iraqis struggle to make sense of the chaos and violence that has consumed their lives during the past two years, books offer solace but also reveal a dividing line between those who grew up before the years of dictatorship, and younger Iraqis straining to find answers to more immediate questions about their lives.

Cost of China's Energy Quest
China is seeking to loosen the grip of the United States on world energy resources and secure the fuel it needs to keep its economy in overdrive. Its energy deal-making, including the China National Offshore Corporation'sbid for the American oil company Unocal, has cost tens of billions of dollars and has dominated China's foreign policymaking for the past two years.

The reaction in Japan to the swelling economic muscle of China provides an early warning sign of the mixed emotions that China evokes as it rises on the global stage. C1

Trial of Accused 13 Unlikely
The chances are remote that the 13 people linked to the C.I.A. who were ordered arrested by an Italian judge last week will ever stand trial, experts in international law said. The 13 people, charged with illegally seizing an Egyptian cleric on a Milan street two years ago and flying him to Egypt for questioning, are presumed to have left Italy. A8

In Battle for Next Justice, Right Says, No Kennedys
With talk of a possible court resignation to follow his current term, Justice Kennedy is looming in many conservatives' minds as just the kind of mistake they hope President Bush avoids. The justice emerged as a consensus third choice, after President Ronald Reagan's first two selections failed. Demanding more ideological clarity in what could be the first Republican selection in 14 years, the right is now mobilized with a cry: ''No more Tony Kennedys.'' A1

Republican Criticism of Bush
President Bush and his hard-charging political team, which seemed to make all the right moves in winning re-election last year, have stumbled when it comes to governing in a second term, many Republicans say, leaving the White House scrambling to get back on track. In discussing the White House's problems, Republicans cited a variety of assumptions and decisions that have not worked out as Mr. Bush and his team planned. A11

Speaking for Terror Suspects
Two leading civil rights groups charge in a new study that the Bush administration has twisted the American system of due process ''beyond recognition'' in jailing at least 70 terror suspects as ''material witnesses'' since the Sept. 11 attacks, and the groups are calling on Congress to impose tougher safeguards. A10

Considering a Medicaid Shift
Lawmakers, health policy experts, advocates for the elderly and stakeholders in the long-term care industry are rushing forward with proposals to remove from the Medicaid rolls people who are not poor by standard definitions, but who rather have exhausted a lifetime of resources or used legal strategies to give their money away. A1

Shock Over Deep Throat
L. Patrick Gray III, the acting director of the F.B.I. at the time of the Watergate break-in, ended more than three decades of silence about his role in the scandal, saying in a television interview that he felt shock and betrayal over the disclosure that his former deputy, W. Mark Felt, was Deep Throat. A11

Women's Casualties in Combat
After the attack on a military convoy in Falluja that killed at least 4 American women and injured 11, families at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina are talking about what the role of women in combat should be. Below a studied calm, wide fissures of opinion are evident. A10

Plutonium Production
The Bush administration is planning the government's first production since the cold war of plutonium 238, a highly radioactive substance valued as a power source, stirring debate over its risks and benefits. The material is hot enough to melt plastic and so dangerous that a speck can cause cancer. A1

HEADLINE: The Great Equalizer: Death or the Estate Tax

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''Repeal Lite'' (editorial, June 21): I agree that the estate tax should not be repealed. It is our country's most progressive tax. As such, one's feelings about it expose how one thinks the burden of taxation should be distributed.
 On one side are those who believe it is important to let the superwealthy pass along their fortunes to their children without contributing anything extra to our shared government -- a government that helped and supported the very wealth creation they benefited from.
 On the other side are those who believe it important for people who have gained more from our society to contribute more. They understand that multimillionaires are far more fortunate than minimum-wage workers, and that over time, such extreme differences in wealth and income can be addressed only by providing more and better opportunities for economic advancement.
 The wealthy should always pay higher taxes than those struggling in the middle and at the bottom. The estate tax merely maintains that tradition.

HEADLINE: Some in G.O.P. Call on Bush to Focus on Governing

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 26 

 BODY:
President Bush and his hard-charging political team, which seemed to make all the right moves in winning re-election last year, have stumbled when it comes to governing in a second term, many Republicans say, leaving the White House scrambling to get back on track.
 Even as they expressed continued support for Mr. Bush and his goals, influential Republicans said Karl Rove and the White House political operation have been slow to shift from campaign mode, with its base-energizing positions, to an approach that allows for more compromise and increases the probability of Mr. Bush signing legislation that directly addresses the everyday concerns of voters. 
 ''The tone has been too much of a permanent campaign,'' said Newt Gingrich, the former Republican House speaker. ''When you're the minority, you need to fight. When you're the governing majority, you need to produce.'' 
 In discussing the White House's problems, Republicans cited a variety of assumptions and decisions that have not worked out as Mr. Bush and his team had planned. They said the administration may have overestimated how much of a mandate Mr. Bush had coming out of last year's campaign, underestimated the willingness of the Democrats to stand up to him and relied too much on a belief that he could force Congress into action by taking his case directly to the people.
 They said a degree of difficulty was to be expected, given the scope of Mr. Bush's second-term ambitions. At the same time, they said, Mr. Bush and his team are struggling with a problem they never had during the campaign: with no high-profile political opponent as a foil, and with Democrats refusing to put forward competing proposals on issues like Social Security, the president and his policies stand on their own, with nothing to deflect partisan fire.
 Should Mr. Bush have a Supreme Court vacancy to fill -- a possibility that could present itself as early as Monday -- it could further inflame partisan passions and complicate the prospects for the rest of his agenda, including his push for major new energy and trade legislation this summer, members of each party said.
 ''They thought because they had slain the Kerry dragon they could claim a mandate and do what they wanted to,'' said one prominent Republican in Washington, who insisted on anonymity to speak candidly about what some see as the administration's miscalculations. ''Now they have to sell things, whether it's Iraq or stem cells or John Bolton -- let alone Social Security -- on their own merits.''
 The White House dismissed suggestions that Mr. Bush and his team had lost their touch and were struggling. Nicolle Devenish, the White House communications director, said Mr. Bush and his aides had done ''an amazing amount of outreach'' to Capitol Hill; were sharpening his message on Iraq and the economy; and were making steady progress on Social Security, energy and trade legislation, and other issues.
 ''We're on the verge of getting a lot of stuff done,'' Ms. Devenish said.
 The tensions inherent in the transition from a first-term presidency, with its inevitable focus on re-election, to a second-term administration, which naturally casts more of an eye to history, are embodied by Mr. Rove. He has taken on the role of deputy chief of staff for policy, a perch from which he has broad, substantive influence over almost every domestic issue. 
 Yet he continues to play his traditional role of tending to Mr. Bush's conservative base, exposing him to Democratic criticism that he too easily subordinates good policy to politics. Last week, he infuriated liberals by suggesting they had been insufficiently aggressive in their response to the Sept. 11 attacks, causing a flare-up in partisan tensions just as Mr. Bush is entering a period in which he needs some Democratic support to get his initiatives through Congress.
 Already, the centerpiece of Mr. Bush's domestic agenda, overhauling Social Security, has become a long shot at best, despite an all-out effort by the White House that has so far failed to sway public opinion in the president's direction. 
 Mr. Bush's nomination of John R. Bolton as ambassador to the United Nations has been stymied by Democrats in the Senate. The Iraq war -- an issue that the White House used skillfully to build its case last year that Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, could not be trusted with the presidency -- is now weighing down Mr. Bush's own poll numbers. 
 Especially if there is no Supreme Court fight, a number of prominent Republicans said, the Bush team, including Mr. Rove and Vice President Dick Cheney, should now do more to steer Washington's focus from the types of ideological battles that dominated the last six months, like those over the fate of Terri Schiavo in Florida and efforts by Democrats to block some judicial nominees. The White House, they said, would benefit from -- and is showing signs of -- moving the debate toward issues that touch more voters more directly, like gasoline prices, jobs, taxes and health care.
 ''We need to move away from nomination battles and process fights and into the more overarching and thematic fights that the administration should want to concentrate on,'' said Tom Rath, a veteran Republican activist in New Hampshire. ''We want lower taxes, a government that's not wasteful, and a government that allows individual entrepreneurs to thrive and pass that success down to their families. Let's force a debate not on whether we can end the filibuster, but on whether we can be responsive to the needs of the people who voted for this president.''
 Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma, said the White House was ''getting recalibrated and refocused'' by seeking to shore up support for the war in Iraq -- Mr. Bush will make a prime-time address on the topic on Tuesday -- and concentrating its legislative efforts this summer on passing an energy bill and a bill providing money for highway building and other popular transportation projects.
 ''The real question is how we do in the second half of the year,'' Mr. Cole said. ''The energy bill and the highway bill offer a chance to reconnect with the broad public. It's a chance to deal with high gasoline prices at the pump. It's a chance to talk about jobs and traffic congestion.'' 
 Mr. Bush still so dominates politics in Washington that there is little open criticism of him, and few Republicans are willing to challenge the strategy of Mr. Rove and other top aides. But behind the scenes there is increasing grumbling about the White House's political style.
 ''There's a view among House members and the leadership staff that the White House feels it has to deal with us to move legislation, but that otherwise we don't exist to them,'' said a senior House Republican leadership aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity to speak candidly.
 On Social Security, the aide said, the White House relied on a strategy of going over the heads of members of Congress to build public pressure on both parties to act, rather than on working closely with Republican lawmakers from the start. That approach, the aide said, proved to be ''a gross miscalculation'' that has led to concern among Republicans on Capitol Hill about the implications for the 2006 elections.
 The aide said that Mr. Bush had pleased many Republicans in Congress by becoming more aggressive in the last few weeks in attacking Democrats as obstructionists, but that there was little evidence of any substantive change in the way the administration was seeking to advance its agenda.
 ''We realize we have to carry ourselves,'' the aide said, ''because the president grows less and less important every day and the Congress grows more and more important.''

HEADLINE: Low Rates Could Be Around for Long Term

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 26 

 BODY:
Federal Reserve officials, who meet this week, are beginning to suspect that the perplexing decline in long-term interest rates is more than a temporary aberration.
 The possibility has major implications for the economy, and it creates new puzzles for Fed officials on how they should respond.
 On Thursday, the Fed is all but certain to raise the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks by another quarter point, to 3.25 percent. That would be the ninth increase in the last year, and the central bank is expected to signal that it will continue to raise overnight rates at a ''measured'' pace. 
 But the real debate at the meeting is expected to be about the unexpected decline of long-term interest rates, which have kept mortgage rates at their lowest level in decades and fueled what many analysts fear is a bubble in housing prices.
 Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said in February that the low long-term rates were a ''conundrum'' but might simply be a ''short-term aberration.''
 But Mr. Greenspan and other senior officials are now suggesting that the change is more enduring. The debate is over why the change has occurred, and different theories lead to sharply disparate conclusions about the best way to respond.
 ''My sense is that people think this could be the new reality, that this could be fundamental, that it could be long-lasting,'' said Laurence H. Meyer, a former Fed governor and now vice chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers, a forecasting firm.
 Mr. Greenspan, testifying before Congress earlier this month, described the trend as profoundly important and ''clearly international in origin.'' 
 ''How we integrate it into the basic underlying monetary policy structure is something we're spending a considerable amount of time on,'' he added.
 The term premium -- the added payment that investors demand to cover the uncertainty of holding long-term bonds -- has shrunk to almost nothing. Investors appear to assume that the overnight rate will be about 3.75 percent by the end of this year. But the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds remains about 4 percent.
 One school of thought holds that low bond yields are a harbinger of slowing economic growth, which would reduce demand for credit in the future. Another school holds that global investors have lower inflation expectations than in the past, which reduces the risk of holding long-term bonds. If either theory is correct, the Federal Reserve would have less need to fend off inflation and could stop raising short-term rates at a much lower level than in the past -- perhaps below 4 percent.
 But yet another theory holds that long-term interest rates may have been depressed by other factors, including a ''savings glut'' around the world and efforts by Asian central banks to keep the value of their currencies down by buying United States Treasury securities.
 If that is true, the flood of foreign money into the country could be diluting the Fed's effort to prevent inflation. That would imply that the Fed needs to raise rates more than many investors are expecting. 
 Mr. Greenspan, testifying before Congress on June 20, was skeptical about theories based on low inflation expectations or on an impending slowdown. ''A narrow gap between short- and long-term rates is often misread as though we're about to tilt into a recession,'' he said. ''If that is the case, then the hypothesis that it is a weak economy which has been driving down interest rates is probably not correct.''
 He also expressed concern that low long-term rates had contributed to ''froth'' and might be feeding inflationary pressures. ''And that's something which, needless to say, we are focusing on very extensively.'' 
 Other officials have been more optimistic. William Poole, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, has argued several times that long-term rates are mostly driven by investors' expectations of long-term inflation. Even though the Fed has raised short-term rates, Mr. Poole said in a speech on June 14, investors have had no reason over the last year to expect higher long-term inflation. ''Economic surprises have been minimal over the past year, and there has been no reason for significant revision in expected future short-term interest rates,'' Mr. Poole said. 
 Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, suggested on June 20 that there may be less uncertainty about inflation than in the past.
 ''It's important to keep in mind that the term premium shouldn't be expected to behave in the way it's behaved in postwar cycles in which inflation was unsteady,'' Mr. Lacker said. ''The most likely explanation for the low rates,'' he said, is that ''inflation is low and that inflation expectations are low.''
 Wall Street economists are as divided as Fed officials about the proper interpretation.
 James Glassman, a senior economist at J.P. Morgan, contends that long-term interest rates reflect the deflationary effects of globalization. ''If you think of this in economic terms, East Asia and Nafta have been annexed to the United States. It looks like an economy that has far more excess capacity. Overnight, decisions by the Chinese government are releasing huge numbers of Chinese laborers. That means more excess capacity and a longer time to get back to full employment.''
 By that interpretation, the Fed could stop raising short-term rates once they reach 3.75 percent. But others predict that the Fed will continue to worry about inflationary pressures, the United States' soaring level of foreign indebtedness and the dangers of a housing bubble.
 Mr. Greenspan, asked by lawmakers to specify a ''neutral'' Fed funds rate -- one that would try to neither speed nor slow the economy -- has periodically remarked that people would know it when they saw it. But in his most recent testimony, he added a twist: people would know it because ''we will observe a certain degree of balance which we have not seen before'' in the economy.

HEADLINE: Iran's New Leader Takes Tough Line, and Then Softens It

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SLACKMAN

DATELINE: TEHRAN, June 26 

 BODY:
Iran's conservative president-elect, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, said Sunday that he planned to move forward with his nation's nuclear energy program, insisting that it was necessary for the development of the country. But he also agreed to continue discussions with three European nations, which, along with the United States, fear that the Islamic Republic is intent on building nuclear weapons.
 In his first news conference since his surprise election victory on Friday, Mr. Ahmadinejad outlined the kind of positions that made him the preferred candidate of Iran's leaders, dismissing the need for any relationship with the United States, telling the Europeans they needed ''to come down from their ivory towers,'' and calling for the country to move forward with its nuclear program. Yet he also tempered his answers with conciliatory phrases as if to present a reassuring face to the world and the nation. 
 Behind a sea of microphones, Mr. Ahmadinejad took a grilling on questions varying from his views on the dress code to plans for his cabinet. With a casual smile, he kept to his message, answering with a candidate's vagueness, often returning to themes of moderation, progress and development.
 His pattern through much of the chaotic hourlong session, held in the city council chambers at the Tehran municipal building, was to first take a tough line, then quickly follow up with a modest offer of compromise. 
 On the nuclear issue, for example, he said Iran needed the technology and ''we will pursue it.'' But he immediately agreed to continue with negotiations, adding: ''If they have a reasonable approach, the Europeans are obligated to fulfill their promises. In that case we will reach a conclusion soon.'' He did not explain what he meant. 
 Mr. Ahmadinejad's seeming willingness to continue the negotiations suggests he is hewing more closely to the stance of the departing president, Mohammad Khatami, than to that of conservative members of Parliament who want to skip the talks altogether and start operations at a reactor that the United States and Europe fear could be used as part of a weapons program. Iran says the reactor, being built with Russian help, will be used for peaceful purposes. 
 While his attitude toward foreigners was sometimes harsh, he offered words of reconciliation to his political opponents in Iran and to those who voted against him.
 Mr. Ahmadinejad's initial support during his campaign came from some of the most reactionary forces in the society -- including the conservative clerics and military leaders -- but he ultimately beat out Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, a former two-term president, on a combination of a populist economic message, everyman appeal and the perception that he was the only candidate independent of a system many Iranians had come to distrust. 
 At his news conference on Sunday, he suggested he would consider welcoming members of the now vanquished reformist movement into his government. 
 ''Iranian people are like a big family,'' he said, when asked if he would reach out to the reformers. ''I will welcome all the hands that reach out to serve Iranian people. There will be no divisions in our government.''
 Reformists, however, appeared nowhere near ready to reach out to Mr. Ahmadinejad. Stung by their electoral defeat, reform leaders were struggling to unite and to find a way back from a political abyss. Some spoke Sunday of building new political parties and creating new Web sites to reach out to potential supporters, but they were far from understanding why they had failed to retain their last foothold on power. 
 The presidency, with the ministries it controls, effectively manages Iran, but has little power to carry out policies if they are not supported by the ruling clerics. Because conservative leaders like the supreme religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, already have final say over the nation's policies, it is not clear how much of a difference Mr. Ahmadinejad's presidency will make when he takes office on Aug. 3. Political analysts said that difference might be more a matter of style than of substance. 
 Mr. Ahmadinejad, 49, is a religious conservative whose manner harks back to the early days of the revolution, when rigid codes of conduct and dress for women were strictly enforced. 
 In keeping with that, he started his day on Sunday paying homage to the father of the Islamic Revolution in 1979, with a visit to the shrine for Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
 At his 5 p.m. news conference he had a man sing verses from the Koran. His supporters greeted him there with a religious chant and then he recited passages from the Koran. The news conference was also the first high-level event in many years not to be translated into English.
 Mr. Ahmadinejad was quick to dismiss the need for repairing relations with the United States. ''Our nation is continuing on the path of progress,'' he said, ''and on this path it has no significant need for the United States.'' But, in his conciliatory follow-up, he added: ''We would like to have relations with any country that doesn't have hostile relations toward us. I think those in the United States who want to have relations with Iran should state their policies transparently so that we can examine the possibility of having relations.'' 
 He also offered a word of reassurance to those who fear he might impose a Taliban-style government on Iran, as his critics had charged during the campaign.
 ''In domestic policy, moderation will be the policy of the government,'' he said. ''We will confront any kind of extremism.''
 Mr. Ahmadinejad, whose pledge to tackle graft helped him in the election, was also asked if he would follow through on his promise to prosecute those in the oil industry guilty of corruption. Yes, he said, he would pursue them, stopping short of explaining how he might do so. 
 As for stricter dress codes for women -- who in recent years have been allowed to wear brightly colored head scarves and modest overcoats, instead of more restrictive Islamic cover-ups -- Mr. Ahmadinejad sidestepped, saying only that it was ''the duty of the current government.'' 
 ''I have stated my opinions in the past,'' he said. Among those opinions was that Iran has more serious problems to worry about than what people wear. 
 His most direct remarks were in his praise of the Islamic Republic's blended government, where elected bodies, like the presidency, must adhere to the decisions of the religious rulers. ''Religious democracy is the only path toward human prosperity,'' he said, ''and it's the most advanced type of government that humans can ever have.''

HEADLINE: At McGraw-Hill, an Heir Takes Over and the Company Flourishes

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
When Harold Whittlesey McGraw III joined McGraw-Hill in 1980, there were plenty of skeptics -- despite the fact that his name was on the building. 
 Even after a decade at McGraw-Hill, the company his great-grandfather founded and started to build into an empire, many thought Mr. McGraw, who is known as Terry, was yet another heir who had lucked into a job he could not handle. Some went so far as to call him ''our Dan Quayle.''
Not exactly. 
 In the 12 years since Mr. McGraw took over as president and chief executive officer of the McGraw-Hill Companies, the parent of Standard & Poor's, BusinessWeek magazine, trade publications and a leading educational publishing business, the company's stock has risen from $8.20 a share on Aug. 2, 1993, to $44 a share at Friday's close -- a 437 percent increase. 
 That return beats both the Dow Jones and S.&P. indexes, other educational publishers like Pearson and Reed Elsevier, as well as most newspaper publishers and an array of broader media conglomerates, including Time Warner, the Walt Disney Company, Viacom and the News Corporation. In that broad group, there are a number of chief executives who have generated a lot more headlines than Mr. McGraw has. Only Moody's, a competitor of Standard & Poor's in the debt-rating market, has outperformed McGraw-Hill, with shares rising 266 percent since it went public in June 1998. In that period, McGraw-Hill shares have jumped 114 percent. 
 So how much of McGraw-Hill's good fortune is due to its prime assets and how much to Mr. McGraw's leadership?
 McGraw-Hill, which posted 2004 net profit of $755.8 million on revenue of $5.3 billion, has scored big on its ownership of S.&P., the debt-rating company that has cashed in on the explosion in corporate debt offerings and the structured-finance markets. Today S.&P. accounts for 65 percent of the company's operating profits, compared with 45 percent a decade ago. 
 But even former skeptics give Mr. McGraw, who has been the company's chief executive since 1998 and its chairman since 1999, credit for streamlining McGraw-Hill from an agglomeration of 15 business units into three core businesses that have capitalized on major trends in the United States and abroad. S.&P. has benefited from the growth of capital markets here and abroad, and the educational publishing unit has profited from state governments' focus on education and the ''No Child Left Behind'' education law of 2001; McGraw-Hill did some lobbying for that law. 
 The information unit, led by BusinessWeek magazine, has sold off many of its unprofitable trade publications, like Chemical Engineering, and tried to focus on a narrower group of faster-growing trade areas like construction and energy. Recently, however, that sector has stumbled because of an advertising drought. 
 ''What Terry has done very smartly is manage McGraw-Hill's portfolio, moving the company away from slower-growing low-return businesses toward faster-growing higher-return businesses, in an evolution of the asset mix,'' said Peter Appert, a media analyst at Goldman Sachs. 
 As Mr. McGraw sees it, his company's mission is to generate ''consistent, sustainable earnings growth.'' In an interview in his office on the 49th floor of the company's Manhattan headquarters, he said, ''One way to get there was to take the volatility out of the earnings cycle.''
 Mr. McGraw, 56, started his career in pension fund management at GTE, the former telecommunications company. He can sometimes ramble on in conversations that range across myriad topics, creating the impression that he is a bit unfocused. But those who have long worked with him say he pays close attention to the details of the underlying businesses. 
 Changes at McGraw-Hill have come in incremental steps rather than the headline-grabbing acquisitions and Internet investments. Over the last 10 years, McGraw-Hill has not spent more than $1 billion on a purchase. Mr. McGraw ''was extremely disciplined in the way he built the company,'' said Stephen B. Shepard, former editor of BusinessWeek and now dean of the graduate school of journalism at the City University of New York. ''He deserves great credit for not going off the deep end in the boom years when so many other media companies did stupid things.'' 
 Nor was McGraw-Hill tripped up in the race to the Internet, which was so disastrous for some companies.
 ''He did not get sucked into the malarkey we tried to push him to,'' said Lauren Rich Fine, who follows McGraw-Hill for Merrill Lynch. ''He has been the least intimidated by the Internet and the most willing to embrace it as an improved customer delivery channel. For instance, they were among the first to digitize their educational textbooks so that when McGraw-Hill was ready to deliver them online, it could.''
 On a paper napkin, Mr. McGraw drew a small chart that explained his view of the Time Warner-AOL deal. ''See, Time Warner had assets and cash flow,'' Mr. McGraw said, creating one side of a ledger. On the other side: ''AOL had zero assets and zero cash flow. In the deal, Time Warner got sizzle. The AOL guys cashed out. They've gone off to the beach.''
 Many who cashed out or watched their company's stock wither were regulars at the fancy conferences where moguls congregate. But Mr. McGraw, whose family owns about 18 percent of the $18 billion company that he runs, was notably absent from those conferences, either because he was too busy or because he felt uncomfortable as a schmoozer.
 ''I never went to Davos. I never went to Herb Allen's media conferences,'' he said, referring, respectively, to the Swiss resort where the World Economic Forum is held and to the annual executive get-together in Sun Valley, Idaho, sponsored by Allen & Co. ''I am not interested in going to things to be seen and to be noisy. It doesn't solve problems. It is about egos.'' 
 After growing up in Darien, Conn., Mr. McGraw attended Tufts University and the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. In his job at GTE, which was subsequently bought by Bell Atlantic to form Verizon Communications, he was involved in shifting the investment strategy of the pension plan from banks to outside managers -- a system he brought to McGraw-Hill.
 ''I never planned to go into the family business,'' Mr. McGraw said. But in 1979, when his father, Harold McGraw, then McGraw-Hill's chief executive, fought a hostile takeover bid by American Express, the elder Mr. McGraw brought his son in to work alongside him. 
 After a stint at the publishing unit, Mr. McGraw became president of Standard & Poor's. The unit reduced its reliance on the debt issuance business, expanded its ratings service to cover untraditional categories, like bank loans, and changed its fee structure to a subscription model. 
 But other parts of McGraw-Hill have had setbacks. The company's third leg -- information and media services -- has suffered from a slowdown in advertiser spending at the broadcast unit and BusinessWeek. Today, the information and media services division represents just 9 percent of operating profit, down from 25 percent a decade ago. 
 When McGraw-Hill announced in March that it had signed a deal to buy J.D. Power & Associates, a market research firm known for its customer satisfaction surveys, and that the acquisition would dilute earnings, the company's stock fell 6.8 percent in a day. 
 Mr. McGraw says he believes that the company can use the J.D. Power name to collect a fee by distributing data from McGraw-Hill's trade publications in construction and aviation to consumers. For example, information that the company provides for professionals on the range of windows and plumbing fixturescould be provided to consumer audiences, and possibly rated as well.
 Nevertheless, investors were worried by the acquisition because some felt that McGraw-Hill was throwing good money after bad. 
 ''Everybody just wished that division would go away,'' Ms. Fine said. Critics also say Mr. McGraw has been indecisive about selling -- or building up -- McGraw-Hill's broadcasting unit, which owns four television stations. 
 ''They do $120 million in revenues and 40 percent in cash flow,'' he said. ''Everybody should be so lucky to have such a big bag of cash. Why sell them for the sake of some strategic clarity of some analyst?'' 
 McGraw-Hill has cut costs at BusinessWeek and is trying to improve BusinessWeek Online to capitalize on the growth in Internet advertising. One clue about the company's eagerness to succeed is the recent hiring of Stephen J. Adler, who helped oversee The Wall Street Journal Online, to be BusinessWeek's new editor in chief, succeeding Mr. Shepard. 
 McGraw-Hill is investigating a number of growth initiatives tied to BusinessWeek, both online and in print. One idea is a magazine aimed at baby boomers, according to several people close to the discussions. And there are potential threats to other areas of McGraw-Hill's business. Even McGraw-Hill's vaunted ratings business could be vulnerable: If interest rates rise, the debt issuance business could suffer. In the longer term, the educational publishing business could suffer if state governments fail to pass school budgets, deferring book purchases. 
 Is there another McGraw waiting in the wings to grapple with such problems? 
 Mr. McGraw's brother, Robert, is on the board. A cousin, Jay McGraw, is working in the company's construction information business. Mr. McGraw's son, Whit, has just completed six years at Morgan Stanley and is going to the Darden Graduate School of Business Administration at the University of Virginia; his daughter, Megan, just graduated from the College of Charleston, in South Carolina. 
 Would Mr. McGraw like to see them in the business one day? ''I'd be thrilled if they would come here,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Behind China's Bid for Unocal: A Costly Quest for Energy Control

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN

DATELINE: BEIJING, June 24 

 BODY:
From the dusty plains of East Africa to the shores of the Caspian Sea, China is seeking to loosen the grip of the United States on world energy resources and secure the fuel it needs to keep its economy in overdrive.
 Its energy deal-making has cost tens of billions of dollars and has dominated China's foreign policymaking for the past two years. At times it has put China in direct competition with American policy goals, especially in Iran and Sudan, whose leaderships are among the least favored by the United States government.
 Now Washington has the chance to shape China's frenetic quest. The China National Offshore Oil Corporation, known as CNOOC, has offered $18.5 billion for the American oil company Unocal. If its bid is successful, Beijing will have a greater stake in the global oil markets, in the same way that Japanese and European oil companies work closely with major American companies around the world. 
 If the bid were rejected by the United States on national security grounds, as some members of Congress have publicly advocated, China could be motivated to build more ties to rogue states and step up its courtship of major oil producers in Africa and Latin America that in the past have looked mainly to the United States market.
 ''Like other big countries, China naturally wants to share proven oil reserves,'' said He Jun, an energy consultant in Beijing who advises Chinese oil companies. ''But if the West treats China as a threat, it will inevitably have to find its own path to meet its energy needs.''
 The energy issue touches all of the hot buttons in China's realm, from its need to modernize its economy to its tensions with Japan, Taiwan and the West. 
 Already, Beijing is leaving few holes untapped. Since becoming China's top leader in late 2002, President Hu Jintao has traveled to Latin America, Southeast Asia and Africa on missions focused largely on securing energy supplies that will not pass through American or European companies before reaching China. 
 Later this month, he will make his third trip to Russia as president to continue a lobbying campaign for a pipeline to ferry Siberian crude to Daqing, China's northeastern oil hub. China hopes the pipeline will reduce its reliance on American-dominated markets for Middle East oil.
 As was the case with Japan in the 1930's, China's relations with the outside world are being transformed by energy needs, generating fears that it will compete with the United States for resources. Chinese analysts say the United States should approve the Unocal deal and work with China to make energy a common cause, before it becomes a source of tension.
 ''Relations between China and the United States are mostly stable, but the energy problem is the most serious threat,'' said Chen Fengying, a senior strategist at the government-backed China Contemporary International Relations Institute in Beijing.
 ''We talk about terrorism and Taiwan,'' Ms. Chen said, ''but there is nowhere near enough attention to energy.''
 Just a decade ago China exported more oil than it imported, but last year it passed Japan to become the world's second-largest importer, after the United States. Its booming but grossly inefficient economy consumes three times as much energy per dollar of output than the world average, and oil use has surged along with the country's auto industry, sprawling cities and new network of superhighways built on the American model.
 Unlike Japan and European nations, which are also big oil importers, China does not have a strategic alliance with the United States. Beijing has grown increasingly wary of depending heavily on imports when its companies do not control major reserves abroad and its navy does not patrol the sea lanes through which those supplies must pass to reach Chinese ports.
 Some foreign economists have criticized China for paying a hefty premium to control energy reserves abroad when it could pay market prices and have oil delivered to its door. But China's leaders are wary of entrusting their economic growth, and perhaps the longevity of the Communist Party, to American oil companies and the Pentagon.
 ''A popular saying abroad is that oil is just a commodity that anyone who has money can buy,'' Mr. He said. ''But this saying is most popular in the countries that already control the supplies.''
 Shortages of imported oil could threaten China in the event of a conflict with Taiwan. The United States, which has said it would defend Taiwan if the Chinese were to attack it, could potentially block shipping in the East China Sea, crippling Chinese trade.
 Partly for that reason, China has scrambled to diversify its oil and gas imports and transport routes, pursuing oil deals with Russia and Central Asian nations and signing a preliminary, $70 billion commitment to buy Iranian oil and natural gas. All of these supplies could be delivered overland if expensive pipelines that Beijing favors are built.
 More generally, China has sent CNOOC and its two bigger state-controlled oil companies, Sinopec and PetroChina, on a worldwide shopping spree to secure rights to proven reserves.
 This effort has already created diplomatic complications for Washington. For example, China opposed moves to punish its oil partner Sudan for atrocities in Darfur and blocked efforts to bring the issue of Iran's nuclear weapons program before the United Nations Security Council.
 Determined to improve ties with Russia, China recently settled a long-festering border dispute on terms widely seen as favorable to Moscow. Russia, in turn, has promised to greatly increase oil shipments to China by rail and has revived discussion of a pipeline to Daqing after earlier arguing that the project made little economic sense.
 Oil is one factor that has plagued relations between China and Japan, which have jostled for control of natural gas deposits in disputed waters of the East China Sea. Talks about the issue have stalled, and a Chinese submarine incursion in that area contributed to a downward spiral in diplomatic ties this spring.
 In public, Chinese officials portray their country as a relatively minor player in global energy markets that seeks cooperative ventures with any country or major company on commercial terms.
 But privately, Chinese officials and analysts say oil is treated as a strategic crisis. They have sounded the alarm about Western and particularly American domination of oil supplies and influence over the major oil-exporting nations, including Saudi Arabia and now Iraq, which has made China dependent on what many here refer to as American economic and military hegemony.
 Beijing this year began construction of a American-style strategic oil reserve on the coast of Zhejiang province. The first phase includes 52 tanks that can each hold 25 million gallons of gasoline. Ultimately, officials aim to create a reserve large enough to allow China's economy and military to function for at least three months without imported oil.
 It has also imposed tough new fuel-economy standards on cars, put some industries on notice that they will have to become less wasteful users of energy, and backed an aggressive search for new coal, oil and gas supplies on Chinese territory to slow the growth in imports.
 Ma Kai, China's top economic and energy planner, told officials in a closed conference recently that the United States was better positioned to withstand the current rise in oil prices because its major oil companies make enormous profits to offset the losses to the American economy. Importing countries with a smaller stake in global energy trading, like China, have nothing to soften the blow of the huge losses they suffer when prices rise, Mr. Ma said, according to a Chinese energy expert who attended the session and asked to remain anonymous.
 This expert said Chinese leaders were well aware that they are paying inflated prices for foreign assets. Proposed pipelines connecting China to Iran, Kazakhstan and Russia and a Chinese-backed pipeline project in Brazil will cost the country dearly, pushing the price of oil from those sources to double or triple spot-market prices.
 CNOOC's bid for Unocal, which would be financed primarily by loans from state-run banks and the company's state-owned parent, offers a substantial premium for the company's assets. But the extra cost is worth it for the sake of political security, many Chinese argue.
 In that sense, the CNOOC offer might be seen in a different light than some other high-profile overseas acquisitions by leading Chinese companies. TCL's purchase of Thompson's television unit, Lenovo's takeover of I.B.M.'s laptop computer line and Haier's proposed purchase of Maytag are all driven primarily by commercial concerns.
 Whether Chinese companies paid a good price for those assets has been debated, but the motivations for purchasing consumer product lines stem mainly from a desire for global brand names and marketing skills, rather than politics, local analysts said. That may be less true of CNOOC's bid.
 ''The CNOOC arrangement has both commercial and political factors involved,'' said Mr. He, the energy consultant. ''Some of the commercial terms, frankly speaking, are questionable. But the political factors are very clear and straightforward.''
 Wenran Jiang, an expert in Chinese foreign policy at the University of Alberta, said many in the West viewed the Unocal offer as part of China's coordinated assault on foreign markets, a sign of economic vigor. In China, he said, the energy quest is seen as a belated, disorganized, even desperate rush to meet basic security needs.
 ''They feel threatened, with their back in a corner, forced to pay high prices to Western companies,'' Mr. Jiang said. ''For them, this is a matter of the survival of the regime.''

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Monday about the energy issues that have dominated China's foreign policy misstated the country's ranking among oil users. It is the second-largest consumer, after the United States, not the second-largest importer.

HEADLINE: To Catch A Thief

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF. 
E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com

 BODY:
If you think you face difficult times, imagine you're a car thief.
 The LoJack security system has hurt the business model of auto theft, forcing thieves to go into new lines of work -- and that should inspire us to think more creatively and systematically about how to reduce crime.
 Sold for $695, the LoJack is a radio transmitter that is hidden on a vehicle and then activated if the car is stolen. The transmitter then silently summons the police -- and it is ruining the economics of auto theft. 
 Car theft, it turns out, is a volume business. And so if even a small percentage of vehicles have LoJack, the professional thief will eventually steal a car with one and get caught. 
 The thief's challenge is that it's impossible to determine which vehicle has a LoJack (there's no decal). So stealing any car becomes significantly more risky, and one academic study found that the introduction of LoJack in Boston reduced car theft there by 50 percent.
 Two Yale professors, Barry Nalebuff and Ian Ayres, note that this means that the LoJack benefits everyone, not only those who install the system. Professor Ayres and another scholar, Steven Levitt, found that every $1 invested in LoJack saves other car owners $10. 
 Professors Nalebuff and Ayres note that other antitheft devices, such as the Club, a polelike device that locks the steering wheel, help protect that car, but only at the expense of the next vehicle.
 ''The Club doesn't reduce crime,'' Mr. Nalebuff says. ''It just shifts it to the next person.''
 So in their clever book, ''Why Not?,'' the two professors propose measures to shift people away from devices like the Club and toward LoJack. For example, they urge regulators to require insurers to give discounts to LoJack users -- Massachusetts does that, so LoJack use is high in Massachusetts and car theft now low.
 That's an illustration of the kind of creative thinking we need more of. Public policy discussions about crime tend to be exceptionally shallow, because politicians are scared to say anything much other than ''string 'em up.'' But if we tackled crime as comprehensively and wonkishly as we do pollution or auto safety, we'd all be better off.
 For example, suppose we apply the LoJack model to home burglary alarms. 
 Conventional home alarms are accompanied by warning signs and don't reduce crime but simply shift the risk to the next house. What if we encouraged hidden silent alarms to change the economics of burglary?
 Granted, most people don't want hidden alarms that entice a burglar to stay until the police show up. But suppose communities adjusted the fees they charge for alarm systems -- say, $2,000 a year for an audible alarm, but no charge for a hidden LoJack-style silent alarm.
 Then many people would choose the silent alarms, more burglars would get caught, and many of the criminally inclined would choose a new line of work, perhaps becoming chief executives.
 An article in The Milken Institute Review proposes other ideas for reducing crime. The author, John Donohue of Yale, notes that both building prisons and adding police officers reduce crime rates. But he argues that we get much more bang for the buck by hiring police.
 We have about 300,000 more prisoners than is cost-effective, Professor Donohue calculates. In other words, every extra $100 spent on incarceration reduces crime losses by some smaller amount, say $50. But he also finds that we could add up to 500,000 police officers, and they would pay for themselves in crime savings.
 Some social programs also pay for themselves in reduced crime. Professor Donohue argues that a good bet is the Perry Preschool program (which involves weekly home visits). Its graduates end up 40 percent less likely to be arrested than those in a control group. The Job Corps for at-risk teenagers has also been shown to be very effective.
 One fairness issue is that anticrime programs are much more cost-effective when aimed at boys than at girls, because boys are much more likely than girls to kill, rob and rape. Neglected girls tend to suffer on their own, while neglected boys make their neighbors suffer. 
 Sure, some of the crime-fighting ideas being bandied about are pie-in-the-sky. But they show how we can think about crime in systematic ways, rather than just grunting about the need for more prisons. We should be at least as creative in addressing crime as thieves are.
