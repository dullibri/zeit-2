Looking to Score With a Sports Complex

 BODY:
A $2.7-MILLION excavation project for a new sports complex on 28 acres just south of the city's center marks the beginning of one of the largest downtown developments in recent history. It is also one of the few projects on schedule in what has become a near standstill in development.
The site, just three blocks from Public Square, is being cleared for the $361.7 million Gateway project, a combination open-air stadium and indoor arena. 
 The sports complex will create a strong southern anchor for the city. Not only will it help retain major league teams and provide space for national conventions, but it will also stretch the urban center southward to meet main highway interchanges.
There are long-term plans for museums and commercial developments on the Lake Erie waterfront several blocks north of the project, and they and Gateway are viewed as major elements in an effort to build an image for the city as a place to visit, not just as a center for business.
Gateway is "a very definite component in our downtown plan to concentrate attractions and create Cleveland as a destination center," said Hunter Morrison, the city planner.
Its completion in 1994 is also being counted on to spur additional redevelopment. Both the Cleveland Indians baseball team, already downtown, and the Cavaliers basketball team, now in an outlying suburb, have made commitments to the new complex and are expected to draw two to four million people a year into the city.
The open-air stadium will accommodate 43,000 Indians fans, and 29,000 additional seats can be built for football fans if the Browns are successfully wooed from their longtime home at the Municipal Stadium.
Cavaliers basketball games as well as hockey games, concerts and other events are slated for the 21,000-seat indoor arena. A total of 3,200 parking spaces will be provided on site initially, with more possible later.
The face of Public Square changed dramatically in the last decade with the completion of the $400 million renovation of the landmark 52-story Terminal Tower and the addition of the 57-story Society Center, now the city's tallest building. These days, however, the economic climate is being blamed for stalling several projects in the planning stages.
The Indians' co-owners, Richard E. and David Jacobs, fans and the American League have long considered the 61-year-old lakefront Municipal Stadium unsuitable for the team. Built for track and field events in an effort to attract the Olympics, it has since been modified for the Indians and the Cleveland Browns football team.
Momentum for a new ballpark began in the mid-80's, but voters defeated a 1984 referendum to raise property taxes to help finance a long-since-abandoned plan for a domed stadium. Still, planning continued. A $4 million loan (since forgiven) was granted in 1985 by the State of Ohio to help buy land. Two years later, demolition of warehouse buildings in the so-called Central Market district left room for a 3,000-space parking lot.
THE city and the county joined forces in 1990 to form Gateway Development Corporation, a nonprofit group charged with overseeing the project's development. Its nine-member panel is headed by James M. Biggar, chairman of the Glencairn Corporation, a local developer, and former chairman of Nestle Enterprises.
But the biggest boost came in 1990 when voters approved an excise tax on cigarettes and alcohol to pay for tax-exempt bonds, which will provide $153.8 million toward construction costs, meeting a Federal deadline for gaining tax-exempt status.
"Had the tax-free-bond provision been allowed to sunset and the bonds had not been sold, the project wouldn't have happened," said Mr. Morrison.
Since the bond offering began in September 1990, $18.8 million of $21.2 million expected has been raised from the sale of luxury seating. Short-term lease sales are to bring in an additional $25.3 million with arena luxury seating adding $4 million more. Twenty-four companies have paid $45,000 to $100,000 in advance for 10-year leases on private loge seating. Game tickets are not included.
"The unique thing about Cleveland is the commitment of the corporate community to the vitality of the city's downtown," said Harry C. Howell 3d, vice president for marketing for Gateway. "They didn't sign leases because they wanted the suite; they did it for the project."
Construction costs beyond money realized from the sale of bonds will be met by other state and Cuyahoga County sources.Parking revenues and the sale of the right to name the complex are being counted on for $21 million. In addition, a local development partnership formed by Cleveland Tommorrow, a civic group, has provided a $28 million loan and local charitable foundations have come up with $4 million.
The Cavaliers have a 30-year lease in which the rent is figured as a share of suite revenue and tickets sold; the Indians, who have a 20-year lease, have agreed to commit $20 million from their premium seating to the construction fund. Their rent will be based on attendance.
DESIGNED by Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum of Kansas City, the firm responsible for the new Camden Yards ballpark opening this season for the Baltimore Orioles and the recently completed Comiskey Park for the White Sox in Chicago, the Indians' stadium at Gateway will give fans a full view of downtown.
Arena designs, completed by Ellerbe Becket of Kansas City, also include two restaurants, a food court, a Cavaliers team retail store and practice courts. Construction is expected to begin later this spring, with completion planned for August 1994.
Both sports facilities will be owned by Cuyahoga County once the debt is retired.
There are divergent views on whether having a major league team in a new ballpark will position the city nationally to attract visitors and conventions. Successful convention and tourist towns, such as San Diego, San Francisco and Chicago, for example, have either better weather or more attractions than Cleveland.
"There are upper limits on the number of conventions out there and other cities possess natural attributes over Cleveland," said Norman Krumholz, a former city planning director who is now an urban affairs specialist at Cleveland State University. "Are we going to compete with San Francisco? I don't think so. The whole point of the stadium is to hold on to the Indians. If we lost them, we wouldn't be a big-league town anymore and that would be disastrous to the morale and pride of the city."

Construction costs beyond money realized from the sale of bonds will be met by an expected state capital budget appropriation of $25 million; $12 million in state loans, $6 million pending from highway funds, $5.1 million in interest on bond investments and $2.5 million on other investments. Cuyahoga County is also being asked for a $75 million loan. Parking revenues and the sale of the right to name the complex are being counted on for $21 million.
In addition, a local development partnership formed by Cleveland Tommorrow, a civic group, has provided a $28 million loan and local charitable foundations have come up with $4 million.
Late last year, the state approved a property-tax cap providing that the development be taxed only on the current value of the land and not on its improvements. To compensate the city's schools and public entities, a $1 million pool was earmarked in the bill to come from city income taxes on Gateway workers.
The Cavaliers have a 30-year lease in which the rent is figured as a share of suite revenue and tickets sold; the Indians, who have a 20-year lease, have agreed to commit $20 million from their premium seating to the construction fund. Their rent will be based on attendance.
Designed by Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum of Kansas City, the firm responsible for the new Camden Yards ballpark opening this season for the Baltimore Orioles and the recently completed Comiskey Park for the White Sox in Chicago, the Indians' stadium at Gateway will give fans a full view of downtown.
Three levels of luxury loges will create private seating for up to 1,416 and semiprivate club seating for 2,140 more. Loge owners will have access to free parking and a separate entrance and walkway to the park.
Private loge and club seating will be offered in the arena as well, along with a separate entrance and free private parking.
Arena designs, completed by Ellerbe Becket of Kansas City, also include two restaurants, a food court, a Cavaliers team retail store and practice courts. Construction is expected to begin later this spring, with completion planned for August 1994.
Designs for the project also include a 90,000-square-foot underground truck garage and several pedestrian plazas.
Huber Hunt & Nichols of Indianapolis last year was awarded a $5.1 million contract to manage the stadium construction; Turner Construction of New York was awarded a $5.5 million contract to oversee construction of the arena.
Both sports facilities will be owned by Cuyahoga County once the debt is retired.
There are divergent views on whether having a major league team in a new ballpark will position the city nationally to attract visitors and conventions.

HEADLINE: Convention Bureau Is Wooing Bus Tours

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

 BODY:
IN the latest attempt to bring an influx of new dollars to Westchester hotels and tourist attractions, a marketing campaign is under way to turn the county into what is known in the travel industry as a hub and spoke destination for bus tours.
"It's a concept that has worked very well in generating additional revenues for the hospitality industry in other parts of the country," said Richard Eisley, president of the Westchester Convention and Visitors Bureau. "The plan is to get motor-coach companies to hub their coaches and passengers at Westchester hotels and spoke out every day, so to speak, to attractions in surrounding areas." 
 The concept would work particularly well for Westchester, he said, because of its proximity to Manhattan and the Hudson River Valley, both top destinations for passengers on organized bus tours.
 
High Expectations
 "We expect to draw visitors from as far away as the West Coast, the Midwest, the Sun Belt and Europe," he said. "What we are selling is location and hotels by making the point that by staying in Westchester, visitors will not only have easy access to all the attractions in New York City, which is the mecca for tourists, but they will also have the nature preserves and historical landmarks in New York State and Connecticut."
He added that despite a hotel tax of 3 percent in Westchester, room rates here are lower than those in New York City, whose hotels have a 5 percent room tax and a higher sales tax.
Even overnight stops would give local hotels and attractions a boost, Mr. Eisley said. According to a travel research company in New Bedford, Mass., "the average expenditure for a motor coach with 48 passengers is $4,695 spent locally overnight for lodging, meals and attractions," he said.
 
Visiting the Trade Shows
 In order to woo major tour companies, the bureau has embarked on a vigorous marketing program that includes participation in trade shows, including one in Kingston, N.Y., this month that is expected to attract 1,000 tour operators. The bureau is also expecting 50 tour-company representatives for a three-day familiarization tour of the county in May.
"We're having a mini-trade show on one of the days for the motor-coach people to talk to everyone here, from hotel reps to shopping-mall people, on a one-to-one basis," Mr. Eisley said.
David Thornton, a tour-operator marketing specialist who is acting as an adviser to the bureau, said the county's chances of success were good.
"Not only does Westchester have the scenic attractions and historic restorations that attract foreign and domestic visitors," Mr. Thornton said, "but Westchester is a crossroads that everyone has to go through to get to New England and west of the Hudson. And hordes of Canadians come through the county on their way to Manhattan.
"It's time for Westchester to capitalize on getting all those motor coaches to stop overnight in the county," he added.
 
Hotels Say They Need Help
 "Our hotels need all the help they can get," said Bruce Gorelick, president of the Westchester Hotel Association and general manager of the 443-room Westchester Marriott Hotel in Tarrytown.
"During a recession as deep as this one, fewer meetings and conventions are being held," he said. "Hotel business is down. It's an uphill fight for our hotels to keep in the black. We need something to stop the bleeding."
Hotels need a 66 percent occupancy rate just to break even, Mr. Gorelick said, but the average occupancy rates for hotels in Westchester this year have been between 58 and 60 percent.
The 3 percent hotel room tax levied by the county was bitterly fought by the industry, and Mr. Gorelick blamed it on a weak economy worsened by giving hotels in Connecticut and northern New Jersey a price advantage.
"When identical rooms in the same hotel chain cost $15 to $20 less in Stamford than in Westchester, you can see what we are up against," he said.
 
Hard Times for Hotels
 Mr. Gorelick gave a litany of examples to illustrate the difficult times hotels are facing: "Although they are still operating, Days Inn in Elmsford is in receivership. Some other hotels in the county are experiencing such difficulties that they have been lowering their rates to dangerous levels. Some are offering rates as low as $75, even $50, just to cover fixed costs. But hotels can't continue to operate that way for very long."
Taking what Mr. Gorelick calls a defensive action, the hoteliers are meeting with county and state legislators this month.
"We want to discuss the impact the hotel tax has had on our business," he said. "Most urgently, we hope to quash the specter of a possible increase in the hotel tax to 5 percent, which we hear is favored by some officials. Given the hard facts that we're doing everything just to survive, the thought of a tax increase is ludicrous."
To make the hotel tax more palatable when it was enacted, 15 percent, or $282,000, of the tax revenue of $1.88 million in the latest figures, was earmarked for financing the Westchester Convention and Visitors Bureau.
 
Association Contributes $8,000
 "Eighty-five percent of the money collected from the hotel room tax goes into the county general fund for other uses," Mr. Gorelick said. "We, as an association, want to go on record that we are so anxious to bring business into the county that with money out of our own pockets we have contributed $8,000 to the convention bureau to help put another salesperson on the staff. And we expect great things."
This year, Mr. Eisley said, in addition to the $8,000 in cooperative funds from the hotels, the Yonkers Raceway and Playland, the convention bureau received its 15 percent share of the hotel tax, or $282,000, and $32,000 from the state, bringing its total yearly budget to $322,000.
"Our bus-familiarization trip is in May," he said, "but because bus people don't buy overnight stays until at least six months after, we can only look for day trips beginning in November." He said that the revenue from day trips is hard to quantify, but he added that the National Tour Association estimates that a busload of passengers spends $2,199 in meals, attractions, transportation and passenger incidentals in one day.
 
And Don't Forget Conventions
 The bureau has also been promoting Westchester's convention and meeting possibilities. "Our first trade show in Albany drew executives from 22 different associations in the Capital Region and resulted in the sale of 1,200 hotel rooms," Mr. Eisley said.
Mr. Eisley estimated that the bureau's marketing efforts directed at bringing conventions to the county will fill 2,415 more hotel rooms, generating $274,706 in business and taxes.
The county also participated in a recent trade show at the New York Hilton in Manhattan. "Representatives from 30 large organizations circulated through the exhibition area, stopping to discuss prices with a sales team from 12 Westchester hotels, Playland and Yonkers Raceway," Mr. Eisley said.
"The hotels said they got a lot of good leads that they would follow up on," he added. "We're satisfied with the turnout. Now we'll wait and see."

OVER THE EARTH I COME
The Great Sioux Uprising of 1862.
By Duane Schultz.
Illustrated. 307 pp. New York:
A Thomas Dunne Book/
St. Martin's Press. $21.95. 
 FROM the early 17th century to the late 19th century, the behavior of white settlers in America toward the native American tribes they encountered, as well as toward the land they expropriated from those tribes, was conditioned by one overriding factor: settlement was generally their last hope. Propelled by experiences of religious, ethnic and economic turmoil, the settlers had staked not only their fortunes but also their very lives on the hope of building new lives in untried country.
For the Indians the settlers displaced, the terms of the conflict were, in the beginning, slightly less mortal, but that mortality grew as the tribes saw their lands shrink drastically with the passing of generations. These circumstances alone would suffice to explain the extraordinary savagery that generally marked hostilities between the settlers and the native Americans; when we add the fact that both sides had made important cultural rituals out of heinous violence long before they ever encountered each other, it becomes clear that an almost unlimited potential for nightmarish behavior existed.
Duane Schultz's capably researched and tautly written "Over the Earth I Come" reminds us that responsibility for the abominable events that occurred during the Indian wars cut across ethnic boundaries. Mr. Schultz successfully resists the pressures of political correctness that reached their apogee with the release of the movie "Dances With Wolves" and offers vivid evidence that barbarity and treachery are qualities that characterize all groups, tribes and nations.
Mr. Schultz -- the author of several books on the Second World War, including "The Doolittle Raid," as well as "Month of the Freezing Moon: The Sand Creek Massacre, November 1864" -- uses a journalistic narrative style to bring to life the great Sioux uprising of 1862 in Minnesota, an event that cost the lives of hundreds of white settlers and eventually led to the largest mass execution in American history (38 Indians were hanged simultaneously), as well as to the expulsion of nearly all native Americans -- not just the guilty Sioux -- from their lands in that state.
Clearly, this was not a situation similar to the enslavement of black Africans or the genocidal extermination of Jews in Nazi Germany, two false analogies often cited in studies of American expansion. Rather, Mr. Schultz paints the Minnesota encounter as what it was: a war, a total war between rival nations for control of territory both groups were willing to die for.
Each side receives Mr. Schultz's muted disapproval: the whites for the way they forced and finally resolved the conflict, the Indians for the way they conducted it. Without overstating his case, he cites the causes of Sioux dissatisfaction, which are all familiar: "the broken treaties, the routine cheating by traders, the near-starvation conditions." By midsummer 1862 the Sioux living on their tribe's principal reservation were desperate, and some were turning to violence. But their chief, Little Crow, resisted calls for an armed insurrection. He confronted Tom Galbraith, the reservation's new Indian agent, and a collection of traders, notably the exploitative and successful Andrew Myrick, with his people's plight. Little Crow demanded food. The essential white reaction was summed up by Myrick: "So far as I am concerned, if they are hungry, let them eat grass or their own dung." As Mr. Schultz comments with typical and admirable understatement, "Andrew Myrick would pay for that remark."
Unfortunately, not only Myrick but scores of innocent white men, women and especially children paid as well. Throughout the summer, Sioux warriors engaged in atrocious behavior that often had little to do with righting wrongs or even with ritualized violence: it was simple sadism and blood lust, usually aggravated by whisky. The settlers were most often done in not by their hatred of the Indians but by the seeming friendships they had formed with them: approached by old Sioux acquaintances they had befriended with food and shelter, many settlers were murdered in the coldest of blood, the native Americans exhibiting a particular penchant for torturing infants and children.
Mr. Schultz does not fail to find individual as well as general parallels between the white and Indian sides: both Little Crow, the leader of the uprising, and Henry Sibley, the popular former Governor of Minnesota who eventually put it down (he was chosen to lead the campaign against the Sioux because of his extensive personal dealings with them), are drawn as three-dimensional, deeply flawed characters, each of whom pursued his appointed task reluctantly but relentlessly. In the fall of 1862, having lost a string of battles, Little Crow led most of his "hostiles" out of Minnesota, leaving behind a large group of white hostages and many "friendlies," Sioux who had opposed the uprising but who were punished by the whites anyway. Hundreds of Indians were sentenced to death that winter, though President Abraham Lincoln approved the execution of only 38 of them. At least some of those 38 were not guilty of any crimes; one had even saved a white woman and her family at great personal risk. But the innocent had made the terrible mistake of throwing themselves on the mercy of the revenge-obsessed whites.
Historically, the uprising represented the overture to the Plains Wars, during which the Sioux would fight the whites far more skillfully and with far greater success. Yet the essential terms and tone of the conflict, judiciously brought to life by Duane Schultz in "Over the Earth I Come," were set in 1862. If it is a less than inspiring story, it is certainly necessary to any balanced understanding of our nation's expansion.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
In the Case of a Missing Publisher, All the Cards Are Now on the Table

BYLINE: By ALEX S. JONES

 BODY:
Should anyone make a movie about Domer Ringuette, it would probably be called "Domer, Run," in tribute to John Updike's Rabbit. And behind the opening credits, a gleeful Mr. Ringuette would be humming "On The Road Again," Willie Nelson's anthem to the exquisite joy of leaving it all behind.
On a Monday last August, Mr. Ringuette -- weekly newspaper owner, pillar of small business and local politician in Chicopee, Mass. -- abruptly disappeared without a word to employees, bankers, customers, newspaper readers or even the mayor. 
 When employees of his paper, The Chicopee Herald, went to his house to check on him, they found it empty, except for an ironing board.
 
'Walking Away From Assets
 Mr. Ringuette, at 53 years old, had done what many dream of doing: he had simply driven away from position, responsibility and assets that he estimates -- rather optimistically -- to be worth as much as $750,000, after his debts were settled.
"I had made up my mind to be free, so I became free," said Mr. Ringuette, who was located five months after he disappeared by The Transcript-Telegram, a daily paper in neighboring Holyoke that received an anonymous tip.
Mr. Ringuette, it turned out, had abandoned his publisher's life to fulfill a dream of becoming a poker dealer. He now deals seven-card stud and Texas hold 'em on the noon-to-8 shift at the Poker Palace in North Las Vegas, Nev., for minimum wage plus tips.
As for the confusion, perplexity and corporate mess he left behind in Chicopee, Mr. Ringuette's position is unequivocal indifference.
"In plain English, if anybody over there has problems, they can go to hell," he said last week.
Now that the shock has worn off somewhat in Chicopee, people seem to view Mr. Ringuette's flight philosophically.
"He was unhappy here and he left," said Dr. John E. Maslar, a chiropractor and local entrepreneur who essentially rescued The Chicopee Herald by hiring Mr. Ringuette's staff and starting a new paper he called The Herald-American.
But Dr. Maslar added, in a sentiment that seems to sum up Chicopee's view of Mr. Ringuette's curious behavior, "It's the weirdest thing in the world."
In the weeks following Mr. Ringuette's disappearance, rumors flew through Chicopee, a blue-collar town of about 57,000 between Springfield and Holyoke in western Massachusetts. Most of the population in Chicopee is of Polish or, like Mr. Ringuette, French-Canadian heritage.
Mr. Ringuette, who spent his entire life in Chicopee, said several rumors had reached him in Las Vegas. One theory was that he had fled to escape huge gambling debts; another had him deep in debt to loan sharks, and it was whispered in Chicopee that he was last seen getting into a sinister-looking black limousine. It was also said that he sometimes quoted poetry to his newspaper employees, though how this was linked to his disappearance was unclear.
 
Afraid of a Change of Mind
 Mr. Ringuette said the rumors about gambling and loan sharks were nonsense. He said he left the way he did because he was afraid he might change his mind if he took the time to sell everything and settle his affairs.
And he said he was fed up with 18-hour workdays, a recession-racked economy that had made money very scarce and the day-to-day frustrations of operating his newspaper, rental property and the Green Valley Country Store and Gas, the convenience store and gas station that he opened every day at 5 A.M. He had been divorced for more than 20 years and his only child, a daughter who lives in Texas, was not interested in publishing.
Under Mr. Ringuette, The Herald shifted from a paid-circulation weekly of about 5,000 to a free-circulation paper of about 25,000 that was distributed in neighboring towns. It had gross revenues of $250,000 to $500,000, the former publisher said.
Most of The Herald's articles were provided by freelance writers or sent in unsolicited. Mayor Joseph J. Chessey Jr. of Chicopee described the paper as a "hometown-type newspaper" with lots of "Girl Scout cookie drive pictures" and such.
"I like working," said Mr. Ringuette, who rejects the idea that he was motivated by laziness. "And I'm a little old for a middle-age crisis."
Indeed, Mayor Chessey and others who knew Mr. Ringuette remember him as hard-working and politically ambitious. A year ago, he had asked Mayor Chessey to appoint him to the Sewer Commission, which sets sewer rates. When Mr. Ringuette left, he was in the midst of an election campaign to become an alderman.
Even so, the Friday before he left, he called a friend and told her she could have his furniture if she would come get it. She came with a truck and removed everything but the ironing board.
On Monday, Aug. 19, he woke as usual at 4:30 A.M., threw some suitcases into his Lincoln Town Car, and left town.
 
Barely Breaking Even
 He said he took what cash he had, but there was not much as his businesses were barely breaking even. Mr. Ringuette declined to provide details, but estimated his debts -- including mortgages, printing bills and about $20,000 that The Herald owed to the Internal Revenue Service -- to be about $1.25 million.
Had he waited until the economy improved and sold out, he roughly estimates his holdings would have brought $2 million, though he declines to explain how he arrived at that figure.
When Mr. Ringuette did not open the convenience store as usual, word spread through Chicopee quickly.
The Chicopee Chief of Police, Joseph J. Wilk, said he never suspected foul play because an officer found no evidence of a break-in at Mr. Ringuette's home. "Everything was safe and sound and gone," he recalled.
When Mr. Ringuette's brothers and sisters, who also live in Chicopee, did not file a missing person's report, everyone concluded that Mr. Ringuette had bolted of his own free will.
At The Herald, Chicopee's only paper, the abandoned staff began a frantic search for a rescuer.
Mr. Ringuette had acquired The Herald in 1983 as a business investment and in hopes that it would eventually help him become mayor.
Though he dropped out of high school, Mr. Ringuette had earned a high school equivalency degree in the Marine Corps and, upon returning to Chicopee, gradually demonstrated acumen as a small-business man. In 1968, he acquired a small variety store, then expanded it to include a laundry and a restaurant he called Domer's Deli. Eventually, he sold that business and bought the convenience store and gas station, as well as real estate and The Herald.
 
Competition Emerges
 But a year ago, the two daily papers in neighboring Springfield and Holyoke had started free-circulation weeklies of their own.
When Mr. Ringuette left, The Herald's employees scrambled to publish that Wednesday's issue and frantically tried to find a backer.
Dr. Maslar, who operates three chiropractic clinics in the area, decided to give it a try, in part to give his son a part-time job as an advertising salesmen. His daughter, who is attending college, writes a column called "The Student's Viewpoint."
"If I had to make a living off this paper, I'd be on a soup line," Dr. Maslar said, though he added that he was making a small profit.
Dr. Maslar's approach was to declare that he was starting a new paper. Whereas Mr. Ringuette's paper had been The Chicopee Herald, the new paper was called The Herald, and quickly changed again to The Herald-American.
The convenience store remains shuttered.
 
Liquidation Likely
 Thomas L. Howard, a tax lawyer at Baker, Worthington, Crossley, Stansberry & Woolf in Washington, said Mr. Ringuette's creditors would liquidate his property, probably for no more than what is owed on them.
Mr. Ringuette says that when he receives letters from the Internal Revenue Service, or from lawyers or the Chicopee Savings Bank -- his main lender -- or the Massachusetts Department of Labor about unpaid wages, he just throws them away.
"If anybody is concerned and wants to put me in jail, they're welcome to," he said. "I don't give a damn; I'm free."

HEADLINE: Cut in Road Budget Imperils New York Drivers

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Mayor David N. Dinkins's plan to slash highway spending in the New York City Department of Transportation's capital budget embodies the worst of bureaucratic decision making (news article, March 4). The Dinkins administration has moved not only to make the life of a car owner even more precarious, but also to threaten the long-term economic well-being of the future of our city. 
 These shortsighted people proposed cutting the Department of Transportation's capital highway budget by an unbelievable 98 percent: slashing an already inadequate $224 million to just over $4 million. This means, for example, that instead of 15 road crews, only one crew will serve all five boroughs.
I fully understand the need to reorder our priorities in fiscally difficult times, but this plan is irrational. Not only will it mean more pothole damage to front-end alignment, suspensions and tires, but it will also most assuredly lead to an increase in accidents and fatalities on our roads.
This City Hall scheme also threatens the long-term economic recovery of our city. There is little incentive for companies to stay in New York -- let alone invest to expand their job base -- when important deliveries can't be made on schedule and employees can't get to work on time or travel the city streets in safety.
And although I don't own a car, few issues have so direct an impact on our day-to-day life as the condition of our infrastructure.
This City Hall budget proposal is a prescription for disaster; it must be changed.

HEADLINE: Hidden Lives: New York's Poorest Immigrants -- A special report;
Crammed in Tiny, Illegal Rooms, Tenants of the Margins of Survival

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER

 BODY:
Up three flights of broken stairs in a garment factory building on the western edge of Chinatown was the windowless 8-by-10-foot cell that Abdulaye Kamara, an immigrant from Senegal, was happy to call home.
His neighbors were mostly people like himself, resourceful immigrants from China, Vietnam, Mexico and a few other countries, living quietly in a warren of 16 cubicles constructed illegally, with no apparent regard for building codes. 
 They had one working toilet, out in the narrow hallway, and no bath or kitchen. The air they breathed was thick with particles of dust and lint, wafting from three other floors where hundreds of Chinese women work at sewing machines from morning till night. They paid $200 to $350 a month and considered it a bargain.
 
Reduced to Rubble
 "I thought, 'This is lucky for me,' " Mr. Kamara said, recalling the day he moved in four years ago. "Manhattan is very high."
This most rudimentary of dwellings is nothing but rubble now, courtesy of four men with sledgehammers who showed up one morning in the wake of a landlord-tenant dispute. Since then, eight tenants have managed to get rooms at a single-room-occupancy hotel on East 28th Street -- a brief respite in the ceaseless search for that rarest of New York commodities: a decent and affordable place for a poor person to live.
But while the fourth floor is no more, the story of 372 Broadway in its hardscrabble heyday -- and of the lives that brought its tenants together there -- is the story of tens of thousands of marginal people who live packed together in similarly subdivided illegal encampments all over New York City.
These are the people who find jobs where there aren't supposed to be any, who manage to survive in New York -- and feed and shelter their families back home. They are the people who sell flowers at highway exits and watches on Fifth Avenue, who drive gypsy cabs in neighborhoods where yellow cabs won't go, who bus tables in Chinatown and deliver takeout at 2 A.M.
They are from China, the Dominican Republic, Colombia, Haiti, Senegal, Mexico and a lot of other places where freedom or work or both are in short supply.
At night here in America, they crowd 10 or more to a basement in East Flatbush, the East Bronx and Washington Heights, or five to a subdivided room in Harlem, Brighton Beach and Elmhurst. In Chinatown, some people sleep in shifts on bunks in barracks-style rooms.
 
More Than 60,000
 They are all citizens of an illegal underground network that has been expanding since the 1970's, as the city's single-room-occupancy hotels have been swallowed by real-estate development. It is impossible to know just how many of these dwellings there are, but urban planners, tenant lawyers, social workers and community organizers, based on their work with the tenants and on reports of evictions from the Fire Department, estimate there are more than 60,000.
The encampment at 372 Broadway was certainly not the worst -- there were sprinklers and fire alarms, and the walls were Sheetrock, not plywood and chicken wire.
"This was actually palatial compared to the standards by which a lot of people are living," said City Councilwoman Kathryn Freed, who is trying to help the tenants.
And Mr. Kamara's cell was palatial compared to where he spent his first six months at 372 Broadway. He is 5-foot-9 and thin, but in the circuit-breaker closet, there was barely space for him to curl up on a narrow mattress on the floor. Mr. Kamara, who is 31 years old, came to America 10 years ago to provide for his mother and nine brothers and sisters back in Dakar. For the last four years, he has done it on a meager $4.25 an hour as a stockboy. The circuit-breaker closet cost $35 a week, cash.
Like Mr. Kamara, the other residents of 372 Broadway, devoted to work and saving money for families back home, led lives as circumscribed as their tiny rooms.
In their two years in America, Fan Yong Guang, 35, and his brother, Fan Yong Yuan, 30, returned every night from the garment factory where they sew zippers to eat rice and vegetables cooked on a hot plate in their room. They have never been to a restaurant, or a movie. Central Park? Fifth Avenue? They had never heard of them.
"I don't know what is in America," the older brother said.
On one of his last nights at 372 Broadway, Mr. Kamara wore a secondhand winter coat as he huddled in his cold cubicle, with only a candle for light. He had just started a new job, as a $5.50-an-hour security guard, and his uniform hung from a hook on the wall. Displayed on a dented metal desk was a Christmas card from his family 4,000 miles away.
On his small tape player, his famous countryman, Youssou N'Dour, sang Mr. Kamara's favorite song, "Immigres," about Senagalese like him who have gone abroad in search of work.
"Every night before I go to sleep I'm thinking about the future," Mr. Kamara said, in the smooth English he says he has taught himself here. His smile was luminous.
"I want to build my mom a house in my country. Not a big house, just four rooms, including the bathroom and kitchen. Mango trees out front. Sometimes I dream I'm sitting under the mango trees with my mom and my brothers and sisters. Then I wake up, and look around, and I'm here."
"This was Frankie's room. Frankie was Spanish. Frankie was a nice guy." Mr. Kamara, the historian of the fourth floor, was giving a tour of a disaster area. Frankie's room was one of those demolished by the sledgehammers, and Frankie had vanished.
So had several Korean peddlers. And Sebastian. "Sebastian was Mexican," Mr. Kamara said. "He sold stuff on the street, sweaters, scarves, everything."
Anyone who was desperate enough to find the way to the fourth floor, and who had cash for rent, could get in. Mr. Kamara arrived after he lost the apartment he shared with five people in the Bronx. Near the electronics store on Canal Street where he was a stockboy, he had spotted the sign: "Room for Rent -- 372 Broadway."
Mee Ying Chan was a mystery tenant. She owns an apartment building in Queens. Still, she insists that she is poor. Last year, she declared herself an Independent candidate for the City Council but then dropped out. Ms. Chan's neighbors enjoyed watching Chinese movies on her VCR, before it was stolen.
In two rooms down the hall lived Gina Doss and Harry Fromer, both from New York. "Gina's in the hospital," Mr. Kamara said.
Mr. Fromer had returned to 372 Broadway after a month's absence -- he had also been in the hospital, he said -- and, before he could reach his door, Mr. Kamara gently broke the news. His room was no more.
"At least we're not on the street," said Mr. Fromer, whose last job was passing out fliers for the Plum Blossom restaurant in Chinatown.
 
Mystery Landlord
Space Leased 'For Storage'
 No one knows who put up the cubicles, though the tenants paid their rent to Javier Arana, who runs a small retail fabric store on the building's ground floor.
City records list the owner of 372 Broadway as the Broadway-White Realty Corporation. Besides that building, the company, which has had many addresses through the years but is not listed in the phone book, owns six apartment buildings in the Bronx. A man involved in the operation of the building, Zalman Deitsch, said he did not know that people were living in the building, which is zoned for commercial use only.
Until recently, Mr. Deitsch said, Mr. Arana leased the fourth floor. He said Mr. Arana told him he was using it for storage. Reached at the fabric store, Mr. Arana said he had nothing to do with the fourth floor and refused to comment further.
For the tenants of the fourth floor, the end may have begun when Ms. Doss, apparently unaware that her room was illegal, took Mr. Arana to housing court last October, demanding repairs. On Feb. 10, a judge fined Mr. Arana $3,500. On Feb. 11, the men with sledgehammers went to work.
 
No Strangers to Trouble
 "Look what they did to the Old Man's home." Mr. Kamara pointed to Room 408, where the front wall had been knocked in. The Old Man, as Mr. Kamara refers respectfully to 78-year-old Tsang Kok Wah, stood there in a soiled raincoat and knit cap.
The tenants were stoic. This disaster was not their first. In the village where he grew up, Mr. Kamara saw other children swallow stones because there wasn't enough food. "For a long time it didn't rain," Mr. Kamara said. "For lunch, we ate a little rice and drank a lot of water. For dinner we had bread and water with sugar. Then everyone moved to the city."
To build his mother's house, Mr. Kamara says he needs $12,000 -- an enormous sum of money in Dakar. After several years of nonstop labor -- peddling umbrellas, icing cookies in a baking factory in the Bronx, making plastic hangers in a factory in Brooklyn -- he had saved $6,000 in a bank in Senegal, he said.
"A few years ago my mom called," he said. "She told me the bank had gone out of business. My money was just gone. I was discouraged. My mom said, 'It happened, it's life. You have to encourage yourself.' So I started over." But he gave up peddling -- it was too risky, he said -- and it is hard just to keep sending money home, let alone to save.
Mr. Tsang wept as he talked through a translator about his losses. His family in China was denounced for owning land when the Communists seized power in 1949.
"The Communists killed my parents," he said. "They executed my brother, and they banged my wife's head on the wall until she died."
Mr. Tsang escaped to Hong Kong. Ten years ago, he came to New York. Here, he said, he is safe from Communists. Though he owns property in Florida, Mr. Tsang said, he can't live anywhere very far from Chinatown. He speaks no English.
On the fourth floor, the only running water was from a small sink in the hallway. How, then, did Mr. Kamara manage to stay so clean?
Mr. Kamara pulled from his pocket the membership card that, for $25 a year, admits him to the Carmine Street city pool, two subway stops and a short walk from his old building. "I love to swim," he said. "I swim half a mile. And I take a shower."
 
Work, Hope, Work
A Better Future For Someone Else?
 On the morning of their last Sunday at 372 Broadway, no tenants were home. Mr. Kamara, dignified in his uniform, was at his security guard post -- at the luxury high-rise next door.
Mr. Tsang was at his job, in Atlantic City, where he trades in cut-rate casino coupons for a modest profit, $4 a ticket. Seven days a week, he commutes by van from Chinatown.
On Canal Street, Fan Yong Guang and his brother were peddling men's dress socks from a cardboard box. "Four for 5 dollar," the older brother said to a couple who stopped only to look. His sales pitch is the only English he knows.
The brothers peddle socks on their days off from the factory in Brooklyn. Some days they sew 200 zippers each; their hands get sore, they said. Other days there is no work.
They each earn about $900 a month, they said. They send $100 a month to their wives in China and put away a few hundred dollars for the day when their families will join them. Food for both of them costs less than $10 a day. They have one luxury -- 10 unfiltered cigarettes apiece a day.
"I'm going to make money for my son," the older brother said. "He's going to go to school, and he's going to learn English. Then, when I'm old, he'll take care of me."
Mr. Kamara is eager to experience the city. "A few years ago, I rented shoes at Rockefeller Center for $10," he said. "I was falling. My friend took my picture. I sent it to my family."
 
The Only Worker
 Ice skating was one evening out of 10 years. Mr. Kamara can't afford small pleasures. "I'm the only one working in my family," he said. "It is very hard to find a job in my country." The only one he could find was pouring nail polish into bottles at a factory for $3.50 a day -- when he could get it.
His mother, Ramatoulaye Diop, speaking in French from the home of a friend in Dakar with a telephone, said the rent on her four-room house is $345 a month. Abdulaye is the one who pays it, she said. She is proud of her second eldest son.
Mr. Kamara gladly put in 11-hour days, seven days a week, as a stockboy at the electronics store. For $45 a day. "I asked the boss for a raise," Mr. Kamara said. "He told me, 'I can get two Mexicans for $45 a day.' "
Mr. Kamara, who has been searching the classifieds for a second job, recently invested $3 in a red tie. He was wearing it with his white shirt the other evening as he walked along bustling Canal Street. "You never know when you could get a job interview," he said. "They won't hire you if you don't look nice."
 
In 'Heaven'
Companionship At an S.R.O.
 At the Latham Hotel, 4 East 28th Street, the eight former tenants of 372 Broadway meet often in one another's rooms after work. "Now we have a lot of problems," Mr. Kamara said. "We talk a lot."
It takes some improvising. Mr. Tsang speaks Cantonese, the brothers Mandarin. Everyone's favorite tenant, Mr. Kamara, makes a point of greeting his Chinese neighbors in their own language: "Ni hao ma?"
Holding tightly to Mr. Kamara's hand, the Chinese brothers repeated their one-word assessment -- in English -- of their sparsely furnished hotel room: "Heaven, heaven!"
After an telephone call from Councilwoman Freed's staff 18 days ago, the Fire Department vacated the tenants, making them the responsibility of the city. If they qualify, they will eventually move to housing projects or city-owned apartments.
 
After All, Hope Flutters
 Mr. Kamara is thinking of the house he wants to build his mother. His dream, he said, seems distant.
"If I had a dream that this was going to be my life in New York," he said, "I would just have stayed in my country and been poor."
But New York is where he is. And, he said, "I have to be hopeful." A few days ago, hope was rising. "I got more hours on my job!" he said. "Double shifts!"
Mr. Kamara heard recently from his 27-year-old brother, Doudou. He can't find a job. "He wants me to send him a plane ticket," Mr. Kamara said. "He wants to come to New York."

"Manhattan is very high." He stood outside his room. (C. M. Hardt for The New York Times) (pg. B2)

HEADLINE: Worries Persisting At the Fed

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 22

 BODY:
Federal Reserve officials say recent data indicate that the economy is picking up steam, but they remain worried that the incipient recovery could peter out.
In interviews last week, two Federal Reserve governors who agreed to speak on the record said that recent reports showing upturns in retail sales and housing starts were the most convincing evidence so far that the stubbornly persistent downturn was ending. But they also said that the manufacturing sector remained subdued and that employment growth was likely to lag. 
 "Taken together, the picture is pretty encouraging, but it is not definitive yet," said David W. Mullins Jr., vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. "There are still concerns about sustainability."
 
'Positive' First Quarter
 Mr. Mullins said that a few weeks ago, many economists were expecting a flat first quarter, but he said recent data suggested that first-quarter growth "would squarely be in positive territory," although it would still be slow.
He said "the pattern of data bodes well for a stronger second quarter and a return to moderate growth by midyear."
Many analysts say the recent positive data make it unlikely that Fed officials would cut interest rates in the near future because they think the Fed no longer believes that additional monetary easing is necessary to insure recovery. Some Fed officials have said they worry that the markets might view any additional cuts as inflationary.
In an interview today on the ABC News program "This Week With David Brinkley," Richard G. Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, agreed that the economy was recovering.
"We in the Administration are assuming each quarter throughout this year will be slightly better than the one before," he said, referring to the growth rate of the economy. "I think we can get 3 percent by the third and fourth quarter."
 
Lower Unemployment
 Mr. Darman added that at such a rate "we could have the good fortune of unemployment coming down" from its current level of 7.3 percent. He did not specify a level it might decline to.
The central bank governors pointed to numerous factors that could weaken or reverse the recent upturns. They said the rise in long-term interest rates since January could undermine the momentum in housing sales and residential construction, and they still worried about the persistent low levels of consumer confidence.
They added that the dollar's recent rise could hurt exports by making them more expensive.
"If you think of the two prime engines of the recovery -- the housing market and exports -- rates shoot at one and the dollar shoots at the other," said Mr. Mullins, who is considered the most influential member of the Federal Reserve Board after its chairman, Alan Greenspan.
Echoing what Mr. Greenspan told a Congressional committee early this month, the governors said the slowdowns in Japan and Germany could hamper American growth by hurting the nation's exports and slowing the world economy. Nevertheless, Mr. Greenspan said he expected American exports to continue to grow because of the strong economic gains of Mexico, the rest of Latin America and the newly industrialized countries of Asia.
Some Fed officials also worried that the positive news on housing starts and other areas could be exaggerated because of the unusually warm winter temperatures. For example, warm weather might have spurred a larger-than-normal amount of home construction in January and February.
The governors also said this economic rebound would probably not be as robust as past recoveries, partly because consumers and businesses were still struggling to pare the large debt they accumulated in the 1980's. This, they said, was holding back spending and consumer confidence.
 
Uneven Performances
 Another governor, Wayne D. Angell, said the lack of economic synchronization among the states would help prevent a robust recovery.
"We've had many quarters of recovery in Colorado, but I don't know if we have had recovery yet in New England," he said. "California is kind of a soft spot, with the cuts in defense."
Echoing Mr. Greenspan's Congressional testimony, the two governors said that consumer confidence appeared to be lower than recent economic reports would warrant. The governors said economic growth over the last three quarters had been so weak, after two quarters of decline, that it was depressing consumer confidence, as were fears about the nation's long-term economic prospects.
 
Anemic Growth Rates
 Mr. Mullins noted that consumer sentiment was subdued partly because the economy has not grown at even a modest 2 percent rate since the first quarter of 1989.
"The concern is not going into a double dip, but staying in this anemic growth range, which tends to reinforce fears," Mr. Mullins said. "There is power in negative thinking. That keeps people from spending and making the sort of commitments to keep the economy going again."
The Fed governors would not tip their hand about whether they were leaning toward lowering or raising rates, but Mr. Angell indicated that the central bankers were keeping their options open.
"There are some circumstances out there where we might have to raise interest rates, and some where we might have to decrease them," he said.

HEADLINE: Bush-Kohl Talks Stalled on Farm Trade

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 22

 BODY:
A weekend of talks between President Bush and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, leaders of the two biggest exporting nations, ended today with no suggestion of progress on a dispute over farm goods that is blocking a global agreement to lower trade barriers.
At a news conference at the White House, the two leaders expressed optimism that the proposed trade accord among 108 nations can be completed in mid-April, as negotiators have pledged. 
 But Administration officials have long said that the agreement hangs in part on the ability of Germany, the dominant force in the European Community, to persuade France and its other neighbors to break down a network of subsidies and trade barriers that protect farmers.
 
'Both Sides Have to Move'
 Mr. Kohl indicated today that his talks with Mr. Bush had produced no breakthrough. He also appeared to call for the United States to drop its demands for a more open European market, something Mr. Bush can ill afford in an election year in which he will depend on the farm vote. Canada and Australia have supported the United States in making these demands on Europe.
After two days of talks with Mr. Bush at Camp David, Md., Mr. Kohl said, "We still have some questions to solve before we can reach agreement. When we talk about compromise, it means that both sides have to move."
The talks also covered aid to the former Soviet republics and emerging democracies in eastern Europe, world environmental problems and preparations for a summit meeting of the seven largest industrial nations, scheduled for July 6 in Munich.
Both leaders consider the trade agreement crucial both to promoting growth in developing nations and to preventing the world from breaking into warring economic camps now that the United States-Soviet rivalry no longer dominates international affairs.
But Europe, led by France, has resisted demands by the United States, Canada and Australia that it open its borders more to farm imports and that it stop subsidizing exports like wheat.
 
Eyes on Europe and U.S.
 Other nations are refusing to negotiate lower trade barriers in other areas, like manufactured goods, until the United States and Europe solve their differences.
Administration officials expressed frustration with Mr. Kohl last week, saying that he had promised two years ago to press the French for concessions on trade but had failed to deliver.
Mr. Kohl said today that he "will give a full report of these two days of talks" to other European leaders, "and we will once again try to find out where there is further room for negotiations."
The two leaders also agreed to work with other Western nations at the Munich summit talks toward what Mr. Kohl called a "help for self-help" for Russia and the other former Soviet republics: technical assistance on problems ranging from unproductive farms to antiquated transportation networks to nuclear-reactor safety.
That advice would supplement the international financial aid now being assembled to stabilize Russia's currency and finance new development, he said. And both aid packages would replace the hastily organized relief missions and injections of money that have kept the former Soviet states from collapsing further this winter.
Mr. Kohl also said that he and Mr. Bush agree on the importance of the summit meeting on environmental problems scheduled for June in Rio de Janiero. At the meeting, developing nations are expected to resist requests by the West to curb industrial pollution and to take other costly steps to combat global warming and depletion of the Earth's protective ozone layer.
The Administration had sought until recently to discount the need for the session. Mr. Bush's first chief of staff, John Sununu, was openly skeptical of claims that some environmental problems were reaching a crisis, and the White House had reduced Mr. Bush's public involvement in foreign affairs after charges that he was paying too little attention to domestic issues.

HEADLINE: White House Sees a Mission to Cut Business Rules

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 22

 BODY:
Saying that the tax-cut measures passed by Congress will not revive economic growth, the Bush Administration has aggressively turned to measures that would lighten the Government's regulatory burden, an area where it has considerable ability to act on its own.
It is not clear whether deregulation, an idea held in some disrepute as a result of the 1980's disaster in the savings and loan industry, has broad political appeal. But the Administration seems to have decided that at minimum it can be used to portray President Bush as a man with a domestic, perhaps even an ideological, program. 
 The drive began in earnest in late January when the President announced in his State of the Union Message a 90-day moratorium on new regulations and a "top-to-bottom review of all regulations, old and new, to stop the ones that will hurt growth and speed up those that will help growth."
 
Cost of Regulation
 There is no doubt that Administration policy makers have begun a concerted drive on what they regard as the over-regulation of American business. Federal regulation alone is estimated to cost as much as $400 billion a year, one-quarter of this for paperwork by large and small businesses.
In the process, a novel theory is being advanced that could vastly expand the scope of cost-benefit analysis, a component of the regulatory process first required by an executive order of President Gerald R. Ford and later strengthened by Presidents Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan.
But the task is complicated by Mr. Bush's own recent record. Though as Vice President in the 1980's he promoted deregulation, as President he supported many of the laws under which the current explosion of new rules is being carried out.
And not even the White House says that the effort will have more than a negligible effect on the economy in the short term, probably nothing even measurable in national output during 1992.
 
'Just the Beginning'
 Yet early results of these reviews are now tumbling from departments and agencies and the pains the Administration is taking to spread and promote them shows that the White House sees deregulation as important.
"This is just the beginning," C. Boyden Gray, the White House counsel and a longtime Bush aide, said Thursday in helping unveil the Agriculture Department's list of 13 initiatives that range from a one-year postponement of nutrition-labeling requirements for meat and poultry to the announced intention to limit appeals of resource-management decisions by the Forest Service.
The Administration regards allowing flexibility in implementing and meeting regulations as important as deregulation itself. Some measures taken or proposed recently are:
*A set of initiatives in transportation that includes creation of a cash-for-clunkers program under which businesses and state and local governments can comply with clean-air standards by buying and scrapping old motor vehicles that cause the most pollution.
*A package of measures announced by Mr. Bush in Oklahoma City designed to aid the depressed natural gas industry.
*Proposals by the Securities and Exchange Commission to make it easier for small companies to sell stock and to make it easier for mutual funds to invest in new companies.
One of the most important actions, though not so clearly deregulatory since it involved a choice between two methods of controlling pollution during refueling, was the Administration's decision announced four days before the Michigan primary that requires special gasoline pumps rather than the installation of additional equipment on new cars.
The biggest potential challenge to the current regulatory system is one that questions the very basis on which rules are constructed. One of the most influential Administration policy makers, James B. MacRae Jr., Acting Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, now contends that the assessment of any new rule must consider compliance costs for workers as well as employers.
In suspending his consideration of air contaminant standards proposed by the Labor Department, Mr. MacRae said it was well established that poor people are less healthy than rich people. Thus, he said, if regulations impose such costs on employers that they reduce pay or jobs, workers might be worse off with the regulation than without it.
This proposition, reportedly to be applied to all Federal agencies, prompted immediate protest among Congressional Democrats, with Senator Edward M. Kennedy, chairman of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, calling it "deregulation ideology run amok."
 
Industry Wish Lists
 Meanwhile, as agencies debate which pending regulations might be exempt from the moratorium because they involving health and safety or are subject to legislated deadlines or court orders, business groups have responded to the renewed opportunity to make the case against proposals they believe ill-conceived.
The Aerospace Industries Association, for example, sent to the Federal Aviation Administration a list of scores of issues that it said would save airplane makers $43.1 billion over 10 years if properly addressed.
One proposal to which it objected would require airframes to be strong enough to withstand the strike of an eight-pound bird instead of a four-pound bird, a requirement it said was not supported by experience.
 
Admission of Error?
 The National Federation of Independent Business, meanwhile, was busy campaigning against another Government proposal to make employers liable for accidents in which their employees failed to buckle seat belts.
In addition to complaints from liberals, the Administration faces skeptics among conservatives.
William A. Niskanen, a Reagan Administration official who now heads the Cato Institute, a conservative research and advocacy group in Washington, said he questioned whether there would be any lasting benefit from the moratorium because Mr. Bush had endorsed much of the environmental, personal disability and other legislation that gave rise to fresh batches of rules.
To be credible, Mr. Niskanen said, the President "has to acknowledge publicly that at least some segments of laws he's endorsed might require amendment," an admission or error similar to one he made about raising taxes.

HEADLINE: SALE OF PLUTONIUM BY RUSSIA TO U.S. FACES UNSEEN SNAG

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
A $6 million deal is being blocked within the United States Government, in which the Energy Department would buy plutonium 238 from Russia and fashion it into nuclear batteries for American deep-space probes and other purposes, Federal and industry experts say.
American stocks of plutonium 238 are running low. If no other supply is found, a prohibition of the purchase could in time derail plans for a new fleet of American spacecraft to explore the heavens. 
 The plutonium sale is one of a number of deals that have been blocked by the Administration in attempts to prevent Russia's military-industrial complex from posing any future threat to the United States, in this case by starving it of revenue. Other blocked sales involve Russian rocket engines, space reactors and other aerospace items.
 
Stabilizing Effect of Sales
 Critics say import restrictions should be lessened or ended to help stabilize the Russian economy, prevent a relapse of totalitarianism and discourage Russian scientists, engineers and technicians from leaving for jobs in the third world.
The White House is said to be considering an increase in aid to Russia and a relaxation of some East-West trade restrictions, under which import curbs might eventually be eased.
The case of the plutonium 238 has a human dimension, as well. Russian officials and workers, desperate for hard currency, quickly went to work and made the material even before a contract was signed, experts said. To date, they have not been paid.
Negotiations for the $6 million deal got under way in 1989 and were all but completed in 1991 when they were suddenly halted, Federal experts said. For nearly a year, the deal has been in bureaucratic limbo.
The Energy Department's current budget request to Congress says the "analysis of this purchase is completed and is currently under active review within the Administration."
In an interview, William H. Young, Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Energy, declined to say where in the Government the deal was being scrutinized. "I can't get into some things," he said. "There are various parts of the Government that are involved and have an interest."
He insisted that there had been no breakdown in negotiations, adding, "We're still considering the possibility."
But Ned S. Rasor, an industry consultant in Cupertino, Calif., who helped advance the plutonium 238 negotiations with the Russians, recently wrote to Senator Sam Nunn, Democrat of Georgia and chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, complaining that the deal was "being blocked" by the Administration.
The purchase, Dr. Rasor said, would be of "great fiscal advantage to the U.S." and "immediately assist stabilization of a democratic Russia."
 
'Moving Slowly'
 A Federal official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the purchase has been reviewed by various Government agencies -- including the National Security Agency, the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Council at the White House. "It's moving slowly," he said. "But I'm still hopeful it will take place."
All such deals have hit a roadblock, leading some experts outside government to speculate that a secret directive may ban such trade. Publicly, the Defense and State Departments have warned that American purchases of Russian high-technology goods could strengthen the military muscle of a former adversary.
John P. Boright, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Scientific Affairs, said at a Congressional hearing on Feb. 21 that the United States had to be "cautious not to inadvertently support organizations and capabilities that could represent a future threat."
The plutonium 238 for sale by the Russians is a radioactive isotope that naturally emits heat, which can be turned into electrical power. A different isotope, plutonium 239, is used to build nuclear bombs. Neither substance is found in nature. Both are produced in nuclear reactors, though by different means.
 
Major Space-Project Uses
 Compact power sources made with plutonium 238 are often called nuclear batteries, or, technically, radio-isotope thermoelectric generators. By whatever name, dozens of them have used in the nation's space program over the decades. They have powered lunar and Martian probes as well as the current Galileo mission to Jupiter.
Nuclear batteries are seen as essential to making electricity in the far reaches of the solar system, where sunlight is too dim to activate solar-power panels.
American supplies of plutonium 238 for such batteries are running low because of safety and environmental problems with the Federal Government's aging nuclear reactors, which have been shut down for years.
Plutonium 238 was last made in 1984. Since 1989, reactors at the Energy Department's Savannah River plant in South Carolina that could make more have been under repair. The K-Reactor there, when it is started back up again, perhaps next year, is scheduled to make tritium for nuclear weapons.
 
Alternatives Would Take Time
 Mr. Young of the Energy Department said it had no plans to make plutonium at Savannah River, and that the only domestic alternatives for plutonium 238 production were modifying a reactor in Idaho or refurbishing one in Washington state, neither of which could be accomplished before the turn of the century.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration needs nuclear batteries made of plutonium 238 for future projects like the Cassini mission to Saturn, a Neptune probe, a Pluto fly-by, a comet sampling mission, a Mars lander and a Mars sampling mission, agency officials said.
In addition to such uses, intelligence agencies need nuclear batteries for spying. In the 1960's, the batteries powered electronic listening devices atop the Himalayas aimed at China. Today, the Navy is said to use them for undersea eavesdropping.
The United States now has about 130 pounds of plutonium 238 on hand and needs about 300 pounds through 1999, according to Energy Department documents. Needs will rise dramatically if proposed NASA missions are approved by Congress.
"Things are building toward a crisis or a collapse," said Steven Aftergood, a plutonium 238 expert at the Federation of American Scientists, a private group in Washington.
 
Soviet Security Concerns, Too
 With shortages threatened, Energy Department officials in 1989 began looking into the purchase of plutonium 238 from the Soviet Union, Federal and industry experts said.
A Soviet nuclear expert, meeting in August of that year with an Energy Department official in Washington, was skeptical, saying such a deal was probably doomed because of the plutonium's potential use in espionage. But by October, the Soviets had relented and given their tentative approval.
At a May 1990 meeting in Moscow at the Ministry of Atomic Power and Industry, Energy Department experts, including one from its laboratory in Los Alamos, N.M., said the United States was initially interested in 11 pounds. They asked for a free sample first to vnalyze the plutonium's purity.
The Soviets agreed. They also said that as much as 44 pounds of plutonium 238 could be produced for sale to the United States each year.
A free sample of 20 grams -- less than an ounce and valued at about $24,000 -- was delivered to Los Alamos in 1991 and found to be of high quality.
 
Change of Signals
 The deal went sour in April 1991. At a Washington meeting, Robert G. Lange, head of the Energy Department's nuclear battery program, told startled Soviet officials that the department was no longer authorized to negotiate the purchase.
A Soviet official paused.
"I want you to understand that the people who produced this in the Soviet Union have not been paid, and will not be paid, until we receive payment from you," the official said, according to American participants at the meeting.
Later, the Soviets lowered their price to just over $545,000 a pound. The initial 11 pounds would sell for $6 million.
Since then, Energy Department officials have conducted no more negotiations while saying that they are still considering the purchase. Mr. Lange, in a talk in Albuquerque in January, outlined planned space missions, the impending shortage and the possibility of the United States' buying plutonium from Russia.
 
U.S. Officials Uncommunicative
 "As long as man has the desire and the will to explore the solar system," he said, "plutonium 238 power systems must be used."
No Administration official has publicly stated the specific objections to the deal. One may be that money paid to Russia could be used to rebuild the military complex there.
Dr. Rasor, the American consulting negotiator, said in his letter to Senator Nunn that the Russians have been willing to consider safeguards to insure that the American purchase "will not support capabilities that could represent a future threat."
He added, though, that he had been unable to "present the availability of such safeguards to the blocking policy makers, since it has been impossible to identify them."

HEADLINE: Trenton Moves to Reclaim Old Factories Left for Dead

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, March 22

 BODY:
They can be seen on the outskirts of any city from Baltimore to Boston, the acres of jumbled brick and cinder-block factory buildings, industrial ghost towns as much as any abandoned Rocky Mountain mining camp, their windows broken and dark, smokestacks cold, loading yards choked with weeds.
Some of them, favored by location or architectural detail, have been converted into glossy upscale shopping arcades, like Oil City, the once dingy refinery on the Onandaga waterfront in Syracuse. Others, like the former American Bank Note Company in the South Bronx, have been recycled into industrial incubators for small businesses. 
 But most remain empty hulks, abandoned by their owners and so contaminated by industrial pollutants that cities decline even to foreclose on them for fear of being burdened with responsibility for cleaning them up.
Now the City of Trenton has begun a pioneering effort to conduct a formal inventory of the dozens of old factories where the city's famous steel and ceramics were once produced. The program is being watched by other cities in the state, both because of Trenton's move to determine the environmental risks of reopening some of the sites, and because the initiative represents a break with the traditional reliance on private real-estate brokers to find occupants for the old buildings.
The recession in manufacturing jobs in Trenton is testimony to slow results of waiting for the private market to act. In Trenton, lighted letters on the old U.S. Highway 1 bridge across the Delaware River still boast, "Trenton Makes The World Takes," but even the mighty Roebling Works, where the cables for the Brooklyn Bridge were spun, is mostly silent, its head office building taken over by the Mercer County administration.
 
Similar Studies
 "It's time to stop talking about how awful this is," said James T. Harveson, the Trenton director of economic development. "We have to get going and find out what we have, because the market is so uncertain that private investors don't even want to put any money in to find out what's here."
The Northeast/Midwest Institute, a research organization sponsored by members of Congress from 18 states in those regions, has also begun a study on the re-use of old factory buildings, while the recently enacted Federal Surface Transportation Act includes a small fund to help similar studies.
The Trenton initiative aims to address one of the most vexing obstacles to recycling old factories: the extent of pollution at sites that may have been used for numerous industrial processes, under several owners, since being built at the turn of the century.
New Jersey's Environmental Cleanup Responsibility Act, which is regarded as the toughest state pollution cleanup law in the country, requires the owner of an industrial site to rid it of any contamination before selling it or shutting down operations. When it was enacted in 1986, the law was expected to make it easier to recycle old factories into new ones by assuring buyers that they would not get stuck with an expensive cleanup.
But the costs of removing tons of contaminated material have proven to be so high, and the market for old buildings so slow, that Mayor Douglas H. Palmer of Trenton told a state Senate hearing this week that the law was having the opposite effect.
"In the last five years, we have had less than 10 sales of industrial properties in the city of Trenton," he told the Senate Environmental Committee on Thursday. Moreover, he said, 80 percent of the land in the city's industrial zone, along Highway 1, "isn't worth a dime."
"It has been rendered valueless because cleanup costs are more than the property is worth," he said. There is even a handful of abandoned buildings, their last owners long since vanished in a fog of succeeding mergers and bankruptcies, that the city has refused to take back for taxes out of concern for its own liability.
 
Liability Concerns
 "We don't want them," Mr. Harveson said. "We won't touch them until we have some sense of what we're getting into."
Mayor Palmer urged the Legislature to modify the law by, among other things, creating a fund to help cities clean up properties, and protecting them from the law's penalties.
New York does not have a similar cleanup responsibility law, said Madeline Gallo, a spokeswoman for the New York Department of Environmental Conservation. Connecticut requires disclosure of the presence of contamination when an industrial site is sold, but no cleanup is required.
Alfred I. Faiella, head of the Newark economic development office, cited the old Arkansas Chemical Company building on Foundry Street as an example of a property abandoned because of the potential cost of cleaning it up. "They just walked away," he said. "We took it for taxes."
One of Newark's finest old factories, the Murphy Varnish Company building in the Ironbound section, looms like an abandoned Georgian country mansion over the industrial landscape. Signs on its boarded-up exterior seem to anticipate the end of the still privately owned building: they alert firefighters to flammable materials on each floor.
The old factories do have one advantage that economic development officials stress: because they are located in old industrial zones, they are away from housing areas whose residents may raise objections to a new factory as a neighbor. But they also suffer defects besides the potential environmental problems.
"The ceilings are too low, there are too many columns, there are multiple floors instead of having everything on one level," said Stephen M. Segal, a Trenton broker of industrial real estate. "And typically, they have been added on to many times, with the oldest and most obsolete and most difficult to use section in front, and the newer parts in the back."
That is why, Mr. Segal and others pointed out, it has been easier for economic development officials to work with big, single-ownership industrial sites than the patchwork of numerous separate properties of the kind that face Trenton officials.
Thus, the New Haven Economic Development Corporation, a nonprofit city-sponsored concern, started in the early 1980's a public-private effort to turn the old Winchester rifle works into the million-square-foot Science Park, where 100 small companies employ 1,200 workers.
Mr. Harveson says he thinks the same approach, attracting many small companies employing a handful of employees each, instead of trying to snare one big corporation to move into town, is wisest for Trenton.
"That's not how America works anymore," he said. "The new jobs are in small businesses."

HEADLINE: Courthouse Is a Citadel No Longer: U.S. Judges Curb Environmentalists

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 22

 BODY:
In the two decades since a burst of legislation to protect natural resources and wild habitats, environmental groups have often turned to the Federal courts to force the Government to comply with the laws or to expand the reach of regulations.
But environmentalists no longer consider the Federal courthouse a friendly citadel. In case after case, judges are deciding to throw out environmental and safety regulations or limit the effect of Federal laws. 
 The judges have ruled on grounds both substantive and procedural: that a law requires that regulations be cost-efficient; that an agency did not have authority to impose a regulation, or had not established adequate scientific basis for it, or that the plaintiffs simply had no standing to sue. Federal judges are also interpreting traditional doctrines on standing and jurisdiction to make it more difficult for environmental groups to sue in the first place.
Supporters of the new direction say they are pleased that Federal judges are finally listening to their argument that too many of the Government's environmental rules are based on insufficient scientific evidence and that their costs far outweigh the benefits.
 
Harm With the Good?
 "What the White House and the courts are now deciding is that regulations not only have potential to do good, they have the potential to do harm, and not just economic harm but actual harm to public health and the environment," said Fred L. Smith Jr., the president of the Competitive Enterprise Institute in Washington.
Last month, the institute won one of the cases cited as part of the new trend -- a case against the Transportation Department in which the institute showed that lighter and smaller vehicles designed to comply with rules for making cars more fuel-efficient resulted in 2,000 to 4,000 more highway deaths every year.
But environmentalists see the rulings as closing the door to one of the most important Government forums for advancing their cause. Albert H. Meyerhoff, a senior lawyer in San Francisco for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said: "The courts traditionally have been the last refuge where we could seek relief from environmental pollution and for health protections. More and more, we're seeing the courts are unavailable for us.
There have been five major rulings in the past year, on regulations affecting such issues as water pollution, asbestos and conservation, that point to the courts' new direction.
 
Weeding Out the Rules
 The rulings are coming as President Bush is mounting a coordinated attack on environmental and health regulations that he says are smothering innovation and hampering the creation of new jobs. In January, the President announced that his Administration would temporarily bar new regulations and conduct a 90-day review intended to eliminate or weaken existing rules. Unable for the most part to afford public works projects and other election-year gifts, the President has made eliminating the rules a centerpiece of his economic policy.
In the last three weeks, the Administration has eliminated a proposal that would have required automobile manufacturers to install new air pollution-control devices. It blocked a Labor Department proposal to reduce exposure to toxic chemicals in the workplace, and it sided with the coal industry in a suit the industry hopes will weaken strip mining regulations.
An Administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity described the White House's efforts as a reasonable and intelligent response to a troubled economy. "What's driving this is simply that too much regulation does have the effect of decreasing economic growth and lowering the number of jobs," the official said.
 
Sharp Words From Reilly
 William K. Reilly, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, who is often at odds with some members of the Administration, was more critical. He said the courts were "second-guessing" regulations that protect environment and health.
"If this second-guessing becomes a trend in judicial decisions, the upshot may well be to reinforce Congress's temptation to prohibit any calculation of cost, no matter how small the risk or how great the expense," he said.
Both critics and supporters of the rulings say the judicial record being established by the Federal courts is an inevitable result of a decade of appointments of conservatives. Presidents Bush and Ronald Reagan made the selection of judges one of their most important tasks. Of the 714 district, appellate and Supreme Court judges now on the Federal bench, more than half were appointed by the two Presidents, according to the Alliance for Justice, a liberal legal group in Washington. There are 123 vacancies, and 30 to 40 judges are expected to retire soon.
Many judges say that a better solution to environmental and health problems is economic policies that encourage industrial modernization. Conservative economic theorists say greater wealth is the key to improving a nation's environment and health of its people. Two Supreme Court Justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, back this view. Other judges who have become advocates of less regulation are Alex Kozinski of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, in California, and Frank H. Easterbrook of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, in Illinois.
 
Some Victories Recorded
 By no means are the courts sweeping all environmentalists out the door. In the Northwest, environmentalists have been successful in persuading two District Court judges to halt the cutting of stands of ancient forests of spruce and Douglas fir. And District Courts around the country have backed suits by the Natural Resources Defense Council and other groups demanding that the Energy Department obey Federal environmental and safety laws at its nuclear weapons plants.
"You don't get ideologues everywhere across the country," said Brian O'Neill, a lawyer in Minneapolis who works for Defenders of Wildlife, which has a case pending in the Supreme Court that tests whether the Endangered Species Act applies to Government actions overseas. "In our circuit, the Eighth Circuit, environmental groups get a fair shake even with conservative panels. That's why we bring cases here, because we think we get a fairer hearing than we would on the East and West coasts."
But environmental lawyers say they are nevertheless very concerned about the trends. Earlier this month, the Supreme Court decided in favor of Arkansas's right to set weaker water pollution-control standards than Oklahoma. Oklahoma had sued, arguing that water flowing into the state from Arkansas violated Oklahoma's stricter pollution standards. Arkansas argued successfully that its standards, the minimum allowed by the environmental agency, were valid.
Last month, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that the 1990 Federal fuel economy standard for automobiles needed to be reconsidered. The Competitive Enterprise Institute and Consumer Alert, two free market groups here, argued successfully that in forcing automakers to design lighter, smaller, fuel-efficient cars, the Department of Transportation must take into account the broader safety effects of the rules. The groups expect that a new standard will allow bigger, less fuel-efficient cars.
 
Better 'Balance' Is Seen
 "If a corporation caused 20 deaths a year there would be outcry, Congressional hearings, front-page stories blasting the fact that private self interests had endangered public health," said Fred Smith, the institute's president. "But when a Government action results in 2,000 deaths per year, we have no hearings, no comment and a passive reaction. There is a lack of balance here that is not producing an honest debate on regulation. Finally, the debate that has been in intellectual forums for 20 years is now moving into the courts."
In December, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit threw out 12-year-old regulations set by the E.P.A. to control disposal of some wastes the Government considered hazardous. Shell Oil and more than a dozen other companies argued that most of the debris covered by the rules was ash or mill wastes that were not dangerous.
But in classifying them as hazardous the Government was forcing companies to spend hundreds of millions of dollars for disposal in special landfills where space for truly dangerous hazardous wastes was running out. In vacating the regulations, the Appeals Court said the environmental agency had not given industries a chance to comment before they were issued.
In October, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, overturned a 1989 rule by the environmental agency that banned almost all products containing asbestos, a known carcinogen. The court said the agency had not considered the safety consequences of banning asbestos from such products as brake lining. Nor, the court said, had the agency considered less costly changes in the regulations. The court also criticized the cost of the ban. It said that for every theoretical case of cancer the agency thought it was preventing, the country would spent $2.2 million to $5.4 million.
 
Dismay and Elation
 The ruling dismayed Mr. Reilly of the environmental agency. "The decision to overturn a rule based on 10 years of very careful research and analysis is at odds with my concept of judicial restraint," Mr. Reilly said in an interview.
But William Laffer, a lawyer and regulatory expert for the Heritage Foundation, a public policy research group in Washington, hailed the rulings as "a splendid thing."
"What we have developed is a bizarre, amazingly complex web of Federal regulations which don't deal with protection of property or lives, but are concerned with making people and businesses jump through hoops," he said.
Philip M. Hocker, president of the Mineral Policy Center, a Washington environmental group, differed: "John Kenneth Galbraith once said, 'People always want what they don't have.' People wanted environmental protection but did not fully realize that could only be achieved by stopping the damage. That is painful because the damage was created for business profit."

HEADLINE: Albany Talks Still Clogged Over Budget

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 22

 BODY:
Although state leaders worked feverishly through the weekend, the prospects for a timely budget remained highly uncertain today because of a continuing impasse over how to wring more than $1 billion in savings from New York's Medicaid and welfare programs.
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and the state's legislative leaders met here this afternoon for the eighth consecutive day, with only nine days separating them from the start of the fiscal year on April 1. But they again failed to strike an accord on the complex and politically charged issues of Medicaid and welfare, which they have been debating since November. 
 While Mr. Cuomo and the legislative leaders sometimes emerge from their private negotiating sessions with reassuring pronouncements, there were no signs of optimism today.
"The Legislature, despite the lateness of the hour, has no real sense of urgency," Mr. Cuomo lamented. "They're having difficulty making even the simplest decisions."
Edward Martin, an aide to the State Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, Republican of Oyster Bay, L.I., said, "There seemed to be a little backward movement today on Medicaid."
The Democrats who control the Assembly and the Republicans who hold a majority in the Senate have yet to announce agreement on any of a wide variety of measures being considered to produce savings from Medicaid and welfare.
They include limiting the menu of health-care services covered by Medicaid for the able-bodied poor and restricting the number of hours that Medicaid would pay for personal-care attendants who cook, clean and shop for homebound patients.
 
To Fight Welfare Fraud
 The negotiators are still arguing about measures aimed at deterring people from moving to New York to qualify for higher welfare benefits. They also are discussing a proposal to fight welfare fraud by fingerprinting and photographing recipients, an idea valued more for its symbolism than for its dollars.
The leaders continue to discuss whether Medicaid recipients should be charged nominal fees for medical services, whether they should increase taxes on the revenues of hospitals and nursing homes, and whether commercial insurers should have to pay higher reimbursement rates to health-care providers in order to improve the competitive position of the struggling Blue Cross-Blue Shield network.
In a reflection of the difficulty of doing business in a divided Legislature, there are real ideological differences on these issues between the Assembly Democrats and the Senate Republicans. And the differences have been reinforced this year by the uncertainties of a looming election in which welfare has become a defining national political issue.
The Assembly Democrats hope to minimize the pain inflicted on the state's welfare and Medicaid recipients, the bulk of whom live in New York City, the base of the Democrats' power. Assembly Speaker Saul Weprin's negotiating room is limited by political discord within his own house, where 31 of the 95 Assembly Democrats have called for higher income taxes on the wealthy as a way to offset cuts in social services. Mr. Weprin, Mr. Marino and Mr. Cuomo have pledged to avoid significant tax increases in an election year.
The Senate Republicans hope to protect nursing homes, hospitals and insurance companies, some of which are struggling to survive in a recessionary economy.
Mr. Cuomo, in trying to broker a compromise, has been criticized by both sides. The Democratic Governor has been assailed by Assembly Democrats for conceding too much to the Republicans because of his obsession with a timely budget. The Senate Republicans have complained that Mr. Cuomo has not done enough to bring his fellow Democrats along.
The Governor, who says he abandoned a Presidential campaign to stay in Albany and work on the budget, has pressured the Legislature to meet the April 1 date by describing the consequences of failure in near-apocalyptic terms. He has warned that Wall Street is likely to lower the state's credit rating for the second time this year, potentially to junk-bond status, and has said disgusted voters will hold incumbent legislators accountable in November.
Mr. Marino and Mr. Weprin also have stressed the importance of meeting the deadline after missing it for seven consecutive years. But as is customary in Albany, where political deadlines are used to extract concessions, it is clear that if an agreement is to be reached on time, it will be as the bells are tolling.
Medicaid and welfare are not the only issues keeping negotiators from closing the $4.8 billion gap in a projected $30 billion budget. Always mindful that it is an election year, Mr. Marino and Mr. Weprin still hope to soften the $240 million cut that Mr. Cuomo has proposed in the state's $8.5 billion education budget. They also hope to find money for pork-barrel "member's items" for legislators to take back to their districts.
They continue to examine new revenue proposals, like a video lottery game that none of the three leaders has either rejected or claimed as his proposal. They must also decide whether to raise the state's bonding authority for housing construction and they must shore up a transit financing plan whose political support has deteriorated in the week since it was disclosed.
But negotiators on all sides of the budget debate agree that if they can reach their goal of saving $1.1 billion from Medicaid and welfare, the other elements are most likely to fall into place.
 
Complex Discussion
 At the negotiating table, the ideological debate between the Senate and the Assembly has been translated into a complex policy discussion.
On the issue of whether Medicaid recipients should make co-payments for their health-care services, negotiators say they are stalled on the question of whether a patient should be required to pay $5 on each of the first five days of hospitalization, as the Assembly Democrats believe, or pay $25 on the first day, as the Senate Republicans and Mr. Cuomo believe.
In trying to keep people from moving to New York to collect higher welfare benefits, the Senate Republicans have proposed paying newcomers either 75 percent of New York's benefits or 100 percent of their prior state's benefits, whichever is lower, for their first year in New York. Mr. Cuomo has proposed paying 80 percent of New York's benefits or 100 percent of the prior state's benefits, whichever is higher, for the first six months. The Assembly Democrats do not like either plan.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Will Recovery Stumble Over Long-Term Rates?

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
Now that everyone agrees that the economy has made some recent gains, economists are arguing over whether long-term interest rates -- which determine how much it costs to build a factory or finance a three-bedroom ranch house -- will head higher or lower.
Take the spirited exchange recently at the World Economy Lab, a new forum in Cambridge, Mass., where executives from Wall Street, banking and industry can mingle with some of the brightest lights of the economics department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
 Rudiger Dornbusch, one of the department's international economists, set off sparks by confidently predicting that rates on long-term Government bonds would fall a percentage point or two.
That brought sharp responses. "I've been listening to guys like you, and now I've got egg all over my face," said Scott Pardee, co-chairman of Yamaichi International (America) Inc. Mr. Pardee, a former Federal Reserve official, had apparently predicted that bond yields would decline to 7 percent by year-end just weeks before they jumped from 7.5 percent to more than 8 percent.
But Mr. Dornbusch was not impressed. "The same people misread the rise of inflation in the early 1970's, seeing it as a little run-up in an overheated economy not a permanent change," he said.
 
Rates Seen as High
 Both sides of the debate agree that long-term rates are high by any measure, especially in relationship to short-term rates and to inflation, which has recently been around 3 percent. Long-term rates are even higher abroad, especially in Europe.
If investors do bid up rates in coming months, the higher borrowing costs could dampen the housing recovery, reduce public and private investment and productivity growth, and drag out the much-needed repair of business and consumer balance sheets.
Part of what makes rates notoriously difficult to forecast is that investors, not the Federal Reserve, control how much the United States Treasury, blue-chip companies or home buyers must pay to borrow. The Fed can manipulate short-term rates by adjusting bank reserves or the rates it charges member banks, but it can only influence rates at the long end indirectly.
Optimists base their expectations of declining rates chiefly on an optimistic outlook for inflation, a trend that one Federal Reserve governor recently called the "major unreported economic story."
Fixed-income investors like low inflation because they can earn a positive return. "Domestic inflation expectations are the primary determinant of long-term interest rates," said Lawrence Kudlow, chief economist at Bear, Stearns & Company.
 
Low Inflation Pressure
 Mr. Dornbusch asserts, "There are no signs anywhere of accelerating inflation." The idea is that when the truth finally dawns on investors, bonds will stage another rally and rates will drop again.
For starters, higher unemployment is reining in wage increases and productivity growth has picked up, offsetting part of the rise in wages and benefits with higher output per hour.
Commodity prices, including gold, remain weak and, given excess capacity, are apt to remain so. And oil prices are also likely to remain stable.
"For three years, gold prices have been trending down and the money supply has been growing, on average, 4 percent a year," Mr. Kudlow said. "That's not the stuff of rising inflation."
But the pessimists who foresee higher rates are not necessarily fretting about a resurgence of inflation. Instead, they worry that the demand for money to invest will strain the supply of savings, especially because the $400 billion Federal deficit is swallowing so much private saving.
"The fiscal deficit is very large and very punishing," Mr. Pardee said. "So the Treasury continues to dominate the market week in and week out."
Things are even worse than at the beginning of the 1980's, this camp contends. "The budget deficit is much bigger and the trade deficit is much smaller," said Rimmer DeVries, former chief economist at Morgan Guaranty. "So a much bigger share of the budget deficit must be financed domestically."
 
'A Weak Government'
 And most economists doubt that Washington has the will to bring the deficit to heel. "We have a weak Government, and any Government we are likely to get will be weak," said Charles Kindleberger, an emeritus professor of economics at M.I.T.
Demand for new credit is not just coming from Washington but also from corporations eager to refinance in order to enhance their credit ratings and households who wish to lower their monthly mortgage payments. The fact that a lot of potential borrowers are waiting in the wings is putting pressure on rates.
The pressure on a limited pool of savings is not limited to the United States. "Rates are increasingly driven by global investment opportunities and the overall willingness of nations to save," said Robert Barro, a Harvard economist.
Deficits are growing overseas as well, said David Wyss, chief financial economist at DRI/McGraw Hill, an economic forecasting firm in Lexington, Mass. Unification with the former East Germany has pushed Germany's budget deficit from a small surplus to a $30 billion deficit. Now German rates on 10-year bonds are slightly higher than American rates, 7.9 percent versus 7.6 percent.
On the other hand, demand for money to invest is likely to be greater than in the 1980's. "Tremendous demand is coming from outside the G-7 countries -- Mexico, Southeast Asia, East Germany and Kuwait, " Mr. Wyss said, referring to the Group of Seven leading industrial nations.
Mr. Dornbusch dismisses the notion of a capital shortage. "The investment opportunities are wonderful, but the investment isn't taking place," he said. "Russia needs lots of capital. So does Africa. Nobody is going to give it to them."

HEADLINE: Trade Mission of Sorts Finds Hartford Lawmakers Roughing It in Las Vegas

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS, Nev., March 22

 BODY:
Would gambling in Hartford create a seedy environment rife with flesh peddling, debauchery and lawlessness? A group of Connecticut legislators decided it was their duty to come and take a close look.
"This may seem glamorous to some," said Reginald G. Beamon, a Democratic State Representative from Waterbury, who also attended a trade mission in Taipei last year. "But to me, it's just part of the job." 
 Mr. Beamon and four other Connecticut lawmakers came to the glitzy, neon-blazing strip at the invitation of Stephen A. Wynn, the president and chairman of Mirage Resorts, which owns the Mirage Casino Hotel and two Golden Nugget casinos here. He has proposed building a $350 million casino and convention center in Hartford.
The notion of a casino in Connecticut's capital has provoked some moral outrage in the state, where the economy has long flourished on building M-16 rifles, the Seawolf attack submarine and the Colt .45.
 
'Land of Steady Habits'
 In Connecticut, which calls itself the Land of Steady Habits, residents can already bet on the lottery, greyhounds and jai alai and at the new casino on the Mashantucket Pequot reservation in Ledyard. But Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. has vowed to veto any bill that permits a casino off the reservation, even though promoters say it would create 4,000 jobs.
"It's the hypocrisy that bothers me most," said Mr. Wynn, a gregarious man with a gleaming smile, an even tan and a careful coiffure.
The delegation included State Representative Gabriel J. Biafore, a Democrat of Bridgeport; State Representative Richard Foley Jr., a Republican of Oxford; State Senator Louis C. DeLuca, a Republican of Woodbury; and State Senator Frank D. Barrows, a Democrat of Hartford. Except for Mr. Foley, who paid his way, the legislators were guests of the casino.
The tour was intended to show that gambling is only one part of a mix of wholesome entertainment. At the upscale Mirage, the legislators saw dolphins, tigers and a magic show by Siegfried and Roy.
 
Lurid as an Airport
 While a few patrons wore outfits skimpy enough to warrant arrest in parts of the country, the casino promoters pointed to the legions of ordinary-looking people, some of them pushing baby strollers.
Mr. Foley, who said he had never visited a casino but had heard lurid accounts about the byproducts of gambling, looked across a room of gamblers that came in every size, shade and age. He said it reminded him of a crowd at an airport.
"These people don't look particularly perverted to me," he said. A moment later, he stepped across a flier on a sidewalk opened to a picture of a woman with a whip.
Earlier in the day, Mr. Foley had noticed a group of "working girls" in a casino down the street from the Mirage. "Not exactly what you'd see in Oxford," he said, referring to his small hometown.
But prostitution and drugs are hardly foreign to Connecticut. Mr. Foley said an aide recently told him he had watched a heroin deal just a block from the State Capitol.
Among the legislators here, only Mr. Biafore had made a decision. He was in favor of gambling. "I'd love to see this in Bridgeport," he said, as he walked past the jingling of coins in slot machines.
Mr. Biafore took the tour with his son, Paul, who works for another casino in Las Vegas, and his son's girlfriend, Jennifer Keeney, who works for the Mirage.
Mr. DeLuca, who acknowledged a passing interest in craps, said he would not gamble at the Mirage. "Just my luck I'd hit it big, and people would say it was fixed."
 
A Fortunate Recovery
 It was a long day. During a session of tax policy, investment strategies and demographics, Mr. DeLuca leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes for a long time.
He revived later that night, and shook the dice at the Sands. "We're going to do it! We're going to do it!" he shouted. And he did. Mr. DeLuca walked away with $80 extra. At the blackjack tables, Mr. Foley was not so lucky. He lost $40.
The Mirage, a neon-less hotel known for its tropical rain forest, tiger habitat, dolphin pond and a simulated volcano that erupts every 15 minutes, has 3,000 rooms and 7,000 workers.
Mr. Wynn played host to the politicians at a breakfast in one of the extravagent villa apartments reserved for his "special, special friends."
 
Cagney Impression
 After a spread that included pancakes Oscar and Nova Scotia lox, Mr. Wynn talked bitterly with legislators about his experiences in Atlantic City, where he once owned a casino.
"Those suckers in Trenton," Mr. Wynn called the New Jersey politicians. "Those dirty rats."
At a dinner in the casino on Saturday night to honor donors to the University of Las Vegas, the legislators were treated to roast loin of veal with shrimp and lobster cordon rouge. A program lauded the contributors to the school, who included Adnan Khashoggi, the arms dealer, the foundation of Michael R. Milken, the imprisoned financier, and scores of others, including Mr. Wynn and his wife, Elaine. The keynote speaker was Elizabeth H. Dole, the former United States Secretary of Labor and Secretary of Transportation.
The workers wore nameplates with their hometowns. And when the legislators saw a woman from Hartford, they rushed to her side with questions.
"I left Hartford eight years ago because there was nothing for me anymore," said Janice Jones, who works as a cashier in the casino. "Connecticut had better wise up and produce some jobs."
One of the casino promoters smiled with satisfaction, and said with a whisper, "That's the next employee of the month; I guarantee you that."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Television;
No More Summer Vacation for Networks

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER

 BODY:
Like millions of other hard-pressed Americans, most television programmers have come to the conclusion that they can't afford to take a summer vacation anymore.
And this summer, more new programs will be on television than ever before -- a radical change from the days when summer television was an unbroken line of reruns. 
 There was always a sound reason for a lack of originality in the summer. Reruns made -- and still make -- a lot of money for a network. The network pays producers for two runs of a series, sells commercials in each and usually covers the full cost of the show during the first run. That makes the rerun pure profit.
But too many reruns also tend to drive viewers away, and nobody can afford to do that anymore.
"We've been talking forever about getting new programs into the summer," said Perry Simon, NBC's executive vice president of programming.
Such talk has been generated by concerns about how many viewers have drifted away from the networks in previous summer months, both to cable channels and away from television entirely.
Two years ago, CBS made the first step toward making a stand by finding a way to acquire lower-cost programs as summer entries, in the hope that one might catch on and become successful all year round.
CBS actually doubled its expectations. Two summer series are now strong regular performers for the network, "Northern Exposure" and "Top Cops."
Last summer, however, proved how uncertain this process could be as CBS found no winners. But the network had already proved its point. Good programs could be broadcast for less money in the summer and then transplanted to the regular season. CBS pays only about two-thirds the standard license fee for a summer series, or about $700,000 an hour.
Summer shows are not necessarily cheaper to produce. The producers usually absorb more of a summer series' cost on the chance that they will create a show that will carry over to the regular season. The producers of "Northern Exposure," for example, cut every corner possible during the summer, but have since increased the production budget and the fees they charge CBS.
This summer, CBS plans to try at least five new series, and will also broadcast two original mini-series. Over all, CBS will spend an estimated $4 million to $5 million extra on its summer schedule.
"We view this as development money," said Steven Warner, the CBS vice president of programming who is charge of the summer projects. "We want the special attention that can be paid to a few new shows in the summer. We definitely do not go fishing in the summer."
Last summer, the Fox Broadcasting Company, which has always used the rerun season to draw attention to itself, decided to take its most promising new series, "Beverly Hills 90210," and start its new run in July rather than September.
The show's popularity has soared since then, and Fox executives believe the summer strategy was largely responsible. "We blazed a trail last summer," said Sandy Grushow, the executive vice president of the Fox Entertainment Group.
Fox argues that summer programs, especially those appealing to younger audiences, are economically sound because they can attract advertising that otherwise has nowhere to go. "There is a lot of advertising money out there," Mr. Grushow said. "The movie business is dying to reach young viewers in the summer."
Among Fox's goals this summer: adding a sixth night of programming.
One reason why this summer is certain to be the most heavily viewed in years is the presence of the huge attraction of the Summer Olympics on NBC the last week of July and the first week of August.
NBC will try to use the platform of the Olympics to pump up interest in two current comedies that the network believes have just started to catch on with viewers, "Seinfeld" and "Blossom."
Both shows will be heavily promoted during the Olympics and will come back on the air with new episodes the week after the games end.
NBC will also put on at least one and possibly two other new dramas immediately after the Olympics in the hope that they, too, will catch fire and can be extended directly into the fall.
Mr. Simon said NBC hoped to learn from the failure of CBS to transfer any of the huge audience it pulled in during the Winter Olympics to the new shows it promoted during the games. CBS mainly promoted two children's shows, "Scorch " and "Fish Police," which quickly proved to be dismal failures.
By concentrating on two series already on the air, NBC hopes that it will not be wasting a big promotional advantage as CBS did.
ABC plans a slightly different approach this summer. The network will mostly rely on a group of shows that it had initially intended to use for short runs in the spring. At least three of these will not be used by the time summer begins. So rather than hold onto them until the next television season, ABC will try to place them strategically this summer.
Just as the Winter Olympics on CBS in February helped drive up the overall viewing of the broadcast networks while pulling down viewing on cable channels for the first time, the Summer Olympics could help reverse the shift of summer viewers from the broadcast networks to cable channels, both network and cable executives believe.
"I think the networks will probably stop their summer slide this year," said Bob Maxwell, the vice president of research for Home Box Office."
That does not mean cable will concede to the networks, he said. Indeed, cable channels, who have come to regard summer as their strongest time of the year, plan special attractions of their own.
The pay cable channels, like HBO and Showtime, which have seen their base of subscribers erode significantly in the last several years, hope for a big turnaround this summer because so many recent hit movies including "Robin Hood" and "Terminator II" will come to cable, starting in June.
'It's going to be an unusual summer," Mr. Maxwell said. And Mr. Grushow added, "It's going to be interesting to see who does well and who gets hurt."

HEADLINE: City-Sized Trouble Sours Dairy-Town Life

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SUSSEX, N.J., March 18

 BODY:
Years back, tiny Sussex was the bustling commercial hub of the dairy industry in surrounding Wantage Township. But the farms are fading and Sussex's good fortunes are ebbing. Now, deep in the countryside of northwestern New Jersey, far from any urban center, it is wrestling with its own version of big-city woes.
The state has ordered the town's aging sewer plant replaced at a potential cost of $10 million. Sussex has to build a $2 million water filtration plant. And it faces a $1 million bill to rebuild a rickety dam so that Clove Lake, now a marshy shadow of its old self, can be refilled and residents can fish, swim and boat in it again. 
 Such costs are nothing to big-city mayors. But they are overwhelming for Sussex, where the municipal budget is just $1.2 million and blue-collar workers and the elderly, who are dominant in the population of 2,200, already grumble about being overtaxed.
Sussex, only three-quarters of a square mile, has no room left for big new taxable developments that would ease the residential tax burden. The town has already foreclosed on a former halfway house for discharged psychiatric patients and the land under a closed lumber yard for nonpayment of taxes. A 40-unit town house project, only a quarter complete, sits mostly weed-filled and empty on a hilltop, a victim of financing troubles.
Then there is the crime. Burglaries rose to 22 in 1990 from 7 in 1989; car thefts jumped to 19 from 12, and larcencies rose to 42 from 32.
Minuscule figures, certainly, compared to inner-city crime. But they help give Sussex the highest crime rate in its county, also named Sussex.
Sussex's population fell to 2,201 in the 1980's, down by 217, while surrounding Wantage Township, 68 square miles of fields and woods, grew to nearly 9,500 from 7,268. With growth came two new strip malls on Route 23. They are less than five miles south of Sussex's old business center and compete for its customers.
Experts say Sussex is not alone.
"We have a number of market towns or market centers that in an agricultural economy had very significant roles," said James W. Hughes, professor of urban planning at Rutgers University and director of the Rutgers Regional Report, which studies housing, demographics and the economy. "As the agricultural economy has waned, their historical function declined. Pre World War II, they were affluent parents. Now they're sort of destitute relatives. The great construction wave of the 1980's, the office building boom, bypassed these older centers. This is prototypical of the economic change that has swept through the region during the past generation."
Hovering over everything else here now is the takeover of the four-man police department by the Sussex County Prosecutor, Dennis O'Leary, at 1 A.M. on Feb. 29. He suspended the chief, Mark Van Engelen, and his three officers with pay, replacing them with county detectives and sheriff's deputies. No charges have been filed, and Mr. O'Leary has declined to discuss the reasons for the takeover or his investigation of the department, which is continuing.
A day before the takeover, members of the department removed 34 items from the police evidence room and burned them, including a marijuana plant and some small amounts of marijuana, in a hole near the public works garage. Mr. O'Leary's investigators dug up the site of the fire on March 6. He declined to discuss what if anything was found.
Chief Van Engelen's lawyer, Kevin Kelly, said the items that were burned were all from cases completed long ago. "None of the items involved pending cases or investigations," he said.
Mr. Kelly said the burning was done during the day, was videotaped and involved evidence in non-indictable offenses, some dating from the late 1970's. He said Mr. O'Leary's office approved the burning.
Mr. O'Leary said the question of permission was "in dispute," but declined to make any other comment. Mayor Peter Horvath and other town officials have refused to discuss the investigation.
But many merchants say the police takeover has cleared Main Street of what they variously call loiterers, bums, riffraff and "biker types.
To an outsider, Main Street looks pleasant and relatively prosperous, with a Chinese restaurant, appliance store, pharmacy, bank, jeweler, hobby store, newsstand and vest-pocket park. A bagel shop has just opened, a new pizza parlor is going in, and negotiations have started about turning the old 5 & 10 building into professional offices and apartments for the elderly.
 
No Lack of Churches
 "We're still a viable town," Mayor Horvath said, pointing out that Sussex has seven churches, a volunteer fire department, and new offices and apartments in a converted creamery.
The trick now is finding the millions for better sewage treatment, water filtering and the Clove Lake dam.
"We don't have the ability to expand the tax base, and the municipal leaders recognize the limited ability of the people to pay more," said Charles M. Kuperus, president of the Town Council and owner of a plant nursery. "There's a commitment to improve. We're going after every grant we can get."

HEADLINE: Dollar Rallies, but Reasons Are Still to Be Determined

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Since early January the dollar has been rallying strongly, a move that caught many forecasters by surprise.
Behind the surge are some signs of economic recovery and a hint of higher interest rates later in the year. But there has also been a general scramble by investors and speculators to get ahead of the game, to buy the dollar early so that any rally will mean really nice profits. 
 "The market is largely speculative," said David Gilmore, senior foreign exchange economist at MCM Currency Watch in New York, "and you make money by getting on trends early on and promoting them as best you can."
But as with last winter's upturn, this rally was not really expected. And now, forecasters are wondering if this year's rally will last; last year's fizzled.
 
More Confirmation Is Needed
 "From a trading point of view, the dollar went pretty far pretty fast," said Neal M. Soss, chief economist at the First Boston Corporation in New York. "Now, this story has to be ratified by fundamental evidence."
Some of that evidence came in the retail sales and industrial production increases in February. But more confirmation is needed in the March and April economic reports to get the dollar moving higher.
Forecasters contend that as long as data support the expectation of an economic recovery, the dollar will remain in its current range of 1.64 to 1.68 against the German mark. It closed Friday at 1.6714 marks.
And the dollar could move to the 1.80 range as the recovery gains momentum and increases the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to keep inflation from reigniting. Such a jump would mean an increase of almost 19 percent from the end of 1991.
But some forecasters expect the dollar to fall later in the year to its current levels as the German and other European economies recover from their recessions or economic slowdowns.
If there are disappointments in the United States economy, the dollar will fall, as it did last year when the hoped-for recovery did not materialize. In that cycle, the dollar rose by 23 percent by the summer and then fell back to end the year up just 1.8 percent.
On the Japanese yen, views are more mixed. Some forecasters say it will fall. But some analysts say that although the dollar has risen against the yen to the 134 level in the last three months, they expect the yen to rally later in the year. On Friday, the dollar closed at 133.85 against the yen.
The late-year-rally view is based, in part, on the growing trade surplus that Japan has with the United States and the rest of the world. There is also a belief that a rising yen, by making Japanese exports more expensive, would help curb the surplus, which otherwise adds to trade frictions. A turnaround in the Japanese economy is also forecast to support the yen.
"We have a very aggressive forecast on the yen," said Geoffrey Dennis of James Capel Inc. in New York. The rise in the surplus, he added, is a "psychological thing" that should draw support to the yen.
The dollar rally this year is in part a result of the new suddenness in the dollar's ability to change direction. It is not that the dollar, during any day, cannot turn quickly. That kind of shift has always happened. But the dollar these days seems to move far ahead of the signs -- economic, technical and otherwise -- that forecasters have depended upon in the past.
The guideposts of forecasting -- interest rate differentials, central-bank policy, capital flows and others -- are not giving the early warnings of change that they are supposed to. They are, in fact, often too late.
"The speed of the move means that you do not have the luxury anymore of waiting for the data to make up your mind," said Nicholas Sargen, the managing director of Prudential's Global Fixed Income Advisers. "You have to be much quicker on your toes in catching these changes in market sentiment. You have to be more anticipatory."
 
A 7.7% Move in a Week
 This year, the sudden switch in direction came between Jan. 9 and Jan. 15, five trading days in which the dollar soared 7.7 percent against the German mark. And the move came at a time when the so-called signposts seemed to point to a weaker dollar.
Some analysts say that the rally this year, which has seen the dollar rise almost 10.2 percent against the mark and 7.3 percent against the yen, is being helped by a new reluctance in the Bush Administration to intervene in the foreign exchange market. They argue that in this election year a stronger dollar helps President Bush by lessening inflationary pressures and, in turn, easing the upward push on long-term interest rates that could threaten an election-year recovery.
Both these factors have made forecasting the path of the dollar more difficult this year and help explain why many analysts, who thought the dollar would remain weaker in the beginning of the year, were wrong. These same factors could also affect the dollar's course from here.
 
More Betting on Anticipation
 The reason the traditional signposts for following the dollar are less useful is that the foreign exchange market and the millions of investors and speculators in it are placing their bets more on anticipation than they have in the past. Instead of waiting for evidence of a change in the direction of the dollar, they are trying to get on the bandwagon in advance.
Even with short-term interest rates on the German mark five percentage points higher than those on the dollar, many investors are counting on better gains from a quick rally of the American currency. But to better their chances they have had to buy the dollar early. And it is these purchases that have pushed the dollar higher.
"The market has gotten more reactionary," said James T. McGroarty, senior vice president of Greenwich Capital Markets Inc. in Greenwich, Conn. "The discounting mechanism of the market has gotten much more sophisticated, and investors and speculators are positioned now well in advance."
Mr. Sargen, a former Salomon Brothers economist, offered a specific example of how the signposts had changed. He said that until recently the dollar had not made a major turn upward until it was quite clear that the Federal Reserve Board had changed its policy on interest rates from easing, which can undercut the dollar, to tightening, which can support the dollar.
But in the last two years this sequence has not been the case. In 1991, the dollar rallied from a post-World War II record low of 1.4475 marks in February to around 1.83 marks in July, even as the Federal Reserve was still easing interest rates in an effort to revive the economy.
The same has been true this year. For example, Salomon Brothers expected the Federal Reserve to ease interest rates one more time early in the year. Thus, it expected the dollar to remain weak. But the dollar defied the traditional signposts again by beginning to rise in January.
 
Evidence of Fed's Shift
 The apparent change in the Administration's position on intervention in the foreign currency market has also helped the dollar rally, said David D. Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services in Chicago. Mr. McGroarty said he, too, had sensed a change in policy.
The change is apparent in the policy actions taken in January and since then. In January, the Federal Reserve, on the instructions of the Administration, intervened to sell dollars against the yen. This move was, at the time, a clear signal that both the Bush Administration and the Japanese Government wanted the dollar to fall against the yen.
But since then, although the dollar has risen almost 8 percent against the yen, there has been no further intervention.

Anxiety and Loss Shape the Mood in Connecticut

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, March 22

 BODY:
Almost everyone in Connecticut these days seems able to name a seemingly unshakable institution that the recession and a changing world have diminished or erased.
Banks drenched in state history have closed. Insurance companies have laid off thousands of white-collar managers. Military contracts that once poured into the state to fight the cold war have shrunk. A state that once attracted wealthy people because it had no wage tax has imposed one for the first time to balance its budget. Home values that once looked like blue-chip stocks have dropped. 
 In such an environment, anxiety will be the real winner in Tuesday's Presidential primary. In dozens of interviews across the state in recent days, from the Navy yards of Groton, to the suburbs of Fairfield County, to the insurance heartland here in the capital, the themes of loss and uncertainty were echoed everywhere.
 
Panic in the Suburbs'
 "There's panic in the suburbs," said Ralph A. Greco, a vice president at PaineWebber Inc. in Fairfield.
"You've got defense workers who don't have work making helicopters or submarines or what have you, and white-collar workers who because of restructuring aren't needed either and they have to find new trades, or new skills, or new locations," he said.
But Mr. Greco said he thought President Bush would not be hurt by all that in the Republican primary -- to the contrary, he thinks voters may seek the known and familiar on Tuesday, and in the general election in November.
Sharon Bieu thinks the electoral dynamic in Connecticut may work exactly the opposite way; to the benefit of Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the Democratic front-runner, or to the benefit of anyone not named George Bush.
Ms. Bieu, a bank administrator who has lived in Connecticut all her life, said that last year's struggles between Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. and the State Legislature over whether to impose a tax on wages has changed the way people look at politicians and politics, and maybe authority in general.
"Everybody feels as if we're being ripped off," said Ms. Bieu, who intends to vote for Mr. Clinton on Tuesday. "I mean, they're taking from us, but they're not giving us anything."
 
Governor Rates Low in Polls
 Mr. Weicker, a third-party governor who pushed the wage tax through a Democratic-controlled Legislature, has one of the lowest approval ratings of any governor in the nation, according to poll-takers. In a survey taken last month by the University of Connecticut, 68 percent of the 500 respondents questioned said Mr. Weicker was doing a fair or poor job. The poll had a margin of error of 5 percentage points.
But some residents said they thought Mr. Weicker's demonstrated ability to galvanize public opinion in the state -- for better and worse -- has paved the way for a politician who, like Mr. Weicker, often says what he thinks regardless of the consequences. That could perhaps help Paul E. Tsongas, a former Massachusetts Senator who dropped out of the race last Thursday, but whose volunteer staff is still pushing residents to vote for him to send a message.
Mr. Tsongas created a stir last week, in his few days of campaigning in the state, when he said residents would have to face the fact that the Seawolf submarine program -- earmarked for elimination by the Bush Administration -- was probably doomed. Mr. Clinton, by contrast, has said he thinks the Seawolf may yet be saved.
"The Tsongas message was clearly based on what he believes, but also I think it was a calculated message that people are ready to hear the truth," said Howard G. Rifkin, an associate professor at the Institute of Public Service at the University of Connecticut.
 
Presidential Learning Curve
 Other people point to a sort of Presidential learning curve.
"I'm going for Bush," said Denise A. Dorr, a 32-year-old Lisbon resident who was interviewed while having her nails done at a beauty salon. "I figure we gave him four years to screw up -- let him have four more years to fix it. If we put someone else in we'll just be starting all over again."
In past recessions, some elements of the Connecticut economy have been relatively immune from hard times. Some residents find it especially troubling that in the last three years, almost every pillar industry in the state has been damaged.
"You look at the Connecticut economy and you don't see what is going to be the factor that's going to turn it around," said Lawrence D. Stillman, an insurance company investment officer who supports Mr. Bush. "You don't see any industry that's on the upswing. It's bad as I can remember it being -- especially the mood."
That mood was captured today at a rally in New Haven where both Mr. Clinton and his remaining Democratic rival, former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California, spoke at the Trinity Temple Church side by side with the Rev. Jesse Jackson. The meeting was dedicated to the memories of young men who have died by violence in New Haven's streets, and the candidates and Mr. Jackson all pledged to dedicate themselves to rejuvenating the troubled cities.
With a gospel choir at their backs and a crumbling, depressed neighborhood outside the door, Mr. Jackson urged the candidates to change "the equation."
"We're not in the equation," he said, glancing at Mr. Brown and Mr. Clinton on the dais. "We seek to be in the equation."
Many residents of the state may have simply opted out of the equation. Mr. Jackson, who sought the Democratic nomination for President in 1984 and 1988, said he had dedicated this election cycle to voter registration, and at his urging several dozen people stepped forward today to register right then and there in the church.
 
Low Voter Turnout
 But politicians fear there could be a historically low turnout in Tuesday's primary, even lower than in 1988 when only about 23 percent of the registered Republicans voted and only 36 percent of the Democrats came to the polls.
Some residents have given up not just on the election but on the state itself. Jeffrey Cameron, a 29-year-old West Hartford resident, counted off the people he knows who are leaving to seek work elsewhere, especially in the South.
And such anecdotal evidence is backed up by the numbers. In 1991, Connecticut was third in the nation in the number of people moving out of the state compared with those moving in, according to Allied Van Lines. Only in North Dakota and New York were the numbers higher.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL: Sleepers, Keepers and Weepers in the Senior Circuit;
Bashers of Rotisserie Leagues Aren't Worth a Thin Dime

BYLINE: By PAUL BELINKIE

 BODY:
While an estimated 2 million baseball fans find enjoyment in playing Rotisserie baseball, last year a small group of critics assumed the responsibility of telling the public exactly how they should be enjoying the national pastime.
They included: 
 *Sports columnists who possessed the vehicle to address major baseball issues but preferred to use their forum to chastise Rotisserie players for not following traditional methods of rooting for sports teams.
*A national magazine that gave a thumbs down to Rotisserie baseball but considers bathing suits a major event.
*So-called fans who disregarded the fact that teams such as the Dodgers, Giants and Athletics had changed their addresses, and players such as Bobby Bonilla, Jack Morris, Danny Tartabull and Frank Viola changed their uniforms, but condemned Rotisserie owners for focusing on various players' performances instead of team standings.
One article even theorized that Rotisserie players were not true baseball fans because of the passion and determination they displayed in attempting to find the results of the previous day's games at their local newsstands. How's that for twisted logic?
When did Rotisserie bashing become in vogue? Who says there is only one way to correctly follow baseball? Who among us is the first to throw a knockdown pitch?
And where will it end?
Will we ban golfers because they slice the ball instead of hitting it squarely? Will we stop quarterbacks from rolling out and force them to stay in the pocket? Should we outlaw the dunk shot, the jump shot, the bank shot, the slap shot?
What about the past-his-prime softball player who can barely hit the ball over an infielder's head but still enjoys the challenge of running the bases (even though it requires a triple for him to score from second). Must he now pack it in because he approaches the game differently than he did 20 years ago?
What is so wrong with Rotisserie players who support the economy by buying newspapers to study box scores and by calling sports phones for the latest updates? Isn't the business of America good for business?
The misconception among critics of Rotisserie baseball is that "owners" are less knowledgeable about the game than they used to be. This is completely contrary to the facts.
Rather, there has been an evolution in the way in which a fan roots. Instead of rooting for someone else's team, a Rotisserie owner roots for his own team. Now, instead of following the home team, a Rotisserie player follows every team and every player in either the National or American League, or both leagues.
The result is the formation of a grass-roots network of fans that is more sophisticated and better informed. Should ignorance be encouraged?
There are several reasons why new-age sports fans are more knowledgeable. The creation of radio talk shows geared entirely to a sports format have prospered in many cities, giving fans the opportunity to express their viewpoints. Sports coverage in many newspapers has increased, giving readers a wider variety of information to dissect.
But perhaps the most important development has been the emergence of cable television. No longer are fans relegated to only following their home teams. Now teams from Seattle to Atlanta can be seen by subscribers, giving players who were once merely names in a box score an entire personality.
The logical conclusion of this exposure has been a greater interest in the sports that are televised, which can be measured by the overall increase in total attendance and the additional revenues that have been reaped by team owners. And by watching players perform instead of only reading about their performance, fans are finally able to judge for themselves the relative merits and talents of the ballplayers.
Rotisserie baseball is one way for advanced students of the game to test their expertise. While winning often requires a certain amount of luck, the decisions made during the season about players and strategy must be built on a solid foundation of information.
Cynics, however, have invariably found reasons to criticize someone else's notion of how to have a good time. Aren't there enough negative thoughts floating around as it is without getting on the bandwagon to stop someone else's enjoyment of a recreational activity. Aren't there enough rules, enough restraints, enough bosses, enough people telling you what you should be doing?
Are you tired of your friends enjoying something you don't understand? Do you miss the excitement of seeing how your team, not the home team, is doing in the standings every week? Are you against people having a good time if it doesn't agree with the way you would do things?
If the answer to these questions is yes, it should be noted that if you don't know who the patsy is in a poker game after 30 minutes, then it's probably you.
 
The Basics
 Rotisserie baseball is a game in which groups of people form their own league, with each person selecting a team of real players from the active rosters of either the American League or National League teams. The selection is usually done by auctions at which team "owners" bid for players.
The performances of individual players throughout the season thus determines how well each Rotisserie league team does. Teams are ranked from first to last each week in eight categories -- four offensive and four pitching -- and the team with the most points in these categories at the end of the season is the winner.
The prices listed for each player on this page represent an estimate of what it will cost to purchase the player at auction.

HEADLINE: Squandering Leverage on China

 BODY:
America's China policy is locked in stalemate. President Bush refuses to demand much of anything from China's leaders. Congress insists that every issue be addressed before extending normal trade. These extreme positions cancel each other out, allowing Beijing to disregard American interests with impunity.
Last week the charade played itself out again. Congress had passed a bill attaching a wide variety of human rights, trade and anti-proliferation conditions to China's "most-favored-nation" privileges -- the basis for normal trade relations with the U.S. Mr. Bush vetoed it. The Senate failed to override the veto. 
 How different -- and more effective -- American policy would be if Washington could figure out how to exploit, in a calibrated way, its leverage. China's recent renewal of capitalist economic reforms only increases that leverage.
Without access to the vast American consumer market, China's development would be markedly slowed. Without American investors, Beijing would be thrown back onto an unwanted dependence on Japanese capital. Without prestige meetings with President Bush, General Scowcroft and Secretary of State Baker, China's hard-liners would be seen as pariahs, compromising their hopes to rule after the death of 87-year-old Deng Xiaoping.
Yet Beijing regularly thumbs its nose at American diplomacy on bilateral issues. From copyright infringements to missile sales, Mr. Bush's negotiators accept Beijing's assurances at face value, only to discover that their Chinese counterparts meant to convey something other than what the Americans understood. After every misunderstanding, the Administration's instinct has simply been to sit down and try again.
Most of the blame for American ineffectiveness lies with Mr. Bush. He proceeds with the optimistic outlook he formed as Richard Nixon's emissary in Beijing. But the bloody crushing of China's democracy movement raised doubts about how much evolution can be expected from the Communist regime. And the fall of Soviet Communism alters the strategic calculus that led Washington to wink at China's trampling of human rights.
Congress hasn't been any more effective. Year after year, it has sought to attach a laundry list of conditions to legislation renewing most-favored-nation privileges.
True, trade privileges constitute one of the few policy tools available to the legislative branch. But maintaining open trade is more than a favor to China's hard-liners. It's just as vital to China's important reform sectors: entrepreneurs in the south coast Special Economic Zones, Hong Kong democrats, intellectuals thirsty for the international news foreign business people bring.
If Washington attached a few modest humanitarian conditions to most-favored-nation rights, like release of the political prisoner Wei Jingsheng or medical treatment for the imprisoned democrat Wang Juntao, China would surely accede rather than lose billions of dollars. Compliance with more ambitious requests, like freedom for all Tiananmen prisoners, could be made subject to a Presidential judgment of "reasonable progress."
Issues like prison labor and copyright piracy are best linked not to overall trading rights but to specific sanctions already written into U.S. trade laws. And leverage over issues like nuclear technology transfers and missile sales is best exercised through special mechanisms governing sensitive exports. The Administration has, in fact, tried these more targeted approaches, but without consistency or conviction.
This year's Presidential candidates have shown little interest in discussing China or any other foreign policy issue. But it's surely worth debating how the U.S. can more effectively press its interests and values on the world's largest remaining Communist regime.

HEADLINE: Times Sq. Deal Shows Where the Bargains Are
To the Editor:
The acquisition by Bertelsmann A.G., the international news media group, of a Times Square building at Broadway and 45th Street (news article, March 4) is a sign of the future strength of New York City and not, as you state, an "indication of the weakness of the city's real estate market."

 BODY:
 The agreement structured by Mayor David N. Dinkins's office shows 1992 is a good time for bargains.
Similar criticism was voiced in the 1970's, when New York Telephone and Teacher's Annuity bought 1166 Avenue of Americas for $30 million. A few years later, half the building was sold for $165 million. What was first seen as a sign of a weak economy was an appropriate business deal by the city and the two corporations. The same half of the building sold for $100 million more a few years later.
Bertelsmann understands the importance of New York City. It is time for others to take advantage of what New York City has to offer and come back.

HEADLINE: WIDER U.S. DEFICITS ARE NOW FORECAST FOR THE MID-1990'S

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 22

 BODY:
A year after White House economists forecast that the Federal budget would have a surplus by the mid-1990's, they are now predicting a deficit of nearly $200 billion in fiscal 1996. And Congressional economists take an even dimmer view.
Projections released this month by the Congressional Budget Office said this year's deficit would be a record $368 billion and that after dropping in the next few years, deficits would soar in the second half of the decade. By 2002, the office said, the deficit could reach $423 billion. 
 Driving the deficit is the enormous and rapidly growing Federal spending on health care. Annual spending on health care is expected to rise from $196 billion this year to $481 billion in 2000. Mandatory programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid now account for about half of all Federal spending.
 
Not a High Priority
 Yet President Bush and Congress have paid scant attention to paring the deficit. The budget accord between Congress and the White House in 1990 seemed to calm fears about the deficit and remove it as a high-priority item on the public agenda.
"This is the first time since the deficit became a problem 10 years ago that no one is even paying lip service to getting rid of it," said Charles E. Schultze, an economist at the Brookings Institution who was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Jimmy Carter. "This is the first time we've given up."
But as expenditures have climbed and tax revenues have failed to keep up, many economists are sounding an alarm. They say the dismal deficit projections and the wrangling between Congress and the President over tax cuts have helped drive up long-term interest rates, which are having a negative effect on stock prices, housing sales, business investment and consumer confidence.
 
Draining Investment Dollars
 They also say the deficit hurts the nation's long-term competitive position by draining money from private savings that could be used to finance investment in machinery and factories that raise output and productivity.
In language considered highly alarmist for a chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan recently told Congress that these deficits were "unacceptably high."
In recent weeks, Mr. Greenspan has repeatedly noted with chagrin that last year the Administration forecast that the Federal budget would reach a surplus in fiscal 1996, but that in its budget this year, the Administration foresees a deficit of $180 billion in 1996, including the costs of the savings and loan rescue. Much of the difference is explained by lower-than-anticipated revenues caused by slower-than-expected growth and by the larger-than-anticipated expansion in Medicare and Medicaid costs.
"We have to go back to the drawing board," David W. Mullins Jr., the Federal Reserve's vice chairman, said in an interview last week. "We don't see anything that is going to restrain this deficit, and we're starting a bidding war over tax cuts with a deficit at nearly $400 billion, which isn't very encouraging."
The deficits began to balloon in the 1980's, but many economists did not worry much, believing the Reagan Administration's tax cuts would spur so much additional growth that tax revenues would increase and narrow the budget gap.
Through the 1980's -- and as recently as January 1991 -- the Federal Government predicted that the budget would have a surplus in five years' time. Not only has a surplus failed to materialize, but the deficit has ballooned.
The string of optimistic forecasts changed in January, when President Bush's budget message included a prediction by the White House Office of Management and Budget that envisioned large Federal budget deficits at least through 1997.
 
An Up-and-Down Path
 The O.M.B. forecast said the deficit would be $399 billion this year and would slide to $180 billion in fiscal 1996. Then, it said, the deficit would rise again, to $182 billion in 1997.
"Total U.S. public and private spending on health is literally on an unsustainable path -- threatening to consume an impossible proportion of G.D.P.," said Richard G. Darman, the office's director. He added, "Slowing the growth of 'mandatory' programs is the most important key to bringing the deficit under control," those programs being Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security.
In projections released this month, the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan agency, estimated that the fiscal 1992 deficit would soar to $368 billion, the highest ever. That includes about $61 billion for the savings and loan bailout and the current surplus in the Social Security fund.
The underlying deficit -- without the bailout costs -- will drop from $307 billion this year to $219 billion in 1995, then curve steadily upward, reaching $432 billion in 2002, the budget office predicted. The budget office said the underlying deficit would fall from 5.3 percent of gross domestic product this year to 3.1 percent in 1995 and climb to 4.2 percent in 2002.
Robert Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office, said that if "there is no substantial improvement in the underlying deficit over a five-year period, by the second year of the next century, we're in the soup."
At some point, the Federal savings and loan bailout program is expected to no longer require huge infusions of cash, as the industry returns to health and the Government receives income from the sale of assets that have become profitable. The budget office estimates that the bailout will cost and $69 billion next year, but by 1996, the sale of assets will contribute $45 billion to the budget. But even this contribution is not expected to be nearly enough to offset the spending on health care.
 
An Impediment to Growth
 A new study by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York concluded that the budget deficits of the 1980's held the nation's economic growth about 3 percent below what it would have been without such deficits. The report added that if the deficit continued to depress private savings, it would hold down growth by about 6 percent by the year 2000.
Some economists say the size of the deficit is exaggerated, asserting that interest payments on the debt should not be factored into the balance because those payments just redistribute money from American taxpayers to holders of Treasury bonds, most of whom put the money back into savings. But looking at the steep upward curve of the deficit and the downward trend in savings, many economists say this criticism misses the point.
Economists and lawmakers who would like to bring the deficit down say it would be unwise to slash it this year because that could hamper an already sluggish recovery. They say it might even be wise to have some short-term stimulus, by increased public works spending, for instance, to speed the recovery.
 
Disappointment With Candidates
 But they say they are disappointed that the Presidential candidates are all but ignoring the long-term deficit problem and that when a candidate suggests a way to cut spending or raise taxes to narrow the deficit, his opponents jump on such proposals.
Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas attacked former Senator Paul E. Tsongas for proposing that gasoline taxes be increased by 5 cents a year for a decade, while Patrick J. Buchanan, the Republican candidate, relentlessly condemned President Bush for agreeing to a tax increase in 1990.
"The problem in politics is that if you promise to do something about the deficit, it imposes pain in the short run and the rewards for doing something about it aren't felt for a long time," said Rudolph G. Penner, former director of the Congressional Budget Office. "The rewards will be felt by our children and grandchildren."
The Congressional budget forecast shows that barring changes in health-care programs, the cost of Medicare will soar from $128 billion this year to $301 billion in 2000. Medicaid costs will more than double, from $68 billion this year to $180 billion in 2000. Taken together, Medicare and Medicaid spending will jump from 3.4 percent of gross domestic product this year to 5.3 percent in 2000, larger than the 4.2 percent share consumed by the deficit in 2002 as projected by the Congressional Budget Office.
 
Using Borrowed Money
 Most economists say a budget deficit need not be bad if the money borrowed is used for investments that increase productivity, like improving airports or job training. That would produce a more efficient economy, which would help enable Americans in the future to repay the debt.
But Mr. Reischauer complained that the money in the deficit has not been used in this way.
"If the money were used for public infrastructure, that's O.K.," he said. "If it were used to fight a war or major social problems, that would be O.K., too. But to the extent it's been squandered on public consumption, you have increased the debt burden on our children without increasing their capacity to repay it."
He also complained that the deficits over the last decade have raised the ratio of public debt as a percentage of G.D.P. from 25 percent in the 1970's to more than 50 percent today and almost 60 percent at the end of the decade.
Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, said: "I think the Congressional Budget Office has phrased it succinctly, that the deficit will cripple economic growth. That's what the huge deficit is doing and will continue to do."
 
Parting With the Leadership
 In the recent tax debate in Congress, Mr. Levin parted with the Democratic leadership to propose that the cost of the $300 tax credit per child proposed by Senate leaders -- $28 billion -- be applied instead to reducing the deficit.
"If we act to reduce the deficit, which will promote future growth, that is a more positive step for the middle class than any benefit from the tax cut," he said.
Senator Warren Rudman, a New Hampshire Republican who has long led the fight to hold down the deficit, observed despairingly: "The blame for this lies with the Congress and the President, with Democrats and Republicans alike, most all of whom have been unwilling to make the hard choices or to explain to the American people that there is no such thing as a free lunch.
"In a time when we are at war economically," he continued, "when the security of America is being drained drop by drop, we cannot seem to get it together."

CORRECTION-DATE: March 24, 1992, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, a front-page article yesterday about new forecasts of the Federal budget deficit referred incorrectly to a deficit-reduction proposal by Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan. In the recent Congressional tax debate, he proposed a bill that would have scrapped the $300 tax credit per child proposed by Senate leaders and instead used most, not all, of the $28 billion cost of the credits to reduce the deficit.

The Economy
A year after White House economists forecast that the Federal budget would have a surplus by the mid-1990's, they are now predicting a deficit of nearly $200 billion in fiscal 1996. Congressional economists take an even dimmer view. [Page A1.] 
 Federal Reserve officials say recent data indicate that the economy is picking up steam, but they remain worried that the incipient recovery could peter out. [D1.]
 
Markets
The dollar has rallied strongly since January, surprising many forecasters. Behind the surge are some signs of economic recovery and a hint of higher interest rates later this year. But there has also been a general speculative scramble to buy the dollar early so that any rally will mean really nice profits. [D1.]
In a bull market, few members of an exchange worry about who sits in the chairman's seat. But when Comex members elect a new chairman on Tuesday, amid a sagging market, they will look to the new leadership to turn things around. [D3.]
 
Companies
More than a dozen new hand-held computers based on "superchips" are due out this year. This new class of inexpensive machines, known in the industry as picocomputers, could transform the high-volume retail computer market. [D1.]
An F.D.A. official has told makers of medical equipment that the agency will follow up hearings on silicone-gel breast implants by initiating investigations of five other devices: artificial testicles, penis implants, breast implants filled with saline solutions, centrifugal pumps used in heart-bypass operations and electrical stimulators used to treat alcoholism and depression. [D1.]
 
International
President Bush and Chancellor Kohl of Germany appeared to have made scant progress over the weekend toward resolving a dispute over farm goods that is blocking a world trade agreement. At the White House, the two leaders said little to suggest that the proposed 108-nation accord would be completed in mid-April, as negotiators pledged. [A3.]
The Media Business
This summer, more new shows will be on television than ever before -- a radical change from the days when summer programming was an unbroken line of reruns. Bill Carter: Television. [D1.]
On a Monday last August, Domer Ringuette disappeared without a word to the employees of his weekly newspaper in Chicopee, Mass. "I had made up my mind to be free, so I became free," said Mr. Ringuette, who was located five months later working as a poker dealer in North Las Vegas, Nev. [D8.]
Color inks based on soybean oils are being promoted as brighter and environmentally safer than conventional inks, which are based on petroleum products. [D8.]
El Sol has become the third Spanish newspaper to close in eight months. Several others are desperately seeking partners. [D8.]
Conde Nast is changing its advertising sales packages, which offer advertisers and their agencies the opportunity to earn discounts of between 3 percent and 30 percent on magazine ad-page rates. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [D9.]
 
Today's Columns
Now that everyone agrees that the economy has made some gains, economists are arguing about whether long-term interest rates will head higher or lower. Credit Markets. [D7.]
A hazard of buying stocks from penny brokers is the possibility that the S.E.C. will eventually take action against them. When that happens, stocks the broker is promoting can abruptly plunge. Visual Equities is a case in point. Market Place. [D6.]

HEADLINE: U.S. ADDS PROGRAMS WITH LITTLE REVIEW OF LOCAL BURDENS

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS

 BODY:
Against the background of a stubborn recession and mounting financial distress in the country, the Federal Government continues to create or expand domestic spending programs with little or no review of the financial burdens they will place on state and local governments, public policy analysts say.
In 1990 alone, the year the recession began, President Bush signed 20 bills into law, ordering programs that the National Conference of State Legislatures says will cost state and local governments billions of extra dollars, primarily for health care, the environment and Social Security payments for public employees. 
 Some mandates, like the Americans With Disabilities Act, were enacted without any reliable estimates of the cost to state and local governments. The legislation, which requires businesses and state and local governments to provide the disabled with equal access to services, employment, buildings and transportation systems, is now expected to cost them millions of dollars annually to comply.
 
Health and Environment
 The most expensive regulations for any state involve Medicaid, the Federally subsidized health-care program for low-income people that will cost $38.3 billion for the states to finance this year. The next most expensive mandates involve environmental laws, primarily water purification, which will cost state and local governments $32 billion a year by 1995.
And three new studies show that despite the publicized efforts of President Ronald Reagan and President Bush to decentralize government, both contributed to a proliferation of regulations that meant enormous costs to states and cities in the 1980's.
No one can reliably estimate the cost of complying with many such programs, and Congress is required to make only preliminary estimates on some of the bills it considers. But analysts say no Federal law provides for complete reimbursement of any mandated program, and some legislative analysts estimate the burden to local governments of such spending at scores of billions of dollars a year.
 
'Rock and a Hard Place'
 "We are between a rock and a hard place," said Gov. Robert P. Casey of Pennsylvania, a Democrat.
As part of a plan to pay for newly mandated Federal health benefits for children, pregnant women and the elderly, Governor Casey has proposed eliminating some medical benefits for disabled men who currently receive state welfare grants. The state raised taxes by a record $3.3 billion this fiscal year and still must reduce spending by $800 million to balance a $14.2 billion budget.
Pessimism is widespread. Three-quarters of the states and more than a third of the nation's cities report worsening fiscal problems this year, and many governors and mayors are saying the problems will linger or worsen over several years even if the economy recovers quickly.
"I think we're headed for a showdown," Gov. John Engler of Michigan, a Republican, said in a recent interview in which he blamed Congress for "wrecking" state budgets. But analysts and other governors blame Mr. Bush. Last month, when the President met with the National Governors Association, their meeting turned into an arguing match.
At that meeting, on Feb. 3 in Washington, two Democratic governors, Roy Romer of Colorado and George Sinner of North Dakota, attacked the President, asserting that too much money was going to the military and too little to the states. "What bases do you want to close?" Mr. Bush asked testily.
Only a month earlier, Mr. Bush seemed sympathetic to the plight of the state and local governments. In January, in Mr. Bush's State of the Union Message, he sought to lay responsibility for mandates on Congress and advocated curbs on spending.
 
Bush on Mandates
 "We must put an end to unfinanced Federal Government mandates," Mr. Bush said. "These are the requirements Congress puts on our cities, counties and states without supplying the money. And if Congress passes a mandate, it should be forced to pay for it and balance the cost with savings elsewhere."
In an earlier effort to give the states more flexibility in administering Federal programs, Mr. Bush last year proposed to consolidate $15 billion in block grants and to leave the decision on how to spend the money up to the states. But many cities opposed the legislation and it died in Congress. Mr. Bush said last week that he planned to revive the proposal.
Nevertheless, analysts say the President has done little to curb the flow of Federal mandates. Nor, they assert, has he acted to provide more financing for those bills he has signed into law.
 
'Zero Leadership'
 "President Bush has provided zero leadership in this area of nation-state relationships," said Joseph F. Zimmerman, professor of political science at the State University of New York in Albany and the author of two new studies on the relationship between the states and the Federal Government.
"You can't point to a single bill where he took leadership to give states more freedom of action, or for that matter, where he sought to impose mandates on states," he said. "In a sense, it is as though President Bush has just been oblivious to this whole area until he mentioned it in the State of the Union Message."
Last January Mr. Bush ordered a 90-day moratorium on new regulations by Federal agencies and a review of existing rules to identify those that appear to do more economic harm than good. That proposal, modeled after a strategy that he carried out as Vice President in the Reagan Administration, was aimed mainly at lightening the burden for businesses.
But a new study says that whatever the impact on businesses, the deregulatory effort was "largely ineffective." It said the Government ultimately passed on more significant regulatory burdens to state and local governments during the 1980's than in almost any other decade, adding to their financial responsibilities.
The study, "Federal Regulation of State and Local Governments," is being prepared for publication later this year by the United States Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations, a Federally chartered research organization in Washington.
 
No Change in Sight
 "Congress was the more active regulator than either the Reagan or Bush Administration, but none of the laws with mandates were enacted over Presidential veto," said Timothy J. Conlan, a professor of government and politics at George Mason University. Prof. Conlan and two colleagues, David R. Beam and Cynthia Colella, wrote the study.
Prof. Conlan and his colleagues said they foresee no lightening of this burden for state and local governments.
The candidates in the contests for the Republican and Democratic Presidential nominations have made Federally mandated programs an issue in their campaigns.
President Bush's challenger for the Republican nomination, Patrick J. Buchanan, has advocated a two-year moratorium on new mandates and a re-appraisal of existing ones.
The Democratic front-runner, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, says the Government is creating too many inflexible and costly programs that reduce the states' ability to cope with social and financial problems they consider more pressing.
 
More Legislation
 Of the 125 mandate-laden bills that have been introduced in Congress this session, more than half deal with health care and criminal justice, which are the two fastest growing segments of state budgets, said Martha A. Fabricius, a policy analyst with the National Association of State Budget Officers who has been monitoring this legislation. She said that more than 20 of the most expensive bills had been introduced by the Democratic leadership.
If enacted, the bills would force most states to raise taxes or reduce existing services, analysts said.
Under some of the bills, the states would be directed to pay all or some of the cost of new programs like insuring savings and loan associations, planting trees on state-owned land, operating mobile units to assist the mentally ill among the homeless and increasing prison terms for several categories of violent crimes.
The states would also be ordered to eliminate at least one revenue-producing program, a tax on certain retirement income, forcing them to find other ways to finance government.
While the Government has expanded Federally mandated programs and whittled away at state and local tax revenues, it simultaneously has reduced aid to the states.
In the 1980's, for example, overall Federal aid declined 10 percent, when adjusted for inflation, and grants that were not related to health care declined 23.6 percent, according to Government figures. There are no estimates on the loss in tax revenue to the states.
 
Historical Shift
 The expansion of Federal authority over state affairs represents an historic shift in American Government since the 1960's, according to Prof. Zimmerman
"Congress, with the acquiescence of the Supreme Court, is slowly usurping the sovereign powers of states and turning them into administrators of national policy," he said, summarizing a central conclusion in two studies he wrote for the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations. The studies, scheduled for publication this year, are entitled "Federal Pre-emption of State and Local Authority" and "Federally Induced State and Local Governmental Costs."
In all, there are estimated to be tens of thousands of Federal mandates and they touch nearly every aspect of government. There are mandates that instruct states or local governments on landfills, welfare benefits, speed limits, other traffic regulations and prison construction, among other things.
 
New York Stories
 Federally required health-care programs consumed 14 percent of all state budgets in 1990 and, with the cost of expanded programs and inflation in medical expenses, the Federal programs will devour 28 percent of the states' budgets by 1995, the National Governors Association estimates.
Examples of the costs that can result from these mandates are easily seen in populous states like New York. Stricter standards for drinking water may cost the city billions; a $600 million water filtration plant is under construction in the Bronx. School districts have spent tens of millions of dollars removing asbestos from school buildings. Congress, in passing the measure in 1986, never considered its cost to state and local governments; it is now projected at $3.1 billion over 30 years.
Members of Congress who develop mandatory programs acknowledge that the programs are a crushing burden for state and local governments. The legislators say there will be no alternative to this piecemeal approach until the President and Congress agree on national solutions to national problems like taxes, health care, welfare and environmental issues.
 
Federal Financing
 "It's incumbent on us to realize that the states can't continue to pay for Medicaid, which is a complicated, second-class health-care system for less than half of the poor people in the country," said Representative Henry A. Waxman, a California Democrat who is chairman of the House Subcommittee on Health and the Environment and the author of a number of Medicaid mandates.
"We need to have major reform in either Medicaid or in the whole system, but we simply can't let pregnant women, infants and children go without health care," said Mr. Waxman, who has said the Federal Government should be responsible for financing Medicaid.
Mario M. Cuomo of New York was the nation's only governor who supported the Medicaid mandates for new programs for poor children and pregnant women in the last two years.
Brad C. Johnson, Governor Cuomo's counsel in Washington, said that providing the additional medical care to women and children cost New York $3.8 million last year, and the state spent $828 million to put 100,000 newly eligible people into nursing homes.
 
'Good Investment'
 "He didn't go along with the other 49 governors because he said the mandates for women and children were a good investment," Mr. Johnson said.
Good investment or not, the state is now trying to decide how to cut $1 billion out of its Medicaid and welfare programs because of budget problems.

HEADLINE: U.S. Under Fire In Talks at U.N. On Environment

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, March 23

 BODY:
Rich and poor countries attending a five-week conference here say the United States is endangering prospects for the international environmental meeting planned for Rio de Janeiro next June.
These countries say that by refusing to promise more environmental aid to the third world or to set limits for emissions of gases that contribute to global warming, the United States threatens to sabotage the two most important agreements to be taken up at the Rio meeting. 
 The purpose of the Rio talks, which are expected to draw thousands of participants from more than 170 countries, is to plan for a world economy that can continue to grow without irreversible ecological damage.
 
Cleanup Plan Threated
 The American stand threatens Agenda 21, an ambitious, international environmental cleanup plan for the next century, because of third world requests for additional aid and new environmental technologies from industrialized northern countries.
The 12 European Community countries as well as Canada and Scandinavia are ready to give additional aid, but have not committed themselves to specific amounts.
There has been no visible result so far from a meeting last week of the conference's Secretary General, Maurice F. Strong of Canada, with Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, the national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, and the the White House chief of staff, Samuel P. Skinner, in an effort to change the American position.
Today Senator Al Gore, a Democrat from Tennessee who will lead the Senate contingent to the Rio meetings, told delegates that the United States must exercise leadership to insure their success, saying that at a minimum agreement must be reached on "new and additional" aid to the third world and on the stabilization of emissions.
"The United States must use its moral authority, its political and economic strength and its leadership skills to resolve the impasses that are frustrating progress," Senator Gore said.
America's reluctance to commit itself to freezing its emissions of "greenhouse" gases at 1990 levels by the year 2000 imperils agreement on the planned new international convention on stabilizing the global climate, which is supposed to be the centerpiece of the Rio agreement.
Last week the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, William K. Reilly, told the conference that the Administration planned no fundamental changes in its position on climate change, saying it would continue to resist "top down directives or commitments and targets, the costs and consequences of which we have not yet fully assessed."
While Washington opposes specific, binding commitments on cutting emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases, Mr. Reilly said that the United States was still committed to reducing these emissions through practical action.
 
'A Futile Exercise'
 In an effort to save the separate negotiations on the climate treaty, the United States and about 20 other countries have been invited to a meeting in Paris on April 15, Portugal, the current president of the European Community, announced today. The participants will try to resolve the standoff before the final round of negotiations opens in New York on April 30.
"It would be a pity if the convention had to be postponed until after Rio," Portugal's representative to the United Nations, Joao Pereira Bastos, said at a news conference, adding that Europe would find an American-style convention that did not require detailed commitments unacceptably weak. In a clear reference to the United States, Mr. Bastos said it would be "a futile exercise" for Europe to press ahead with its own climate stabilization plan unless "other regions" joined in.
Partly because of these disagreements, the conference of more than 170 countries meeting here to prepare the agenda for the Rio meeting has entered its fourth week with little progress to report.
But progress is also being slowed, delegates say, by the breadth and complexity of the agenda because it identifies poverty and its effects as a fundamental environmental threat and says that only when it has been abolished will the global environment be safe. As a result, the conference is bogged down in quarrels over economic and social issues that at first sight seem far removed from the environment, including debt relief, slum clearance, the Uruguay Round of trade talks and subsidies for northern farmers that block the agricultural exports of poor countries.
These issues complicate the negotiating process by taking up time and reopening old quarrels between the North and the South. The fact that many of these questions are the subject of continuing negotiations in other international forums makes the discussions here even more complex.
"With 60 percent of our time gone, we've only negotiated 5 to 10 percent of the output," Canada's chief delegate, John Bell, who is chairman of the group dealing with financial questions, said last week. "Increased funding for the developing world is absolutely central. It's frustrating we haven't even started negotiations."
Asked about America's reluctance to provide aid, Pakistan's United Nations representative, Jamsheed K. A. Marker, current president of the Group of 77, as the developing countries call themselves, said that he did not wish to single out the policies of any individual countries for public criticism. But in an interview he made clear that the developing world remained unhappy with Washington's stance, saying: "Without financial commitments it is difficult to know how this will all end. That's the biggest stumbling block for the developing world."
Chile's delegate, Vincent Sanchez, said: "This conference could fail. We've agreed absolutely nothing of real significance so far."
Already, an important attempt to draft a convention to save the world's rain forests has collapsed because mainly northern, industrial countries and southern, undeveloped countries cannot agree on who is to blame for their destruction.
 
Progress Is Expected
 While few delegates deny that the Rio preparatory conference has reached a critical phase, some say progress will pick up in the two remaining weeks as countries realize time is running out. "These big conferences usually reach a low point about now," said Britain's delegate, Fiona McConnell. "It's often darkest just before the dawn."
But increasingly participants here say that the Rio meetings must be judged less on concrete agreements than on broad global initiatives to make economic development environmentally sustainable.
"Rio must be seen as the start of a process, not the end," Mr. Strong, the conference's Secretary General, said today.
The last world environmental conference, held in Stockholm 20 years ago, resulted in most governments' creating environmental ministries.
Agenda 21, the 800-page global environmental action plan, lays down new goals in virtually every field.
To carry out their part of this agenda, developing countries say they will require $70 billion in additional aid each year over the $55 billion they now receive from northern industrialized countries.
 
Relations Embittered
 Most industrialized nations are ready to make firm pledges of new resources and access to technology that will allow developing countries to make a safe transition to industrialization. But the United States continues to resist even a general commitment, even though it recently made an additional $75 million available in environmental aid for developing countries.
The result, many delegates say, has been a general embittering of North-South relations at the conference, with the Group of 77 pushing a number of demands the northern countries consider extreme, politicized and unacceptable.
In Rio, heads of state hope to adopt what is being called an "earth charter," a document northern countries foresee as a relatively short statement committing everyone to taking greater care of the environment -- "the sort of thing you hang on a classroom wall," one diplomat said.
But the Group of 77 has submitted a long draft accusing northern countries of selfishly pushing the world toward ecological disaster through their greed. The draft demands sweeping changes in life styles and consumption patterns.

HEADLINE: Former Chase Manhattan Official Named Deputy Mayor by Dinkins

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
In a move to bolster his standing in the business community, Mayor David N. Dinkins yesterday appointed Barry F. Sullivan, a well-known banker and former chairman of the First Chicago Corporation, as New York City's Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development.
Mr. Sullivan, who is 61 years old and who became known in New York City's banking industry as an innovative executive at the Chase Manhattan Bank, will remain a consultant to First Chicago at a salary of $780,000 a year, which was negotiated as part of his retirement package in December before he discussed the city job. He said his consulting work with First Chicago would be minimal and would not interfere with his duties as a deputy mayor. 
 Mr. Sullivan said yesterday that he would give his $112,000 City Hall salary to charity after he pays taxes on it.
Dinkins administration officials said yesterday that Mr. Sullivan's unusual financial arrangement with the city was not unprecedented and that Mr. Sullivan had agreed to remove himself from any city decisions that might affect First Chicago, like the sale of city bonds.
 
Gesture to Business Sector
 The appointment of Mr. Sullivan, who was recruited by David Rockefeller, his former colleague at the Chase, is seen as an attempt by the Dinkins administration to get the business community more involved in developing plans to resolve the city's mounting fiscal problems and to bolster investors' confidence in how the city is run.
Dinkins administration officials noted that during the city's last fiscal crisis, the city hired a number of private finance experts who retained paid affiliations with their respective institutions, including John C. Burton, who was appointed Deputy Mayor for Finance in 1976 but remained an officer of a major bank.
"It's critically important for the city to be able to tap into the rich resources of the business community," said O. Peter Sherwood, the Corporation Counsel for the city. "While we are hiring people with remarkable talents, we are also protecting the public interest by making sure they do not use their position for the benefit of their outside employers."
Mr. Sullivan said that through his appointment, "the Mayor is saying that the private sector is important to the city and if I can get a business expert who also understands the city, I can get a bridge between the two that I don't have today." Mr. Sullivan added that he planned to concentrate on developing small and medium-size businesses in New York City and attracting more international businesses.
He said that while he had contemplated not accepting a salary from the city, he later decided that it was important that he be paid for the work he performed. The money, he said, will be donated to New York City's parochial and public schools, Columbia University and the United Way.
Mr. Sullivan, who strengthened First Chicago's bank's venture-capital and consumer divisions, takes over as the city's chief promoter of business and development at a time when the city is struggling to overcome its worst fiscal crisis since the 1970's.
Facing mounting budget deficits, Mayor Dinkins has been under pressure from business leaders to hold down taxes and avoid drastic service cuts. But as city services decline and with the high cost of doing business in New York, many companies and investors appear to have lost faith in New York City and have moved elsewhere.
 
To Forge New Ties
 Mr. Sullivan, who has broad experience in the private sector and in public sector jobs like helping Chicago's first black mayor, Harold Washington, build links to the business community, is being brought in to forge new ties between the Dinkins administration and the business community, whose relationship has been tenuous, aides to Mr. Dinkins said.
Perhaps the most difficult challenge facing Mr. Sullivan is building new confidence among the city's business leaders and attracting new business and investments through partnerships and other arrangements.
Mayor Dinkins announced Mr. Sullivan's appointment at a City Hall news conference yesterday attended by some of the city's top business leaders, including Mr. Rockefeller, the former chairman of Chase, and Robert Tisch, the chairman of the New York City Partnership. "Mr. Sullivan's ideals, combined with his hard work and dedication, will help the city of New York and will help this government better serve the people of New York," Mr. Dinkins said.
Mr. Rockefeller first approached Mr. Sullivan about the deputy mayor job in January when city officials put the word out that they were looking for a successor to Sally Hernandez-Pinero, who resigned last month to become chairwoman of the city's Housing Authority.
Ms. Hernandez-Pinero, who had indicated that she wanted a less demanding job so that she could spend more time with her young children, had earned the respect of many in the business world, though she was initially seen by some as inexperienced and weak.
Business and community leaders yesterday praised Mr. Sullivan's appointment, which has been expected for some time but was delayed because of negotiations over his affiliation with the bank. Mr. Sullivan is scheduled to begin his new job full time on May 1 after he completes a volunteer project in Chicago to involve business executives in reviewing the finances of the city's public schools.
"The business community would like to feel that the person in that job understands its problems and can offer some creative solutions," said Tony Terraccino, chairman and president of the First Fidelity Bank Corporation. "Barry Sullivan is just that person because he's knowledgeable about business and understands its needs."

HEADLINE: Friedrich von Hayek Dies at 92; An Early Free-Market Economist

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
Friedrich von Hayek, a Nobel Prize-winning economist who was an intellectual forebear of libertarians and other advocates of free-market economics from Ronald Reagan to Margaret Thatcher to Finance Minister Vaclav Klaus of post-Communist Czechoslovakia, died yesterday. He was 92 years old.
Mr. Hayek's secretary, Charlotte E. Cubitt, confirmed his death in Freiburg, Germany, according to Edward Crane, president of the Cato Institute, a conservative American research and policy institute. 
 Mr. Hayek, a British citizen of Austrian birth who taught at the University of Chicago during the 1950's, had lived in Freiburg for nearly three decades and been ill for several years. The immediate cause of his death was not announced.
Mr. Hayek won the Nobel Prize in 1974 for his work in the 1920's and 1930's on money, prices and the causes of the business cycle. But his most famous work was a 1944 book, "The Road to Serfdom," which predicted that collectivism would fail and warned Western Europe and the United States of the dangers of socialism and big government.
 
'A Rallying Cry'
 "It provided a rallying cry for free-market intellectuals during what was for them the dark days of the 1940's," said Mr. Crane, president of the Cato Institute, said. "He proved to be very prescient."
Stephen Kresge, who is editing Mr. Hayek's collected works -- 18 books, 15 pamphlets and 142 articles -- added, "It was one of those ironies that he was widely read in Eastern Europe at a time when he wasn't being read in the West."
Mr. Hayek influenced virtually every prominent free-market economist, from Milton Friedman to George Stigler, as well as providing intellectual fodder for some of the Reagan Administration young turks, including Martin Anderson, the President's first chief domestic-policy adviser, and Paul Craig Roberts, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Policy.
An ardent opponent of most Government intervention in the economy, he was all but ignored by other economists for 30 years after World War II, although he was respected for early contributions to monetary theory.
This was a time when economic thought was most heavily influenced by John Maynard Keynes, an advocate of growth and prosperity with an important role to be played by government. Keynesianism became a dominant intellectual force, as the European social democracies boomed and the Soviet Union and other centrally planned economies scored impressive feats of industrialization.
Mr. Hayek, an extreme hawk on inflation, also laid the intellectual foundations for opposition to high taxes on inheritances or high incomes.
His following in the United States, even after he won the Nobel Prize, consisted mostly of a small band of monetary economists, including Milton Friedman of the University of Chicago, a fellow Nobelist in economics, who held that too-rapid growth of the money supply was the root of all outbreaks of inflation.
With the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe, his constituency has widened. Mr. Hayek's views on the economic inadequacies and political ills of central planning are now regarded as in the mainstream.
 
Medal From Bush

Last November, President Bush awarded Professor Hayek (rhymes with kayak) the Medal of Freedom, the United States' highest civilian honor. His son, Laurence Hayek, accepted the award.
"More than almost anyone else in the 20th century, this guy was vindicated by the events in Eastern Europe," said Austin Furse, director of policy planning at the White House.
Once described as "articulate, austere and infinitely urbane," Mr. Hayek was born in 1899, into a Viennese family of academics and civil servants.
The tall, patrician Mr. Hayek served as a gunner in World War I before earning two doctorates, one in law and a second in economics. During the 1920's, he was a member of a small circle of brilliant young Austrian economsts, including Fritz Machlup, Oskar Morgenstern and Gottfried Haberler, all of whom, like Mr. Hayek, eventually ended up at prominent American univeristies.
On the eve of the Depression, he left for the London School of Economics, where he lectured in the 1930's and 40's. He won that post by creating a stir with a series of lectures on the causes of economic booms and busts.
 
Debate With Keynes
 Soon after arriving in England, Mr. Hayek threw down the gauntlet to John Maynard Keynes by delivering a blistering review of the Treatise on Money. According to Mark Blaug, a historian and professor emeritus at the University of London, the controversy engaged almost everyone who was anyone in monetary economics in that day and was only settled, in Keynes's favor, when Keynes published his "General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money" in 1936.
When Keynesian thought prevailed and his reputation went into eclipse, Mr. Hayek turned to philosophy and psychology, which he first taught at the University of Chicago, where he wrote what many consider to be a second masterpiece, "The Constitution of Liberty." He returned to Austria in the early 1960's and finally settled in Freiburg.
"He got the satisfaction, the enormous satisfaction, not only of recognition," said Mr. Kresge, "but of seeing what has happened in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union."
In addition to his son, Mr. Hayek is survived by his second wife, Helene, and a daughter, Christine.

HEADLINE: Polish Austerity Budget Threatens Medical Care

BYLINE: By STEPHEN ENGELBERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WARSAW, March 23

 BODY:
As Poland's leaders unveiled the Government's austerity budget, Dr. Piotr Zielinski was worrying today about matters less sweeping: how many doctors to dismiss and where he might finance next week's purchases of medicine.
Dr. Zielinski, director of the Bielinski Hospital on the outskirts of Warsaw, runs one of the thousands of agencies in Poland that are already hard up for resources and will have to make do this year with even less. He is planning to lay off 30 percent of his employees this year, close down most specialized wards, and continue asking patients for voluntary contributions, even though the Polish Constitution guarantees everyone free health care. 
 Poland's economic reform plans, regarded as the boldest in Eastern Europe for the last two years, have recently been the focus of concern among Western economists. The victory of parties opposed to the reform plans in last year's parliamentary elections stirred questions of whether Poland was losing its nerve just as the reforms entered their most painful phase.
"In order to avoid a financial crash, reform must involve austerity measures," Andrzej Olechowski, the Finance Minister, told reporters today as he described a budget aimed at restoring Poland's credibility in international financial markets.
Poland is under strong pressure from the International Monetary Fund to limit its deficit to 5 percent of gross national product, about $4.5 billion.
The I.M.F. suspended approval of Poland's economic program in September, after the budget deficit began to soar out of control. A tentative agreement to reduce Poland's $46 billion international debt is contingent on maintaining the fund's approval.
The budget Mr. Olechowski sent to the Parliament today hits the 5 percent deficit target by limiting spending on health and education and by proposing something few American politicians would dare try: cuts in social security.
Mr. Olechowski said Poland's retirement system, which guarantees a pension of about 70 percent of the average industrial wage, was more generous than the country could afford, and he said the 2.5 million people receiving disability payments was well above European standards.
At the squat, gray-concrete Bielinski Hospital, Dr. Zielinski has already learned much about pinching pennies. The hospital ran out of money in October, and survived only through a public fund-raising campaign that included strategically placed collection boxes and televised appeals for contributions.
In the final months of 1991, the 685-bed hospital created waiting lists for all non-emergency surgery. The typical patient needing a hernia operation or gall bladder removal waited four to six weeks. This year the hospital is temporarily resuming its normal schedule.
Dr. Zielinski insisted that the money allocated to him by the Health Ministry was less than the bare minimum. But he acknowledged that Poland's entire system of health care encouraged waste and needed drastic reform. "We've never had to calculate the cost of anything," he said.
Until recently, the doctors at Bielinski Hospital and the adjoining outpatient clinic made house calls, and whole wards of the hospital were kept open all night with doctors on duty in case any patients walked in. Since visits to the doctor were free, some elderly people treated the outpatient clinic as a "social club" and dropped by every day, according to Dr. Zielinski.
Officials at the Health Ministry hope to set up a system of health insurance in Poland. Meanwhile, they have already put into effect a plan in which patients have to make partial payments for some of the more expensive prescription medicines. In the case of some imported antibiotics, this can mean $15 per treatment, about 10 percent of the average monthly wage of an industrial worker in Poland.
Dr. Zielinski said that shortly after this system was announced, the number of patients seeking help at the hospital's clinic dropped sharply. He attributed this both to a reduction in frivolous visits and to a fear among sick people that they would be prescribed medicine they could not afford.
 
Few Alternatives Seen
 Senior Polish officials well understand the hardships these budget cuts are bringing, but see few alternatives. One factor influencing their thinking was a confidential World Bank study, circulated this year, that said Poland stood on the brink of hyper-inflation and must slash social spending, raise taxes and end the role of workers in managing state-owned factories that still employ millions of people.
The analysts argued that Poland could lose the benefits of two years of economic austerity if it failed to tighten control over its budget -- particularly pensions -- and speed up privatization with a "drastic approach."
"Poland faces grave problems that it must overcome," the World Bank said in the draft report. "The fiscal situation has worsened to the point where hyper-inflation is an immediate danger. Unemployment reached a level that cannot be tolerated for long, even if many unemployed find some work in the informal sector."
The World Bank analysts acknowledged that Government intervention was needed to end a recession that has pushed unemployment above 12 percent. According to the report, market forces alone have failed to transform the country's state-run industries, and must be supplemented by programs that force such factories to restructure or go bankrupt.

HEADLINE: Nunn Is Optimistic On Big Aid Package For Ex-Soviet Lands

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 23

 BODY:
After a meeting with President Bush, Senator Sam Nunn, Democrat of Georgia, said today that he was "cautiously optimistic" that the President would soon push for a major aid package to help Russia and other republics of the former Soviet Union.
Senator Nunn, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and three other Senators who recently traveled with him to Moscow and Kiev, met with Mr. Bush to urge him to press ahead with aid for the republics and to tell him that he would have bipartisan support in the Senate for such a package. 
 "I am cautiously optimistic that the President is going to be more assertive and that we're going to see some kind of proposal forthcoming from the Administraton," Senator Nunn said.
The Senators said they had discussed a contribution to a multibillion-dollar fund to stabilize the ruble and the $12 billion contribution that the United States had pledged, but not approved, for the International Monetary Fund.
Senator Richard Lugar, Republican of Indiana and an influential member of the Foreign Relations Committee, said in a news briefing after the meeting, "We want him to lead and we want to support him, and we understand that a very difficult vote-getting operation will be required to get support" for such increased foreign aid.
 
Nunn Praises Russia
 The group of senators, which included John Warner, Republican of Virginia, and Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico, said Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, who attended the meeting, told them that "a large package is being examined."
Senator Nunn praised Russia for taking painful steps to build a market economy, but he said the republics were in great need of Western help to allow that transition to succeed.
"This is a critical time," he said. "My feeling is that we spend some dollars now in order to spend a whole lot less in the long run, perhaps expenditure of trillions if we have proliferation and ethnic conflict breaking out all over the former empire."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Political Memo;
On Reflection, Bush and Clinton Have Likenesses

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW LONDON, Conn., March 23

 BODY:
Moving from the hermetically sealed, high-security bubble of President Bush's entourage to Gov. Bill Clinton's campaign is a journey through the political looking glass. It is not hard to imagine the two candidates standing on opposite sides of the mirror, looking at reflections distorted by politics and circumstances but in many ways the same.
Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton are both graduates of the school of compromise, trying to get along with as many people as possible and building up networks of friends and allies through endless note-writing and constant telephoning. But the public perception could not differ more. 
 Voters rate Mr. Bush high on integrity and honesty and low on compassion and understanding of their problems. For Mr. Clinton, it is just the opposite. His just-plain-folksiness is as much a problem as Mr. Bush's aloofness, and that could drive a Bush-Clinton contest, if, as now seems likely, Mr. Clinton wins the Democratic nomination.
 
Different 'Family Values'
 If Mr. Bush has to decide how goofy is too goofy and when impressively Presidential becomes dangerously detached, then Mr. Clinton must ask: How slick is too slick? When do human flaws turn into fatal weaknesses?
The mirror images are reflected in their speeches, as Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton sound many of the same themes and make many of the same arguments, but salt them with social values that could not be more divergent. For Mr. Bush, "family values" means an anti-abortion amendment to the Constitution; for Mr. Clinton, the phrase means legalized abortion.
They even show in the atmosphere on the two men's campaign planes. Mr. Bush's is a war zone; his aides are convinced the press is out to get the candidate and at fault when the President's campaigning falls flat. Mr. Bush once courted reporters, especially when his popularity was high; but with times tougher, Marlin Fitzwater, the White House press secretary, has called them "lazy bastards."
More thick-skinned, Mr. Clinton smiled through weeks of attacks, managing to keep his plane an oasis of congeniality. When a newcomer joined the flock of reporters last week, a regular tried to persuade him that Mr. Clinton was more worthy to be President than Mr. Bush.
 
Image-Building Time
 Other images seem the same. Both staffs are virtually all-white clubs, with a woman as rare a sight on Mr. Clinton's plane as it is in Mr. Bush's entourage. Criticism of the Arkansas Governor's playing golf at an all-white club has given him a taste of Mr. Bush's struggles with his patrician image.
Even the candidates' campaign strategies seem reflected in the same glass.
After defusing Pat Buchanan's challenge, Mr. Bush has put his Boeing 747 in the hangar for a while and retreated to the White House. There, he is busy trying to look tougher than Congress and paint himself as a chief executive burdened by the responsibility of governing and trying to get the Democrats to do the right thing.
After emerging with a seemingly unassailable lead in the Democratic race, Mr. Clinton will have to pick up the pace, his aides say, not just to keep winning primaries, but to elevate himself to Mr. Bush's level.
The President's fortunes rely heavily on his ability to use the power of incumbency. Mr. Clinton must build himself up by knocking Mr. Bush down.
Barnstorming through Connecticut and New York, the Arkansas Governor presented himself as a compassionate leader and Mr. Bush as a schoolyard bully who was blaming everyone else for his misdeeds and was in need of a visit to the woodshed.
"If I had behaved that way as a young boy, my Momma would have spanked me," Mr. Clinton said, letting his Arkansas drawl slide just a little deeper into the "aw-shucks" register.
Painfully aware that Mr. Bush can schedule nationally televised speeches and meet foreign leaders to remind everyone of his stature, Mr. Clinton is planning more major speeches.
But Mr. Clinton is having trouble finding areas of disagreement on military policy, apart from his desire to keep building a submarine that Mr. Bush is willing to forgo, and slight differences on helping workers at weapons plants that will soon close.
Mr. Clinton is forced by conviction and politics to support Mr. Bush on the Persian Gulf war. To show a difference, he can only rely on Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf's assertion that the war ended a bit too soon. Mr. Bush can bring the general on stage and then go to military bases to be cheered as Commander in Chief.
Mr. Bush has not seemed to be able to get his themes in focus, give speeches without mangling his lines or show he cares about regular people. Mr. Clinton, though a compelling orator, sometimes ends up looking just a bit too facile as he exercises his ability to sound as if he has been thinking all day about the particular problems of an audience.
While polls show that many voters wonder if Mr. Bush can be trusted to be an agent of social justice and economic equity, not just a globe-trotting diplomat and warrior chief, they also show that voters do not know if they can trust Mr. Clinton at all.
Mr. Bush's aides say they look forward to exploiting Mr. Clinton's inexperience on the national stage and his other weaknesses.
Mr. Clinton has said he looks forward to crossing speeches with an opponent who cannot speak well off the cuff.
The candidates try to please their audiences in their own ways. In anticipation of the New York primary on April 7, Mr. Clinton has made much of his opposition to Mr. Bush's Middle East policies. He has not mentioned that, like Mr. Bush, he opposes Israeli settlements on the West Bank.
Mr. Bush often announces some new Federal program to benefit the state in which he is campaigning and seems to know every local politician by name.
Mr. Bush believes he cannot win without the conservative vote and Patrick J. Buchanan's assaults have forced the President further to the right. Mr. Clinton, on the other hand, is striking toward the center and the near-right and so has been able to resist pressure from the left.
Still, on Sunday, he had to sit quietly, smiling wanly, as the Rev. Jesse Jackson lectured him on responsibility and compassion and then shamed him into joining a protest march through the streets of New Haven that the Governor had planned to skip.

HEADLINE: New Foe for Seoul Party in Vote Today

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, March 23

 BODY:
South Korea's stormy politics have long been shaped by the simple rule that the conservative forces of the military, the Government and big business are always united for the often violent struggle against their common foe, the left.
But as this young democracy prepares for its most important elections in four years on Tuesday, a new challenger is shaking the governing party more than street demonstrations ever did -- a powerful opponent on the right. 
 The 76-year-old Chung Ju Yung, founder of the Hyundai group, Korea's second largest industrial conglomerate, has formed a new conservative party and opened a bitter assault on the governing party of President Roh Tae Woo in the campaign for the National Assembly.
This independent-minded, self-made millionaire has pushed ideology aside and focused his harsh attacks on bread-and-butter economic issues and political corruption. What he is offering is not a new political order so much as what he says would be a more competent one. In doing so he is initiating a debate that is likely to persist even if his quixotic campaign fails -- a debate on what role the Government should play in the economy as South Korean democracy matures.
"His involvement has really given us a shock," said Suh Song Mok, a National Assembly member from the governing Democratic Liberal Party and one of its key election strategists. "The main issue in the election has turned out to be chairman Chung, and how many seats he will win. The question is whether he takes his seats from the ruling party or the opposition."
As Mr. Suh said, the new Unification National Party has also stolen attention if not some votes away from the main opposition party, the Democrats, led by Kim Dae Jung, South Korea's foremost dissident.
Mr. Chung's message is similar to that of Ronald Reagan in the American Presidential election of 1980: He wants to get the Government off the backs of businessmen, in this case by eliminating Government shakedowns and the heavy-handed way it controls everything from what some industries produce to who gets bank loans.
"What he is saying has some appeal to the business community because they don't want to be controlled by the Government any longer," said Yang Sung Chul, a professor of political science at Kyunghee University. "Under Roh Tae Woo we have all these highs: high real estate prices, high inflation, high trade deficit, high foreign debt. People are frustrated. That's why I wouldn't be surprised if there is a protest vote."
Few expect Mr. Chung's party to win a majority of the 299 seats in the Assembly, or even to deny the Democratic Liberals a majority. But he is putting the old military-dominated power structure through a test with longer-term significance: Is it ready for genuine political pluralism?
Over the weekend, a military officer said at a news conference that soldiers were being forced into filing their absentee ballots for the governing party. With about 560,000 soldiers who vote in this way, the news was enough to bring charges of vote-rigging from the opposition. The Defense Ministry denied the charges.
Suspicions that Government agencies have been performing dirty tricks were seemingly confirmed last week when four members of the Agency for National Security Planning, which used to be called the Korean Central Intelligence Agency, were caught handing out leaflets charging an opposition politician with carrying on affairs and fathering an illegitimate child. The Government has said the four were acting on their own.
 
Long Feud With Government
 Mr. Chung, who has officially resigned from the Hyundai group, has had a longstanding feud with the Government, culminating last year in the filing of a $181 million tax case against Hyundai.
Basic economic issues and questions of honesty have pushed aside most other policy debates in the election campaign including national security. Even with the concern over reports that North Korea is developing nuclear weapons, there is almost no discussion among the candidates of how far or how fast the South should go in pushing for reunification with the hard-line Communist Government in Pyongyang.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Democrats;
Clinton's 2-Front Attack Is Slowed by More Defense of His Past

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GROTON, Conn., March 23

 BODY:
In a curious blend of defensive and offensive posturing on the day before the Connecticut primary, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas lobbed attacks at his two prime political competitors today and fended off new accusations that he used his office to benefit political supporters in his home state.
But one of those two rivals, President Bush, charged Mr. Clinton today with committing "the oldest, most crass political game in the world" by telling local shipbuilders that their project should be saved while at the same time calling for $100 billion in cuts in the military budget. 
 Mr. Clinton, traveling through the state by bus today, called the President a leader who would "do nothing" to stimulate the American economy.
"He told the American Congress to do nothing while American businesses, large, medium and small, are getting their brains beat out because we're the only country in the world without an economic strategy," Mr. Clinton said this morning at a plant gate here.
 
Much Ado About 'Do Nothing'
 Mr. Bush, at a news conference at the White House on Sunday, repeated his oft-stated pitch for Congress to cut the taxes on capital gains. He said he was "perfectly prepared to work with Congress" to stimulate the economy but would not agree to an approach that would harm more than help.
"The best thing would be to do something that would stimulate investment, but if that can't happen, then the next choice would be to do nothing and the worst choice would be to pass a tax-and-spend bill," Mr. Bush said.
Mr. Clinton seized on the "do nothing" part of Mr. Bush's statement.
"I couldn't say it any better than George Bush has," Mr. Clinton said. "He has given us his platform for the 1992 election, and I hope the American people read his lips."
In an interview with WTNH-TV in New Haven, Mr. Bush took aim at Mr. Clinton, though he did not mention his name. "I want to cut the defense budget by $50 billion," he said. "And that's based on the recommendations of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Secretary of Defense. And yet, what you're hearing from the other side is: 'Well, 50 is not enough. Let's cut it 100. But when I go to some different area or some different plant, I'll tell them I'll keep theirs open.' That's the oldest, most crass political game in the world."
Mr. Clinton today visited the shipyard here that produces the Seawolf submarine and employs 17,000 people. Mr. Bush has recommended canceling production of the two Seawolfs yet to be built under the contract.
But Mr. Clinton's anti-Bush message was muddled somewhat today as he was forced to explain away more questions from his past.
The major distraction for Mr. Clinton today was an article in The Los Angeles Times that detailed his relationship with Dan R. Lasater, an Arkansas businessman who was awarded a state contract in 1985 for a police communications system.
The article said that Mr. Clinton personally lobbied state legislators, urging their support for a $30.2 million bond contract to finance the state radio system, and that three important Democrats dropped their opposition.
The contract was awarded to an alliance that included Mr. Lasater's company and was worth $750,000 to him and his partners. Governor Clinton in 1986 called Mr. Lasater "a substantial contributor and supporter of mine."
The unsuccessful competitor was Stephens Inc., a Little Rock, Ark., concern that the Times article said had received most of the state's bond business for years. It quoted an anonymous former state Democratic official as saying that Stephens had supported Mr. Clinton's Republican opponent in two elections.
 
Pardon for Contributor
 The article also told of Mr. Lasater's guilty plea and sentencing in 1986 to two and a half years in prison for cocaine possession. After Mr. Lasater finished his sentence, Mr. Clinton granted him a state pardon in 1990.
Mr. Clinton said today that any pressure by him for the communications system was to bring business to the state, not to steer it to a friend.
Responding to recent questions about his playing golf at an all-white club, Mr. Clinton said he had led an "integrated" life. He denied assertions that the club, the Country Club of Little Rock, discriminated, saying that it let non-members like himself play there. "They let people of different races play golf there, go to social events there," he said. "They always have."
Mr. Clinton sought instead today to focus on Mr. Bush and on Edmund G. Brown Jr., the former Governor of California, who attacked Mr. Clinton in New York on Sunday by calling him "Slick Willie" and who said the President would take "Bill Clinton and grind what's left" in the fall election.
"Governor Brown doesn't serve our party very well with those kinds of violent personal attacks," he said.

HEADLINE: Shamir Is Accusing the U.S. of Trying to Rearrange Israel's Borders

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, March 23

 BODY:
Signaling that he may run for re-election with a campaign against the Bush Administration, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir accused the United States today of trying to rearrange Israel's borders even before the Middle East peace talks have had a chance to get going.
Mr. Shamir said he could never accept President Bush's insistence on a freeze on Jewish settlements in the occupied territories as the price Israel must pay for $10 billion in American loan guarantees to resettle new immigrants from the former Soviet Union. 
 "There can be only one meaning to this demand," he told hundreds of evangelical Christian pilgrims in Jerusalem. "It is an attempt to determine Israel's borders and the ultimate status of the areas in question in advance of negotiations. We shall never agree to such a step."
Once more, the Prime Minister restated his determination to build settlements in the West Bank -- "areas that are the cradle of our civilization."
"This little country is all that we have, and it is ours," he said.
 
Defensible Borders Stressed
 Mr. Shamir did not go quite as far as several of his Cabinet ministers and aides who have accused the Administration of seeking to push Israel fully back to its borders before the war in 1967, when it emerged holding lands that had been part of Syria, Jordan and Egypt. Israel maintains that it cannot properly defend itself from its pre-1967 frontiers, which a senior official in the Prime Minister's office, Benjamin Netanyahu, recently described as "the borders of Auschwitz."
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d has rejected all Israeli suggestions that the Administration, with its hard-nosed stand on settlements, was either siding with the Arabs in the peace process or interfering in Israel's parliamentary elections, scheduled for June 23.
In his speech, Mr. Shamir repeated his commitment to the peace negotiations. But it seemed from his remarks that he may now believe, as others in his Likud Party have already concluded, that there is political sense to making targets of Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker in the election campaign against the Labor Party, whose call for a one-year freeze on settlements is presumably more to the Administration's liking.
Any sort of anti-American campaign carries enormous risks, given the overwhelming importance of good relations with Washington for Israel's diplomatic and economic well-being. But feelings against the Administration are running high here these days, especially among political conservatives who tend to vote for Likud or for several small parties even further to the right.
The apparent death of the loan guarantees, the allegations in the United States that Israel had improperly re-sold American arms technology to other countries, the news reports (denied by the State Department) that Mr. Baker used a graphic Anglo-Saxon obscenity in talking about American Jews, and the fatal bombing of the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires last week -- all have combined to make many Israelis feel besieged and friendless.
"People are angry at the Bush Administration for what turned out to be an uncompromising stand on guarantees," said Ronald Kronish, head of the Israel office of the American Jewish Committee. "The feeling is that the Administration has been unduly harsh."
While it seemed likely that Labor's leaders would try to blame Mr. Shamir for the poor state of United States-Israeli relations, for in their view being the uncompromising one with his position on settlements, many Likud politicians say their own best bet is to capitalize on resentments here by running against Washington. Their argument is that they will do well by presenting themselves to voters as the ones who stood up for principle even in the face of considerable American pressure.
"The Administration is trying to destroy Israel's image in American public opinion," David Magen, Minister of Economic Planning, told the Israeli radio. There was, he said, a hostile effort to undermine Israel through a campaign of "instigation and incitement."
Apparently, Mr. Shamir is not fully comfortable with this sort of frontal assault, for at a meeting of his Cabinet on Sunday he called for restraint in dealings with the United States, this country's chief benefactor. But his speech before the Christian group today suggested that he was willing at least to test the water for such a campaign.
In his remarks, the Prime Minister said terrorism like the Buenos Aires bombing was "directed against our very existence as a state and as a people."
"The perpetrators of these dastardly crimes will fail," he said, "because they are rebelling against the march of history. They are rebelling against the will of God."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Voters;
Undertones Of Distress Hit Bastion Of G.O.P.

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GREENWICH, Conn., March 22

 BODY:
When George Bush's popularity ratings dropped, the President's aunt grew alarmed. "I was so worried about him," said Mary Herbert Walker. "In this economy, people want change."
Mrs. Walker, who is 89 years old, lives with her dog and two servants in a large white frame house in Greenwich, Conn., the town where Mr. Bush grew up. While Mrs. Walker conceded that "our friends have not been affected at all" by the recession, she said she began to worry about her nephew after talking to the man who cleans her carpets. 
 "He's a lovely man," she said, "and he adores George Bush, but he told me he thought the President had not spoken enough to the little people."
Like the President, many residents of Greenwich live at six degrees of separation from the recession. At a time when many Americans are fed up with their leaders' perks and privileges, Greenwich is the hometown Mr. Bush would just as soon forget.
"I think he would rather be a Texan than an effete Easterner," said Suzanne Schutz, a longtime resident of Greenwich.
 
A Bastion of Moderates
 While there are some who have felt the hard times in Greenwich, for many others who live in the wooded enclave of large estates, country clubs and yacht clubs not all that much has changed since the the Depression, when "Poppy," the son of Senator Prescott Bush, was driven by limousine to the Greenwich Country Day School. And most Republicans in Greenwich remain what George Bush used to be: moderate Republicans.
As Mr. Bush steers to the right to recover the conservative wing of his party, even some of his fondest hometown friends express annoyance, especially about his oppositon to abortion rights.
Russell S. Reynolds Jr., a 10th-generation Greenwich resident who is on the President's state campaign finance committee, said he was disappointed to see that Mr. Bush, who adopted staunchly conservative positions in the 1988 election and floated back toward his father's brand of moderate conservatism as President, was again listing to the right. "Everyone has the feeling that he hasn't been as strong about what he believes as he should be," Mr. Reynolds said.
There is still overwhelming support here for Mr. Bush in the Connecticut primary on Tuesday and for his re-election in November. Republicans outnumber Democrats by more than 2 to 1, and local Republican officials say there is no significant support for Mr. Bush's challenger, Patrick J. Buchanan.
 
Political Torpor Prevails
 On the last weekend before the primary, Greenwich was in an advanced state of political torpor. Mr. Bush's mother was wintering in Hobe Sound, Fla., and his brother, Prescott Bush Jr., was on a business trip to Japan. Betsy Hemingway, a longtime family friend and co-chairwoman of the President's re-election campaign in Connecticut, was in Bermuda.
On Saturday, while Mr. Buchanan made his way to a rally in Hartford, Mr. Bush's campaign workers held their first and only campaign "blitz" in Greenwich, with 15 to 20 volunteers scheduled to gather and hand out leaflets. Three showed up.
One of them, James Boutelle, 30, seemed perplexed. "Greenwich is not a rah-rah town," he said, "but you'd think that at least some of the Bush kids would be up here."
Edward D. Dadakis, chairman of the Greenwich Republican Committee, was less concerned. "We feel pretty comfortable that Greenwich is a Bush town," he said cheerfully. "His brother and mother live here. He has so many old friends, I think there is a hometown-boy feeling."
Mrs. Schutz, a volunteer at the Greenwich Historical Society, said she understood why Mr. Bush plays down his Greenwich roots. "When I was young I hated saying I was from Greenwich," she said.
 
Eschewing the 'G' Word
 Going away to college made her self-conscious about her town's image, she said, adding, "When one became aware of scholarship students, one didn't want to say the 'G' word."
Mr. Bush, who claims as his residence a hotel suite in Houston, donned a Stetson-style hat to welcome Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany to Camp David this weekend. But Mr. Bush's country-western airs do not pass muster with Claire F. Vanderbilt, president of the Greenwich Historical Society. "I don't think of him as a Texan," she said stoutly.
Just as they resist acknowledging Mr. Bush's adopted home state, many of the President's friends, and friends of his mother, have trouble accepting his stand on abortion.
Both of Mr. Bush's parents were early supporters of Planned Parenthood. The glossy coffee-table book on the history of Greenwich, published in 1989 to celebrate the 350th anniversary of the town's founding, has a chapter on Greenwich celebrities.
High on the list of favorite sons is Mr. Bush's personal physician, Dr. Burton Lee 3d, who was cited for having said he would not seek the post of Surgeon General "because he disagrees with the President's view on abortion."
Mrs. Vanderbilt had only glowing words for Mr. Bush and particularly his mother, whom she described as "a great golfer and a great do-er," but she could not resist recounting, rather gleefully, a recent anecdote about Helen Wilshire Walsh, one of Dorothy Bush's best friends. "She was so mad at George Bush about the abortion thing, she called up Dorothy and said, 'Dorothy, DO something about it.' "
Anne Symmers, a Republican district chairwoman, was one of the volunteers distributing Bush leaflets on Saturday. In her other hand she carried a petition seeking signatures in support of an abortion-rights plank in the state Republican platform.
Mrs. Symmers, a longtime tennis partner of the President's mother, whom she described as "the grande dame of the Field Club tennis courts," said she wished Mr. Bush would support the petition, but added quietly, "I imagine it's very difficult for him, what with the conservative right."
Jane Welsh, who emerged from a supermarket clutching a bouquet of daffodils to her fur coat, was less understanding. She declined to take a leaflet, saying, "I'm a lifelong, generational Republican, but I am so mad about the President's position on abortion."
She added scornfully, "I wouldn't mind if it were out of principle or morals, but it's purely political."
Misfortune is an abstract in Greenwich, a town with nine garden clubs, five animal hospitals and no homeless shelters.
When residents discuss United Parcel Service, the company that last December moved its headquarters from Greenwich to Atlanta, they measure the blow not in terms of lost jobs, but in lost contributions to local charities.
 
A 'Career Transition Group'
 Some here resent the notion that Greenwich is a pampered oasis far removed from hard times. "Greenwich is not THAT much of an island," said Philip M. Drake, senior partner at the law firm of Cummmings & Lockwood. Mr. Drake, who attended Andover and Yale with Mr. Bush, said of the recession: "You hear people talking about it, or know of a neighbor whose child was laid off."
At services today in Christ Episcopal Church, where the Bush family has long worshiped, the minister offered a prayer for the President, and also a prayer for out-of-work members of the congregation.
Still, the reversals on Wall Street have not produced any born-again Bolsheviks. "Some people are out of work but they still believe in the Republican system," said Mr. Reynolds's wife, Debbie.
Mrs. Walker, the President's aunt, said she had written to her nephew about her concerns. "I think the economy is getting better," she said. Then she paused and, in a worried voice, added: "George Bush said that TOO much. It upset people who lost their jobs."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Primary;
With Choices Now Clearer, Stakes Rise in Connecticut

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, March 23

 BODY:
A Democratic Presidential primary that was not supposed to count for much has become a fought-over prize in the last few days, with Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas and former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California both wanting and needing a strong showing before the larger New York primary on April 7.
The Connecticut primary on Tuesday will be the first to feature what is now essentially a two-man race, a situation that Mr. Brown clearly hopes to capitalize on as the remaining challenger to Mr. Clinton, the acknowledged party front-runner. 
 Mr. Brown, whose attacks on Mr. Clinton's character have drawn some Connecticut Democrats to him and alienated others, campaigned today on a more quiet but equally insistent note. He called himself the sole alternative left to what he labeled the "official candidates of a corrupt status quo," meaning both Mr. Clinton and President Bush. Mr. Brown has also sharply increased his television advertising, even outspending Mr. Clinton by several thousand dollars in the Hartford television market last weekend.
Mr. Clinton, courting the working class and minority coalitions that brought him victories in other states, spent most of his final campaign day in the hard-pressed communities of southeastern Connecticut, where cutbacks in the Pentagon's budget for submarine building have hurt cities like Groton and New London.
Even President Bush, facing what is expected to be only a modest threat by his Republican challengers, Patrick J. Buchanan and David Duke, weighed in today from the White House, granting television interviews to correspondents from the state's three network affiliates, just in time for the 6 P.M. broadcast.
 
Open Reservations
 For all the candidates campaigning in a state that has suffered some of the region's hardest blows in the recession, the task has been to appeal to voters who are frustrated and angry about the economy yet have open reservations about Mr. Brown and Mr. Clinton.
And supporters of Paul E. Tsongas, the former Massachusetts Senator, have continued to campaign here with the idea of starting a movement to draft Mr. Tsongas at the Democratic National Convention. At a rally in downtown Hartford today, a Tsongas supporter dressed as Diogenes, the philosopher of ancient Greece, rang a bell and said he was looking for "one honest Democrat."
For Mr. Clinton, the pressure to finish strongly here has forced him to take Mr. Brown's candidacy more seriously -- a drastic change from previous races in which Mr. Brown could be dismissed by the Clinton campaign as a fringe candidate.
In a church in New Haven on Sunday, for example, the two men shared a stage with the Rev. Jesse Jackson, both clearly watching Mr. Jackson's every move for signs of open endorsement. Mr. Jackson ordered the two candidates up to pulpit and onto their knees to pray, but said only that "one of them" would be the next President.
 
Haunted by Tsongas
 And as with any good melodrama, there is a ghost in the story. Mr. Tsongas, who only a few weeks ago was considered the likely winner here, abruptly suspended his campaign last Thursday for lack of money, and the question remains: Who will get his voters?
In New York, Mr. Tsongas's supporters have not decided whether to campaign on the former Massachusetts Senator's behalf. Jim Armenakis, the state chairman, said, "Paul's decision binds me not to campaign." But he added that he might reassess his position if Mr. Tsongas performed particularly well in Connecticut.
"Whatever happens, we hope his message can continue to spread throughout the electorate," Mr. Armenakis said. "He is on the ballot here and it is a legitimate option to vote for him. If there is an avalanche of support in Connecticut I expect it will happen. We will just have to wait and see."
Tom Pier, the deputy press secretary for the Brown campaign, said Mr. Tsongas's departure was the spark for Mr. Brown's redoubled efforts in Connecticut, a decision that, in turn, seems to have raised the stakes for Mr. Clinton, whose schedule has been packed with appearances everywhere from factory gates to suburban shopping centers.
 
Campaign Upheaval
 Clinton campaign workers said the Governor's strategy here has also been in upheaval. As recently as 10 days ago, they said Connecticut was Tsongas territory and that the state's 53 delegates were not worth fighting over.
Then, when Mr. Clinton started to gain strength from his primary victories in the South, Connecticut emerged as a perfect place to finish Mr. Tsongas off more cheaply than in the expensive media markets of New York. But the coup de grace came six days early, with Mr. Tsongas leaving Mr. Clinton to face Mr. Brown alone.
 
A Disadvantage for Clinton
 "He's a victim of his own success," said George Jepsen, a Democrat State Senator from Stamford, and the Clinton campaign's coordinator in Fairfield County. Mr. Jepsen said that in the Presidential campaigns in 1976 and 1984, the first primary race after the field settled to two candidates saw the No. 2 candidate pick up speed at the expense of the front-runner.
"It sets up him to get bloodied in a race like this," he said of Mr. Clinton.
And many Democrats also mentioned the narrow time frame with Mr. Tsongas departing so close to the election.
"I don't think the Democrats are ready to anoint somebody," said Mary P. Guinan, the former chairwoman of the Hartford Democratic town committee. Ms. Guinan, a Clinton supporter, said she thought the sudden "whittling down" of the choices in recent weeks has alienated many voters in this heavily Democratic city who might still settle on Mr. Clinton in November if he is the nominee, but not yet.
Hartford's mayor, Carrie Saxon Perry, however, has all but endorsed Mr. Brown, telling residents in the heavily Democratic minority neighborhoods that Mr. Brown's message is the closest to Jesse Jackson's.
 
Tsongas Voters Are Split
 A survey of Democrat town committees and interviews with registered voters today around the state indicated a split between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Brown in picking up the old Tsongas constituency. But Democrats said that people deciding between the remaining candidates were using sharply different lines of reasoning.
On policy issues, Mr. Tsongas's views are probably closer to Mr. Clinton's, with the major difference that Mr. Clinton favors a tax cut for middle income families and Mr. Tsongas did not. But Mr. Tsongas's image as a non-traditional candidate is apparently inclining other voters toward Mr. Brown.
One man said he felt like a rubber ball, bouncing between candidates who do not stay around long enough to get his vote.
"My first candidate was Tom Harkin," said Erik Franklin, a 20-year-old college student who attended a Tsongas rally in downtown Hartford. Mr. Franklin said he did not like Mr. Clinton and was leaning toward Mr. Brown, when he saw Mr. Clinton and found himself undecided all over again.
"I'm a little closer to Clinton now, having seen him," he said.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Political Week;
Brown Flails as Clinton Rolls With the Punches

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 23

 BODY:
Former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California is flailing about, spewing out charges like sparks from a Fourth of July pinwheel, in a last-ditch effort to establish himself in this week's Connecticut primary as a credible alternative to Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas.
The rest of them -- the Wilders and Kerreys, Harkins and Tsongases -- are gone now. Just Bill Clinton and Jerry Brown are left, locked in a wildly unequal struggle for the Democratic Presidential nomination. Mr. Clinton has the delegates, the endorsements, the money and the television commercials. He even has the support of the desperate workers at Groton, Conn., who build the Seawolf submarine, soon to be suspended under President Bush's military cutbacks. 
 What is left for Mr. Brown is somehow to undercut the reputation that Mr. Clinton has built up as a candidate who can survive almost anything. In that effort, the Californian is willing to utter some pretty harsh words.
In little more than 48 hours, Mr. Brown accused Mr. Clinton of economic incompetence; called him "Slick Willy," which is what his adversaries have been calling him in private for weeks but refraining from calling him in public; said that if nominated he would "ruin the whole Democratic party;" charged him with promising a lot to blacks but delivering nothing, and labeled him "the greatest bluffer to enter American politics in my lifetime."
Even if Mr. Clinton wins big, Mr. Brown is unlikely to desist. So after the votes have been counted in Hartford tomorrow night and the candidates head for the New York balloting on April 7, the Arkansas Governor can expect more of the same. More bombardment from a challenger who has absolutely nothing to lose and absolutely no expectation of future favors to temper his tongue.
In addition, Mr. Clinton faces two weeks of close scrutiny on the urban issues that plague New York City, from the homeless to AIDs to decaying housing to inadequate schools to crime to drug epidemics to disintegrating roads. To a degree, those topics were issues in Illinois and Michigan as well, but only to a degree; the New York primary will focus more attention on them than any other contest until the fall.
Perhaps he will roll with those punches, as he has rolled with so many others. What is interesting, and highly disturbing for those Democrats who have already conceded the nomination to Mr. Clinton, is that the punches keep coming, from so many directions. They keep coming partly because he has made so much progress, and each level of success brings scrutiny, but also because he keeps doing things that raise continuing questions about his judgment.
Why, for instance, having taken so many zingers over the past two months, would a candidate, whose chances for nomination and for ultimate victory depend upon black voters, play golf at an all-white country club? Why would a man who as long ago as the Vietnam War, by his own testimony, was worried about his viability as a political candidate, fly on an airplane owned by a man whose company has a reputation for polluting rivers and streams in Arkansas?
Today, The Los Angeles Times reported that Mr. Clinton lobbied legislators to approve a state bond contract benefiting a political supporter who later pleaded guilty to cocaine possession and distribution charges.
Mr. Clinton rebuts each charge as it arises and presses on. His campaign aides are now talking about using the remaining big primaries, especially those in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio and California, to begin the process of persuading the "Reagan Democrats" to come home.
The President lost New York in 1988, but he won the other four by relatively narrow margins -- 100,000 in Pennsylvania, 300,000 in California, 500,000 in Ohio and New Jersey. Most Democratic strategists think all are winnable this fall, except perhaps New Jersey, but Mr. Clinton still has to make himself and his ideas known in them.
So he will campaign hard in all with one eye on their electoral votes in the fall, the other on Mr. Brown. Mr. Bush will be stumping hard for their support, too. But so far this year he has done poorly among the Democrats and independents who backed him four years ago and made possible his successes in the big states, according to exit polls in the early primaries.
The President's attempt to take the initiative against Congress last week lacked drama, content and timing. Nothing original or unexpected about Congress-bashing, and in big-time politics, a radio speech at 4 o'clock on a Saturday afternoon is the ideal vehicle for something you want to conceal from public notice, not for something you hope will set a campaign afire.
Mr. Bush has got rid of Patrick J. Buchanan, his tormenter in the early primaries, although the conservative commentator's name remains on the ballot in Connecticut and elsewhere and might still draw some protest votes.
The President's biggest problem is that he makes the recession sound like something that happened on someone else's watch, not something that happened on his. "Just hang on and everything will be all right" is a formula for a one-term Presidency, many Republicans think, but they have pressed Mr. Bush in vain so far to lay out a grand vision of a second Bush Administration.

HEADLINE: Report Says Poor Children Grew Poorer in 1980's

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Mar. 23

 BODY:
American children grew poorer during the 1980's, were more likely to become criminals or crime victims and were less likely to live with two parents, a new study shows.
The study, released here today by a children's foundation and a research center, also showed that parents worked more but earned less, allowing them less time and money to help improve their children's lives. But some conservatives criticized the report as misleading. 
 "The risk to American children is rising," said Judith H. Weitz, coordinator of the study. "In 33 states, in which 82 percent of our children live, the condition of children worsened on more than half of the nine benchmarks. These trends constitute a pattern of national child and family neglect."
The study, conducted by the Annie E. Casey Foundation, a philanthropy for disadvantaged children, and the Center for the Study of Social Policy, a not-for-profit research group, ranked the 50 states and the District of Columbia in order of quality of life for children by calculating nine "measures of child well-being," including infant mortality rates and the percentage of children in single-parent households.
Robert Rector, a policy analyst for welfare and family issues with the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group, called half of the study's findings "pure mental rubbish."
"What Casey doesn't do is look at the physical living standards of poor children," Mr. Rector said. "What they rely on is this totally corrupt and meaningless poverty report. It ignores $150 billion worth of welfare; so it doesn't look at the children's standard-of-living conditions."
North Dakota had the highest total score in the categories, followed by New Hampshire, Utah, Connecticut and Vermont. The District of Columbia ranked lowest, behind Mississippi, Louisiana, South Carolina and Georgia.
New Jersey ranked 11th and New York ranked 36th. New Jersey ranked best in improving its violent death rate for teen-agers, which decreased 4 percent from 1984 to 1989.
The nation did worse in six of the nine measures of child well-being, remained the same in one area and improved in two, the study shows.
Nationwide, children living in poverty increased 22 percent, births to single teen-agers rose 14 percent, children in single-parent families increased 13 percent, the violent death rate of teen-agers between the ages of 15 and 19 increased 11 percent, the juvenile incarceration rate rose 10 percent and babies born with low birth weight rose 3 percent, it says.
The rise in violent deaths among teen-agers was led by a rise in suicides and homicides, Ms. Weitz said.
White single girls accounted for the majority of teen-agers having babies and showed the most significant increase in that rate, she said.
 
Mortality Rate Improved
 The infant mortality rate improved by 22 percent, the rate of child deaths between the ages of 1 and 14 declined 18 percent and the percentage of teen-agers graduating from high school stayed the same, the study found.
But while the infant mortality rate improved, a black baby was twice as likely as a white baby to die during the first year in 1989, Ms. Weitz said.
The study also shows that parents are faring worse financially than their childless counterparts. From 1979 to 1990, the median income of families with children, adjusted for inflation, fell by 5 percent, while families without children had a 7 percent increase in their income, it said.
Mirroring other accounts of the financial trend during the Reagan Administration, the study shows that richer families with children grew richer while poor ones became poorer. The average income of families in the bottom fifth income bracket fell 12.6 percent from 1979 to 1990 to $9,190, while the average income of families in the top fifth bracket increased 9.2 percent between the same years to $79,000, the study found.
Ms. Weitz said of one finding: "American families typically have less time to devote to the supervision, education and care of their children than they did two decades ago. These families are both time and money short."

HEADLINE: In Film, a Career Of Trying to Balance The Inequities of Life

BYLINE: By SHEILA RULE

 BODY:
Barbara Kopple says that she never knows what's in store when she sets out to make a documentary film and that "life has a way of taking you with it and you just have to be flexible enough to go along." After reading about plant closings and wage cuts around the nation, Ms. Kopple decided in the mid-1980's to explore how the industrial landscape had changed since she directed "Harlan County, U.S.A.," her 1977 Oscar-winning film about a coal miners' strike in eastern Kentucky.
Ms. Kopple turned to what she said she considered a "very American industry" -- meatpacking -- and traveled to Minnesota in the hope of capturing on film how harsh economic realities were affecting workers in America's heartland. She happened upon a labor dispute at the George A. Hormel Company meatpacking plant in the town of Austin. 
 "I knew there was a poignant story out there about what was happening in Middle America to people who believed in the American dream, the American work ethic, the whole notion of upward mobility, and who were watching those beliefs become unraveled," Ms. Kopple said in an interview the other day in her Manhattan loft apartment. "We had no idea of the kind of, not physical brutality, but mental brutality people would endure to try to keep decent jobs with decent pay, the kinds of things they learned to believe in all their lives. "
The 39-year-old Ms. Kopple spent five years chronicling what became a devastating strike that paralyzed Austin, turned brothers against one another and pummeled generations-old ideals into gaping emotional wounds. This resulted in "American Dream," a political and social documentary that she directed and, with Arthur Cohn, produced.
Although the film was shown at the 1990 New York Film Festival and won an Academy Award for Ms. Kopple last year (making her the only woman to be so honored twice in the documentary-feature category) its first commercial run did not start until last week, at the Angelika Film Center, in Manhattan. The film will be opening throughout the country and shown free in early April in Austin. It is only now being released, Ms. Kopple said, because it took months to work out a way to pay back an investor who wanted his money before the film opened commercially. The film was released by Prestige Films, a subdivision of Miramax.
When "American Dream" was shown at the film festival, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times: "Ms. Kopple's stirring, forthright film captures an American town, the strength of its traditions and the deep and permanent ways in which those traditions can be destroyed. Her work is as important as it is good."
Ms. Kopple made "American Dream" the way she made "Harlan County": by getting close and intimate. She immersed herself in the Austin community, lived with its people and let them get to know and trust her. That trust made it possible for proud, strong union men to sit in front of the camera and cry when talking about no longer being able to provide for their families.
 
Leading to a Strike
 The film shows what happened to Austin after Hormel tried to roll back its meat processors' wages in 1984 to $8.25 an hour from $10.69. In the process, the documentary asks fundamental questions about the survival of union traditions in 1990's America. Resisting the idea of lower wages, Local P-9 of the meatpacking division of the United Food and Commercial Workers' Union rebelled against both Hormel and its own international parent union. As a strike became inevitable, the local met opposition even inside its own ranks. Workers went on strike in August 1985.
By the end of the film, P-9's parent union has thrown out the rebels and, nearly a year after the strike began, made its own settlement with Hormel. They agreed on a $10.25 wage but made no allowance for restoring jobs to those who honored the picket lines; their names were instead placed on a waiting list. In 1989, Ms. Kopple notes in a closing title, Hormel rented half its Austin plant to a manufacturer who paid only $6.50 an hour.
"As you're filming, you see themes emerge," said Ms. Kopple, who used a two-member crew, made up of a cameraman and herself as sound technician. The film cost nearly $1 million and, in addition to the investor's financial backing, was made with contributions from foundations, church groups and others. "For me, what emerged was that we are not living in a very humane society and workers in this country shouldn't have to make choices that these people made and that these are systemic problems."
 
A Confidence Bred in Childhood
 Ms. Kopple's "Harlan County, U.S.A." was chosen in 1990 by the Library of Congress as 1 of 25 films to be placed on its Film Registry, tantamount in film terms to conferring it the status of a national treasure. Like "American Dream," it had a strong political theme. But Ms. Kopple said she herself was not so much political as socially conscious and a person who "really cares what happens to people." She says she feels confident taking risks. When she made "Harlan County," serious, independently made documentaries were not crowd-pleasers at movie theaters nor widely distributed -- hers was the breakthrough -- and at one point in filming "American Dream" she had only $275 left for the project.
She says she owes that confidence in part to her experience of growing up in affluent Scarsdale, N.Y., where life was stable and centered on family, community and education, allowing her to "grow up believing that there was nothing I couldn't do in my life." Protective of her private life, she will say only that she has a "loving mate and child." Her uncle is the playwright Murray Burnett, a co-author of the play "Everybody Comes to Rick's," on which the screenplay for "Casablanca" was based.
Ms. Kopple studied clinical psychology at Northeastern University in Boston for a while but decided to return to New York. While taking a course in cinema verite at the New School, she was told that David and Albert Maysles -- brothers regarded as two of the founders of the genre and makers of such documentaries as "Gimme Shelter" and "Salesman" -- needed help. Ms. Kopple ended up working with them, learning a lot about film making and deciding that it was what she wanted to do with her life.
 
For Oliver Stone
 In addition to her award-winning documentaries, Ms. Kopple has directed or co-directed the documentaries "Winter Soldier," about Vietnam veterans; "No Nukes," which included performances by Bruce Springsteen and Bonnie Raitt; "Civil Rights: The Struggle Continues," and "Out of Darkness: The Mine Workers Story." She also directed a dramatic feature, "Keeping On," a 1983 American Playhouse presentation about union organizing among millworkers in a Southern town. She recently completed "Beyond J. F. K.: The Question of Conspiracy," a documentary about those who witnessed, wrote books and developed theories about the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, which she made at the request of the director Oliver Stone. Her next project will be a feature film titled "Women," about four men, love and relationships.
"My overall goal," Ms. Kopple said of her documentary work, "is to let people speak and let them be heard, because what they are saying is really important, as important or more important than anything President Bush has to say. It's to film stories about people that you wouldn't ordinarily get to see. To think that these people's stories are going to be shown, that other people will hear them, as a film maker that gives me a tremendous amount of strength to carry on."

HEADLINE: Critic's Notebook;
Downfall of the American Family

BYLINE: By JOHN J. O'CONNOR

 BODY:
Television has no problem these days casting a friendly snicker at the depictions of family life in old series like "Ozzie and Harriet" or "Leave It to Beaver." The traditional nuclear family in America has long been an endangered species. Adults have been known to recall growing up neurotic because life at home did not measure up to the warm togetherness shown on "Father Knows Best." Upbeat programming has its downside.
The patronizing air toward old series, however, carries an implicit message: television today is so much more gritty and attuned to reality. Is it? While headlines tell almost daily horror stories of families in crisis, of neglect and violence, of more and more children slipping beneath the poverty line, prime-time entertainment continues to provide bromides. What happens when a youngster gets into a bit of trouble on tough urban streets? Why, Mom simply sends him off to live with wealthy relatives in California and, presto, you have "Fresh Prince of Bel Air." Slick, squeaky clean and pure fantasy. 
 But there is always the news-and-public-affairs side of the television ledger and, no doubt because this is an election year, activity there is on a noticeable upswing. As it happens, the American family is the hot subject of choice. Last week, for instance, Wednesday's edition of "48 Hours" on CBS remembered how a year ago the White House insisted that the economic downturn would be brief and mild. Well, said Dan Rather, it's now serious, and that point was driven home in a series of vignettes about unemployed husbands, home auctions and booming businesses for bankruptcy lawyers. The American dream now, one couple said, is survival.
CBS, though, would not be denied its upbeat spins. Mr. Rather spoke of "confidence shaken, but as you'll see, tough times have not crushed the American spirit." For a finale, one unemployed fellow, one of the nine million men and women out of work across the nation, found a new job. Mr. Rather smiled encouragingly.
NBC's "Brokaw Report," broadcast on Friday, was refreshingly less interested in positive packaging than in harsh facts. In the first of what will be a periodic series of special reports on social and political issues facing Americans, Tom Brokaw offered "Families in Crisis." There were reports on families in which both parents had to work full time, leaving little time for their children; single mothers in the inner city, and the effects of divorce in a nation that has the highest divorce rate in the world.
Armed with several powerful vignettes, Mr. Brokaw would pause at points to recite the simple, grim facts, among them: 45 percent of American families headed by a single mother live in poverty; 65 percent of black children live in a family headed by a single mother; a black child born today has an 87 percent chance of spending some years in a single-parent home. In the last 20 years, Mr. Brokaw said, there have been 16 major American-family studies commissioned by the Federal Government, all "slick and impressive," but the overall condition "has only gotten worse." His gloomy and quite reasonable conclusion: "We're falling behind."
Tomorrow night at 9 on Channel 13, "Families First With Bill Moyers" devotes 90 minutes to exploring a promising alternative to putting children in foster homes, a system that costs taxpayers $9.1 billion a year. Mr. Moyers and his producers -- Gail Pellett and Damon Williams -- visit families in Missouri, Kentucky and Michigan. Each has gone through a crisis, encompassing anything from drug addiction to abusive behavior, and each has been helped by an innovative approach known as family preservation services.
Now being used in more than 30 states under a variety of names, family preservation services fights the unnecessary removal of children from their homes. As one social worker puts it: remove the risks, not the children; put the family first. One worker can spend from 4 to 8 intensive weeks with a family, on 24-hour call, constantly teaching and strengthening parental skills. Some of the assistance is purely practical, including sprucing up a rundown home, and some involves psychological counseling. A few efforts fail, but enough succeed to raise serious questions about Washington's traditional focus on out-of-home care. The stories collected by Mr. Moyers and staff are certainly persuasive.
Abysmal housing, drug-damaged adults and children, overwhelmed agencies, guns in schools, the spreading phenomenon of "throwaway" children: not a pretty picture, certainly, but one that demands at least as much exposure as the latest batch of entertainment sitcoms. Television sometimes gets it right.

HEADLINE: Letters to a Supporter Record Einstin's Search for Proof

BYLINE: By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD

 BODY:
ASKED how he would have felt had there been no experimental confirmation of his general theory of relativity, Albert Einstein is supposed to have remarked, "Then I would have felt sorry for the dear Lord -- the theory is correct."
Yet Einstein, knowing that the theory and his reputation could stand or fall on the results of certain rigorous tests, was keenly interested in the work of one young ally, Erwin Findlay Freundlich. Years before the theory was perfected and published in 1916, Einstein was advising and encouraging Dr. Freundlich, an astronomer at the Royal Observatory in Berlin, to conduct two astronomical observations that could prove or disprove his revolutionary concept of space, time and gravitation. 
 The nature and importance of their collaboration, especially in the period of Einstein's greatest creativity, comes into sharper focus in 25 previously unpublished letters and postcards from Einstein to Dr. Freundlich that have just been given to the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York. The correspondence had been in private hands and generally inaccessible to the public or most scholars.
The letters document the development of crucial aspects of Einstein's general theory of relativity, including all three predictions that were eventually verified by experiments or observations. One letter includes what may be the first illustration of the curvature of light, an astrophysical phenomenon predicted by the theory.
The general theory of relativity explains the force of gravity in terms of the curvature that space undergoes in the vicinity of massive objects. Einstein predicted that light passing through such a curved space would itself follow a curving path, and this prediction was confirmed by observation of the deviation of light from a star as the light passed close to the Sun on its way to the Earth. Another prediction based on Einstein's theory was that light passing a massive object would undergo a reddening, and the theory also predicted that a clock near a very massive object would run slower than one distant from such an object. All these predictions have been confirmed.
Robert E. Parks, curator of autograph manuscripts at the library, said this was one of the most important collections of Einstein letters from the crucial years of 1911 to 1921, when Einstein was formulating the general theory of relativity and waiting for experimental confirmation. They reveal in more detail than before Dr. Freundlich's role as a disciple, perhaps the first scientist to become thoroughly acquainted with the fundamental principles of Einstein's theory, and as the first person to try to provide experimental proof of the predicted consequences of the general theory.
In one test, Dr. Freundlich was successful. In the other, more critical test, the bending of starlight as it passes through the gravitational field of a massive object like the Sun, he probably would have been successful if World War I had not intervened. Dr. Freundlich's experimental ideas, which are discussed in this correspondence, eventually prevailed, though others got most of the credit.
Dr. Martin J. Klein, a professor of science history at Yale University who is senior editor in charge of publishing the complete Einstein papers, said the new collection at the Morgan was quite important in understanding the development of Einstein's ideas.
He described Dr. Freundlich as a moderately important figure in Einstein's career, someone who "certainly was supportive, especially in the early years."
Scholars say there are as many as 50,000 documents in the Einstein archive. Publication of the papers, a project centered at Boston University, could run to as many as 30 volumes. Only two volumes have been printed; a third is at the press now, and volumes four and five should go to press later this year, Dr. Klein said.
Einstein biographers, though aware of Dr. Freundlich's role as a disciple and experimentalist, have made little or no use of this correspondence. But Ronald W. Clark, author of "Einstein: The Life and Times," cited the letters as an essential primary source of Einstein's early work and repeated one quotation from a letter Einstein wrote to Dr. Freundlich in September 1911.
At the time, Dr. Freundlich was frustrated in his attempts to measure the deflection of light caused by the planet Jupiter. Einstein's response is consoling and philosophical.
"If only we had a considerably larger planet than Jupiter!" Einstein wrote in a letter from Prague. "But nature has not made it a priority to make it easy for us to discover its laws."
Dr. Klein said this was "a typical Einstein remark."
 
Close Working Relationship
 Dr. Freundlich was born in Biebrich, Germany, in 1885 of a German father and Scottish mother. After earning a doctorate at Gottingen University, he went to work at the Berlin observatory, where he was introduced to Einstein, who at the time was having trouble finding astronomers to search for experimental proofs to his still unpublished general theory.
Thus began a close working relationship and the businesslike correspondence from 1911 to 1931. The letters and postcards acquired by the Morgan represent all but a few that Einstein is believed to have written to Dr. Freundlich. They had been acquired from Dr. Freundlich's widow by Horace Wood Brock, an economist and rare-document collector in Menlo Park, Calif. Mr. Brock donated the correspondence to the Morgan Library, adding to its growing collection of papers of famous scientists.
Most of the Einstein letters are handwritten, with the "very neat, regular penmanship of a German schoolboy," as Mr. Parks observed. In the tradition of those more formal times, most of the letters begin, Liebe Freundlich!, or Dear Freundlich, and are signed simply, Einstein or A. Einstein.
In some of the early letters, Einstein discusses various theories of gravitation and expresses confidence in his work. From Zurich in October 1913 he wrote, "My theoretical efforts are finally progressing well after a period of indescribably troublesome search, so that there is every expectation that the equations of the general dynamics of gravitation will soon be set up."
The first collaboration between Einstein and Dr. Freundlich was an investigation of the motion of the planet Mercury. Slight quirks in Mercury's orbit around the Sun had been observed for years, and could not be fully explained by Newton's laws of gravity. Dr. Freundlich's telescopic studies between 1911 and 1913 confirmed that Mercury's position conformed to Einstein's predictions based on equations of the general theory as they pertained to the Sun's gravitational effect in warping what is known in Einsteinian physics as spacetime.
 
Einstein Is Left Speechless
 Dr. Freundlich's Mercury results, Mr. Clark writes in his biography, left Einstein "speechless for several days with excitement." But they would remain controversial until they were duplicated by Sir Arthur Stanley Eddington, the British astronomer, and other scientists had a chance finally to read Einstein's general theory, published in 1916.
Meanwhile, Einstein was encouraging Dr. Freundlich's second approach to testing the theory. The astronomer was planning an expedition to the Crimea to observe a total eclipse of the Sun. Discussing the eclipse experiment, Einstein said in a letter to Dr. Freundlich that "in this matter you astronomers can do an invaluable service to theoretical physics."
If Einstein's theory was correct, light of a background star, or any type of radiation, should bend while passing through warped spacetime near a massive object like the Sun. This deflection of light should be twice as great as would be accountable under Newton's laws.
During an eclipse it should be possible to see starlight passing close enough to the Sun to be so affected by solar gravity. The star should appear displaced from its normal position. But Dr. Freundlich was unable to make the test. World War I broke out in August while he was in Russia on the way to the Crimea. He was briefly interned by the Russians when they declared war on Germany.
Not until 1919 was the crucial eclipse test conducted. Sir Arthur and other British astronomers, observing on an island off the west coast of Africa, applied the techniques Dr. Freundlich had elaborated in 1914 and saw the displacement of starlight in accordance with Einstein's theory.
Although Sir Arthur was thus recognized as the first person to prove the general theory experimentally, the British astronomer later acknowledged to Einstein, "It seems unfair that Dr. Freundlich, who was first in the field, should not have had the satisfaction of accomplishing the experimental test of your theory."
In recent years, the bending of light phenomenon has been verified repeatedly in tests involving spacecraft exchanging radio signals when they were positioned so that the waves would pass close to the Sun and be deflected by its gravity.
 
Concept Confirmed in 1960's
 Dr. Freundlich drew attention to a third experiment, though he lacked the facilities for making the necessary observations. According to the general theory, the wavelength of light should be increased in the presence of a strong gravitational field like the Sun's, owing to a loss of some energy as the light or any other radiation was striving to escape the gravity. The phenomenon was confirmed in laboratory tests in the 1960's at Harvard University.
In 1918, Dr. Freundlich became Einstein's full-time assistant. After the world war, he raised money to establish the Einstein Observatory in Potsdam, becoming its first director and working alongside Einstein. This proximity accounts for the hiatus in their correspondence through most of the 1920's. When it was resumed briefly in 1931, Einstein was expressing some of his ideas for a theory unifying all the forces of nature, a goal that still defies scientists.
Both Einstein and Dr. Freundlich left Germany after Hitler came to power, and apparently had no further correspondence with each other. Dr. Freundlich wound up his career as an astronomer at St. Andrews University in Scotland, the land of his mother. Einstein died in 1955, and Dr. Freundlich in 1964.

GRAPHIC: Photos/Drawings: Albert Einstein (Lauren Uram); In correspondence with Erwin Findlay Freundlich, like the postcard at right (probably dating from 1911), Einstein bounced theories off his colleague and disciple. The card discusses some formulas related to Newtonian physics and asks (on the reverse) whether it is possible to observe stars close to the Sun in broad daylight. Freundlich pursued such observations in an effort to get proof of the predicted consequences of Einstein's general theory of relativity. (David A. Loggie/Peirpont Morgan Library) (pg.C1); The New York Times's headline from Nov. 10, 1919, tells of triumph of Einstein's theory. Letters are to Erwin Findlay Freundlich, German astronomer. The one at the left discusses Dr. Freundlich's problems at work in 1916. In 1917, Einstein sent him this diagram, center, showing the curvature of light. (David A.

HEADLINE: SOCCER;
Different Cup of Soccer, Even Indoors, in 1994

BYLINE: By FILIP BONDY

 BODY:
Narrow field? A mere technicality.
Artificial grass? Call the gardener. 
 Geographic isolation? Domed stadium? Crumbling stands? No big deal.
The operating word yesterday at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York was accommodation, as international and United States soccer officials announced nine very American venues for the 1994 World Cup while trying to fit their symmetrical old sport to the imperfect New World.
The winning bids, which could pump hundreds of millions of dollars into local economies were: Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J.; Robert F. Kennedy Stadium in Washington; Foxboro Stadium near Boston; Soldier Field in Chicago; the Cotton Bowl in Dallas; the Citrus Bowl in Orlando, Fla.; Stanford Stadium in Palo Alto, Calif., the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif.; and the Pontiac Silverdome in Michigan.
 
Willing to Change
 This last piece of news about the sky-less, grass-less Silverdome, more than any other tidbit, demonstrated the flexibility brought to the table by FIFA, the governing body of world soccer, and World Cup USA organizers. A fresh layer of sod and some growth lights would be enough.
"To play in a dome, in a hole, shows the open spirit in FIFA," said Joseph Blatter, general secretary of FIFA. "We'll have a look if it works before the World Cup. Otherwise, we could have a mess, and we will not take a risk."
The top soccer officials were willing to tinker with the geometry of the sport, approving fields at Giants Stadium, the Silverdome and possibly at Foxboro that a few feet narrower than regulation; with the environment of the sport, playing indoors at the Silverdome; and even with the organization of the tournament.
This time around, every stadium will host top-seeded teams from two of the six different groups, each group composed of four soccer nations that have qualified through preliminary matches. Early round-robin matches involving two groups will be split among three venues, instead of the traditional World Cup setup of a single, four-team group assigned to two venues.
Giants Stadium, which will sprout instant grass a month before the tournament begins in June 1994, could be the host of matches for both Italy and another top-seeded team, possibly Brazil or Argentina. Tentatively, New Jersey, Foxboro and Orlando make up one set of host venues; Dallas, Los Angeles and Stanford represent another; Pontiac, Foxboro and Chicago are the third. Travel will be arduous, but not prohibitive, generally allowing three days between matches and not extending over more than one time zone.
In addition, the schedule of the matches has been skewed, so that four matches nationwide will be played each day on the weekends during the first round.
"We went through all the mathematics," Blatter said. "This was the best exposure for soccer."
Each venue, it seemed, had its pluses and minuses, its dimples and warts. Atlanta missed out because Bobby Dodd Stadium was too small. Orlando was selected over Tampa Bay because it had Disney World and over Joe Robbie Stadium in Miami because of impending baseball expansion.
Foxboro Stadium, despite its ragged condition, beat out the Yale Bowl, because of New Haven's proximity to Giants Stadium. The duty yesterday morning fell upon Ross Berlin, senior vice president for World Cup USA, to inform New Haven investors and the other losers of their sad, non-soccer fates.
 
'There's Some Bitterness'
 "Some of them had been with us for two and a half years, and it gets personal," he said. "There's some bitterness from the folks in New Haven, and I understand that."
There are still many unresolved matters. Eight of the nine venues will probably be the host for a second-round match, but it will not be known until June which stadiums will be awarded the ceremonial opening match, the quarterfinals, the semifinals and the final. After these announcements, tickets will be put on sale.
The United States, as host, and Germany, as defending champion, are automatically qualified for the tournament. The 22 other nations will be qualifying until November 1993. When the final field is set, a draw will be held and teams will be assigned to stadiums. World Cup USA will have the right to fit certain teams to certain regions, to draw upon natural ethnic populations.
Speculation is that the United States national team will be assigned to the Dallas-Los Angeles-Palo Alto grouping, Germany to the Chicago-Detroit-Boston area, and Italy to New Jersey-Washington-Orlando.
"Italy has taken a strong, unequivocable position that it wants to be near New York," said Scott LeTellier, managing director of World Cup USA. "We've heard from people in New York that they want Italy here."
"Subject to those two caveats," LeTellier said, with an understood wink, "no decisions have been made."
 
Which State Is It?
 When the World Cup sites were announced yesterday, The Giants Stadium venue in East Rutherford, N.J., was introduced simply as New York. But that apparently didn't bother Gov. Jim Florio of New Jersey. "Anybody can bask in glory," Florio said moments after he watched the announcement of the names of the venues, "but we will have the games that will showcase our state, unite our communities and bring some revenue to the state."

HEADLINE: A Banker With a Fondness for Public Affairs

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
Barry F. Sullivan, New York City's newly appointed Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development, is a Jesuit-educated native of the Bronx who turned down a chance to play basketball with the New York Knicks before beginning a lifelong career in banking that culminated in the chairmanship of the First Chicago Corporation, one of the nation's largest banking concerns.
For a city that faces deep financial difficulties, a banker of Mr. Sullivan's stature brings not only a thorough understanding of how capital markets work but also of the fiscal realities of large city governments and the kinds of contacts and friends that go along with being at the helm of an important financial institution. 
 Mr. Sullivan, 61 years old, retired on Dec. 31, 1991, from First Chicago, and as part of his retirement package, will continue there as a consultant. The consulting agreement will allow him to collect what amounts to his base salary of $780,000 for three more years. While no board members have suggested that Mr. Sullivan was forced out, such arrangements are typical in the banking industry when a bank's board decides it is time for a change at the top.
Mr. Sullivan spent nearly a dozen years at First Chicago and, before that, was executive vice president of the Chase Manhattan Bank.
According to banking analysts, Mr. Sullivan's track record at First Chicago was mixed. On the one hand, he is lauded for First Chicago's solid capital base and for the bank's successful foray into the credit-card business. On the other, he is criticized for failing to seize opportunities to turn First Chicago into a super-regional star. The value of the bank's stock, for example, is little higher today than in 1980, when Mr. Sullivan became the chief executive officer.
 
Timing of Expansion
 In particular, several analysts said, he waited too long to expand new businesses and was too slow to cut back in old ones. "First Chicago under Sullivan was reluctant to cut expenses," said Judah S. Kraushaar, a bank analyst at Merrill Lynch. "Toward the end of his chairmanship, there were a fair amount of calls from investors to accelerate the pace of retrenchment."
One thing that made Mr. Sullivan attractive to the Dinkins administration is his long involvement in public affairs, including his positions on the city of Chicago's Financial Planning Committee, a group of business executives that analyzed Chicago's fiscal problems and proposed solutions.
He graduated from a Jesuit school, Regis High, in Manhattan and played college basketball at Georgetown University in Washington. After turning down a chance to play professional ball, he joined the Army in 1952 during the Korean War. He finished his college degree at Columbia University and, after a year as a management trainee at Inland Steel, he earned an M.B.A. at the University of Chicago Business School.
Most of Mr. Sullivan's banking career was spent not in Chicago but in New York at the Chase, where he steadily rose through the managment ranks in the 1960's and 1970's. He left Chase for First Chicago in 1980.
He and his wife Audrey, who plan to live in Bronxville, have four sons, a daughter and two grandchildren.
"He understands the unique differences between big companies and big cities," said John Rau, chairman of the Banking Research Center at the Kellogg Graduate School at Northwestern University and former chief executive officer of the LaSalle National Bank. "He's no babe in the woods, politically, nor will he be a bull in a china shop."

HEADLINE: Delay Sought For Limits On Pollution

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 23

 BODY:
On the same day that a state board gave final approval to a regulation placing strict new limits on motor vehicle emissions, the State Senate passed legislation that would delay putting the rules into effect.
The debate on the legislation, which has pitted the protection of the state's environment against concern for its faltering economy, now moves from the Senate, which has a Republican majority, to the Assembly, which is controlled by Democrats. Supporters of the bill believe it faces an uphill fight there, but environmental groups are not taking the vote for granted. 
 The bill found a measure of bipartisan support in the Senate, where it passed 38 to 19. The legislation was supported by 30 of the 34 Republicans who voted today and by 8 of the 23 Democrats.
 
Fear for Jobs
 The bill's supporters have charged that the regulations could cost the state thousands of jobs in the petroleum and automobile industries, including automobile manufacturing and assembly jobs. A recent petroleum industry study, which has been derided by state environmental officials, projected that the standards could eliminate up to 66,000 jobs.
"The good news is we don't have an environmental crisis," said Senator Owen H. Johnson, Republican of West Babylon, L.I., the bill's sponsor. "The bad news is we have an economic crisis."
The bill's opponents, including the Environmental Conservation Commissioner, Thomas C. Jorling, contend that delaying the regulations would harm the quality of the state's air and could cost the state billions of dollars in Federal transportation aid if New York is found in violation of the Federal Clean Air Act of 1990.
The state's Environmental Board, whose chairman is Mr. Jorling, voted unanimously at an afternoon meeting to adopt the new rules on motor vehicle emissions, which are known as the California standards.
The standards would require automobile manufacturers to sell a higher proportion of cleaner vehicles over the next 14 years. By 2003, for instance, 10 percent of the cars sold in New York would have to be rated as zero-emission vehicles -- most likely electric cars.
The bill passed by the Senate would delay adoption of the California standards until a commission studies whether they are the best way to meet the Federal requirements.
 
Election-Year Conflict?
 In the Assembly, the legislation is sponsored by Michael J. Bragman, a Cicero Democrat who is chairman of the Transportation Committee. Environmentalists said they feared that Mr. Bragman who is also the new chairman of the Democratic Assembly Campaign Committee, the primary fund-raising group for Democratic incumbents would promote the bill to his colleagues as a vehicle for collecting election-year contributions from petroleum and automobile companies.
Mr. Bragman vehemently denied the charge today. "I am personally offended that anyone would raise that issue in regard to this legislation," he said. "There's a wide spectrum of support for this bill."

HEADLINE: Brazil and Argentina Loan Talks Progress

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Talks by American and foreign bankers with officials of Brazil and Argentina about $78 billion of past-due loans and interest are progressing faster than expected and may result in an agreement that allows banks to recover more than they had expected, bankers said yesterday.
After Argentine officials presented a proposal to bankers at a meeting in New York yesterday, William Rhodes, vice chairman of Citicorp, issued a statement saying that he was "optimistic that we can have an agreement in principle with either one or both of those countries" within two weeks. 
 Ronald Mandle, a banking analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, a securities firm, said the agreements "at a minimum show that the banks have adequate reserves for their Latin American loans, and it's possible that the loans will be seen to have more value than they are now showing on the banks' books."
Mr. Mandle added that the lending banks' revenues would increase as the two countries repaid past-due interest in cash or with bonds and as they make on-time payments in the future.
The likelihood of new loan agreements with Brazil and Argentina has not much helped the stock of large banking companies like Citicorp and the Chemical Banking Corporation, because those banks face new losses from bad real estate loans, analysts said.
Because the loan agreements are not final, bankers declined to discuss the tentative terms. But sources close to the talks said that Brazil was close to agreeing to pay about 65 percent of its $41 billion in past-due international bank loans, while Argentina might pay 67.5 percent of its $23 billion of delinquent loans.
Both countries are expected to agree to plans whereby bankers could choose repayment of their full loan amounts at reduced interest rates or accept a reduction in loan amounts but receive higher interest rates.
 
Past-Due Interest
 Both countries have also accumulated large bills for past-due interest, which are part of the debt talks with banks. Brazil has already paid in cash $2 billion of its past-due interest and has said it will pay the remaining $6 billion with new bonds of undetermined value when an agreement has been reached on the other parts of its debt. Argentina is still talking about repayment terms for its $7.5 billion of past-due interest.
Argentina, which expects to get a $3.6 billion extended credit line from the International Monetary fund next week, is in a stronger financial position than Brazil, which has a standby credit agreement with the I.M.F. of only $2.1 billion.
The money from the I.M.F., plus funds from the Inter-American Development Bank and the Japanese Export-Import Bank, will be used by the two countries to guarantee some of the interest and principal payments on their debts.

HEADLINE: Rift Over Services Emerges at Trade Talks

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: GENEVA, March 23

 BODY:
Trade diplomats are now saying that disagreements over services, ranging from banking to telecommunications and sea transportation, could be nearly as damaging to trade talks as the quarrel between the United States and the European Community over farm subsidies.
 The agricultural disagreement has been widely blamed for delaying completion of the so-called Uruguay Round of negotiations for free world trade, held under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
 "We are in trouble -- no doubt about that," said one official close to the talks, begun in 1986 in Punta del Este, Uruguay.
 [Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, told reporters in Washington last Wednesday that many countries had stopped negotiating on services while waiting to see the outcome of the talks between the United States and the European Community on agriculture. Trade negotiators planned to spend February and March discussing services and the reduction of trade barriers for manufactured goods but have lost much time debating agricultural issues, she said.]
The services hurdle appeared again today after key delegations to the trade talks presented their initial commitments on opening their service markets and presented lists of sectors where they want to keep restrictions.
 
 
Europeans Criticize U.S. Stand
 Some European Community officials, insisting that they had no wish to point fingers, but speaking on condition that they not be identified, said the problem lay with a United States desire to exclude sea transport, financial and air transport services and telecommunications from rules that would bar countries from discriminating in favor of domestic companies.
 Such rules essentially mean that all nations party to an agreement face the same barriers or tariffs.
 The European Community officials say omission of these key sectors would exclude around 75 percent of potential exchanges from an agreement on trade in services, which was expected to emerge from the negotiations.
 "Seen from that perspective, it would cast a huge shadow of doubt over whether we can get" a services agreement, said one neutral diplomat. "And if we fail there, it will reduce further the chances of getting an all-round agreement."
 But another trade diplomat sympathetic to the United States position argued that a services agreement only made sense if enough countries came on board with pledges of broad liberalization measures -- and said that so far not enough had done so.
 
Surge of Protectionism Feared
 A collapse of the exhausting round of talks, originally due to end in December 1990, would deal a bitter blow to the recession-hit world economy and could possibly lead to a surge of trade protectionism and the emergence of closed trading blocs.
 Until now, the dispute over the European Community's subsidies to its farmers -- which the United States and other agricultural producers say must be cut sharply -- seemed to be the only real barrier to wrapping up the round on a high note.
 On Sunday, President Bush and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany said after a weekend of talks at Camp David, Md., that they had agreed to work together for a successful outcome and that the talks should be completed by the end of April at the latest.
 They announced no breakthrough on agriculture, and did not publicly identify concerns about services.

HEADLINE: Chrysler's Star May Flare Again

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 23

 BODY:
If Robert J. Eaton had joined the Chrysler Corporation just a year ago, he would have been signing up to rescue a sinking ship.
 But in just the last two months Chrysler's prospects suddenly seem brighter. With $861 million of new equity raised in February, a slew of new models about to roll into showrooms and layers of corporate fat sliced away, the nation's No. 3 auto maker appears poised for yet another of its comebacks. In other words, the task of Mr. Eaton, formerly the head of General Motors' European operations, is to keep several good things going at Chrysler. 
 By the time he becomes chairman and chief executive on Jan. 1, he must swiftly head off any political infighting, assemble his own team from Chrysler's cadres and reassure bankers and credit-rating agencies that the auto maker is truly on the mend.
Failing any of these tasks could be fatal, for Chrysler finally has some momentum after four years of declining profits, and a loss last year, as well as a bitter and divisive two-year power struggle as the company tried to find a successor to Lee A. Iacocca. That struggle could reignite at any moment if Mr. Eaton is unable to assert his leadership and reconcile contending factions.
 "Chrysler managers have been working extremely well together for the past two years -- like a championship basketball team," said Ronald A. Glantz, automotive analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds in San Francisco. "I worry how a new star player will affect the chemistry."
Most important, Mr. Eaton must learn to manage the fragile chemistry among himself, Mr. Iacocca and Robert A. Lutz, Chrysler's president and the man passed over for Mr. Iacocca's job, who says he plans to stay at the company.
David E. Davis, editor of Automobile magazine, said: "I think Lutz and Eaton can make it work. But it remains to be seen if Iacocca will let them."
Mr. Davis added: "A real determined effort has to made to stamp out all the backbiting. There's still blood in the water where Lutz is concerned."
 Although Mr. Eaton was a highly regarded engineering executive at G.M., he had relatively little experience as an operating executive deeply involved in making and selling cars day to day. Nor does he have deep experience in sales, marketing or finance.
 
Encountering Success
 Analysts point out that G.M.'s success in Europe was well under way by the time Mr. Eaton arrived, thanks to John F. Smith Jr., G.M.'s executive vice president in charge of international operations. Under G.M.'s European management system, Mr. Eaton worked for four years with a small staff in Zurich on strategy, separated from the operating decisions made at G.M.'s Adam Opel headquarters in Germany and the Vauxhall Motors subsidiary in Britain.
Initially, until Mr. Iacocca departs, he and Mr. Lutz will both have a hand in the sales and marketing of Chrysler's newest models. The Jeep Grand Cherokee, a full-size, four-wheel-drive, four-door wagon, which is scheduled to be introduced next month in New York, promises to provide stiff competition for the popular Ford Explorer utility vehicle. Reviewers have praised its handling, refinement and car-like feel.
A new line of midsize cars -- selling as the Dodge Intrepid, Chrysler Concorde and Eagle Vision -- won raves at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit in January. Rosy predictions notwithstanding, the new models will help Chrysler only if they can sell at a strong, sustained pace without costly rebates or dealer incentives. The extent of the nation's economic recovery will play a role, but so will effective, coordinated advertising and public exposure.
 
 
Need for New Pitchman
 With Mr. Iacocca, the quintessential marketeer and pitchman, scheduled to retire from a day-to-day role at the end of the year, Chrysler will need someone or something to fill the void to motivate dealers, fine-tune its pricing and merchandising and add just the right touch to advertise the wares. It might be Mr. Lutz, whose career has focused mostly on sales and marketing. Mr. Eaton may also decide to promote someone from within, or he may look outside the company.
Chrysler's biggest void may be in finance. Gerald Greenwald, Robert S. Miller Jr. and Fred Zuckerman, senior financial executives whose credibility with lenders helped Chrysler arrange its Government-backed bailout a decade ago, have all left in the last two years. When Mr. Iacocca came to Chrysler in 1979, he recruited those men from the Ford Motor Company. Mr. Eaton said he did not plan a similar recruitment from G.M.
Meanwhile, Chrysler is caught in a credit squeeze of a different kind, caused by debt ratings that have plummeted to less than investment grade. This year, more than $2.7 billion of Chrysler debt matures, mostly from the finance subsidiary. Since the auto maker cannot borrow at reasonable terms to "roll over" the debt, because of its low credit rating, Chrysler must retire the debt with cash generated from installment loans. Chrysler has also chosen to "bundle" auto loans and sell them to investors. But as a safety net, the auto maker is renegotiating a $6.8 billion revolving line of credit with a consortium of 150 banks.
 Next year, another $1.6 billion of Chrysler debt matures. By then, Chrysler hopes to be basking in the success of new models. If that occurs, investment-grade credit ratings could be restored, paving the way for re-entry into the credit markets.
John Tierney, chairman of the Chrysler Financial Corporation subsidiary, acknowledged that rarely had negotiations with banks been so painstaking or time-consuming. "The regulators are leaning on the banks," he said. "Everything gets looked at twice and three times."
But he said the departure of senior financial executives had not been a negative factor. "Chrysler has plenty of experience," he said. "We don't have greenhorns."
Moreover, Mr. Miller, the former vice chairman, said when he resigned last month that he would be working with banks on Chrysler's behalf in his new job as an investment banker for James Wolfensohn & Company.
Bankers, rating agencies and shareholders are sure to be watching Mr. Eaton's moves closely for reassurance that he can keep the auto maker motoring toward recovery.
If turmoil breaks out, the stage could be set for Mr. Iacocca's return to a larger role than chairman of the executive committee, a role that his confidants say he wanted but that Chrysler's outside directors denied when the board selected Mr. Eaton earlier this month.
 In several ways, the ferment at Chrysler could prove explosive. The Big Three have different corporate cultures, and executives who grew up at one company rarely transplant successfully at another. Several Chrysler managers who spoke on the condition of anonymity, as well as Mr. Lutz himself, said they were disappointed when the board hired a G.M. executive over the current president.
Clearly, Mr. Lutz is seen by many of his colleagues as a "wounded prince." When Chrysler revamped, streamlined and speeded up engineering and product development in the spring of 1989 as a response to its sinking market share, Mr. Lutz emerged as symbol and spokesman of the new organization's spirit, arguing for engineering enhancements and styling refinements and often clashing with Mr. Iacocca. In the end, Mr. Iacocca yielded frequently, enhancing Mr. Lutz's prestige in the eyes of many workers.
Aaron Taylor, president of Local 7 of the United Automobile Workers union, whose members are building the new Jeep Grand Cherokee in Detroit, said: "Bob Lutz was a guy who took a firm position, but was someone we could work with. Without prejudging Eaton, I'm disappointed, and so are the members."
 
 
Greenwald Called First Choice
 Nevertheless, Mr. Lutz is not universally popular. An ego-driven and outspoken man, he alienated many in the company with public criticism of departments and individuals. Several people who said they were familiar with the deliberations of Chrysler directors said that Mr. Iacocca's first choice for chairman was Mr. Greenwald, the former vice chairman and Mr. Iacocca's heir apparent, who resigned two years ago to lead an aborted employee buyout of United Airlines. He now works as an investment banker for Dillon, Read & Company in New York.
But Mr. Lutz vowed he would not work for Mr. Greenwald, these sources said. So the board, aware that Mr. Lutz had opposition in the company and lacked Mr. Iacocca's support, selected Mr. Eaton as a compromise, the sources said. The directors also decided to limit Mr. Iacocca's role to that of chairman of the executive committee, rather than chairman of the board.
Mr. Lutz said he would not quit and would do everything he could to make Mr. Eaton's job easier. But a senior Chrysler manager, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said, "They've painted a big bull's eye on Bob's back," suggesting that executive recruiters would regard him and some of his supporters as targets for job offers from other companies.
Gossip in the auto trade press last week already had Mr. Lutz talking to Porsche A.G., the troubled German sports car company, about a job. Mr. Lutz has denied the reports.

THE CRASH AT LA GUARDIA
FEW ANSWERS FOUND IN PLANE WRECKAGE
Federal investigators began sifting through the charred shell of USAir Flight 405, looking for clues why it veered off a snowy runway as it tried to take off from La Guardia Airport. Unanswered yesterday were such questions as whether the plane had been properly de-iced, whether its flaps were in the right position, whether an engine tore off, and whether the victims drowned or suffocated in the fire. A1. 

SURVIVORS' CHILLING NEARNESS TO DEATH
There were 26 passengers killed in the crash, but another 24 people managed to escape, some just barely. Their memories are crowded with visions of mangled metal and balls of fire, of gushing water and the stench of jet fuel. A1.
Among the dead, tourists, business travelers and two who boarded at the last moment. B2.

HEADLINE: Slumping Real Estate Leaves Giant Reeling

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. HYLTON

 BODY:
The real estate depression has backed another giant against the wall. In recent days, Olympia & York Developments Ltd., New York's largest commercial landlord and a financial powerhouse in its Canadian homeland and abroad, turned to its banks to ease a cash crisis and began negotiating to reorganize billions of dollars of debt in an attempt to retain its vast holdings.
Now, Paul Reichmann, the highly regarded head of Olympia, will negotiate with scores of bankers to get easier payment terms, forgiveness of debt and a capital structure that will allow the company the latitude to finish its huge Canary Wharf project in London and meet its debt obligations in North America. 
The troubles of this huge conglomerate, which owns the World Financial Center in New York and many other Manhattan office towers, underscore how heavy bank borrowing and falling commercial real estate values in the United States and London have devastated even the strongest property companies.
In London last week, Citibank foreclosed on Randsworth, a $425 million property investment by a group of pension funds in more than a million square feet of London office and retail space. And developers on both sides of the Atlantic have faced cash squeezes as rents and property values have fallen.
Besides its real estate holdings, Olympia & York owns most of the Gulf Canada oil company, most of Abitibi-Price, the world's largest maker of newsprint, and enormous property holdings in the United States and Europe. It is one of the world's largest private companies and its losses in property investments could yet have a devastating impact on many of the biggest banks in Canada, the United States, Europe and Japan that have lent more than $12 billion to the company. Rumors of the company's troubles have roiled the commercial paper markets for the last few weeks.
News of the Olympia cash crisis shook the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday, causing real estate and banking issues to fall sharply and the Toronto Stock Exchange 300 to fall 26.28 points, to 3,443.67. The Financial Services Index plunged 67.97, to 2,689.18 as investors speculated on what effect Olympia's troubles may have on Canadian banks.
The exchange's real estate and construction index plunged 83.21, to 6,149.04. And the news brought swift Government action. Finance Minister Donald Mazankowski of Canada said that Ottawa was negotiating with banks to stabilize the company, but he said no bailout was being considered.
For Olympia, the task ahead is to reorganize its debt and try to wring as many concessions from its lenders as possible to protect the company's assets from foreclosure. The company raised more than $170 million in emergency cash last week to ease the crunch. "This will be an exercise in re-establishing the base in all his properties," a prominent real estate executive said.
"The banks are going to accept different terms and lesser debt in exchange for equity in the properties. And that is the game of convincing them that the equity is worth more than it is," the real estate executive said, speaking on condition of anonymity. "If you do that right, what you get is usually much more than you give." Referring to Mr. Reichmann, the executive said: "He gets lower debt and better cash flow and they get a future on the value of the equity. The only way he can lose is if they take the properties."
The restructuring of the Olympia & York empire is likely to prove one of the largest in history and will bring into the center of public attention the Reichmann family, the secretive Toronto billionaires who own the company, and the banks that lent them billions. Since 1990, when the family began quietly looking for a a buyer for 20 percent of its portfolio of American real estate, speculation has swirled that Olympia was squeezed for cash.
Some Wall Street real estate professionals estimated that Olympia had more than $12 billion of bank debt on its books. The company's cash problems have limited its ability to refinance the hundreds of millions of dollars of debt that matured regularly and to do other necessary things like pay for needed property improvements.
 
Huge Cash Drain
 Its 71-acre London project, known as Canary Wharf, is still an enormous cash drain and Olympia has had a hard time taking out the money it invested in development and construction of the project through bank refinancing and issuing public securities. The company's cash flow has shrunk as its non-real estate investments have suffered in the worldwide recession. The Reichmanns have been unable to sell off property to raise cash quickly because the real estate markets have been virtually frozen for more than a year now.
Olympia's troubles harbor huge potential losses for some banks. But because many of the loans are collateralized by individual properties, some banks may suffer only small losses. It is widely expected in the New York real estate market that the banks will take equity positions in some of the Olympia properties in exchanging for writing down the company's debt, reducing interest rates and extending loan maturities.
"The banks have few options in dealing with them now," said another real estate executive who also declined to be identified. "The banks have to provide liquidity or they have a huge problem. Reichmann can use this to his advantage because the banks' alternatives are limited and so they have to be very understanding and work this out."
But even if the banks are very cooperative with the Olympia executives, the restructuring of the company's billions in debt will likely be protracted because of the scale of the debt and the complexity of the company's capital structure.
J. P. Morgan & Company, which has about $50 million in unsecured loans to the company, is expected to serve as its adviser in the negotiations.
Yesterday, a spokesman for Olympia declined to comment on the focus of the talks with the company's banks and would say only that the current cash crisis was brought about because the speculation in the commercial-paper markets made it difficult for the company to raise money for the enormous refinancing needs it has each quarter and to refinance commercial paper debt.
"Speculation surrounding the commercial-paper program created a liquidity crisis, which delayed arrangements for other sources of finance," Peter Rosenthal, a spokesman for Olympia, said yesterday.
Commercial paper has long been one of Olympia's main source of financing because the rates are low. But few companies are able to retire all their commercial paper outstanding on short notice. Typically, Olympia would borrow short-term money that would mature every 30 to 90 days and would refinance that debt as it matured with more commercial-paper issues.
Although the recent market rumors and rating agency downgrades of Olympia & York commercial paper over the last several weeks forced the company to reduce its commercial-paper programs from about $800 million to $400 million in Canadian dollars recently, Olympia's problems are more fundamental to problems in the real estate industry.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasuries Higher in Quiet Day

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices were mostly higher yesterday in quiet dealings that pushed yields lower.
The price of the Treasury's 30-year bond rose by 3/32 point, or 94 cents per $1,000 face amount. Its yield fell to 8.03 percent, from 8.04 percent late on Friday. 
 No economic reports were released by the Government that affected the bond market. Traders looked ahead to the auction of two-year and five-year notes later this week.
On Friday, Treasury prices fell because of several factors, traders said, including a report from a regional Federal Reserve bank that detected an economic upturn. Signs of economic improvement often depress bond prices because they make it less likely the Fed will lower interest rates.
 
Looking Ahead
 John Canavan, an analyst at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates Inc. in Princeton, N.J., said some market participants were looking ahead as far as April 3, when the Government releases March employment figures.
Today, the Treasury Department is scheduled to sell $14.75 billion in two-year notes, and $10.25 billion in five-year notes tomorrow. Both are record amounts.
In the weekly Treasury bill auction yesterday, the Government sold $11.5 billion in three-month bills at an average discount rate of 4.08 percent, down from 4.09 percent last week. Another $11.5 billion was sold in six-month bills at an average discount rate of 4.27 percent, unchanged from last week.
Yields on the securities were 4.18 percent for the three-month bills and 4.43 percent for six-month bills.
 
Short-Term Maturities Up
 In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, short-term maturities were unchanged to 3/32 point higher, intermediate maturities were up by 1/16 point to an eighth point, and long-term issues were unchanged to up by 3/32 point, the Telerate Inc. financial information service reported.
The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond index, which measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or longer, rose 0.81 point, to 1,207.35.
Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 4.17 percent, as the discount rose by 2 basis points, to 4.08 percent. Yields on six-month bills were unchanged at 4.37 percent, as the discount held at 4.23 percent. Yields on one-year bills held at 4.71 percent, as the discount was unchanged at 4.50 percent.
A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at maturity.
 
Federal Funds Rate Up
 The Federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was quoted at 4 percent, up from 3 3/4 percent late on Friday.
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds closed at 94 1/4, down by 1/32 point. The average yield to maturity was 6.79 percent, unchanged from late on Friday.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

Both issues are dated March 26. The three-month bills mature on June 25, while the six-month bills mature on Sept. 24.

HEADLINE: Another Texas Bank for Banc One

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Taking advantage of its high stock price, the Banc One Corporation announced an agreement yesterday to buy Team Bancshares of Dallas, the successor of a failed Texas bank, for $782 million of Banc One stock.
The acquisition of Team, which was created in 1988 by a private investor group to buy failed and weak Texas banks, will strengthen Banc One's grip as the second-largest banking company in the state and make it the leading bank in terms of branch offices in the Austin and Dallas/Fort Worth markets. Team has about $5.5 billion in assets.
 
Tripled Their Money
 
 Banc One completed its acquisition of most parts of the failed MCorp, a Texas banking company, last year, but it remains second in the state to Nationsbank of Charlotte, N.C., which bought the failed First Republicbank in 1988.
For investors who were brave enough to put money with Team in the late 1980's, the sale to Banc One will produce a profit equal to nearly three times their investment of $270 million. The gain is even greater for investors who were among the earliest buyers of Team shares, according to Ronald G. Steinhart, chairman of Team and a major investor in the company.
While Team benefited from the willingness of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to hold the bad loans of banks acquired by Team, the Government has never been a shareholder in the company. By concentrating on collecting low-cost deposits from consumers and making loans to individuals and local companies, Team was profitable in its first year, and in 1991 it earned about $35 million.
"That's not as much as we think this bank can earn when the economy comes back all the way," Mr. Steinhart added.
Team will be the sixth company with assets greater than $1 billion that Banc One has bought in the last year in exchange for new shares of stock. Banc One's stock, which closed unchanged yesterday at $46.625, has been trading at an unusually high price for a banking company relative to its profits.
Because of its high stock price, Banc One has been able to make the acquisitions by issuing fewer shares than would be required by other companies whose stock is not so highly esteemed. That has been a big advantage for the banking company, enabling it to offer prices for acquisitions that other companies could not match without issuing so many new shares that their earnings per share would fall. For example, the $82 worth of Banc One stock to be paid for each share of Team is equal to about 2.25 times Team's book value, the value of each share on Team's own books. Most bank acquisitions are done at two times book value, or less.
 
Helped Share Earnings
 Donald Kimble, an assistant vice president at Banc One, said that all of the banking company's acquisitions had increased, or are expected to increase, earnings per share in the first year after the purchase. By contrast, many other banking companies that have issued new shares for acquisitions say that the increase in the number of shares outstanding caused earnings per share to decline for a few years after the acquisition.
Banc One has issued or will issue 32.7 million new shares to pay for the 14 banking companies, with a total of $12 billion in assets, that it acquired last year. But analysts still expect Banc One to earn more per share in 1992 than the $3.16 it earned last year.

HEADLINE: Stocks Slip in Quiet Trading; Dow Off 4.25

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stocks closed slightly lower in quiet trading yesterday, giving back some of the gains made on Friday in the "triple witching" expiration of index futures, index options and equity options contracts.
The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 4.25 points, to 3,272.14. Other indexes also fell a bit. 
 A firming bond market helped stocks bounce back in the afternoon, but that was not enough to counter a negative tone established early in day. That tone was set by some sharp declines in European stock markets and investor concern over interest rates and the budget deficit.
And as if that were not enough, news that Citicorp would have a loss of about $120 million on a loan to a British property company also dampened the mood.
"This market has been in the same trading range for about 10 weeks, with no hint of direction," said Ricky Harrington, director of equity investments for Marion Bass Securities.
Analysts said investors were marking time awaiting the release of more economic data this week to see if there were further signs of a recovery. The durable goods numbers, due out tomorrow, "may turn out to be the most important of the week," Mr. Harrington noted.
Yesterday's New York Stock Exchange volume of 157.05 million shares was extremely light compared with the 246.9 million shares traded on Friday. Losing issues outnumbered gainers by 996 to 699.
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks fell 1.39 points, to 409.91, and the American Stock Exchange composite dropped 0.67 point, to 401.36. In Nasdaq trading, the decline was a little deeper, with the composite off 2.45 points, to 621.83, while the Russell 2,000 slid 0.61 point, to 207.76.
Rising interest rates were a concern, as mortgage rates inched higher and the Treasury's 30-year bond remained over 8 percent. The combination put some pressure on equities, traders said.
Reports that the Federal Reserve was worried about the recovery and that wide budget deficits are forecast for the mid-1990's also dampened market sentiment.
Elsewhere, traders said news of Citicorp's loan loss and reports that Olympia & York, the Canadian developer, was seeking to restructure its $20 billion of debt hurt the banking sector.
Citicorp fell 1/2, to 17 1/8; J. P. Morgan fell 1, to 58; Chemical Banking fell 5/8, to 34 3/4; Norwest dropped 5/8, to 35 1/8, and First Union lost 1 1/8, to 35 3/4.
Trading desks said shares of Intel fell 1 3/4, to 63 1/4, following an article in Barron's that investors faced earnings disappointments.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Mostly Lower As Trading Slows to Crawl

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar was mostly lower in slow trading today as dealers adjusted their positions in anticipation of new data on the United States economy.
Gold was unchanged in New York, closing at $338.20 a troy ounce on the Commodity Exchange. Later, the Republic National Bank quoted a price of $338.25, also unchanged from Friday. 
 "I can't emphasize how quiet it was today," said Kevin Lawrie, vice president for foreign exchange with the Bank of Boston. "There was nothing new to inspire people. I haven't seen it this quiet in a number of weeks."
Traders were waiting for new economic statistics that might give the dollar some direction, Mr. Lawrie said.
Tomorrow the Government is to release figures on February durable goods orders. On Thursday, figures for fourth-quarter gross domestic product and corporate profits will be announced, along with weekly jobless figures.
"We're not clear whether the dollar is still in its bullish uptrend," Mr. Lawrie said. "People are looking for anything positive to grab onto."
Traders say the market is cautious and needs extraordinary economic figures to move it.
The dollar ended the day in New York at 133.45 Japanese yen, down from Friday's 133.85. In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 134.20 yen, up 1.65 yen from Thursday. Japanese markets were closed Friday for a national holiday.
In London yesterday, the dollar was quoted at 133.75 yen.
The dollar was also lower against the German mark, closing at 1.6665, down from 1.6730 late Friday. The mark closed in Europe at 1.6685 marks, down from 1.6785 Friday.
Against the British pound, the dollar fared no better, closing at $1.7190, compared with $1.7120 Friday. In London, sterling rose to $1.7170, from $1.7045 Friday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates Friday, included: 1.5145 Swiss francs, down from 1.5190; 5.6515 French francs, down from 5.6755; 1,252.75 Italian lire, down from 1,257.00, and 1.19175 Canadian dollars, down from 1.19825.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Europe Is Costly So Far for Delta

BYLINE: By Agis Salpukas

 BODY:
FLY Delta Air Lines from Munich or Frankfurt to New York? It is not the first airline that Germans think of, for Delta has not been a household word in Europe. Since taking over most of Pan American World Airway's routes to Europe last summer, however, the carrier has spent heavily to become a competitor there, and industry experts are optimistic the investment will pay off over the long term.
"There's more to be done in terms of identity," said Harold Achtziger, the vice president of international operations at Delta. "Once we get the message out on how big our route structure is, then people will become enthused." 
 Delta began service to 21 former Pan Am trans-Atlantic destinations on Nov. 1, a time of year when international traffic normally falls. The recession has pushed traffic down even further. This combined with heavy spending on retraining employees, refurbishing terminals and other start-up costs put great pressure on earnings. Delta's operating loss for the quarter ended Dec. 31 totaled $236.8 million, and the net loss totaled $187.6 million.
"It's taken a lot to train people to our way of doing business," Mr. Achtziger said.
The situation has affected Delta's stock, which closed on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday at $66.25, unchanged. That is on the low end of its range of $65.25 to $75.25 in the last year.
Since the start-up costs were higher than expected, the results were of concern to some analysts. For example, Rose Ann Tortora, an airline analyst at County NatWest, increased her estimate of Delta's losses for the fiscal year ending in June to $1.50 a share from $1.00. She added that since Delta's stock was at a high level, it was vulnerable if international operations did not improve.
So far, international bookings for all airlines have remained discouraging, with carriers, including Delta, offering a free companion ticket to those who travel to Europe. And some carriers cut fares by 10 percent this month to stimulate bookings.
Whether the resistance to travel will continue into the peak summer season is uncertain since many people book at the last minute.
There is little doubt that Delta's acquisition of the Pan Am routes will eventually prove to be highly profitable. Frankfurt is considered to be a desirable hub for service to other destinations in Europe and other parts of the world.
Delta has raised concern among carriers like Lufthansa and Alitalia, both because its strong domestic system in the United States gives it the ability to feed its international flights and because its healthy balance sheet enables it to expand.
For the time being, however, Delta's start-up costs will continue to take a bite out of earnings. During the quarter ending this month, its expenses to service passengers have risen 37 percent over the comparable period last year, Ms. Tortora said.
"If the implementation is successful," she added, "they will get the offsetting revenues, and they will make money."
She said that Delta had had a good record in developing new service. Also, Delta has an advantage over European carriers in that its cost of delivering service is lower.
Nevertheless, European carriers have also become aggressive in preparing for the greater competition in their market. They have ordered new airplanes, have started new routes and are upgrading what are considered some of the best in-flight services even further.
Most are also cutting back on their top-heavy management and getting cost savings from their unions, and many are no longer dependent on state subsidies. Some -- British Airways, for example -- have become privately owned carriers that are building global route networks.
Thus, Delta is taking over routes in markets where the competition is becoming keener.
Mr. Achtziger said his staff had been looking at the way Lufthansa serves its customers. But it has not been a one-way street, he added. "They are looking at their product, and they are copying some of the things we do," he said.
Delta has also formed a partnership with Swissair and Singapore Airlines under which they feed traffic to one another and do some joint marketing.
Delta and other American giants are not a great threat to the European carriers in the short term, but they cause concern over the long range. Delta, with its lower operating costs, modern fleet and strong financial resources, can gradually whittle away at the European airlines' market share and threaten even their strongest hubs.
Ms. Tortora added that operating under the pressure of deregulation, American carriers had learned to be fast to win new markets and had become determined to keep driving down costs.
"They have become very competitive on the cost side," she said.

HEADLINE: Business Scene;
Capital Spending Unlikely to Surge

BYLINE: By Louis Uchitelle

 BODY:
THE incipient recovery, now evident in higher retail sales, should -- if it continues -- show up in another form by late summer: a rebound in capital spending as Corporate America re-equips to meet the growing demand for its wares. That was the pattern after other recessions. The problem is that capital spending lately has failed to perform according to script.
During the recession, it declined only mildly, avoiding the steep plunges of previous recessions. The concern is that the mild decline in capital spending will be followed, in the recovery, by an equally mild rebound in capital spending. But even if capital spending rebounds sharply, will it create thousands of new jobs, as it has in the past? The answer appears to be no, which means the recovery will be harder to sustain. 
 "The cost of employment is a much greater consideration than it was in the past," said Raymond E. Cartledge, chairman of the Union Camp Corporation, a paper company that invested $1.2 billion in 1990 and 1991, mostly for machinery to increase production capacity by one-quarter for its main products. But when the big spending was over, Union Camp had added no employees.
Similarly, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company invested $5.2 billion in 1990 and 1991 so that its long-distance network in the United States could handle 135 million business calls on an average weekday last year, up from 110 million in 1989. But as A.T.& T. installed the new automated gear, the number of workers operating the network sank to 11,600 in 1991 from 16,800 in 1989.
The cutbacks reflect what Eliot Janeway, an economic consultant, calls "the killer cost of job benefits." Health care and pensions, in particular, have become a larger share of labor costs.
Presumably, if the economy becomes strong enough, the concern over adding labor costs will fade. Union Camp might build an additional factory, requiring more workers, rather than cram new machinery into existing plants, so that existing workers can produce more. And A.T.& T., having just introduced a video telephone for the home, might find sales brisk enough to justify a separate plant to make the phones. Right now they are made as a sideline by existing workers at a factory in Shreveport, La., dedicated to other products.
Such decisions will not come easily. Corporations are wary. Demand for what they sell has suffered not only from the recession, which started in July 1990, but also from the minuscule growth that has stifled the economy since early 1989. "There is not a lot of new investment because there is not a boom or a great expectation of one," said Edward Denison, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.
Reflecting the reluctance to expand employment while more production can be obtained from existing workers, the amount of capital equipment assigned to each worker has risen in value at an average annual rate of 1.5 percent since 1979. That is almost as much as Germany's 1.6 percent, the Labor Department reports. But with expansion no longer so popular, net new investment -- that is, capital outlays beyond the cost of replacing existing equipment -- declined in the late 1980's to less than 5 percent of gross domestic product, the G.D.P. being all the new wealth that a nation generates in a given period. Until the 1980's, the proportion rarely fell below 7 percent.
"Companies are content to seek higher profits from their existing operations rather than expand in the hope of gaining market share when the boom comes," said David Wyss, senior economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill, a consulting service.
Aside from the aversion to labor costs and the skepticism about the future, economists cite other factors that have discouraged capital spending, both new and replacement. It totaled $1.06 trillion in 1990 and 1991, after adjustment for inflation, or roughly 11 percent of G.D.P. compared with nearly 16 percent a decade ago.
The still-heavy corporate debt load means revenue must be channeled into loan repayment rather than investment. Further, overbuilding of offices and stores has killed investment in commercial buildings. And foreigners are inhibiting investment on two counts. First, they are reducing their spending for new factories in the United States. Second, their array of modern plants abroad inhibits expansion by American companies. The latter have become fearful that consumers will buy imports rather than domestic products.
The bottom line is weak investment, endangering a recovery. Vigorous capital spending in the past has created new jobs not only to make new equipment and build new factories and stores, but also to man them. The new workers have then become bigger consumers, feeding the recovery.
"The hope is that companies whose products people buy will hire and then invest and expand and hire more people," Mr. Wyss said. "But right now executives are being cautious. And what scares us is that they won't shake their caution."

A.T.& T. Enters Card Venture

 BODY:
Taking aim at the largely untapped market of small-business customers, American Express and A.T.& T. said yesterday that they planned to offer a card combining features of American Express cards and A.T.& T.'s long-distance discount card.
The new program, called Corporate Link, offers teleconferencing and other communications services, language translation services, consolidated and detailed billing, as well as itemized expense-account and other reports. Customers will also receive 10 percent discounts on long-distance charges totaling $120 or more a year. 
 The American Telephone and Telegraph Company and the American Express Company have both experienced sharp reverses in their core businesses in recent years, prompting both to work on strengthening their appeal to small-business customers. Providing services when a company is young is likely to build a loyal customer, executives from A.T.& T. and American Express say, an important consideration when every market-share point is sharply contested.
After intense competition by MCI and Sprint, A.T.& T. has stabilized a sharp drop in long-distance market share at about 67 percent. The white-collar recession hurt American Express's Optima, or revolving-credit operation, as well as the mainstay green charge-card operation, where bills are paid in full at the end of the month.

HEADLINE: Callousness at Colt's

 BODY:
Two years ago Colt Industries' faltering firearms manufacturing unit, based in Hartford, was saved by financing that included state pension funds as well as money from a union and private investors. But then the new company disappointed supporters of gun control by bringing out a new version of an assault rifle the old Colt had voluntarily withdrawn from the civilian market.
Last week, when the still-troubled firearms company filed for bankruptcy, the state again moved to prop it up, this time with a loan of $2 million from the Connecticut Development Authority. Yet doubts remain about the propriety of public support for a business with a history of indifference to valid public concern. 
 The company, founded in the 19th century by Samuel Colt, produces a variety of handguns along with the M-16 assault rifle for the military. In 1989 it withdrew its AR-15, a version of the M-16 sold in civilian gun shops, as a gesture to public concern about domestically produced assault rifles. Such weapons, prized by criminals, serve no compelling legitimate purpose in civilian hands.
The company's subsequent owners didn't inherit the capacity for corporate statesmanship. Shortly after they took over the business they now call Colt's Manufacturing, they began shipping a version of the AR-15 called the Sporter, modified to eliminate superficial assault weapon features like a bayonet mount. That dismayed Francisco Borges, the Connecticut State Treasurer, midwife of the deal two years ago in which public employee pension funds had put up $25 million to purchase 47 percent of the new company. He spoke of pressuring the company to withdraw the Sporter, to no avail.
Like other gun makers, Colt's finds that the recession and the end of the cold war have cut deeply into demand for its traditional lines of firearms. The criminal market, meanwhile, looks more and more robust.
Colt's won't say how much the Sporter contributes to sales and insists that most purchasers use it for target competition. State officials, public employees and taxpayers have a right to more precise reassurance that the rescue of a proud old company won't pose a new threat to public safety.

HEADLINE: A Military Force for the Americas

 BODY:
Right-wingers backed by the military have now thwarted an international peace plan for Haiti, forcing the Organization of American States to contemplate stronger approaches to restoring democratic rule. In Venezuela, military nationalists challenge democracy. And Shining Path guerrillas terrorize Peru.
The time has come to create a new inter-American military force that could intervene to protect democratic governments from hijacking by armed terrorists. 
 The vast majority of Haitians favored O.A.S. efforts to restore their ousted President, Jean-Bertrand Aristide. But an armed minority of soldiers and political thugs intimidated enough legislators to block final approval.
Now O.A.S. members are likely to step up economic pressure. That will bring new suffering to impoverished Aristide supporters, but may not soften the hearts of soldiers who have profited handsomely from drugs and other illicit rackets.
Nor will embargoes alone provide an answer to serious problems elsewhere in the hemisphere. Last month rebel soldiers nearly overthrew Venezuela's democratic Government. And in Peru, the violent Shining Path insurgency continues to gain ground, threatening the democratic regime. Peru's own army, notorious for human rights abuses, has proved ineffective and a danger to democracy itself. Meanwhile the possibility of backdoor U.S. intervention through drug interdiction rightly alarms Congress.
The crises demand a Latin American version of the collective security arrangements now emerging in Europe, Africa and Asia.
European mediators backed by U.N. peacekeepers are trying to end the deadly war between Serbs and Croats. Soldiers from a West African regional organization have helped restrain Liberia's civil war. And Indonesian and Malaysian forces are now moving into Cambodia as part of a U.N. peacekeeping plan. Outside intervention is no longer tantamount to big-power bullying.
A hemispheric intervention force is more likely to be accepted if Washington maintains a low profile. The U.S., as the region's major military power, is uniquely suited to certain logistical and reconnaissance tasks. But political control of the force needs to be shared broadly.
Earlier in the Haitian crisis, Argentina and Costa Rica seemed favorable to creating an inter-American force. With the region's militaries again becoming restive and Shining Path on the march, there's little time to lose.

HEADLINE: Mr. Clinton's Tough Choice

 BODY:
Gov. Bill Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, wants to spend $3.4 billion to build two Seawolf attack submarines that President Bush correctly canceled. For that Mr. Clinton has been accused of "pandering" to the voters in Connecticut, whose primary is today. But whatever his motives, the policy is wrong-headed.
Even Mr. Clinton concedes that America doesn't need another Seawolf. He simply wants to keep submarine production capacity afloat until the time comes for a new sub. 
 There's a better way to preserve vital defense industries as the Pentagon budget shrinks. Careful planning can choose exactly which skilled workers and plants are essential. The result is likely to be elimination of some facilities, such as the Connecticut shipyard that builds the Seawolf. But that's the sort of tough choice that will face any President in coming years.
The Seawolf was designed to counter a Soviet submarine threat that is unlikely to materialize. Mr. Clinton would buy a smaller, cheaper submarine, the Centurion, to replace older subs as they retire more than a decade from now. But the Centurion could not be procured until 1998 at the earliest.
Mr. Clinton rightly talks about needing "a plan for conversion" of defense industries to civilian projects. But nuclear submarine yards are not ideal candidates for conversion. There is no commercial need for nuclear subs. And many of the technical skills needed for constructing them can't be honed by building much else.
Even as part of America's defense industrial base, the nuclear submarine yard at General Dynamics's Electric Boat Division in Groton, Conn., may not be needed. The U.S. has another shipyard capable of building and repairing nuclear warships -- at Newport News, Va. When the Pentagon begins building Centurions, it won't be producing them at a fast enough pace to keep two shipyards going. And it doesn't need two fully capable shipyards to insure future competition in designing new nuclear subs.
Newport News says it can restart sub construction even after a hiatus -- if the yard can be put to work overhauling existing subs and building a new nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. A study of the nuclear warship construction industry could examine that claim. It could also examine which key subcontractors with necessary skills may need to be kept in business during the hiatus.
Closing Electric Boat will be painful for its employees and costly to Connecticut and Rhode Island, already suffering from prolonged recession. And resuming submarine production at Newport News after a long layoff would entail other costs.
But it would be cheaper than keeping Electric Boat at work building unneeded submarines. Mr. Clinton calls for change and recognizes that it begins with substantially larger cuts in the defense budget. But he has to accept the consequences of those cuts. Otherwise the more things change, the more they'll stay the same.

HEADLINE: When 'Fairness' Isn't Fair

BYLINE: By Clayton Yeutter; Clayton Yeutter is President Bush's counselor for domestic policy.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Class warfare, discredited throughout the former Communist world, seems to have found new life in American political circles. A front-page article in the March 5 New York Times described one example: an allegation that the recovery of the 1980's -- and hence the conservative philosophy of the Bush Administration -- helped the rich and hurt the poor.
This analysis, a reprise of the so-called fairness argument, rests on a Congressional Budget Office study and an analysis by a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist, Paul Krugman. The C.B.O. and Mr. Krugman have played prominent roles in shaping the liberal version of the fairness debate, and their allegations have become a staple in the speeches of Democratic politicians. But the analysis suffers from grievous flaws. I will cite just a few. 
 First, the claim that the top 1 percent of taxpayers raked in 60 percent of the benefits of the Reagan-Bush boom rests on a statistical sleight of hand. The C.B.O.-Krugman analysis masks the progress of the Reagan-Bush expansion by throwing in data from the Carter era, when the poor got poorer and the rich got poorer. During the Reagan-Bush boom, by contrast, the rich paid more in taxes and the poor made more in income. Minorities enjoyed a greater leap in wealth, employment and mobility than whites. The middle class shrank because more people became "rich." That's the Reagan-Bush record.
Second, the analysis gives the impression that American society consists of stationary social classes -- a sort of human layer cake in which a haughty, unchanging upper class rests atop an oppressed, unchanging underclass. That is pure fiction: Our greatness as a nation arises from the fact that people rise and fall on the strength of their abilities. Many children of the rich fall below the national average income level in their lifetimes, and many poor children rise to riches.
Third, the C.B.O. study creates the impression of an increasingly divided America by overstating the "wealth" of the top 1 percent and understating the wealth of everyone else. It lumps retirees who have sold their homes into the ranks of tycoons. It overlooks the incredible increase in the values of investments in the Reagan-Bush years. At the same time, the study understates middle-class wealth by overlooking the value of unsold assets like homes, stocks and pension funds. If you count everybody's capital gains, you find that the poor and middle class got the vast majority of benefits of the Reagan-Bush expansion.
But the fairness story involves far more than statistics. It involves values. Many advocates of the "fairness" critique want to stoke middle-class resentment by implying that the rich take from the poor. They never seem to realize that a dynamic, entrepreneurial economy can create a bigger pie for everyone.
American workers understand how an economy works, however, and so do voters. They don't like the Robin Hood politics of class warfare, and never have. When societies exalt the corrosive instinct of envy they condemn themselves to a poverty of goods and spirit. Moses delivered a commandment that began: "Thou shalt not covet." He and his wanderers understood that an economy runs not just on profits, but on values.
The "fairness" argument ignores the way the market works. It twists the meaning to advocate a Government powerful enough to transfer money from rich to poor. But no one equates fairness with a Government that grows and raises taxes, regardless of its performance, or that transfers money from the rich and middle class into programs that lure the poor into permanent dependency.
Most Americans think about fairness in practical terms. You work hard, and you keep what you earn: That's fair. If you save and invest and take risks, and produce something that fulfills the needs of others, you make a profit. That's fair.
The politics of redistribution are as dead as Leninism. Today, people in former Communist lands beg for copies of the Federalist Papers and "The Wealth of Nations" -- not for "The Greening of America." They don't seek a sleeker socialism. They seek something like what President Bush calls the Good Society -- one built on hard work, decency, thrift, service, family -- one that places the individual before government.
The C.B.O.-Krugman assault on the Reagan-Bush recovery avoids all these factual and moral subtleties, and muddles a debate that matters to most of us. That's a shame because the fairness debate will shape our destiny. As we take on the tangled issues that arise from it, we will need all the facts and all the real fairness we can get.

HEADLINE: Genetic Engineering Needs Strict Regulation

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Bush to Ease Rules on Products Made by Altering Genes" (front page, Feb. 25) and "From Monsters to Mainstream" (editorial, March 1) both emphasize the economic benefits of the Administration's new biotechnology policy.
The National Audubon Society remains concerned about the environmental risks posed by genetically engineered organisms, such as plants, fish and microbes. We are not afraid of monsters, but Vice President Quayle and the Competitiveness Council are. Their monster is regulations designed to protect the environment. Undoubtedly, Competitiveness Council members will sleep better at night under their new policy. 
 This policy will not guide regulatory agencies; it will paralyze them. The first problem is the definition of biotechnology. According to the council, everything is biotechnology, and everything poses equal risk, including plants and animals produced by normal sexual reproduction. Basically, Federal agencies must regulate everything, or nothing.
Another problem with the new policy is that it prevents the regulatory agencies from doing anything until unreasonable risk is proved. Who would provide the proof? We cannot wait for industry to step forward. Government agencies must evaluate risks and make regulatory decisions.
The final problem is the unreasonable risk standard. This requires the value of environmental protection to be greater than the economic cost of regulation. An industry booster can add up dollars and jobs, while nobody can easily evaluate environmental quality in the same terms. This standard is a prescription for continued environmental degradation.
Consider the entrepreneur Leopold Trouvelot, who imported a few gypsy moth eggs from Europe in the late 1860's to raise in his home near Boston. His intent was to establish an American silk industry. His silk industry did not survive, but the moth did: somehow eggs, caterpillars or moths escaped from his house. Every spring, gypsy moth caterpillars now defoliate millions of acres of trees in Northeast and mid-Atlantic states.
If Trouvelot were alive today, he would dismiss our environmental concerns with the blessing of the Competitiveness Council. He would talk about the jobs his silk industry would create. He would point out the benefits to commerce resulting from a multimillion-dollar silk industry. He would boldly assert that his silk industry would enhance American competitiveness. Given all this, he would conclude, how could we worry about a little caterpillar?
For a 1992 example, consider genetically engineered fish. Scientists hope fish that contain new growth hormones will grow bigger and faster than normal fish. Other scientists are developing fish that could be introduced into cold, northern waters, where they cannot now survive. The intention is to boost fish production for food. The economic benefits may be obvious, but not the risks. Does this make the risks reasonable?
Our critics will argue that gypsy moths are different from genetically engineered fish. That is not the point. The point is it is easy to speculate about economic benefits of a new technology. But speculation is not fact. Sadly, the Competitiveness Council prefers to believe economic speculation and ignore the environment.

HEADLINE: Right Time to Invest In Eastern Europe

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Articles like "Eastern Europe Foils All but the Hardiest of Western Investors" (front page, March 5) may discourage American business investment in Eastern Europe, which would be a big mistake. In the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic, for example, as of last July, investment by American companies made up only 10 percent of foreign investment.
With such low levels of investment, United States companies are losing out on what is sure to be one of the next economic miracles of this era. Remember, in the period before World War II, Czechoslovakia was one of the most developed countries in the world. Present frustrations not withstanding, the Czech and Slovak federation may be ready to take off economically as Germany did in 1950. 
 The United States Government recognizes the exciting and important opportunity presented, and is providing technical assistance and other foreign aid to Eastern Europe.
One of the most exciting programs is the one I work for, the Czech and Slovak American Enterprise Fund, a privately managed investment fund with an Agency for International Development grant (there are similar programs for Poland, Hungary and Bulgaria). We are committed to investing in viable small and medium-size businesses in the Czech and Slovak federation, with an emphasis on joint ventures with United States companies.

HEADLINE: Why New York State's Independent Colleges Also Deserve Aid

 BODY:
To the Editor:
You report that 250 professors and students at the City University of New York have sued the state, "contending that the way it finances public higher education is racially discriminatory" (news article, Feb. 27). While I take no position on the merits of the legal challenge, I believe you leave out a critical part of the story: the contribution of independent colleges and universities.
No matter whose statistics we accept, it is clear that New York State subsidizes each student in four-year, public colleges somewhere between $8,650 and $9,700 a year (these figures do not fully include capital expenditures). By contrast, direct state subsidies to the 398,000 students enrolled in independent colleges amount to only $1,025 a year per student. 
 Independent colleges produce fully 47 percent of all baccalaureate degrees awarded to African-American and Latino students in the state, more than either CUNY or the State University system. At the graduate level, 61 percent of all degrees awarded to African-Americans and Latinos come from independent institutions.
Yet direct state aid to independent institutions lost 25 percent to inflation between 1985 and 1990, while state aid to public institutions increased 30 percent in the same period. Since 1990, at Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's urging, direct state aid to independent institutions has been reduced three times, a total of 37 percent. All told, since 1985 the purchasing power of this aid has been cut by nearly half.
The 1992-93 executive budget recommendations contain a cut of 50 percent in direct aid. These reductions would greatly impair the capacity of independent colleges to serve poor students, including African-Americans and Latinos.
The state's policy of disinvestment in independent higher education over the last seven years ignores the cost-effectiveness of these institutions, as well as the long-range economic benefits deriving from the students they train.

New MSG President

 BODY:
DOUG MOSS has been named president of the Madison Square Garden Network, an appointment anticipated since December when his predecessor, BOB GUTKOWSKI, was elevated to the presidency of Madison Square Garden. Moss, who is 38 years old, had been the MSG Network's senior vice president of advertising sales since 1990.
In Gutkowski's six years at MSG, its subscription rolls swelled from 1.7 million to 4.6 million households, a performance achieved mainly through the acquisition of the rights to Yankees games. 
 Repeating that phenomenal growth will be virtually impossible, but Moss said: "That was such an evolutionary period for us. Now I have to maintain that standard of excellence and look at the business every day and do the best you can."
Despite the recession, he said advertising sales for New York Rangers and New York Knicks games have hit a network record, and early sales for Yankees games exceed last year's slow pace. Said Moss: "We've been very fortunate. The marketplace has improved a bit and the splash the Yankees made by getting Tartabull and hiring Buck Showalter has helped."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Primary;
DEMOCRATS REBUFF CLINTON IN THE CONNECTICUT PRIMARY AS BROWN WINS A CLOSE VOTE

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

 BODY:
Democratic primary voters in Connecticut served notice yesterday that they were less than overwhelmed by their party's new front-runner, Gov. Bill Clinton, handing him an embarrassing second-place finish to former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California.
The voting was a jarring message for a man who was widely predicted to be on a clear path to the nomination after former Senator Paul E. Tsongas left the race last week. It heightens the importance of New York's primary on April 7, and it signals that Mr. Clinton still has considerable work to do to build and consolidate his support among Democratic primary voters. 
 It was also one more sign of the unpredictable mood of the voters in this season of economic anxiety and deep discontent with politics and politicians.
 
Outpouring of Anger?
 Mr. Brown, whose anti-establishment campaign has proved far more dangerous to Mr. Clinton than many had expected, asserted that the day's voting was an outpouring of anger at the powers that be. "It's not about me," he said, campaigning in New York. "It's about a process that hasn't been working."
Mr. Clinton told a rally last night that the outcome in Connecticut was a "small setback" but that he had only begun to fight. "Nobody's going to take this election for granted. We're going to work hard and we're going to win it," the Arkansas Governor declared. "I've always been told New Yorkers like a good fight."
With all of the vote counted, Mr. Brown had 37 percent, Mr. Clinton 36 percent and Mr. Tsongas 20 percent.
 
The Tsongas Effect
 Clinton campaign officials asserted that the Connecticut vote reflected lingering affection for Mr. Tsongas as well as a historical pattern in which voters have sought to slow a front-runner who was considered a presumed nominee.
"It's a long process, and I think people voted to keep the process going, to keep it open, and learn more about the candidates," said David Wilhelm, the Clinton campaign manager. "And that's all right."
On the Republican side, with 99 percent of the vote counted, President Bush had 67 percent to 22 percent for Patrick J. Buchanan, his conservative challenger. Nine percent of the voters backed an uncommitted slate of delegates and 2 percent supported David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klansman from Louisiana.
But it was Connecticut's Democrats who were heard most clearly. Ronald H. Brown, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said last night that Mr. Clinton, who has a huge edge in delegates, continued to gain ground, and he argued, "I've never known a nominee who wins everywhere, every day."
For all the efforts at philosophy, the Connecticut primary set the stage for a new period of testing for Mr. Clinton. "You've got to be careful trying to translate Connecticut into New York," said John Marino, the chairman of the Democratic Party in New York. "But it's going to make New York as interesting as it's been in the past two cycles and as important as it's been in the past two cycles."
Other party leaders said the shock from Connecticut could turn out to be healthy for Mr. Clinton, saving him from the complacency that many Democrats saw in the campaign of Michael S. Dukakis after he wrapped up the Democratic nomination in the spring of 1988.
Phil Angelides, the chairman of the California Democratic Party, said, "Does it change the big picture? No. But it probably administers a shock that in the long term will have proven to be not unhealthy. This is a great reminder of how tough the road to November is going to be."
 
A Boon for Brown
 Surveys of voters leaving the polling places showed that Mr. Brown was the clear beneficiary of Mr. Tsongas's withdrawal last Thursday, just five days before a primary that he had long been expected to win. Four in 10 voters said they would have voted for the former Senator from Massachusetts if he had remained in the race. Moreover, 4 in 10 of those who ended up backing Mr. Brown said Mr. Tsongas was their first choice.
Just as telling, Mr. Brown was the favorite of those who said they made up their minds how to vote in the last four days. About a quarter of the registered Democrats voted in yesterday's primary, proof that the worries in the Clinton camp about a low turnout were well founded.
Some voters went to the polls and simply pretended that last Thursday's announcement never happened: the Tsongas faction in Connecticut refused to die. Saying they hoped ultimately to draft Mr. Tsongas as the Democratic nominee, local organizers said they mounted a considerable effort to remind voters that Mr. Tsongas was still on the ballot and thus still an option.
And Clinton aides asserted that the remaining sentiment for Mr. Tsongas had a major influence on yesterday's results.
In a statement, Mr. Tsongas said the results in Connecticut showed that "the voters believe that we need an economic policy that works." He added, "I am gratified that the message continues to have the power to move people."
Still, his campaign manager, Dennis Kanin, said Mr. Tsongas was not encouraging the draft movement. "He has suspended his campaign," Mr. Kanin said.
 
Ignoring the Trend
 The troubles for Mr. Clinton are in keeping with a history of the voters making life difficult for Democratic front-runners. In 1976, Mr. Brown made a late entrance in the campaign against Jimmy Carter and won contests in California, Maryland and Nevada. Connecticut, moreover, has resisted the trend before. In 1980 its voters backed Senator Edward M. Kennedy, and in 1984, Gary Hart.
Still, Republicans were gloating last night. "What it says is there's a lot of ground to cover before the Democratic convention," said Torie Clarke, press secretary for the Bush campaign.
Mr. Clinton entered this phase of the campaign with a seven-to-one edge in national convention delegates, and under the party's strict rules of proportional representation, Mr. Brown will be hard put to overtake him.
In Connecticut, Mr. Brown and Mr. Clinton each won 21 of the 53 delegates at stake and Mr. Tsongas gained 11.
A tally compiled by The New York Times now shows Mr. Clinton with 1,012 delegates, nearly half of the 2,145 needed to win the nomination. Mr. Tsongas has 434 delegates, Mr. Brown has 164 and 566 delegates are either backing other candidates or uncommitted. The tally includes the preferences of "super delegates," who are members of Congress, Democratic National Committee members, governors or former elected officials.
Mr. Bush won all 35 of the Republican delegates at stake, bringing his total to 764, roughly two-thirds of the 1,105 he needs to win the nomination.
The significance of the Connecticut voting for the Democrats was not so much in the delegates to be won, but in the psychological impact on both campaigns and the party.
Mr. Clinton has primaries and caucuses in 20 states ahead against a candidate who has made a series of personal attacks. Mr. Clinton is expected to keep up his own assault on Mr. Brown, centering on his support for a flat income tax and his shifting positions over the years.
Last night, Mr. Clinton declared, "Mr. Brown's major proposal -- Jerry's tax -- declares war on New York, war on the middle class, war on the poor."
 
Bush's 'Tough Call'
 The Bush campaign, meanwhile, had a few worries of its own in yesterday's voting.
Ms. Clarke, from the Bush campaign organization, said the President's allies felt "pretty good, given the fact that Connecticut was hit hard by the recession, and given the fact that the President recently had to announce some tough spending cuts for the state."
Mr. Bush himself thanked Connecticut's voters tonight, saying it showed they understood that a President sometimes has to make "tough calls," as he did on canceling the Seawolf submarine.
Still, there were warning signals for the general election. In the survey, Mr. Bush got about half of the Republican primary voters who considered themselves liberal; a fifth of those voted uncommitted and a quarter voted for Mr. Buchanan. This suggests that Mr. Bush's continued efforts to protect his right flank, in the midst of a primary challenge from Mr. Buchanan, may have cost him.
Almost two-fifths of the Republican primary voters said they disapproved of Mr. Bush's performance in office. More than 8 in 10 said they considered the national economy to be "not so good" or in "poor" condition.

HEADLINE: In Every Category, Crime Reports Fell Last Year in New York City

BYLINE: By GEORGE JAMES

 BODY:
Reported crime in New York City fell modestly last year in every major category, the Police Department said yesterday. It was the first such across-the-board decline in 36 years.
The total number of crimes reported to the police, based on the crime figures provided to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, dropped for a third year in a row from 710,221 in 1990 to 678,855 in 1991, a decrease of 4.4 percent. Total crimes fell three-tenths of 1 percent in 1990 and eight-tenths of 1 percent in 1989. Decreases in total felonies were registered in 54 of 75 precincts, while there was no change in 2 precincts.
 
A Number of Factors
 The rise and fall of crime is a result of a number of factors not readily discernible, including reported versus actual crime, shifts in demographics and personal habits, and police strength, visibility and strategy. 
 Police Commissioner Lee P. Brown said he felt that the increases could be attributed to an increased police presence in the streets and the taking hold of his community policing strategy. Outside the department, some criminologists adhered to that view, while others questioned whether the statistics were accurate reflections of crime.
Thomas A. Reppetto, president of the Citizens Crime Commission, an independent agency monitoring crime, said it was difficult to assign a specific cause for the decrease. "Can we link changes in police strength and operational methods to a decline in crime? I think they should not be dismissed as explanatory factors."
Homicide, which surged 17.8 percent from 1989 to 1990, dropped 4.1 percent in 1991, from 2,245 in 1990, when the deaths of 87 people in the Happy Land Social Club fire in the Bronx pushed the total to a record number, to 2,154. If the Happy Land deaths were eliminated, homicide figures between 1990 and 1991 would be about even and the decrease statistically insignificant. Robberies, considered a barometer of violent street crime, fell 1.8 percent; aggravated assault dropped 3 percent, and rape declined 7.5 percent. Burglaries fell 6.6 percent, larceny theft 4.5 percent and motor vehicle theft 4.9 percent.
The figures run counter to a national trend. While other cities with a population of one million or more are showing half the percentage decrease in total crimes compared with New York, they are showing a 4 percent increase in violent crime. In major categories of murder and robbery, a number of major cities are showing double-digit percentage increases.
Mayor David N. Dinkins was briefed on the crime figures yesterday morning shortly before Mr. Brown testified before a joint council committee hearing on the "Safe Streets/Safe City" program, which was created several years ago to add more police officers to the streets after a crime wave resulted in intense pressure on City Hall to act.
Mr. Dinkins's spokesman, Leland T. Jones, said yesterday that "Safe Streets" was beginning to pay off in lower crime figures. "I think he was cautiously pleased, pleased that the numbers were down but cautious in knowing there was a lot more work to be done and we have to move forward with the staffing increases and redeployments called for in his 'Safe Streets/Safe City' program to make sure the downward trend continues."
In New York, 1991 was a year in which it was not uncommon for two parties in a dispute, often over drugs, to spray a street with bullets, wounding and killing bystanders; or for teen-agers to carry guns into schools as casually as they would pens, as was the case in late November when a student shot and killed another and wounded a teacher at Thomas Jefferson High School. Two other students were killed in a separate shooting there this year.
 
Handguns and Homicides
 Deputy Chief Michael A. Markman, commanding officer of the Office of Management Analysis and Planning, which prepared the report, said that 73 percent of homicides last year involved the use of handguns, compared with 69 percent in 1990, 56 percent in 1980, 48 percent in 1970 and 19 percent in 1960.
He said that 15- to 19-year-olds were more likely to be arrested for murder than members of any other age group. Twenty-nine bystanders were killed, compared with 22 in 1990.
Mr. Reppetto, president of the Citizens Crime Commission, whom Mr. Brown credited with tracking the across-the-board-decline to 1955, said that "while crime remained unacceptably high, clearly the indicator arrows are pointing the right way: downward."
Commissioner Brown said, "As we began implementation of the Mayor's 'Safe Streets Safe City' program, we placed a special emphasis on increased visibility at the precinct level. For example, the number of uniformed personnel assigned to patrol in the police precincts of the five boroughs has increased by 22 percent over 1990. Where we had only 786 beat officers in August 1990, we now have over 3,000 beat officers, an increase of 290 percent."
While some have speculated that an aging or shrinking population might lead to a decrease in crime, Mr. Repetto and others dismissed demographic change and other large social factors as an explanation for the drop in New York City.
"It can't do it in a year," Mr. Repetto said. "Changes in population, changes in reporting crime, great social and economic changes, those don't happen in a year." According to the Census Bureau, the population of New York City increased during the 1980's, and many claim that the true population is underreported.
But Dr. Lawrence W. Sherman, a criminology professor at the University of Maryland and president of the Crime Control Institute, a national, nonprofit research organization, saw the figures as inconclusive, saying that, statistically speaking, this year's decline "could be a down-blip followed by an up-blip next year."
Small percentage changes, as in the aggravated assault and robbery categories, could be meaningless statistical fluctuations, Dr. Sherman said. He added that if the 87 deaths in the Happy Land Social Club fire were subtracted from that year's record-breaking murder figure of 2,245, the number of murders in 1991 would have decreased by 4.
The decrease in New York appears significant when compared with statistics in other cities.
According to F.B.I. figures for the first six months of 1991, the key barometers of homicide and robberies were up 2 percent, and 6 percent for cities.
The increase in homicide in San Antonio was 60 percent, in San Jose 58.3 percent, in Dallas 30.2 percent and in San Diego 19.7 percent. Robbery rose in San Jose by 33.5 percent, in San Antonio by 31.8 percent, in San Diego by 30.9 percent and in Chicago by 30 percent.

HEADLINE: Births Beyond Hospitals Fill an Urban Need

BYLINE: By LISA BELKIN

 BODY:
Shortly after midnight on a recent Sunday, in one of New York City's poorest neighborhoods, 20-year-old Yesenia Rice gave birth in a clinic several miles from the nearest hospital.
Her mother-in-law and aunt sat behind her on the thick double bed, one advising her to "yell and scream" and the other urging her to "breathe, breathe, breathe." Her mother stood behind the bathroom door, glad to be near her daughter but unable to watch the unmedicated pain. 
 When the boy was finally born, after 33 hours of labor, the midwife cradled him briefly while his father, Kyle Rice, cut the umbilical cord. Then the midwife placed the glistening infant on his mother's belly. Fewer than eight hours later, far sooner than a hospital would have allowed, Ms. Rice was home with her husband and son in their apartment in the Morris Heights section of the Bronx.
The birth of Stefen Marc Rice at the Childbearing Center of Morris Heights last month is part of the search for cheaper and better health care for poor urban women.
The solution, many health-care experts say, may be centers where prenatal care, labor, delivery and follow-up care are all given outside the hospital. The centers serve women with no health problems and no reason to believe they will have a complicated pregnancy, and hospitals are used as backup if complications occur.
The experiment is based on two encouraging facts, one economic, one medical. Births outside of a hospital cost about $3,300 in the New York area, 60 percent less than traditional hospital care. This is largely a result of the lower salaries paid to midwives and the fact that there is no hospital stay.
In addition, at least one study, reported in The New England Journal of Medicine four years ago, found that birthing centers have half the newborn mortality rate of hospitals. Center administrators say this is because the centers are smaller than hospitals and can provide more personalized care.
Still unanswered, however, is a question of culture: Can these centers be made attractive to women who have come to shun what they see as old-fashioned ways and who believe that expensive, modern technology is better?
"They're in the United States now," said Jennifer Dohrn, director of the center in Morris Heights, an area where many families come from countries where midwives and home births were the norm. "They want access to the hospitals and the machines. It's an extra challenge to explain what we're all about. When it works, it's spectacular."
Although there are a handful of similar centers serving migrant women in rural Texas, the four-year-old Morris Heights center was the first in the country intended for a poor urban neighborhood.
The center was established by the Maternity Center Association, which also runs a center on the Upper East Side. Its success, in turn, has led to the creation of a center in the East New York area of Brooklyn, near Kings County Hospital, scheduled to open this fall. If that works, the Health and Hospitals Corporation, which will run the East New York clinic and which runs the city's 11 municipal hospitals, has expressed interest in opening other centers citywide.
 
Relaxing Before Birth
 The history of the centers began less than 20 years ago in response to the demands of middle-class women who viewed childbirth as a natural experience, not an illness, and who wanted more control over how and where they gave birth.
Many obstetricians were, and still are, critical of the decision to give birth outside a hospital, citing the small but existing risk of complications needing immediate, high-tech care. But most states now license birthing centers and 135 such centers have opened in the United States since 1975. Until the Morris Heights center opened, almost all were in middle- and upper-middle-class areas.
At these centers, birth occurs in bedroom-like rooms, without medication, monitors or doctors. Women can use the Jacuzzi to help them relax or the kitchen if they feel hungry. Family and friends gather around to coach and watch. Often children are invited. After the birth, new mothers rest for no more than 12 hours and then go home.
"At the hospital they would have attached me to a monitor and not let me move around," said Ms. Rice, who spent much of her labor circling a large flower pot in the center's waiting area, oblivious to the sympathetic stares of other patients.
"There would have been drugs and they would have taken the baby away to the nursery," she said, as her son slept by her side. "This way is more natural."
 
Attracted by Convenience
 So far, 410 babies have been born at the Morris Heights center. The Bronx Lebanon Hospital provides backup services, and the center accepts both Medicaid and private insurance.
Midwives in Morris Heights say that the prenatal care they offer is what attracts women in this poor, violent, medically underserved neighborhood. At a recent orientation session for prospective patients, for instance, only two of the seven women who attended were attracted to the center's philosophy. Others said they came because "I just live right up the block" or "My friend came here and said it was nice."
Out in the waiting room, 21-year-old Eva Licona, who is seven months pregnant, sat with her 9-month-old son and 3-year-old daughter, both of whom were born in area hospitals.
 
'Better Than the Hospital'
 She had planned to have this child at Union Hospital in the Bronx but had to cancel a prenatal check-up because her son was sick. When she tried to reschedule, she said, she was told the next available opening was three months later.
Her mother passed the Morris Heights center every day and suggested that her daughter find out what it was. Her first appointment was the following week. "This is better than the hospital," she said. "It's right around the corner and I don't have to take the bus or the train with these kids."
Aware that their approach may be surprising to some patients, Ms. Dohrn and the three staff midwives try to make the center a reassuring place. Other centers, which often feature a decor of chintz and antiques, have found that they intimidated many poor women who assumed they were not welcome.
The Morris Heights center is bright and cheerful, with a children's play area and bold African prints on the walls. The bulletin boards hold schedules of support groups that have developed over the years -- for single mothers, for breast-feeding mothers, for teen-age mothers.
The fact that this is a different kind of clinic is apparent from the first appointment when women are taught to weigh themselves, test their urine for sugar and protein, then enter the results on their charts. Women accepted into the center record these numbers at every visit, as a way of keeping them aware of the changes in their body.
 
Invitation to a Birth
 Women embrace the center's philosophy to varying degrees. Most are attracted to the policy that allows a woman to invite as many relatives and friends to the birth as can reasonably fit into the room. Sometimes, that involves a lot of people. One patient, active in her church, invited the gospel choir to sing in celebration while she gave birth. They stayed in the waiting room and sang loudly.
More usual is the presence of children. When 27-year-old Shari Anderson gave birth to her son, Glenn Jr., early this month, her 10-year-old daughter, Shaniqua, was there to watch. When the worst of the pain began, Ms. Anderson worried that she had been wrong to bring Shaniqua and tried to coax the girl into waiting outside with an older cousin. The child would not leave.
"I'm glad she stayed," Mrs. Anderson said, a week after the birth. "She's proud of him. She's telling her friends 'I seen my brother be born.' "
Also popular among patients is the center's policy of sending women home between 5 and 12 hours after they give birth. They are visited at home the following day by a nurse from the center who checks both mother and baby. That schedule is sharply different from most hospitals, which require a two or three day stay and do not arrange home visits.
The concept the center backs that meets the most resistance from new mothers is breast-feeding. Most of the women will not try it, the midwives say. There are posters on the walls advocating the practice and several women who have breast-fed have been trained by the staff to counsel others. But the number of interested women is not high. Lack of time, fear of difficulty and mistrust of anything but modern formula are the reasons most often given.
"I think this place is great but I won't do the breast-feeding," said Ms. Rice, who said she was not willing to change her fast-food diet to provide nutrients for her son.
Looking down at the baby, who was sucking hungrily on a bottle of formula, she said, "I love him to death but I won't put a piece of broccoli in my mouth."

Car Sales Fell in Mid-March; Trucks Rose

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 24

 BODY:
Sales of North American-built vehicles fell 2.7 percent in mid-March, as auto makers continued to feel the decline in fleet sales of cars to rental companies. Light-truck sales were higher.
Sales of cars fell 6.9 percent in the period to 167,708, from 180,195 a year earlier, while sales of light trucks rose 4.7 percent. Total vehicle sales fell to 276,889, from 284,482 in the comparable period of last year. 
 In the absence of other economic news, some traders on Wall Street cited the decline in vehicle sales as one reason for an 11.18-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average.
The seasonally adjusted annual rate of domestic car sales was 5.8 million for the March 11-20 period. That compared with 6.0 million in early March and 6.2 million a year earlier. The number of selling days was the same in each period.
Although sales were sluggish, dealers seemed optimistic, based on the number of prospective customers visiting their showrooms. "Showroom traffic has increased," said David Cooksey, general manager of Jerry's Chevrolet in Weatherford, Tex. But he said customers were having difficulties qualifying for loans.
Stan Ennis, general sales manager of Saccucci Lincoln Mercury Honda, in Middletown, R.I., said: "Lending requirements are tougher than they've ever been. And some people, because of the difficulties in the economy, are having things -- maybe a late payment on a credit card -- show up on their report."
The General Motors Corporation posted a 6.1 percent drop in car sales, to 77,954, and the Ford Motor Company's car sales fell 5.4 percent, to 46,573. A trade publication, Ward's Automotive Reports, estimated that the Chrysler Corporation's car sales dropped 26.4 percent, to 14,350. Chrysler reports sales once a month.
Ford said its sales of cars to retail customers rose 10 percent, while sales to daily-rental fleets were down an amount the company declined to specify. This year, Ford increased to six months, from four, the period that rental fleets must keep cars before selling them back to Ford.
Wendy Needham, automotive analyst for Smith Barney, Harris Upham in New York, said, "Clearly, fleet sales are giving way to retail sales, and that's going to help profitability."
 
 
Truck Sales Rise First
 G.M.'s light-truck sales were off 12.6 percent, to 38,305. Ford sold 13.6 percent more light trucks, at 38,389. Ward's estimated Chrysler's light-truck sales at 26,850, a 22.6 percent increase from a year earlier.
Some dealers took heart from the fact that over all, light-truck sales have been stronger than a year ago. Truck sales typically jump during the first stage of an economic recovery, followed by an increase for cars. Mr. Cooksey, the manager of the Chevrolet dealership, said, "We're selling new Chevy Suburbans as fast as we can." The Suburban is a large station wagon-style utility vehicle on a light-truck chassis.
 
'A Disappointment'
 Of the Japanese companies that build domestic cars -- which are considered for reporting purposes those built in the United States, Canada and Mexico -- the Honda Motor Company suffered a 3.5 percent decline in car sales, to 10,814, and the Nissan Motor Corporation posted a 38.8 percent drop, to 2,289. But the Toyota Motor Corporation reported a robust 38.8 percent increase in car sales, to 10,421. Sales were up 44.4 percent for Toyota's redesigned Camry model, built in Georgetown, Ky.
 Tom Webb, chief economist of the National Automobile Dealers Association, said: "Except for Toyota, these numbers are a disappointment. They are not a real setback, but a clear indication that the recovery is having a hard time getting out of first gear."
The Big Three continued to lose their share of the domestic car market to Japanese companies. G.M., Ford and Chrysler together captured 82.8 percent of domestic car sales, down from 84.2 percent a year earlier. Japanese makers captured a 17.2 share, up from 15.8 percent.
The Big Three consolidated their overwhelming lead in the light-truck market. G.M., Ford and Chrysler sold 95.7 percent of all North American-made light trucks, up from 95.5 percent. The Japanese share was 4.3 percent, down from 4.5 percent.

HEADLINE: At East-West Crossroads, Western Europe Hesitates

SERIES: After the Cold War -- First article in a series: Western European Views

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, March 24

 BODY:
While the Berlin wall was still standing, Western Europe enjoyed a pretty good deal: It bowed to American leadership on East-West security issues and quietly got on with turning the European Community into a world economic power that had minimal international political obligations.
In theory, the region lived under constant threat from the East, but by the mid-1980's few Western Europeans believed that a Soviet attack was possible. They felt secure because the future seemed predictable: Washington would control Moscow, Europe would remain divided and they both would flourish. 
 But with the end of the cold war, Western European governments have been suddenly confronted with the unknown, and anxiety is setting in. Not only can they no longer ignore the problems to the East, but their established relationships and carefully drafted plans have also been thrown into question.
 
Uncertainty Eastward
 "In the past, we lived between the Atlantic and the wall," said Simone Veil, a French member of the European Parliament. "We would shed a tear for the misery of those in the East, but the situation was frozen. Now we have uncertainty and we don't know where we're going."
Western Europe's immediate goal is self-evident: to deal with the new threats -- less extreme but more immediate -- posed by the post-Communist East without sacrificing its own economic prosperity and political harmony. But as it sets out to build the new Europe, it feels besieged.
Looking at the East, Western Europe knows that chaos in the former Soviet bloc will bring a flood of immigrants and refugees. It worries that Yugoslav-style civil wars could be repeated elsewhere. It is scrambling to avert a new Chernobyl disaster in antiquated Soviet-made nuclear reactors. It fears dispersal of the nuclear arsenal once controlled by Moscow. And it wonders if it has the time and money necessary to bring free-market democracies to the East.
 
Uncertainty Westward
 Looking at the West has hardly proved reassuring. Paris and London are nervous about Germany's new power, Bonn has been stunned by the cost of developing eastern Germany and economic growth is slowing throughout the region. The European Community also seems unsure of its next step, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has lost its traditional role and Western Europe's relations with Washington are strained by new trade disputes.
In both halves of Europe, the shadow of the 19th century has also reappeared.
"We knew the transition would be difficult," said Simon Lunn, an official at the North Atlantic Assembly, a parliamentary body linked to NATO. "What we didn't see was that as soon as Communism disappeared, old resentments would bubble up and create potential problems throughout the area."
Above all, the rise of a united Germany is stirring long-dormant fears of German might, albeit of its economic and political influence rather than of its military ambitions.
 
Xenophobia Resurgent
 The surge of ethnic disputes across Eastern Europe is also awakening grim memories of the past.
Further, this coincides with rising xenophobia in the West. In practice, France, Italy and Spain are more worried about immigration from North Africa, but Germany already feels swamped by new arrivals from Poland, Russia, Ukraine, Yugoslavia and Romania, and the German public is demanding tighter border controls.
"Suddenly the West is confronted by its own past rhetoric when it complained, 'How evil the Communists are for not letting their people go,' " a senior European Community official said. "Easterners would hear the community boasting about its virtues so that's where they want to be -- either through membership or immigration."
Even Berlin, a proud symbol of liberty throughout the cold war, now feels battered as the problems of the poor East spill into the rich West. The wall itself has now largely disappeared, replaced by what the German writer Gunter Grass has called a "social abyss." Yet a good many West Berliners think life would be a lot easier if the wall were still in place.
"There's a sort of unexpressed feeling that we'd be better off if we could ignore Eastern Europe's problems," former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing of France said.
 
Balance of Power
When Bonn Speaks, Everyone Listens
 The search for a new role for the former Soviet bloc might seem almost simple were it not accompanied by a fundamental change in the balance of power in Western Europe, brought on by the uniting of Germany and the reduction of the American military presence.
But the end of the cold war has disrupted relationships that assured stability in Western Europe for more than 40 years. And as the United States pulls back from Europe to address its domestic problems, France and Britain have had to adjust to Germany's growing domination of the region.
"You feel it in daily events," a Western European ambassador said, insisting that he not be identified. "New weight is given to German views. The way Germany views things is formative in how decisions are taken. I'm not saying this with hostility. It's a fact of life and we have to adjust to it."
Last December, the European Community did just that, bending to strong German pressure and agreeing to recognize the former Yugoslav republics of Slovenia and Croatia even though several governments were not eager to do so. A few days later, in another example of muscle-flexing, Germany raised bank interest rates without consulting its European partners.
 
'Myth of French Grandeur'
 France is finding it specially painful to accept Germany's new profile. For 35 years, France enjoyed political leadership of the community, thanks to its alliance with Germany's economic power, but theirs is no longer a partnership of equals.
"The myth of French grandeur is disintegrating and this is creating a deep crisis of confidence in France," a German official said.
In 1990, President Francois Mitterrand even went as far as trying to slow the pace of German unification. More recently, senior French officials have complained that Germany is working to rebuild its traditional sphere of influence in Central Europe.
France's insecurity may even have contributed to the drubbing that the governing Socialist Party suffered in regional elections last Sunday.
But Mr. Giscard d'Estaing, the former President, is more sanguine.
"It's not true that we're seeing the rebirth of German imperialism," he said in an interview. "The objective fact is that their power has grown and this brings consequences. France should now redefine its role. It must step out of its defensive posture."
 
Britain Turns East
 Britain, in contrast, traditionally gave precedence to its "special relationship" with Washington over political ties to Western Europe. It was therefore a blow to former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher when the Bush Administration anointed Germany its new "partner in leadership" in May 1989, six months before the Berlin wall came down.
But her successor, John Major, has brought Britain closer to Europe and established a good personal rapport with the German Chancellor, Helmut Kohl. If the April 9 general elections bring the Labor Party leader, Neil Kinnock, to power, Britain may become still more "European."
 
Role of the U.S.
Stay on Board; We Need the Ballast
 An important variable in the balance of power is whether -- or rather how much -- the United States will disengage from Europe. Although Washington plans to cut its troops in Europe from 325,000 in 1989 to 150,000 in 1994, President Bush has pledged that the United States will remain a European power.
Most governments in Western and Eastern Europe welcome this commitment, viewing Washington's presence in NATO as an essential counterweight to Russia as well as to Germany. Yet they are also alarmed by the isolationism emerging in the United States and by Canada's recent decision to withdraw its last 1,100 soldiers in Europe.
"It's normal for the United States to pass responsibilities to Western Europe, but we're not fully ready, so there is a risk of a vacuum," noted Andre Glucksman, a French philosopher. "The risk posed by the United States is not intervention but isolation."
 
Alternatives to U.S. Power
 Two debates with potential for conflict are taking place. France, which in 1966 withdrew its forces from NATO's integrated military command, is convinced that the United States will soon pull all its troops out of Europe. And it believes Western Europe should prepare for this by establishing an independent defense capability.
Specifically, France envisions transforming a moribund nine-nation regional defense group called the Western European Union into the security arm of the European Community. It has also persuaded Germany to beef up an existing joint military brigade in the hope that in time it will form the core of a new European army.
But Germany as well as Britain and others are equally determined not to weaken NATO, which has long given Washington a voice in European affairs. Thus, to avoid provoking an American pullout, they want the European defense "pillar" to come under NATO; and to give the alliance a new role, they favor expanding its mission to include "out of area" threats in, say, the Middle East.
NATO's principal function, though, would be to maintain an American presence in Europe. "The only element of stability and predictability in this world in transition is the trans-Atlantic axis," NATO's Secretary General, Manfred Worner, said. "If the United States disengages, I foresee a certain temptation for Western European nations to revert to past patterns of power politics."
Peter Schneider, a Berlin writer, was more specific: "If the United States leaves, Germany will be the dominant European power. No one likes the idea; many Germans don't want it. But it will happen anyway."
 
NATO and Community
Fear of Expansion: Big May Be Bad
 While Western Europe anguishes over its future, the countries of the East look for a place to belong.
As far back as 1988, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, then the Soviet President, spoke of a "common European home." President Mitterrand later called for a European confederation embracing East and West. Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d has imagined a "Euro-Atlantic community" stretching from Vancouver to Vladivostok.
The first attempt to design an umbrella, however, involved the Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which includes the United States and Canada. It played a major role in promoting human rights and democracy in the Soviet bloc during the cold war. But so far it has not demonstrated the authority to manage urgent security and development problems, and now, with 51 members, it is probably too cumbersome.
In reality, with the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and Comecon, the Moscow-led trade bloc, the only regional groupings still exercising power are NATO, with 16 members, and the European Community, with 12. And unsurprisingly, the former Soviet-bloc countries rushed to seek their aid and protection with a view to eventual membership.
At NATO headquarters in Brussels, officials usually occupied with endlessly revising military strategies were suddenly busy receiving top-level delegations from the East, including President Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia and President Lech Walesa of Poland. While not ready to take in new members, the alliance also created a North Atlantic Cooperation Council as a forum for discussing security, disarmament and political questions; the membership so far includes 19 former East-bloc republics.
For the European Community, however, the collapse of Communism has posed a more fundamental challenge. The 12 have already signed association agreements with Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary and will do so next with Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, thus acknowledging that the very character of the community is changing.
Until late 1989, the community's immediate goal was to create a regional trading bloc, which will go into effect on Jan. 1, 1993. Then, after the Berlin wall came down, looking for a way to anchor a united Germany in the West, President Mitterrand persuaded Chancellor Kohl to join him in sponsoring new moves toward greater economic and political unity.
Finally, after a year of negotiations, European leaders agreed in December at a conference in Maastricht, the Netherlands, to establish a single currency and a regional central bank by 1999 and to move toward common foreign and security policies. Indeed, only Britain objected to committing the community to a "federal goal."
But then members immediately began wondering how these goals could be achieved by a community that might number 20 to 24 nations.
"The community's federal vocation becomes less and less likely as enlargement brings more and more countries that are different culturally as well as economically," Mr. Giscard d'Estaing noted.
Further, the cost of integrating Eastern European countries has already been brought home by the richer members' commitment to develop the community's current "poor four" -- Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland.
Germany, for one, wants to focus its spending on Eastern Europe. "Germans are increasingly asking why they should show more solidarity with Portugal than with Poland," Alfred Grosser, a French political scientist, said. "They already feel they're paying out too much for Southern Europe. Still more dangerous, it's creating anti-community feelings in Germany."
Mr. Giscard d'Estaing commented: "In the past, there was a feeling that Germany was in debt to Western Europe so it could always be tapped for money. That's over now."
 
The Importance of Aid
Making Friends By Spending Money
 No Western European country has more reason to feel vulnerable to instability in the East than Germany.
"We're once again the front-line state," Arnulf Baring, a history professor at Berlin's Free University, argued. "It's in our interest to help Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary so they become a buffer zone against chaos in the former Soviet Union."
As a result, well over half the aid to flow from West to East in the past 28 months -- some $50 billion -- has come from Germany, some channeled through the community but most delivered directly as grants, credits and food assistance. German businesses are also investing heavily; in Czechoslovakia they provide 80 percent of all new foreign investment.
Yet while Germany is taking the lead out of self-interest, it has also appealed to the rest of the West to play a bigger role: the German economy is already strained by the cost of integrating its own eastern lands and it is alarmed to hear its community partners accuse Bonn of trying to annex Eastern Europe economically.
"The French protest to the Czechs about the level of German investment, so the Czechs say, 'Why don't you invest more?' " one German official said. "We ask the same thing. We also want France, Italy and Britain to do more. The political risks of an economic vacuum, of economic failure, are too great."
But Germany may have to get used to being "damned if it does and damned if it doesn't," a British official said.
"Germany is going to find itself in the old American position," said Mr. Grosser, the French political scientist. "If you give aid, you're imperialist; if you don't, you're selfish."
The rest of Western Europe, though, is still hesitating. And this is adding to pessimism. "If you look back 10 years from now," Mr. Worner of NATO said, "most likely we will come to the conclusion that we did not live up to the challenge of helping the East in this very critical phase."

As a Thousand Cheer, Brown Pays Dinkins a Visit

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Edmund G. Brown Jr. brought his eclectic brand of populist oratory to New York's City Hall yesterday, courting Mayor David N. Dinkins and addressing a crowd of about 1,000 supporters and passers-by outside.
Mr. Dinkins, who plied Mr. Brown with papers pressing the cause of urban America, said that as Mayor of the host city for the Democratic National Convention, he was neutral in the contest between Mr. Brown, the former Governor of California, and Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas. But he said there was "always a chance" that he might yet endorse one of the contenders for the Democratic Presidential nomination, and that he expected to meet with Mr. Clinton before the New York primary on April 7. 
 Some mayoral aides were so concerned that pictures of the two men together could be misinterpreted that they pulled Mr. Dinkins back to prevent him from wading into the cheering crowd of Brown supporters outside City Hall. Mr. Brown has been making a push to win support from minority groups.
"New York is a major battleground," Mr. Brown said as he left City Hall. "This is the place where we start turning the party around and the country around."
Today, Mr. Brown is to head to Albany for a rally at the Capitol and a meeting with Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.
Meantime, Governor Clinton made one campaign stop yesterday, at Benjamin N. Cardozo High School in Bayside, Queens. He spent the rest of the day in private meetings with labor leaders, money raisers in New Jersey and at a meeting with the editorial board of The Daily News.
 
New Electricity for Brown
 Earlier in the political season, Mr. Dinkins met with Mr. Clinton at Gracie Mansion. He also met Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa and former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts, but their withdrawals from the race and the approach of the New York primary added electricity to his meeting with Mr. Brown yesterday.
To the crowd of supporters and the curious drawn by leaflets passed out in nearby subway stations, Mr. Brown continued to try to position himself as an outlet for voter dissatisfaction in both parties. "We lack a recognition and a commitment at the highest levels of this society to economic and social justice," he said, criticizing "an oligarchy of privilege ripping us off."
Asked later if he wanted the Mayor's endorsement, Mr. Brown said, "Sure." Asked if he thought it would help, he again said, "Sure."
But Mr. Brown had started the day in a meeting with two dozen labor leaders, including one Barry Feinstein, the president of Local 237 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, who is not so sure that association with the Mayor is a good thing these days. Mr. Feinstein, once a strong Dinkins supporter, has lately wondered aloud whether the Mayor's standing is so diminished that the union should reconsider whether to support him for re-election.
Mr. Feinstein spoke glowingly of Mr. Brown, however. "I was really very excited," he said after their meeting. "I think we've got a race here."
But George Stephanopoulos, Mr. Clinton deputy campaign manager, said the Arkanas Governor planned to concentrate on challenging Mr. Brown's ideas, especially a plan to replace most taxes with a 13 percent flat tax on income, which the Clinton camp says could harm the poor.
"We have to bear down hard," Mr. Stephanopoulos said. "We're going to be here, which means taking Jerry Brown seriously."

HEADLINE: Plenty of Fish in Sea? Not Anymore

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GLOUCESTER, Mass.

 BODY:
Since colonial days, fishermen like Matthew Vitiello have cast their lines in Georges Bank and reaped the harvest of plentiful waters, returning to the wharf with a boat full of fish.
Now, an expanded fleet stays out twice as long to bring back half as much fish. Overfishing has seriously reduced the stocks of cod, haddock and flounder that have sustained New Englanders for centuries. 
 Under a court order, the New England Fisheries Management Council is drafting a plan to rebuild the stocks of groundfish, which live and feed along the ocean floor. The stocks of cod, haddock and flounder are at their lowest level ever. The plan being considered would limit fishermen's days at sea, increase their net-mesh size and ban newcomers to the fishery.
If the plan is approved, fishermen say, a livelihood that has been part of New England tradition will be in danger of extinction. "What are we preserving the stocks for, if you're going to put the fishermen out of business," asked Tony Verga, executive director of the Gloucester Fisheries Commission, which oversees the fleet in this fishing port.
 
Fewer Days at Sea
 Under the plan, Mr. Verga said, fishermen will have to reduce their days at sea by 10 percent every year for five years. "How are you supposed to pay your bills when your ability to make a living is cut in half?" he asked.
The council's plan would also force fishermen to throw back smaller, younger fish and would require fishermen with vessels of 61 tons or more to buy a $5,000 electronic tracking device for their boats so the National Marine Fisheries Service could regulate them. It would also restrict access to haddock fishing grounds and place a 2,500-pound limit on the amount of haddock that could be caught on each trip.
Mr. Verga suggested that the council recommendations might save the fish but that they showed little concern for the fishermen. "The fishermen are not programmed to do anything else," he said. "Fishing is something that gets in your blood. It's that freedom when you're heading toward the open sea. There was a freedom to it, and now that's being taken away from this industry."
But Peter Shelley, senior attorney at the Conservation Law Foundation, disagrees. "What we have here is a conflict between short-term economic interests and long-term economic interests," he said. "The fishermen's representatives are worried about this year's profits instead of the long-term interests of the industry."
"At this point, fishermen have to be able to make short-term sacrifices to reap the long-term benefits of rebuilding the stocks," Mr. Shelley said. "There is no way around it."
Scientists agree. "There is no way the stocks can survive at this rate," said Vaughn C. Anthony, a scientist at the Northeast Fisheries Center, the research arm of the National Marine Fisheries Service. "The fishing mortality has never been this high."
Fourteen out of the 20 groundfish stocks are being "overexploited," he said. Fishermen are landing 50 percent to 70 percent of the available stock, he said, and "that's twice as much as they should be taking."
Yet total groundfish landings dropped to 95,000 metric tons last year, from 200,000 metric tons in 1982.
While fish like cod, flounder and haddock once made up 75 percent of the groundfish stock in the waters off the coast of New England, these stocks now represent only 25 percent of the stock. "Trash fish" with little commercial value, like spiny dogfish, skate and mackerel, have replaced them.
But Mr. Anthony said fishermen could more than double their catch, if the stocks were rebuilt. Cod and flounder are expected to be restocked in five years under the plan; haddock is likely to take 10 years.
 
Economic Pressure
 But one fisherman, Matt Carter, wonders whether others like him will be able to hold on to their businesses that long. "There is going to be a lot of people falling out of this industry," said the 30-year-old captain. "People aren't going to be able to pay their bills."
Fishermen are already having problems selling their boats and getting bank loans, he said. The only thing keeping fishermen afloat are the higher prices, he noted. As consumer demand for fish has increased, fishermen have tried to keep up with demand, despite warnings that stocks were being severely reduced.
The depletion of the groundfish stock has already taken its toll on the economy. The reduction in annual landings of groundfish by 137 million pounds has cost New England $350 million and 14,000 jobs, according to a 1990 report from the Massachusetts Offshore Groundfish Task Force.
This is not the first time New England's groundfish stocks have been in danger of collapsing. In the 1970's, foreign fishing fleets harvesting the fisheries with sophisticated equipment were overwhelming United States fleets and rapidly depleting the groundfish stocks.
In 1976, Congress passed the Magnuson Fishery Management and Conservation Act, establishing a 200-mile limit off the shores of New England as an exclusive economic zone of the United States. The act also created regional fishery councils like the New England Fisheries Management Council, and charged the councils with rebuilding the depleted stocks.
 
Suit May Be Settled
 Quotas were placed on cod, haddock and flounder, but then abandoned in 1981, after fishermen pressured the council to lift them.
The Conservation Law Foundation and Massachusetts Audubon Society sued the National Marine Fisheries Service and the Department of Commerce, which oversee the council, for failing to meet their charge under the Magnuson Act. But the conservation groups agreed to settle the suit if the council would develop a plan by Sept. 1, 1992, that would reduce the number of fish harvested by 50 percent. If the council fails to develop a plan, the National Marine Fisheries Service and the Department of Commerce must develop one by Nov. 1, 1992.
Mr. Vitiello, a long-line fisherman, continues to fish for fertile ground in the waters of Georges Bank. A couple of years ago, he and three other crew members used to land 40,000 to 50,000 pounds of groundfish, like cod, cusk, haddock and halibut, after a three-day trip.
Now, it takes five or six days to land 20,000 pounds, he said. "Now that I've been able to expand I haven't been able to fill it up," he said.

HEADLINE: Rudman, Irked by the Senate, Is Retiring

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 24

 BODY:
Senator Warren B. Rudman, who attacked and scorned business-as-usual in two terms in the Senate, today announced his retirement, complaining that there was no challenge left in serving in a government that was "not functioning."
While he made it plain that he included the executive branch in his general criticism, Mr. Rudman, a moderate New Hampshire Republican, said that in the last year or two partisanship and posturing had made the Senate a trying experience. 
 "Here we are, getting zero done, staying up to midnight debating amendments that everyone knows won't become law, because somebody wants to get a press release out," the 61-year-old Senator said in a telephone interview from Concord, shortly after saying he would not run again.
 
'Satisfying' Memory
 He took a leading role in the Iran-contra inquiry as the senior Republican on the special Congressional investigating committee, sharply criticizing the Reagan Administration's arms-for-hostages effort. He said today that that was a "very satisfying" memory.
"I was swimming against the tide of my own party," he said, "but the Government was very seriously out of control."
He is the fifth Senator to say he will not seek re-election in November.
Mr. Rudman was best known nationally for his co-authorship of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act of 1985, which limited growth in discretionary Federal spending. But in the Senate, he was noted for his impatience with behavior that he regarded as self-serving and trivial.
 
Lashes for North
 During the Iran-contra hearings in 1987, he lectured Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North about pursuing foreign-policy initiatives that he thought Congress would disapprove if Congress only knew about them. "I want to point out to you, Colonel North, that the Constitution starts with the words 'We the people,' " Mr. Rudman said. "This Congress represents the people."
He went on: "I guess the last thing I want to say to you, colonel, is that the American people have the constitutional right to be wrong. And what Ronald Reagan thinks or Oliver North thinks or what I think or what anybody else thinks makes not a whit."
Last fall, when Senator Alan Cranston, Democrat of California, defended himself against a Senate Ethics Committee decision that he had improperly aided Charles H. Keating Jr., the former savings and loan executive, by saying he only did what others did, Mr. Rudman angrily took the floor to say most senators had higher standards.
"What I have heard as a statement I can only describe as arrogant, unrepentant, and a smear on this institution. Everybody does not do it," said the vice chairman of the ethics panel.
When other senators, panicky after the Clarence Thomas hearings last fall, rushed to subject the Senate to court review on sexual harassment charges, Mr. Rudman fought a losing battle in arguing that the Constitution commanded the Senate to police itself, something he said it had been doing confidentially and successfully through its Rules Committee.
"The Senate is a very special place with very special obligations, a very rich history, and, I hope, a very rich future," he said. "None of us who serve here will serve here longer than a brief blink of time. And there are some institutional values which are worth protecting."
And submitting personnel actions to review "by a judge who is appointed for life tramples any semblance of separation of powers that I have ever read or heard of."
The burgeoning Federal deficit has been an interest of his in the Senate, and Mr. Rudman held forth on the subject for some time at his news conference today in New Hampshire.
He renewed the arguments he made in the Senate on March 12 in denouncing the Democratic tax bill and President Bush's proposal, saying then:
"There can be no doubt that sustained record budget deficits, high real interest rates, and the devotion of an incerasing portion of the economy to pay interest on the skyrocketing national debt is the primary factor.
"And there can also be no doubt that the blame for this lies with the Congress and the President, with Democrats and Republicans alike, most all of whom have been unwilling to make the hard choices or to explain to the American people that there is no such thing as a free lunch."
Mr. Rudman's two most likely successors are Gov. Judd Gregg or former state Attorney General Tom Rath, a close friend of Mr. Rudman's who has indicated he will not seek the Republican nomination if Mr. Gregg runs. No obvious Democratic candidate is in place, and the seat would be very hard to wrest from the Republicans.
Grumpy, impatient with colleagues and reporters, and given to lecturing, Mr. Rudman made enemies as well as friends in the Senate. But his departure, which he had hinted at to colleagues for months, was greeted with regret from both parties.
Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the minority leader, said Mr. Rudman "never ducked a tough issue, a tough vote, or a tough fight on the Senate floor."
"You don't replace a Warren Rudman," he said. "You just thank the people of New Hampshire for giving us the honor of serving with this one-of-a-kind public servant."
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, said: "He has been an able and eloquent voice for the needs of New Hampshire and the nation. He reminds me of the E. F. Hutton ad. When he talks, everyone in the Senate listens, because he always has something worthwhile to say. No senator is better liked or more respected."
In the interview, Mr. Rudman said his warmest memory of the Senate was in recommending, supporting and helping win confirmation of a protege, David H. Souter, to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.
He said he had no specific plans for retirement, though the former state Attorney General suggested he was more inclined to a career in business than to returning to law, even though "the offers would be stupendous."
In Concord today, he said he was leaving the Senate because "I just don't think I would enjoy it for six more years."
"I've enjoyed serving this state enormously," he said. "Great state. Great freedom. I thank the people of this state for giving me an unbelievable opportunity to serve."

Representative Quits
BOSTON, March 24 (AP) -- Representative Brian Donnelly, Democrat of Massachusetts, said today that he would not seek re-election because he wanted to spend more time with his children, ages 10 and 5. Mr. Donnelly, a 46-year-old Bostonian, has served seven terms.

HEADLINE: Personal Health

BYLINE: By Jane E. Brody

 BODY:
AS the unemployment rate continues to climb, each month hundreds of thousands of Americans discover that involuntary joblessness is often more of an emotional and physical challenge than any job they have ever held.
It is not, as some may think, unfettered free time to do chores and pursue pleasures, at least not if a paycheck is needed to keep a roof over one's head and food on the table or pay tuition or insurance premiums. 
 Nor is unemployment a relief from drudgery, particularly if one's job is a source of personal identity, pride or camaraderie. Rather, many studies have shown or strongly suggested that unemployment breeds a host of personal, family and social ills, from depression and heart attacks to child abuse and criminal violence.
The hazards of unemployment are not suffered solely by the person who loses the job. Many who still have jobs labor under the stressful fear that they may be next to join the bread line. During recessions, there is often more competition between workers and less possibility of promotion. Or, because of cutbacks, employees may be stripped of needed support personnel or have to do the jobs of two people.
Wives of unemployed men face an increased risk of mental and physical health problems, and children may show physical or behavioral symptoms from rising family tension. When unemployment suddenly halts affordable health insurance, whole families often forgo important preventive health measures or ignore early signs of illness until it is too late to prevent serious consequences.
Even older workers who take early-retirement deals are vulnerable to the ill effects of suddenly having no job, especially if they have not prepared emotionally or situationally for a stay-at-home life.
But experts on the psychosocial consequences of unemployment believe that it is possible for most unemployed people and their families to defray many of the costs of joblessness and reduce the toll on health and family stability.
 
Out-of-Work Blues
 Periods of economic recession marked by high rates of unemployment and business failures and reduced per capita income have long been linked to an increase in personal and social ills. Dr. M. Harvey Brenner, a sociologist at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, has found that during and after recessions in the 1970's and 1980's there was a significant rise in deaths from heart disease, stroke, cirrhosis of the liver, suicide, traffic accidents and homicides in the general population. There were also more admissions to mental hospitals, more arrests and more cases of assault and fraud.
Even when the country emerges from a recession, the problems do not necessarily recede. Dr. Brenner maintains that those who suffer the most serious economic consequences and who do not participate in the national recovery face the most severe stresses when things get better. For others, bad habits acquired during the recession, like alcohol and drug abuse, can take their toll years later.
Dr. Richard H. Price, professor of psychology at the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research in Ann Arbor, analyzed recent studies showing that emotional disorders are most often the result of job loss, not its cause. For example, in a Michigan study, people who had lost their jobs because of mass layoffs and plant closings were three times as likely as steadily employed people to show serious symptoms of anxiety and depression.
In another study of families of auto workers who had recently lost or were expecting to lose their jobs, job loss was associated with increased household conflict, tension and stress. The unemployed workers were more likely to have fights with their spouses and to have hit, slapped or spanked their children.
Dr. Paula M. Rayman, a sociologist at Wellesley College who studied unemployed workers at a Hartford aircraft factory, found that the stress of joblessness worsened family relationships. Unemployed workers were also more likely to suffer from severe headaches, chronic nausea, stomach troubles and constant fatigue.
 
Preventing Problems
 Some people weather problems of unemployment better than others with similar life circumstances. Dr. Jacob Trachtenberg, a psychiatrist at Northwestern Institute in Fort Washington, Pa., said: "People who adjust easily to change, who can tolerate the frustrations of everyday life and who can control their impulses will have an easier time than others. Also people who have good relationships with family and friends and a strong sense of self-esteem will weather the stress of unemployment better than those people who do not."
He and other experts urge the newly unemployed to take steps immediately to head off the depression and sense of worthlessness that can both damage health and make the search for a job more difficult. Here are some helpful measures:
*Don't blame yourself for the cutbacks that left you jobless.
*Try to turn your anger and frustration about losing your job into motivation to find a new one.
*Admit to your concern about being out of work and discuss it with your family and close friends. Let the children know that they are not to blame for the sudden unhappiness at home. Sharing the burden makes it easier for everyone to bear.
*Develop a concrete plan to find a new job. Prepare a resume, read the want ads, sign up with public and private employment agencies and let as many people as you can know what kind of job you are looking for.
*If your old line of work is no longer an option or you have lost interest in it, consider a job retraining program. Analyze your skills, abilities and interests and take the opportunity of joblessness to assume a new vocational direction.
*Try to maintain as much of the structure of your old life as possible. Continue with activities you can afford that bring you satisfaction and keep you in touch with friends.
*Find positive ways to vent your negative feelings, for example through physical exercise, which can also help you maintain your physical and mental well-being.
*Take a part-time job. Or become an "entrepreneur." Working out of your home, turn a hobby or your skills into a money-making operation.
*Fill your spare time with volunteer work. It will enhance your self-esteem.
Another positive step is to join a support group of people who have lost their jobs. Participants can offer helpful survival hints and sometimes job contacts as well as make you feel you are not alone.

Box Socials
By W. P. Kinsella
225 pages. Ballantine Books. $20.
After delivering two fictional fast balls with "The Iowa Baseball Confederacy" and "Shoeless Joe" (the basis for the movie "Field of Dreams"), W. P. Kinsella confounds his fans by throwing a change-up in "Box Socials." His new novel is more about small-town life than big-time baseball. It's a story filled with nostalgia about a time when the game was played on real grass and was called on account of darkness. But even more, it's about the everyday hopes of what it must be like for most people to play out their lives in the minors. 
 Some of the most lasting baseball literature does, in fact, take place in the environs of the bush leagues. In "The Natural," Bernard Malamud devised a mythic bat for his star who came up from the sticks. Eliot Asinof's authentic novel, "Man on Spikes," became a metaphor for the gritty struggle of someone who couldn't quite make it to the majors. With perfect pitch, Ring Lardner's classic "You Know Me Al" letters reduced his brash busher, the bullpen's Jack Keefe, to human dimensions.
None other than Virginia Woolf praised "You Know Me Al" as vivid prose that provided insights into American society. In an introduction to the Scribner edition of his father's book, John Lardner recalled that Mrs. Woolf wrote that as the boastful Keefe "babbles out his mind on paper, there rise up friends, sweethearts, the scenery, town and country: all surround him and make him up in his completeness." Her observation happens to fit the half-literate character, Truckbox Al McClintock, and his neighbors in Mr. Kinsella's "Box Socials."
In a down-home style that resembles the humorous voice of Garrison Keillor, Mr. Kinsella begins, "This is the story of how Truckbox Al McClintock almost got a tryout with the genuine St. Louis Cardinals of the National Baseball League, but instead ended up batting against Bob Feller, of Cleveland Indians fame, in Renfrew Park, down on the river flats, in Edmonton, Alberta, summer of 1945 or '46, no one can remember which, though the date in question has brought on more than one disagreement."
The narrator, Jamie O'Day, is a teen-ager who lives with his parents in farm country miles away from the big city of Alberta, surrounded by Ukrainians, Norwegians, drifting American families and native Canadians. His wise South Carolina mother recognizes that the family are hillbillies, but she is determined to improve their fortunes.
"I married your daddy because he was a nice, cheerful man who never expected to bat less than .400, never expected to lose a game, and certainly never expected a Depression," she tells Jamie. His father is a wanderer who plays with a barnstorming team called Brother Pettigrew's Divine Light Baseball Mission. Brother Pettigrew said his team combined "the two Gods of rural North America, the mysterious and sometimes troubling one in the sky and baseball."
The small-town pickup teams outside Alberta have such names as the Sangudo Mustangs, New Oslo Blue Devils and Fark Red Sox. They rarely had time to practice. When they did, the Red Sox coach urged his players on with such admonitions as, "Want you boys to try as hard as a homely girl on her honeymoon."
In the cold winters in western Canada, sex is never far from the minds of the baseball-mad hillbillies and the author. Everybody in "Box Socials" is randy and available: if not in their neighborly bedrooms, then in their fields, barns and trucks. There isn't a four-letter word in the book, but Mr. Kinsella manages to get what he means across with such coy lines as, "The young people who were anxious for a chance to rub their personal body parts together on the dance floor didn't mind dancing to seven straight renditions of 'Alice Blue Gown.' "
Matchmaking takes place at the box socials of the title. At weekend get-togethers, the women prepare boxes of food and cakes and wrap them up without their identifying names. The man would look for one of the boxes prepared by the woman he coveted. It was a good guess that a marriage was shaky when a man avoided buying his own wife's box lunch. Truckbox Al McClintock saved up his 35 cents to buy the box lunch of a particularly unattractive young woman who was reputed to be -- one of Mr. Kinsella's euphemistic snappers -- "hot-blooded."
There are a number of amusing characters in the book, including a short American soldier whose truck breaks down in one of the Alberta towns and who never wants to get away. With a steady paycheck from the Army that has forgotten him, he's pursued by a Ukrainian sexpot named Lavonia Lakustra. Their six-day wedding ceremony calls to mind the ethnic wedding in the film "The Deer Hunter." Then, too, there's the luscious Velvet Bozniak who, the author writes with a wink, knows more about sex than any girl has a right to know.
But what about small-town baseball and those fields of dreams? Teasing the reader with the arch sociology of the inhabitants of a little-known place in a forgotten time, Mr. Kinsella delays the big game until the final pages of his novel. Now it was up to Truckbox Al McClintock to bring fame to the hillbillies. After all, he batted cleanup for the Oslo Blue Devils and could hit a ball 50 yards over the centerfielder's head.
But how would he do in an exhibition game against Bob Feller's hundred-mile-an-hour fast ball at Renfrew Park, down on the river flats, in Edmonton, Alberta, in the summer of 1945 or '46?
"That game, which might have been Truckbox Al's big break, was, though not one of us realized it at the time, an end to an era, and a beginning to a new one," Mr. Kinsella writes in his highly original story. "The rapidly improving economy soon made it possible for ordinary folks in the Six Towns area to own cars, and once they owned cars they traveled, and once they traveled things were never the same again."

HEADLINE: The Pop Life

BYLINE: By Peter Watrous

 BODY:

Sort of Rock
They Might Be Giants has just released its fourth album, "Apollo 18" (Elektra), and like its other ones, it has a small, low-tech feel to it. The band, the guitarists and songwriters John Flansburgh and John Linnell, are a product of bohemian Lower East Side life in New York in the early 1980's, and the music comes without a genre to identify it. It's pop, in a way, and rock, in a way, and it's loaded with clever wordplay and obvious melodies. But the songs aren't normal pop but rather the pop incarnation of irony, with such tunes as "The Statue Got Me High," "My Evil Twin" and "She's Actual Size," pretty much explaining their stance. 
 "Essentially, we're a cultural U.F.O.," said Mr. Flansburgh. "We don't fit into a trend, and the people who like us like us for a wide variety of reasons. We're definitely pro-melody, which is not the coolest way to be. We want to take melody back from the forces of evil."
When the band first started performing, Mr. Flansburgh and Mr. Linnell worked in tiny Lower East Side clubs, backed by a boom box. They created dial-a-song, an underground favorite that features a new song every day or so and can be dialed on the phone. On their last record, "Flood," they suddenly became college rock icons and can now sell out the Beacon Theater. It's the revenge of bohemia on mainstream pop.
"When we started, we just made ourselves available to the general public by things like dial-a-song and by playing a tremendous amount of gigs," said Mr. Flansburgh. "Then we started making records, which kind of surprised me. Because I think bands like us don't get to make records.
"People aren't really interested in music that challenges them. Our music challenges things that are familiar to people, the proper use of melody, what the function of song is, things like that."
 
Sounds of Puerto Rico
 "Ritmos y Cantos Callejeros" (Ansonia/750 Paterson Ave, East Rutherford, N.J. 07073) first came out in 1970, and it was immediately clear that this album was different from most Latin records at the time. It paired two of Puerto Rico's best percussionists and band leaders, Cortijo and Kako, in a setting that was less commercial than most salsa records being made, by them or others.
The album, just released on CD, features bombas and plenas, based on rhythms specific to Puerto Rico. There's no horn section, and the chorus uses the gorgeous sound of a Puerto Rican choir. The main singers (Chivirico Davila, Ismael Rivera and Gilberto Cruz) use the freedom of the tracks to improvise a bit. It's a classic album, loaded with easy, graceful rhythms, and with smooth call-and-response sections, both from the drums and from the singers.
 
Still Political, but . . .
 When Rono Tse and Michael Franti were members of the group Beatnigs, they'd run around onstage wrapped in chains, shouting political slogans, banging on refrigerator doors and car gas tanks, and taking most of their clothes off. It was industrial rock agitprop from San Francisco, and it was obviously informed by performance art as much as by the music scene.
The Beatnigs broke up a few years ago, and Mr. Tse and Mr. Franti are now rappers traveling under the name the Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy; they've just released their first album, "Hypocrisy Is the Greatest Luxury" (Fourth and Broadway). Mr. Franti raps in the deep authoritarian tones of Chuck D of Public Enemy; his pieces are no less political than they were before, and the samples range from avant jazz to noise.
"Rap's the music Rono and I listen to," said Mr. Franti. "With the Beatnigs we weren't really making music; it was more like political theater."
It's also music that doesn't resort to racism to condemn racism, pointing out the fallibility of standard hip-hop positions, from gangsterism and anti-Semitism to consumerism.
"Black roles used to be very circumscribed," said Mr. Franti. "Today we have other opportunities yet we still see these roles existing both in entertainment and in consumers perpetuating the roles to present some modicum of personal success. A lot of roles we black people put on ourselves. For example, during the mid-80's when black America was hit hard economically, we were being encouraged by each other to buy commodities like gold chains and sneakers, which aren't putting money back into the community and just show off who's biggest and baddest. Bashing Jews became the thing to do. We want to resist all that and to choose what kind of symbols of blackness we are."

HEADLINE: Trying a Market Approach to Smog

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, March 21

 BODY:
After laboring for decades under the nation's toughest air-quality rules, companies in Southern California now face a daunting new challenge: proving that they can figure out on their own how best to clean up the nation's worst smog.
Under a plan that regional air-quality regulators approved earlier this month, Southern California will scrap most of its cumbersome rules for oil refineries and other large industrial polluters. Instead, the regulators are introducing a radical new free-market approach. Companies will still face strict quotas for reducing emissions. But they will be free to satisfy these limits in almost any way they see fit -- even by buying the right to pollute from another company that has surpassed its cleanup quota. 
 The plan will not take effect for a year and many important details remain to be worked out by the South Coast Air Quality Management District. But companies are already gauging the effects on their operations and laying plans to cut emissions or buy pollution rights.
Southern California Edison envisions savings and is stepping up efforts to help customers develop less-polluting technologies. ARCO, the big oil company, anticipates such great costs that it is lobbying for changes.
The plan's goal is to reduce the costs to industry -- and the region's economy -- of eradicating the choking brown haze that covers the Los Angeles basin. It is the most ambitious effort in the nation to use free-market forces to reduce pollution. The results are certain to have a profound influence on national policy, which is already moving in the same direction.
Several companies large and small, ranging from Terra Furniture of City of Industry to ARCO of Los Angeles, say the plan demands too much additional emissions reduction and will ultimately prove unworkable.
George H. Babikian, the president of ARCO's gasoline refining and marketing division, said the plan "would impose an additional burden on industry that is technologically unrealistic and financially unreasonable."
 
Big Savings Expected
 But most companies say the new approach will save them hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars as the region pushes to meet Federal clean-air standards by early in the next century.
The Coatings Resources Corporation, a small company in Huntington Beach that makes paints and coatings for products like Mattel toys, plans to use new technologies and less polluting paint ingredients, reducing emissions enough to become a seller of pollution credits. In contrast, Southern California Edison says it can meet its emissions requirements more cheaply by buying credits than by investing in additional pollution-control technologies itself.
"The market will assign the cheapest way to get the necessary emissions reduction," said Michael Hertel, Edison's manager of environmental affairs.
The plan frees companies to reduce pollution in the most cost-effective ways they can find and provides incentives for research into new pollution-control techniques.
 
Creating a Market
 Companies that exceed their emission-reduction quotas can sell pollution credits on an open market. The trading will be monitored by the regional air-quality agency, which will most likely vouch for the validity of the credits and provide up-to-date price information.
The buyers would be companies that could not meet their quotas or that decided it would be less expensive to buy credits than to invest in new technology. The Federal Environmental Protection Agency is developing a similar program on a national scale to promote reductions in the pollutants that cause acid rain.
"What the business community has been saying is, 'We can clean up the air cheaper if you let us do it our way,' " said Joel Schwartz, a staff scientist at the Coalition for Clean Air, an environmental group. "If the program goes forward, they're going to have to prove to us that they can give us real, quantifiable reductions in emissions and progress towards clean air. Otherwise we have to go back to the old system, which may be more onerous, but also easier to enforce."
Many business groups, eager to increase the potential supply of emissions credits and therefore hold down their price, want the plan to include not just the 2,700 largest polluters, as the air-quality agency has proposed, but almost all companies in the sprawling Los Angeles basin. Some environmental and health groups want to exclude certain large polluters, including utilities, on the ground that they are just coming under tough new regional regulations and should not be allowed to escape them.
 
Trying to Save Jobs
 But the overall plan has apparently gained unstoppable political momentum. At a time when many companies are fleeing from California, in part because of high regulatory costs, officials are eager to save jobs by granting industry more flexibility.
Some critics of the system say it will actually encourage the flight of businesses because if they close they can sell credits equal to their total emissions -- money they could then use to relocate to another state with looser rules. They could also move to Mexico, though Mexico City's mayor just issued a warning to companies to cut their emissions.
But a study by the air-quality district found that the program would reduce 1994 industrial-compliance costs by $427 million, a reduction of 65 percent based on projected costs under current regulations. In 1997, the savings would be $270 million, or 29 percent. By 1997, the study said, the region would be losing nearly 2,000 fewer jobs a year than under the current approach.
Southern California Edison, for example, has seven large plants in the region, all of which emit nitrogen oxides in burning fuel to create electricity. Nitrogen oxides are one of the two basic classes of smog-forming pollutants covered by the plan; the other is reactive organic gases, which are released primarily in the use of paints, coatings and solvents.
Mr. Hertel said that Southern California Edison has reduced its nitrogen oxide emissions by more than 70 percent since 1979. The company's estimated cost for each further ton of annual reductions is $30,000, he said. Because many other companies can reduce their emissions more easily, the cost of buying a credit for one ton of annual nitrogen oxide emissions is projected at $6,800 or less, he said, making it highly attractive for Southern California Edison to be a "smog credit" buyer.
 
Working With Customers
 At the same time, the utility is helping some of its customers reduce their emissions through imaginative uses of electricity. Fender Guitars was having trouble meeting air-quality standards because its wood coatings emit gases as they dry. But Southern California Edison developed a process to cure the coatings using ultraviolet and infrared light, reducing the quantity of solvents needed and therefore reducing the pollution.
Under a broad-based program of trading pollution credits, Mr. Hertel said, more companies would be willing to invest in similar innovations, since they could pay for the investment by selling the resulting emissions credits.
"By unleashing the innovation that comes from people looking to make a dollar from reducing emissions," Mr. Hertel said, "I think we're going to see much more rapid progress towards the clean-air goal than we would under the old command-and-control system."
The owner of the Coatings Resource Corporation, Ed Laird, said the company was well on its way to eliminating completely its use of paint and coatings ingredients that contain a type of gas known as volatile organic compounds. Suppliers of the resins that go into his paints and coatings are already developing products that do not have the compounds, he said.
But what to many companies is the plan's virtue -- allowing industry to meet emission-reduction quotas any way it wants -- is a curse to others. Mr. Babikian of ARCO said the program would benefit the company for several years because it knows how to squeeze a certain additional amount of pollution out of its operations. After that, Mr. Babikian said, there is no assurance that the oil industry will be able to develop the technology needed to reduce its emissions of nitrogen oxides by 8 percent annually through the year 2010, as the plan requires.
"We'd be relying on technological innovations that may or may not take place," he said. If ARCO were forced to bid for pollution credits to meet its quota, Mr. Babikian said, it would only encourage more small companies to cash in their credits and move out of the region.
At Terra Furniture, Gary Stafford, the chief financial officer, said the company, which has 50 employees, probably could not afford to meet its emission-reduction quota by purchasing credits at an estimated cost of $40,000 per annual ton.
Yet the cost of meeting the quota by installing new technology to reduce emissions is also prohibitive, probably $1 million plus operating costs. Even being able to sell the resulting emissions credits would not make a $1 million investment economical, Mr. Stafford said.
It is unclear whether furniture makers will be included in the new plan. The air-quality agency wants to start only with companies that emit more than four tons of pollutants a year, and about half the furniture companies in the region fall below that threshold. But despite his reservations, Mr. Stafford is lobbying for the industry to be included because the new approach would delay until after the year 2000 emission-reduction goals that furniture makers and some other companies would otherwise have to meet by 1997.

WHAT FACTORIES WILL HAVE TO DO
 
A factory must reduce emmissions each year by preset amounts (8 percent annually for nitrogen oxides and 6 percent annually for reactive organic gases). The rules would initally cover 2,700 at the largest polluters.
 
A company that pollutes can . . .
 
. . . reduce production or close down.
If a factory cuts pollution by more than the required amount it can . . .
 
. . . invest in new technology or processes to reduce pollution by at least the required amount. If the company reduces polution by more than the required amount, it can . . .
 
. . . purchase a credit from a company that has exceeded its goal for emissions reductions.
 
. . . sell the credit on an open markeet.
It can keep the money or use the investment in pollution-control technology.
 
. . . bank the credit to help meet its reduction quota in coming years.

Nippon Phone Looking for Cash

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Japan is moving to allow foreigners to buy a stake in its largest company, the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation. It is an offer that foreigners can be grateful was not made earlier.
The shares of N.T.T., once a Government-owned telephone monopoly, have fallen 80 percent from their 1987 peak. The company, which is still partly owned by the Government, has faced growing competition within Japan. That, plus the Japanese bear market, has made N.T.T.'s stock a disastrous performer. It has become a symbol of Japan's financial excesses in the 1980's. 
 The Japanese Cabinet is expected to approve on Friday a proposal from the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications to allow N.T.T. to sell shares directly to investors, and allow foreigners to buy up to 20 percent of the company. Cabinet approval would send the proposal on to the Parliament, where approval is expected. The legislation would specify that no foreigners could serve on N.T.T.'s board.
 
How High Is Too High?
 Whether foreigners will want to buy may depend on whether they accept arguments that N.T.T., its market capitalization down to about $75 billion, is no longer priced absurdly high compared with the world's other telephone companies. On the surface, that does not appear to be the case. Even after falling 19,000 yen, to 640,000 yen yesterday -- or about $4,800 a share -- the total value of its 15.6 million shares is still greater than the $70 billion market value of Philip Morris, the largest American company by capitalization.
N.T.T. shares are trading at a multiple of about 50 times estimated earnings for the fiscal year ending next week, and the company, citing the slowing Japanese economy, has warned that profits may fall next year.
But Jeffrey Zavattero, an analyst for Jardine Fleming in Tokyo, argues that as a multiple of cash flow, the stock price is comparable to that of other phone companies -- about six times cash flow. N.T.T. takes a huge charge for depreciation, reflecting its large capital spending program and its relatively rapid depreciation of many assets, but the cash-flow calculation ignores depreciation, as well as capital spending.
Mr. Zavattero said yesterday that he believed N.T.T.'s profits could rise rapidly if Japanese Government regulators would allow it to raise rates on local calls, which are now much cheaper than in most other countries.
Such issues did not seem to matter in early 1987, when N.T.T. was one of the hottest stocks in the world, with a market capitalization that amazed foreigners. It went public when the Government sold part of its holding in February 1987, at 1.6 million yen a share. There was a frenzy to own the shares, and those who got in on that first offering quickly felt rich, as the shares nearly doubled, reaching 3.18 million yen.
At its peak, foreign skeptics noted, N.T.T. was valued at about $350 billion, or more than the entire German stock market. Even after the 1987 market crash, the Government was able to sell shares to the public in two additional offerings, at 2.55 million yen and 1.9 million yen a share.
In the days of hectic rises for N.T.T., the Government ownership of most of the shares helped push up the share price. Japanese institutional investors had to have a market weighting in N.T.T., but at the beginning only one-eighth of the company's shares were publicly held, although the company's weighting in stock indexes assumed that all shares were available. Not everyone could have a market weighting, but many were trying.
Now, with the Government's stake down to about 65 percent, its holdings seem to have the opposite effect. The Government wants to sell more, in large part to keep its budget deficit down. It had planned to sell 500,000 shares in the fiscal year that ends March 31, and the same number of shares in each of the next four years. Such sales would cut the Government's stake to about 50 percent and raise, at the current price, about $12 billion.
But no sale will be made in the current year, in large part because officials concluded the market could not absorb those extra shares. In the current fiscal year, the shares have fallen 40 percent in value. The Government still wants to sell shares in the next fiscal year, however, and the knowledge that those shares are overhanging the market may have helped depress the price.
The proposed legislation expected to be approved by the Cabinet on Friday would not affect those sales. Instead, it would clear the way for the company to make its own sales, with the money going into its coffers rather than the Government's. Mr. Zavattero said he expected any such sale would not be of shares outright, but of convertible bonds.
N.T.T. can use the money. A company official was quoted by Bloomberg Business News yesterday as having said that the company planned capital spending of 1.94 trillion yen, or about $15 billion, in the fiscal year that begins next week, up 3 percent from the current fiscal year.

HEADLINE: Pace of Congressional Politics Picks Up

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING

DATELINE: TRENTON, March 24

 BODY:
With a new redistricting map in place, the tempo of Congressional politics quickened today with the announcement of a Republican candidate in the redrawn Sixth District on the Jersey Shore and an acknowledgement by Frank J. Guarini that he will fight to keep his seat in the newly drawn, heavily Hispanic 13th District in Hudson and Union Counties.
In the Sixth District, Grace Applegate, who served in the administrations of Gov. Thomas H. Kean in Trenton and President Bush in Washington, announced today that she would run for the Republican nomination for the seat vacated by Bernard J. Dwyer. Mr. Dwyer, a Democrat, announced on Saturday that he would not seek re-election to the seat he has held since 1980.
 
Moving to Old Bridge
 
 A major reason, the 71-year-old Congressman said in a statement, was that he did not want to run again in a district that had been so revised that he would not know half the voters and they would not know him.
His withdrawal left Representative Frank J. Pallone Jr. as the odds-on favorite to become the Democratic nominee in the Sixth. Mr. Pallone now represents the adjacent Third District, in Ocean and Monmouth Counties, but was thrown into Mr. Dwyer's Sixth District by the redistricting plan adopted last week.
As the only incumbent seeking the Democratic nomination, Mr. Pallone will have a strong advantage, but he may be challenged in the primary by Assemblyman Robert G. Smith of Piscataway, who is expected to announce his intentions on Thursday.
Ms. Applegate is leaving a job as special assistant to an Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services. She will move to Old Bridge from Washington. Before taking the Washington job, she served for eight years in the New Jersey Department of Labor.
Meanwhile, Mr. Pallone stepped up his own campaign for election to a fourth term in a new district by gaining the endorsement of the Sierra Club, which is considered important along the Jersey Shore, where pollution is both a personal and economic consideration because of the tourist dollar.
The newly drawn 13th District, in Hudson and Union Counties, was inherited by Representative Frank J. Guarini, the incumbent Democrat in the 14th, which is being dismantled. There has been speculation that Mr. Guarini might not run for an eighth term to make way for a Hispanic candidate in the new district, which has been redrawn to become 43 percent Hispanic.
But a spokesman for Mr. Guarini in Washington, Brook Anderson, said today that "he is running" in the reconstituted 13th, but no date has been set for a formal announcement. Speculation has centered on a possible candidacy by a Democratic State Senator, Robert Menendez of Union City, a Cuban-American with a substantial following, but he has not made his intentions known.
Brian Hughes, son of former Gov. Richard J. Hughes, has announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination to oppose Chris Smith, the Republican incumbent, in the Fourth District, which sprawls across parts of Burlington, Middlesex, Mercer, Monmouth and Ocean Counties.
Mr. Hughes, who is employed by the Governor's Council on Alcohol and Drug Abuse and who is in favor of abortion rights, has said he will concentrate on health care and economic issues, but is also expected to make an issue of Mr. Smith's prominence as a nationally known anti-abortion leader.

HEADLINE: Trenton Ponders Change In Tough Sewer Controls

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J., March 24

 BODY:
Environmentalists and advocates of development clashed today over suggestions for easing New Jersey's stringent moratorium on sewer connections.
The law, which has been in effect since 1973, halted any new hook-ups last year in nearly half of the state's communities because local treatment plants were releasing unclean water or were at maximum capacity. 
 The state Department of Environmental Protection and Energy is considering relaxing the sewer connection ban. At an informal hearing at Rutgers University here today, department officials heard arguments from both sides on options that ranged from keeping the ban to adopting intermediate measures where violations are minor to scrapping all the restrictions.
Last year, 249 of the state's 567 municipalities where wholly or partly under a ban. The list was reduced to 142 municipalities when dozens of communities in Bergen and Union counties were recently removed after large central sewer plants came into compliance.
 
Economic Impact Cited
 Modifying the New York metropolitan region's most stringent sewer restrictions, the department said in a working paper, would open the way for more development in an economically depressed time. It would also undermine some municipalities' use of sewer bans as a tool for stopping growth, which the state described as an unintended result.
The law has come under particular attack from developers since the Clean Water Enforcement Act took effect last summer. That law, which the developers fought, imposes stiff fines on communities that pollute.
With the ban slowing development in many communities, representatives of business interests declared, the state's economic recession, in which 50,000 construction workers have been idled, is being made worse.
"Of all the Department of Environmental Protection regulations, this one has probably had the most devastating effect on development," said Peter A. Buchsbaum, a Woodbridge lawyer who spoke for a commercial developers' group. "It's not like wetlands rules, which only say, 'Don't go there, go here.' It simply stops all development in its tracks."
But William R. Neil, assistant director of conservation, of the New Jersey Audubon Society, challenged that view.
"Hard economic times are being used as the justification for caving in to officials and special interests who never liked these laws or met the funding deadlines, even in much better financial times," Mr. Neil said in a prepared statement.
 
Some Cities Like the Ban
 The state seemed to acknowledge that an unintended consequence of the sewer ban law has been for many municipalities to accept the moratorium as more or less permanent, neither seeking to lift it nor appropriating the money to correct the defect that brought it on.
Some communities have had all or part of their area on the restricted list for more than a decade. The state says, for example, that Caldwell Borough in Essex County has been under a ban since Jan. 1, 1979, because its treatment plant is at maximum capacity and is discharging insufficiently treated water. Allentown Borough, in Monmouth County, has been under the ban since July 1973, and dozens of the 144 areas where sewer hook-ups are banned have been in that situation since the mid-1980's.
Dirk Hoffman, the head of the Sewer and Waste Water Trust Fund, which was set up by the state to help communities meet state rules, pointed out today that many municipalities had not bothered to apply for the funds available to them.
As a result, the state working paper noted, the violations that prompted many restrictions on new hook-ups have not been corrected.
Of four options being weighed, the state seemed to favor a modification of the law to take into account the degree of pollution and the willingness of sewer authorities to fix the problem.
 
Second Law Applies
 "When a sewer-connection ban is imposed for permit violations that are environmentally insignificant," the discussion paper said, "strict compliance with the sewer-connection ban criteria is difficult to implement and defend."
The other options are to withhold the ban if the violation is intermittent and the sewer authority agrees to correct the problem, to scrap the ban outright or to leave the law unchanged.
John R. Weingart, assistant commissioner for regulation, said any formal proposals to modify the law would be published in the fall and subject to formal hearings before their adoption.
The meeting today came a day after the Department of Environmental Protection released a study of the first six months' operation of the Clean Water Enforcement Act. The act's stiff fines for improper waste water treatment systems were held up today as making the system of sewer bans unnecessary.
The report noted a large increase in the number of agreements to correct waste-water violations, most of them coming before the act took effect from officials seeking to avoid the law's penalties.
But Alan I. Mytelka, director of the Interstate Sanitation Commission, a regulatory agency covering New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, urged the state to retain some role in regulating local sewers. Local politics seems to get in the way of effective regulation, Mr. Mytelka said, when only local officials decide issues with statewide impacts.

HEADLINE: Senate Panel Votes $25 Billion for S.& L.'s

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 24

 BODY:
The Senate Banking Committee adopted legislation today that would provide an additional $25 billion for savings and loan bailouts and would, for the first time, make public the examiners' reports on failed financial institutions.
The bill, sent to the full Senate on a voice vote, would bring the total taxpayer cost of the bailout program to $130 billion. That is still short of the $160 billion the Bush Administration says it needs to complete the bailout but would be enough to carry the program until April 1, 1993, well past the election. 
 The committee voted 12 to 8 to include "sunshine" provisions sponsored by Senator Timothy Wirth, Democrat of Colorado. They would require regulators to make public the examination reports of banks and savings and loan associations that later failed. Names of borrowers would be deleted, except those of board members and other insiders.
Regulators also would be required to make public the terms of settlements they reached with bank officials sued for fraud or negligence.
Two weeks ago the House Banking Committee voted 31 to 17 to adopt similar financing legislation, but without the broader provisions of the Senate bill. The chairman of that panel, Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, Democrat of Texas, refused to permit amendments.
In a letter today, Mr. Gonzalez asked House Speaker Thomas S. Foley of Washington to demand support for the bill from President Bush. Mr. Gonzalez said he saw little Republican backing for the measure in the full House and doubted whether it would pass without a majority of both parties.
The Senate provisions on disclosure are intended to make it easier for Congress and the public to assess failures and judge the fairness of civil settlements that recoup losses.
"Let's get these decisions out into the sun," Senator Wirth said. "Sunshine is the best antiseptic."
Regulators opposed his provisions, arguing that the threat of disclosure would turn bank examinations into an adversarial proceeding and that disclosing terms of settlements might encourage defendants to fight Government suits rather than settle quietly.
Another provision by Mr. Wirth would extend from three years to five years the statute of limitations for such civil suits brought by the bailout agency, the Resolution Trust Corporation. The agency seized more than 300 failed savings and loans in 1989 and said it was having trouble meeting the current three-year deadline.
 
Aid for Ailing Savings Institutions
 At the urging of Senator Terry Sanford, Democrat of North Carolina, senators also agreed to earmark $1.85 billion of the $25 billion for assistance for operating but ailing savings institutions.
Senator Sanford said pumping money into open institutions was cheaper in many cases than closing them. He said it was better for the economy because it would avoid the forced sale of the loans and real estate owned by the weak institution.
A Bush Administration oversight panel headed by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady is considering whether to adopt a policy on assistance for open savings institutions and has scheduled a hearing on the subject for Wednesday.
The Senate committee rejected by a mostly party-line 11-to-10 vote a motion by Jake Garn of Utah, the senior Republican on the panel, that would have stripped all provisions but the financing from the bill.
Mr. Garn said even well-meant extraneous provisions would encourage a flood of amendments when the legislation reached the Senate floor, making it impossible to meet an April 1 deadline for keeping the Resolution Trust Corporation going. Legislation passed by Congress in November authorized an increase in bailout spending but said it must be spent by April 1.

HEADLINE: Bank Fund And C.D. Yields Mixed

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH M. FOWLER

 BODY:
Yields on bank money market accounts and short-term certificates of deposit continued to give mixed signals last week, according to The Bank Rate Monitor, which tracks bank rates.
Robert K. Heady, publisher of The Monitor, said yesterday: "Despite the fact that there are more than $100 billion in certificates of deposit maturing in April, banks are going to have a tough time recapturing all that money because of their low interest rates. In the past year, for example, the average yield on one-year certificates of deposit has plunged from 6.53 percent to 4.15 percent." 
 "Typically," he added, "you would now see banks bumping up rates to grab those certificate of deposit rollovers, but because loan demand is weak, their deposit rates suffer." He believes that savers, accustomed to high yields, may now "swing into more speculative, higher-paying investments, such as stocks, bonds and mutual funds."
 
New York-Area Yields
 At New York area commercial banks, the average money market account yield dropped by 2 basis points, to 3.40 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of 1 percent. Among the savings institutions in this area, money market accounts averaged 3.96 percent, up from 3.95 percent a week ago.
Among individual banks in the New York area showing the largest changes in yields, First Fidelity of New Jersey cut its money market account by 25 points. Crossland Savings made the largest changes in three- and six-month certificates of deposit, reducing its three-month certificate by 15 points and its six-month by 9 points.
The Bank Rate Monitor said the average three-month yield at 20 large banks outside the New York area dropped by a point, to 3.57 percent, while the six-month certificate averaged 3.91 percent, up 2 points, an indication of the mixed movements in yields.
By comparison, at the Treasury's weekly auction of three- and six-month bills, the average rate was 4.08 percent and 4.27 percent, respectively.


GRAPHIC: Annual effective yields, in percent, on money market accounts, three-month certificates of deposit and six-month C.D.'s expected at selected institutions on Wednesday, March 25,1992. Some C.D. yields assume reinvestment after maturity. Yields are based on the method of compounding and the rate stated for the lowest minimum to open an account, but minimums may vary. Higher yields may be offered for larger deposits. C.D. figures are for fixed rates only.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Off in Slow Trading As Dealers Await New Data

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar was mostly lower in light trading yesterday as the market awaited further reports to confirm improvement in the American economy.
Currency traders said there was little news to affect the dollar. 
 "It didn't do much -- absolutely boring," said Christopher Bourdain, who heads foreign exchange sales for Credit Suisse in New York.
"The market is mildly convinced we're in some sort of a recovery," he added. "People are waiting for some further confirmation before they buy dollars more."
 
4 Reports Scheduled
 Such news could come today, when the Government releases figures on February durable goods orders, or tomorrow, when fourth-quarter gross domestic product and corporate profits numbers will be announced along with the weekly figures on new unemployment claims.
The disappointing mid-March auto sales figures reported yesterday did not affect foreign exchange markets, Mr. Bourdain said.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 133.80 yen, down 0.40 from Monday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 133.70 yen. In New York, a dollar bought 133.45 yen, unchanged from late on Monday.

Women's Work: The Pay Paradox

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
COMPARED with their European counterparts, American women are more skilled and enjoy greater legal protection against job and pay discrimination. Why, then, is the gap in pay between men and women roughly the same as in Europe -- and in some cases, far greater?
One possibility is that discrimination is actually more pervasive in the United States than indicators suggest. But Francine Blau and Lawrence Kahn, economists at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign campus, offer a very different explanation in an article to be published in the May issue of the American Economic Review. 
 The unique American problem, they argue, is not discrimination but the yawning gap in wages between skilled and unskilled labor. On average, they note, American women are less skilled and have less job experience than American men. And rewards to skill (or penalties for lack thereof) are far greater in the United States than in other countries. Indeed, adjusted for this wage dispersion factor, the gender pay gap is no higher in America than in Scandinavia.
As might be expected, Sweden and Norway do well in gender pay comparisons. By the late 1980's, women were paid 85 to 90 percent as much as men, per hour worked. By contrast, women in tradition-bound Switzerland lagged far behind at 68 percent.
The real surprise is that American women do only slightly better than Swiss, earning roughly 70 cents for every dollar brought home by men for an hour's work. Even more disturbing, the differences between the leaders and the laggards on the pay equality front have widened since the rise of feminism. Back in 1967, the difference between the United States and Norway was 11 percentage points; by 1989 it had widened to 16.
It is not easy to find the smoking gun that explains such large and growing differences. The United States had laws protecting the right to equal pay and equal access to better jobs before Sweden or Norway -- or for that matter, before other European countries that rank fairly well on the gender pay gap.
The two economists do note one striking difference between the United States and other rich countries: Only the United States fails to guarantee the right to maternity leave beyond the period of actual disability. Indeed, most other countries guarantee time off with pay for both pregnancy and care for infants. It thus seems likely that more American women are forced to choose between high-paying careers and motherhood.
But Mr. Kahn argues that the actual impact of leave policies on the gender pay gap is ambiguous. While the laissez-faire American approach surely drives some women off the fast track, it surely also pulls some on. American women who are effectively forced to forgo parenthood to further their careers are better positioned to compete than European women who try to have it both ways.
What, then, does explain the lackluster American performance? Ms. Blau and Mr. Kahn see it as a double whammy. Like Scandinavian women, American women are, on average, less productive than men because they have less training and experience. But unlike Scandinavian women, they are the inadvertent victims of a wage-setting system that has been increasingly apt to punish a lack of skills or experience.
American women are thus "swimming upstream," starting from a position of economic inferiority in a labor market that reserves an ever-skimpier slice of the pie for those at the bottom.
This is only a hypothesis, of course. The meat of the Blau-Kahn contribution is their statistical analysis, which isolates the factors in intercountry pay differences that are specifically related to gender. And as the two economists predicted, sex discrimination does not seem to be an important cause of the relatively poor American experience. Indeed, differences in pay for comparable skills explain 100 percent of the difference in the gender pay gap between Scandinavia and the United States.
On first glance, that appears to be good news. American law and culture seem to have done a good job -- or, at least, as good a job as Sweden and Norway -- in attacking sex discrimination in the workplace.
It is, however, an awkward sort of victory for the American system. The labor market may not be discriminatory in intent. But it is plainly discriminatory in result, rewarding the haves and punishing the have-nots. As the blues singer Billie Holiday once put it in a slightly different context, "God bless' the child that's got his own."
The best one can say for the American labor market is that, given time, unintentional discrimination should be self-correcting. The gap in average skill and experience levels should narrow as better-educated generations of women permeate the work force. Moreover, the gap in pay levels between skilled and unskilled work will probably also narrow as more people, male and female, respond to the increased incentive to go to college.

HEADLINE: EATING WELL;
Testing of Food Pyramid Comes Full Circle

BYLINE: By MARIAN BURROS

 BODY:
ONE million dollars ago, the United States Department of Agriculture put the Eating Right Pyramid graphic on hold because, health professionals and some Federal officials charged, there had been opposition from the meat and dairy industries.
Eleven months later, extensive testing has shown that the pyramid, which divides foods into five groups, remains the strongest choice for conveying one of the Government's most important nutrition messages: eat less fat. 
 That means that the Agriculture Department is faced with a dilemma: it must either go with the original graphic, despite industry opposition, or reject the graphic, despite its advantages, and anger many nutritionists and health professionals. The department would not comment on the report or speculate on when it would be released. The decision will probably affect how nutrition is taught for decades to come.
Concerned that the Agriculture Department cannot educate the public about nutrition while promoting the economic well-being of the food industry, the Department of Health and Human Services has involved itself in the deliberations.
"H.H.S. put money in to keep U.S.D.A. honest," said one Agriculture Department staff member involved in the deliberations who was afraid she would lose her job if she allowed her name to be used. So the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, will help the Secretary of Agriculture, Edward R. Madigan, make the final decision.
Meat and dairy producers have not changed their minds about the pyramid, which advises the public to use fats and oils "sparingly," and says that meats and dairy products should be eaten less frequently than fruits, vegetables and grains.
"The industry would have preferred anything but the pyramid," said Jeannine Kenney, legislative representative for the National Milk Producers Federation. "The pyramid gave a very negative image. It appeared to rank food." Mark Armentrout, chairman of the food policy committee of the National Cattleman's Association, said, "Something is a better alternative than the pyramid."
The Eating Right Pyramid, created for the Department of Agriculture, was to have made its debut last April. When Secretary Madigan delayed its publication, he denied that there had been industry pressure and said the graphic had to be tested on schoolchildren.
Since then Bell Associates, a research firm in Boston, has tested a number of other graphics and has narrowed the choices to the pyramid and a bowl, which orders the five food groups horizontally rather than vertically. The research was designed to prove once and for all that one graphic was superior to all the others and to remove politics from the decision.
According to the final draft of the report, the original pyramid, with slight modifications, continues to communicate best the need to reduce the consumption of fats, oils and sugars, and to convey the amount of food that should be eaten from each of the five groups. It also presents the information in the clearest fashion.
The bowl graphic performs best if the primary message is the importance of eating a variety of foods from each of the groups.
If the final report says the same thing, then the pyramid would be the logical choice, said James A. Harrell, deputy director of the office of disease prevention and health promotion in the Department of Health and Human Services.
"If those are the final recommendations from the contractor and the people who do the review of the report, I would have to agree," he said. "But I can't concur now.
The differences between the two graphics are statistically significant but not great. "It's a call of which is the most important message," said the Agriculture Department staff member.
The Health and Human Services Department regards reducing fat as the most important message, as reflected in a report by the Surgeon General in 1988.
"The strongest focus in the Surgeon General's Report is that dietary fat is the single most important factor related to chronic disease," said Dr. Rachel Ballard-Barbash, a medical officer in the division of cancer prevention and control at the National Cancer Institute.
Dr. Ballard-Barbash was an adviser on the original study when she worked in the office of disease prevention and health promotion. At the Agriculture Department, she said, the nutritionists "were certainly aware that the consensus was that dietary fat was of paramount importance."
Experts involved in the project, both inside and outside the Government, have always thought the Government was asking too much from one graphic.
"They can't have one graphic do everything -- children, adults, Hispanics, low income -- or teach everyone what they should eat, how much they should eat, about fats and oils and sugar," said Elaine Arkin, a health communications consultant and adviser on the report. Joanne Tighe, deputy project director at Bell Associates, said: "We told them on July 1 that one graphic will not do everything. They have been putting off the moment of truth."
There are those who think the Government has wasted its money redoing the survey.
"It's a little troubling to see a large sum of money spent and still arrive at a similar conclusion," Dr. Ballard-Barbash said, "but that doesn't mean it shouldn't have been investigated. The folks who did this originally were fairly well-trained nutritionists who had a good knowledge of what was contained in the Surgeon General's Report and in Dietary Guidelines, and they understood where the emphasis was in terms of disease prevention."
To answer the questions raised by Mr. Madigan about the effectiveness of the pyramid, committees were formed to find possible alternatives. Focus groups were consulted and the result was a handful of graphics: variations on the pyramid and on a bowl, a shopping cart, a pie chart, a table top and even some designs from children, like a spaceman.
After further testing, the pyramid and bowl were the clear winners. But consumer groups and many nutritionists still preferred the pyramid.
The bowl and pyramid were then tested on 3,000 people in three age groups. A draft reporting the results of the testing was sent to a panel from the two Cabinet agencies in early January, somewhat behind schedule.
"We were given a ridiculously huge piece of work to do in a very small amount of time," said Jeanne Goldberg, an assistant professor of nutrition at Tufts University, who was the principal investigator on the project.
No one was happy with that draft. Neither the bowl nor the pyramid jumped out as the superior graphic because the Agriculture Department had not decided in advance what messages were the most important: variety, proportionality (how much to eat from each group) or reduction of fats and sugars.
"The problem," Ms. Tighe said, "is that they have to set priorities, because they can't get all the messages across and they have to decide which is the target audience."
Hoping to get a more definitive answer, the panel returned the first draft to the investigators. They were asked to look at the data again and give more weight to some of the questions, particularly those that had to do with the three key messages.
"I think this draft tilts a little bit differently than before, toward the pyramid," said John Vanderveen, director of the division of nutrition at the Food and Drug Administration's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition.
Dr. Cheryl Achterberg, an associate professor of nutrition at Pennsylvania State University and one of the report advisers, said, "Avoiding fats and sugars comes through better in the pyramid." Many people involved generally agree. But all believe that neither the bowl nor pyramid, standing alone, does a particularly good job at conveying information.
"The average person picked up on about one-third of the message on first impression," Dr. Achterberg said. "There was a whole lot they didn't get without instruction."
The latest draft of the report notes "the necessity for presenting either graphic in an educational context."
The respondents were also asked which graphic they preferred, but there was very little difference. "People didn't strongly dislike either one," Dr. Achterberg said.
Few of those involved with the project appear to favor the bowl; some say either would do the job. But among those who favor the pyramid, the support is very strong.
"Looking at the question as an educator," Dr. Achterberg said, "there is no question which one I would pick from an instructional perspective. The pyramid depicts the concepts more clearly and is more teachable. The bowl is more difficult to teach from."
So now the two Secretaries will have to make a policy decision, which is to say, a political decision.
"I wish there were no politics involved in it," said Mary Abbott Hess, former president of the American Dietetic Association and a consultant to the project. "Political influences in nutrition education messages should not be part of the process."
The U.S.D.A. staff member said, "Putting the best light on the expenses and manhours spent searching for the perfect graphic, at least it confirms that the original research project was pretty well designed."

HEADLINE: Two Sound Choices;
A Business Pro at City Hall

 BODY:
Mayor David Dinkins made a wise move by naming a prominent banker to be New York City's Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development. The appointment of Barry Sullivan, retired chairman of the First Chicago Corporation, sends a positive message to business leaders in search of a sympathetic ear at City Hall.
Mr. Dinkins often calls on competent experts from the business world, but just as often fails to act on their counsel. As a member of Mr. Dinkins's inner circle, Mr. Sullivan could have a more direct impact on policy -- if the Mayor is receptive. 
 Not that the Bronx-born banker will always be right. But at least he'll be in a position to bolster business confidence in the city. And he can strengthen City Hall's ties with the private sector, which are still weak despite the tireless efforts of Mr. Sullivan's predecessor, Sally Hernandez-Pinero. Mr. Sullivan is no newcomer to urban issues and political realities; he advised several Chicago mayors.
He will remain a consultant to First Chicago for three years, at an annual salary of $780,000, while donating his after-tax city salary to schools and charity. His deal with First Chicago raises the fear of future conflicts of interest, but that shouldn't be a problem if he keeps his commitment to recuse himself from any dealings the city might have with First Chicago.
Mr. Sullivan's success will depend on many factors, including the overall economy. Not the least of these factors, however, will be the Mayor's willingness to consider his counsel.

HEADLINE: Russia Acts, U.S. Slumbers

 BODY:
No blank check. With that vapid phrase, President Bush sidesteps pressure to organize large-scale Western economic aid for Russia. Apparently unsure that Russian economic reforms are real, he sits on the sidelines as the Russian economy verges on collapse.
Mr. President, take another look. In February the Yeltsin Government and the International Monetary Fund reached agreement on economic measures that will be formalized once Russia becomes a member in April. Since then Russia has further decontrolled prices, slashed military spending, cut subsidies to state enterprises and opened its borders to trade and investment. That's an astonishingly quick leap to markets. 
 These are momentous events; in Russia last August, the Communists were supreme and private property a heresy. Seven months later the Government is about to adopt a plan to privatize more state-owned enterprises in a month than Margaret Thatcher privatized in a decade.
But the transition is painful. Economic output in Russia has fallen 20 percent, a horrifying collapse. Factories are closing because they have been stripped of the ability to import crucial machine parts. Living standards of millions have disintegrated in the wake of galloping inflation. External aid is needed, without delay.
The I.M.F. has now stepped in where Mr. Bush and other Western leaders have refused to tread. It has carefully estimated Russia's need, and negotiated commitments by Mr. Yeltsin to institute strict, immediate fiscal discipline. The I.M.F. staff will recommend that the West provide Russia this year about $12 billion for debt relief, imports to keep factories running and emergency food, medicine and consumer goods to help Russia make it through the cruel first stages of inflation. The staff will also recommend creation of a $6 billion fund to help stabilize the value of the ruble in order to facilitate free trade and investment. The total aid package of $18 billion isn't overly generous, but should prove adequate.
Mr. Yeltsin has begun to carry out his commitments. Virtually all consumer prices have been, or soon will be, set free. The budget deficit has been cut from about 20 percent of gross national product to less than 5 percent -- about the same as in the U.S. And a single exchange rate will be created, its value set by market forces.
There is still one crucial reform to negotiate -- braking the explosive growth in money and credit. Without monetary discipline there will be no reliable price system and economic reform will fail.
Success of a Western aid package will rest on the I.M.F.'s ability to force the Russians to stick by their agreements. The fund has already shown encouraging results in Poland. There the Government undertook radical economic reform subject to an I.M.F. agreement, then wavered under economic pain and political chaos. But the I.M.F. threatened to withdraw aid, and this week the Polish Government proposed a budget that fulfilled its I.M.F. commitments.
What happened in Poland can also happen in Russia, if the U.S. and the rest of the Western Alliance supply enough assistance to give reform a chance.

HEADLINE: Tsongas, Still Ahead of the Curve

BYLINE: By John B. Anderson; John B. Anderson, visiting professor of law at Nova University in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., was an independent candidate for President in 1980.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Paul Tsongas's decison not to contest yesterday's Connecticut primary and pull out of the Democratic Presidential race may dishearten those of us who felt 1992 might see a victory of political substance over style. The lesson, however, is not that the Tsongas campaign failed but that it went as far as it did. Measured against expectations, the Tsongas saga was a triumph.
Unfortunately for Mr. Tsongas -- and for the country as well -- exceeding expectations and scoring moral victories are not what counts in politics. As Churchill growled after the moral triumph of Dunkirk, "Wars are not won by evacuations." 
 America needs a politician committed to cleansing the Augean stables of the residues left by the excesses of the 80's. That resolve has to be accompanied by the ability to create the political, financial and organizational depth to transform it into effective support.
Mr. Tsongas had the right message, an economic message, and it created his candidacy, giving voters a reason to choose him over his more charismatic opponents. His principal failure was an unwillingness to project that message relentlessly throughout the campaign.
It took him far indeed -- much further in delegates and primary victories than a similar message took me in the Republican primaries of 1980. We should recognize its powerful themes. Investment should be emphasized over increased consumption. There is a need for sacrifice, including an energy tax on each gallon on gasoline. Increased military spending and lower taxes will not yield a balanced budget except with the use of mirrors.
I believe that the Tsongas campaign succeeded in New Hampshire -- his greatest triumph -- because the candidate was better at retailing this message than at packaging it for wholesale distribution. In the Granite State, where voters believe they have to meet a candidate to know him, his almost painful honesty could be discerned and respected.
In the unblinking eye of the television camera, which was the means of communication in larger states, that important characteristic was somehow strained out.
As time went on, his novelty was eroded by a growing suspicion, nurtured by his adversaries, that in some Orwellian way truth in a political campaign is really fiction. He unwittingly fortified that assessment when he began attacking Gov. Bill Clinton on the issue of electability. Even the most unsophisticated voter understood that this was really an assault on Governor Clinton's character. That tactic reduced Paul Tsongas to just another political brawler. In any contest simply between politicians, Mr. Clinton was clearly the superior craftsman.
The American people are prepared more than ever to support a return to sensible economic policies. They are prepared for sacrifice if convinced that sacrifice will bring results. They are prepared for higher taxes if convinced the money will not be wasted. They hunger for someone who has a credible plan for long-term economic growth that includes reinvigorating industries that create real wealth such as high technology.
Deeply skeptical of politicians and promises, the public is even prepared to hear the truth. And as the protracted recession, the shrinking of the middle class and the dramatic loss of our economic power to other countries expose the fraud of the Reagan economic myths, the public is becoming increasingly angry and more than just a little scared.
Why, then, will Governor Clinton probably win the nomination? Personality, chutzpah, good organization, good networking, a strong regional constituency and enough money raised early to overcome political setbacks and to survive -- all these are important.
But Bill Clinton will win by default. Not just because Mr. Tsongas abandoned his message and Senators Bob Kerrey and Tom Harkin had no relevant messages to begin with, and not just because Jerry Brown was a supremely flawed messenger from the start, but because the heavyweights of the Democratic Party -- people like Mario Cuomo, Al Gore and Dick Gephardt -- lacked the moral courage and political conviction to fight for their principles and for their country's well-being when the occasion demanded it.

HEADLINE: Metal Detectors Won't Stop School Violence;
Expectations of Failure

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your excerpt from Dr. Johnny Ray Youngblood's eulogy for Ian Moore, one of two students shot to death by another student in a Brooklyn high school Feb. 26 ("What Will Ian Tell God About Us?" Op-Ed, March 8), leaves a great deal unspoken in its plea to all, especially black youth, to reflect on violence's implications.
There seems to me to be essential facets of the black experience in America that crave, but seldom find expression. That is because the dynamics of oppression rely upon the victim blaming himself for his own victimization. 
 The African-American experience began with slavery. Slavery was extremely costly -- most costly when it was most ruthless. It had to go. The Industrial Revolution brought new indignities for blacks. Not only did they all now have to fend for themselves economically, but also in the South, until very recently, they lost virtually all protection of law. In the North, Jim Crow ruled.
Throughout our history, every black child who can trace his or her origins to the slave trade has grown up surrounded by the most profound expectations of failure. How some black families have prospered and thrived, and how some black children have nevertheless managed to excel, represents not only the proverbial triumph of hope over experience, but a wellspring of creative love that can only be imagined by others.
Today, for most black children without effective networks of personal support, the first complete confirmations of expectations of failure occur regularly in inner-city public schools. By the age of 9 or 10, many a black child has become aware of only two certainties: schools are places where learning is supposed to take place, and he or she has learned next to nothing. Such black children do not have to hear Patrick J. Buchanan or David Duke tell them they are unworthy of full participation in the broader culture. Children always tend to blame themselves for the omissions of those responsible for their welfare.
Of all the passions, the passion for justice may be the most transcendent. That is why the mind that is entreated to "Think! Think!" is likely to do precisely that -- and come up with the wrong answer. The injustice of an educational system that will not teach is so monumental that the infant's search for justice sees no alternative but to resolve itself into a false conclusion that there must be an innate inability to learn.
As for the gun that killed Ian Moore and Tyrone Sinkler, it is something you and I put into their assailant's hand.

Prices Rise as New Notes Sell Well

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices jumped nearly a point yesterday on a successful note auction and fresh signs of weakness in the auto industry, sending the key long-bond yield below 8 percent.
"There was a lot of fear going into the auction," said Mead Briggs, trading department manager at Deutsche Bank Government Securities. "When the results came out, everyone sort of sighed with relief." 
 The 8 percent 30-year bond closed up nearly a full point, or 30/32 , at 10017/32 , sending the yield down to 7.95 percent, from 8.03 percent Monday.
 
Gain on Auto Numbers
 Mr. Briggs said the market first gained on a surprising dip in auto sales. Sales of North American-made cars and trucks fell 2.7 percent, major auto makers reported, breaking a string of sales gains for Detroit.
But the early upward move was tempered, as traders waited for the results of the two-year note auction to be released in the afternoon.
The Treasury Department said it sold $14.8 billion of the notes at an average yield of 5.85 percent and set a 5.75 percent coupon. Traders picked up the two-year notes in the when-issued market and brought the yield down to 5.79 percent by the end of the day.
"The two-year was the stellar performer," Mr. Briggs said.
 
Retail Sales Outlook
 The market also took some heart from a Johnson Redbook Service report that showed weak retail sales, one analyst said. The report showed sales at discount and department store chains fell 2.6 percent in March from February.
The analyst, who asked not to be identified, said the market was growing relieved after weeks of positive economic news raised fears of unbridled growth, which could touch off the inflation that erodes the value of fixed-income securities.
"The market assumed a more rapid pace of recovery than seems likely and the auto sales number brings people back to reality," the analyst said. "The improvement will be limited."
The success of the two-year auction sets an encouraging precedent for the $10.25 billion five-year note auction today, but several factors could temper enthusiasm, traders said.
If the market is overvalued, a strong rise in February durable goods data to be released today could shatter the market's gains of yesterday, they said. Five-year yields may also need to rise from current levels to woo investors, traders added. The when-issued five-year note was yielding 6.98 percent.
 
Good Day for Bills
 The bill sector had solid price advances yesterday. Three-month yields were down 4 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 4.05 percent; six-month yields fell 7 points, to 4.19 percent, and the one-year bill was down 11 points, to 4.40 percent.
The price of the 5 3/8 percent two-year note rose 6/32 , to 9912/32 , to yield 5.72 percent. The price of the 7 1/2 percent 10-year note increased 19/32 , to 9927/32 , to yield 7.52 percent.
Federal funds were trading at 3.75 percent late in the day, just below the Federal Reserve's presumed 4 percent target. The Fed refrained from open-market activity when funds were trading at 3.875 percent.
 Following are the results of yesterday's auction of two-year notes: (000 omitted in dollar figures)

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Strategy;
NEW YORK BATTLE GAINS IN INTENSITY AS BROWN SURGES

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

 BODY:
The battle for New York began in earnest yesterday as Gov. Bill Clinton struggled with a gritty new problem handed him by the voters of Connecticut: how to deal with former Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr., emboldened by victory and ready to roll.
Mr. Clinton's campaign had hoped to be focused on President Bush by now, but instead found that Mr. Brown's upset victory in Connecticut on Tuesday had transformed the race for the Democratic Presidential nomination and left the Arkansas Governor with a lot to prove in the April 7 primaries in New York, Wisconsin and Kansas. 
 Mr. Clinton responded yesterday with a new attack on Mr. Brown's proposal for a 13 percent flat tax, which aides said was the beginning of a renewed debate with the former California Governor on economics. Mr. Brown countered with a bitter assault on Mr. Clinton's labor record, and the stage seemed to be set for a bruising, two-week New York campaign.
 
Clinton's Headaches
 Despite his seven-to-one edge in delegates, Mr. Clinton finds himself confronted with an opponent who revels in probing his "character issues" and delights in assaults on the Democratic establishment. Add to this the discontent among voters this year with politics-as-usual, and the movement of this two-man race into ever-volatile New York, and Mr. Clinton has major headaches.
Mr. Brown, who has suddenly acquired the news media entourage and other trappings of a winning candidate, said, "It's David vs. Goliath, but that slingshot is getting pretty big and pretty heavy."
In Albany, he looked on with delight as Gov. Mario M. Cuomo declared that Mr. Brown was a viable candidate. Mr. Brown, who condemned his rivals as creations of the news media and tools of special interests, clearly relished his moment in the limelight.
 
'The Campaign Has Just Begun'
 The humbling of an establishment front-runner fits perfectly with the script of the Brown campaign. Patrick Caddell, a strategist who advises Mr. Brown, declared in an interview yesterday: "People are being told that the system will be what it is, and it's being jammed down their throats. Yesterday, they turned around and said, 'No, it's not going to be jammed down our throats.' " Mr. Caddell added, "As far as I'm concerned, the campaign has just begun."
Mr. Clinton, many Democrats agree, needs to rebuild his image as a populist for the middle class, an image that he rode to victories in primaries in the South and Midwest. He also needs to convince voters that he, not Mr. Brown, is the most promising candidate of change, these Democrats say.
These are the strategic imperatives behind Mr. Clinton's new attack on Mr. Brown's tax policies, which he declared yesterday was a "war-on-New-York tax" that "sounds great and sounds simple but would make things worse."
James Carville, Mr. Clinton's strategist, said, "We're going to run against him the same way we'd run against any other candidate who wants to raise taxes on people making $50,000 a year and cut them on people making half a million."
Mr. Brown defends his proposal as a measure that would result in lower taxes for middle- and lower-income people. On the CBS News program "This Morning" yesterday, he asserted that the tax plan "will shift to business the share that they have often been able to avoid by deducting their power lunches, their trips to Hawaii and all of the other things that they do that average people can't do."
 
An 'Immunized' Candidate
 In general, Mr. Clinton must walk a fine line. If he goes head to head with Mr. Brown, he runs the risk of letting the former California Governor set the terms of the debate, and being distracted from the larger dialogue with Mr. Bush, some Democrats fear. Moreover, some Democrats suggest that Mr. Brown has "immunized" himself from many of the Clinton attacks, by the very nature of his campaign.
"He's saying, 'This isn't about me, this is about taking back the system,' " said Bill Carrick, a veteran Democratic strategist. "He says, 'Yeah, I raised the money, yeah, I did all this, but now I've seen the light.' "
Other Democrats, however, agree with Jeff Neubauer, the chairman of the Wisconsin Democratic Party and a Clinton supporter. "To borrow a phrase from Lee Atwater, I think they're going to have to scrape the bark off Brown."
Mickey Kantor, the Clinton campaign chairman, who also ran Mr. Brown's 1976 presidential campaign and 1982 Senate campaign, asserts that the voters will soon see the difference between the two men. "Jerry is getting what he wants," said Mr. Kantor. "Jerry wants attention. When the lights go off, Jerry disappears."
There are also clear dangers for Mr. Clinton in seeming to slight Mr. Brown's challenge; he runs the risk of seeming presumptuous and setting himself up for another comeuppance from the voters. For now, at least, the Clinton campaign seems intent on sending humility signals. "Clinton is out there fighting for the nomination, fighting for the votes of New York and Wisconsin and everywhere else," said Mr. Stephanopoulos.
The calendar over the next month brings only three small caucuses and a primary in Puerto Rico before the New York, Wisconsin and Kansas contests; after the voting there, the next major primary is not until April 28 in Pennsylvania, meaning that candidates who falter in New York would have a long wait to recover their footing.
Many of Mr. Clinton's allies yesterday tried to present the Connecticut results as a valuable lesson, delivered early enough in the process so that he can quickly correct course. Other Democrats argue that Mr. Clinton should consider Mr. Brown's challenge an opportunity to address the voters' unease about such issues as his wife's partnership in a law firm that does business with the state of Arkansas.
"It would be a lot easier to answer them with Jerry Brown raising them, than with the President of the United States raising them," said Harrison Hickman, a Democratic polltaker.
Mr. Stephanopoulos said Mr. Clinton will handle those doubts the way he did in earlier primaries: "by fighting for something bigger than yourself, by making people understand that this is a big election about big issues, and by putting Bill Clinton out there."
Still, Mr. Caddell, who said he was informally advising Mr. Brown, asserted that forces were stirring in the nation that would be hard to stop. He compared it to the collapse of the Hapsburg Empire, and said the residents of the Washington establishment were utterly unaware of its magnitude. "I think the thing builds," Mr. Caddell said. "Once the toothpaste is out of the tube, it's hard to put it back in."

HEADLINE: U.S. and Allies to Resume Effort To Get Sanctions Against Libya

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, March 25

 BODY:
The United States, Britain and France indicated today that they would press ahead with demands for Security Council sanctions against Libya because it appeared unready to turn over two suspects in the 1988 downing of an American jetliner.
The United States representative to the United Nations, Thomas R. Pickering, said he would now speed up discussion of the sanctions resolution with other Council members. 
 Mr. Pickering had expressed skepticism on Monday when the Libyan United Nations representative said his country would turn over the two agents to the Arab League, initiating a procedure for eventual trial in Britain or the United States. Today, Mr. Pickering accused the Libyans of playing "a shell game."
 
Libyan Offer Unclear
 Accounts from the Middle East differed on the exact position Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, Libya's leader, had taken on the matter. But envoys from the Arab League who met with him in the Libyan capital, Tripoli, on Tuesday night were in agreement when they returned to Cairo today that Colonel Qaddafi is unwilling to see the two accused officials delivered to American or British authorities, as the Security Council has demanded.
American, British and French diplomats predicted that the Council would vote either Friday or next Monday on a resolution that would impose a ban on airline flights to and from Libya, prohibit the sale of planes, spare parts and all arms to the North African nation and require all governments to reduce the size of Libyan embassies in their capitals. It would also ask Colonel Qaddafi for concrete evidence that he has renounced terrorism, for instance by providing details about terrorists he has trained or armed.
The diplomats brushed aside reports circulating in the Arab world that Libya's Arab League envoy, Ali Treiki, was on his way to the league's Cairo headquarters with a letter giving Colonel-Qaddafi's "reply" to a plan the Arab envoys presented to him on Tuesday night for turning over the accused men to the West.
 
Role of U.N. Leader
 Under this plan, the Arab League would have taken custody of the Libyans and turned them over to the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Ghali, who in turn would transfer them to London or Washington. Mr. Ghali never accepted such a role, however, saying the Arab League should turn the suspects over directly to the United States or Britain in the presence of a United Nations official.
However, hopes rose on Monday that the Arab League might be able to negotiate a transfer arrangement with Libya acceptable to the three Western powers after Libya's United Nations representative said a "decision" had been made in Tripoli to give the accused men to the Arab League.
Significantly, though, the Libyan representative, Ali Ahmed el-Houderi, gave no clear commitment that the Arab League would then be allowed to pass them on to Britain or the United States, although a number of diplomats suggested that this was what would happen.
 
Sanctions Effort Suspended
 As a result the British and French had said on Monday that they would briefly suspend their sanctions campaign in order to give the Arab envoys a chance to work out an agreement with Libyan diplomats.
The Security Council voted in January that Libya must hand over the suspects to the United States or Britain and send four other Libyans for questioning by a French magistrate investigating the destruction of a French airliner over sub-Saharan Africa in 1989 with the loss of 170 people.
Accounts also varied as to what happened when the seven-member Arab League team reached Tripoli on Tuesday. But it appears that the four Foreign Ministers and three high officials were kept waiting until after midnight before Colonel-Qaddafi received them along with his second-in-command, Abdul Salaam Jalloud.
Colonel Qaddafi, the accounts say, then berated the Arab team for trying to conduct business with him during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. He said that what Mr. Houderi had said was "inaccurate," although India's Ambassador in Tripoli had been told by Mr. Jalloud last week that Libya was ready to yield the accused men to the Arab League .
In Cairo today, some of the Arab envoys said Libya wanted the league to hold the two suspects in a United Nations building in Tripoli until the World Court rules on its argument that it has a right to try them itself. The World Court at The Hague is to begin hearing Libya's case on Thursday.
Others thought the Libyan leader was unwilling to hand them over to anyone until the World Court gives its judgment, which could take months. A third version of events was that Libya would only surrender them if ordered to do so by the World Court.
Although the Security Council is expected to vote sanctions against Libya by a comfortable margin, representatives of Arab nations and developing countries appear unhappy at the prospect. Yet they are obviously reluctant to incur the wrath of the United States, Britain and France by seeming to defend Colonel Qaddafi.
 
Warnings to Libya
 But they have been warning Libya, diplomats here say, that the sanctions the Council is planning to impose may prove much harder to lift than to impose.
This is because in its proposed form, the sanctions resolution requires Colonel Qaddafi not only to renounce terrorism but to provide persuasive, specific evidence that he has done so.
This means that handing over the accused Libyans and sending the others to the French magistrate would not necessarily lead to the restoration of normal aviation links or the relaxation of any other restrictions.
At present, a number of international airlines, including Swissair, Lufthansa, K.L.M. and Alitalia, fly to and from Libya, in addition to Libyan Arab Airlines, the country's national carrier.
The United States and other western Security Council could demand that Libya also destroy terrorist training camps under international inspection and disclose the names of all the terrorist groups whose members it has trained, supported or armed, including identification of individuals.
Britain has already accused Libya of training and arming Irish Republican Army guerrillas operating in Northern Ireland, and international police forces and justice ministers believe that many Palestinian groups have close ties with Libya.
As a result, some third world countries are warning Colonel Qaddafi's representatives that the sanctions the Council is now discussing, once adopted, may be in force for a long time. They assert that the real aim of the United States is to force Colonel Qaddafi from power, just as it wants to keep sanctions in place against Iraq until President Saddam Hussein is overthrown.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: New York;
Brown and Clinton Trade Blows in New York Contest

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
In a political world redefined by Edmund G. Brown Jr.'s narrow victory in the Connecticut primary, Mr. Brown and Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas campaigned yesterday for the pivotal New York primary, which will decide who gets the bulk of the state's rich lode of 244 convention delegates and whether Mr. Clinton can get back on a glide path to the nomination.
Mr. Clinton, trying to rebound from the setback dealt by Mr. Brown's populist send-them-a-message campaign, demonstrated that he, for one, had got the message. The Arkansas Governor immediately focused his campaign on Mr. Brown, the former California Governor, denouncing his proposal to replace existing Federal taxes with a flat 13 percent income tax and a 13 percent value-added tax on goods and services as "a war on New York tax." Mr. Clinton suggested that the state's April 7 primary be transformed into a referendum on the tax plan, which is a centerpiece of Mr. Brown's campaign. 
 Mr. Clinton's assessment of the effect of the tax proposal was largely echoed by Carol O'Cleireacain, New York City's finance commissioner, in an analysis ordered by Mayor David N. Dinkins and presented to Mr. Brown on Tuesday as he paid a courtesy call on the Mayor before holding a rally outside City Hall. A copy of the analysis was made available to The New York Times in Washington by people close to the Clinton campaign, but from outside the Dinkins administration.
 
Some Broad Implications
 Mr. Dinkins has not endorsed either candidate. But the brief analysis he commissioned could have broad political implications -- particularly if the Mayor endorses the findings by Ms. O'Cleireacain, who was the chief economist for a municipal employees union that has endorsed Mr. Clinton. She held a similar post for the Rev. Jesse Jackson in his campaign for the 1988 Democratic Presidential nomination.
Some of Mr. Clinton's supporters in New York were incensed at Mr. Jackson over his flirtations with Mr. Brown, who has said he might want Mr. Jackson as his running mate. Mr. Jackson has said it would be premature for any candidate to offer or to accept the Vice-Presidential nomination.
Mr. Dinkins reitereated yesterday that he might invite some of his fellow mayors to New York before the primary to press the candidates on urban issues.
Mr. Brown, who said he would get back to Ms. O'Cleireacain but had not as of yesterday evening, wasted no time in resuming his assault on Mr. Clinton, calling the Arkansan a "right-to-work, union-busting, scab-inviting, wage-depressing, environmental disaster" governor.
 
Labor's Pleasant Surprise
 Mr. Brown sought his share of labor endorsements Tuesday at a breakfast in Manhattan led by Barry Feinstein, who heads Local 237 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. Other union leaders, accustomed to bodacious demands to meet the high cost of campaigning in New York, said they were pleasantly surprised to be asked for contributions of only $100 -- Mr. Brown's self-imposed limit.
Mr. Clinton is counting on labor as a central ingredient to delivering his vote in a campaign. He campaigned at the Staten Island ferry terminal in Manhattan early yesterday, and then delivered his salvo against Mr. Brown's tax plan in front of an H & R Block tax preparation office. Mr. Brown unleashed his attack on Mr. Clinton on a train to Philadelphia, where he conferred with labor leaders before flying to Albany to meet with Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.
So far the New York campaign has been devoid of customary ideological and racial rifts, although Mr. Brown and Mr. Clinton appeared ready to defy a local political custom in which the candidates themselves are usually more civil than their supporters and the news media.
New York Democrats, who anointed front-runners in the 1984 and 1988 Presidential primaries, are preparing to play that role again on April 7 as Mr. Clinton mobilizes the organizational support he locked up months ago, and Mr. Brown strives to translate his anti-establishment message into votes.
Despite that message, Mr. Brown has not been shy about courting labor leaders like Mr. Feinstein, Jan Pierce of the Communications Workers and Sonny Hall of the Transport Workers Union, as well as public officials who are still uncommitted.
Yesterday, at his meeting with Governor Cuomo, Mr. Brown declared that the Governor's assessment that the primary race is "wide open" was a boost to a candidate who, until the Michigan primary last week and the Connecticut contest on Tuesday, had been largely dismissed as a spoiler.
"What Connecticut does," said Norman Adler, a political consultant who is helping Mr. Brown's labor supporters in New York, "is just make the Brown people feel better and the Clinton people work a lot harder."
Although Mr. Brown edged Mr. Clinton by one percentage point in the Connecticut primary, winning 63,624 votes, or 37 percent, to 60,894 votes, or 36 percent, for Mr. Clinton, each candidate won 21 of the 53 delegates at stake. Former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts, who withdrew from the campaign last week, gained 11 delegates.
John A. Marino, the Democratic state chairman, discounted the Connecticut outcome. He said Mr. Clinton remains the heavy favorite, with money for television commercials that are expected to begin next week and organizational support from labor and party leaders who can still deliver in some upstate counties and, to a lesser degree, in sections of New York City.
What Connecticut may also have done is lower the level of expectations for Mr. Clinton, who was deemed to be in need of a decisive victory in New York and now may be satisfied merely with winning. Mr. Clinton refocused his New York campaign yesterday to reflect a vital lesson involving the calendar and the alphabet: April comes before November, and Brown before Bush.
"He's the only one to campaign against," Harold M. Ickes, the Clinton campaign manager in New York, said of Mr. Brown.
 
Low Turnout Predicted
 Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist College's Institute for Public Opinion, predicted a relatively low turnout from among the state's 3.7 million enrolled Democrats, 2 million of whom live in New York City. Only enrolled Democrats can vote in the primary.
The turnout may depend in large part on the organizational skills of the Clinton campaign and whether New Yorkers not only view Mr. Brown's message as appealing, but also consider the messenger credible.
Mr. Pierce of the communication workers said Mr. Brown's showing in Connecticut, where he defeated Mr. Clinton by one percentage point, represented more than an anybody-but-Clinton protest vote, but an emerging movement.
"There has been a lack of media attention to the Brown campaign to date," Mr. Pierce said. "When a hard-nosed populist gets into a contest, the media doesn't pay attention until the candidate starts to attract a constituency. Brown is doing what Jackson did in 1988, but this time Brown's bringing in another segment of the left out and left behind that is not dependent on high-tech or paid TV."
That view was echoed by Mr. Feinstein. "We're major underdogs," he acknowledged. But Mr. Brown is "drawing people, and apparently they're listening and that translates into excitement," the teamster leader said, adding: "It doesn't matter what you think about the flat tax or 'Governor Moonbeam' or anything else. It translates into 'let's go send a message.' Now it's a matter of delivering the message."

HEADLINE: Council's Spending Plan Rejects a Commuter Tax

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
The New York City Council released an alternative to Mayor David N. Dinkins's spending plan yesterday that would shift more money to libraries, schools and the police while rejecting the administration's proposals to tax commuters and cars.
The Council's flat rejection of the Mayor's tax package bodes ill for its chances of passing the State Legislature, where it would have faced an uphill battle even with the support of both branches of the city government, aides to state lawmakers said. 
 Mr. Dinkins said, "I cannot see for the life of me why" the Council had jettisoned his tax package. "It surprises me that they have abandoned any effort at the commuter tax in the fashion that they have," he said.
The Council's response to the Mayor's preliminary plan is the first move in the annual political chess game over how to shape the city's $29.4 billion budget. It marks a sharp change from January, when Council leaders warmly received the Mayor's outline on spending, prompting speculation that this year's budget negotiations would be less confrontational than last year's.
 
Pressure From the State
 The plan comes as Mr. Dinkins has been feeling increasing pressure from state fiscal monitors, who want him to squeeze more savings from labor, and unions, who have warned him he will suffer politically if he caters too much to Wall Street.
Under the Council's plan, the city would spend about $124 million more than Mr. Dinkins has budgeted, relying on rosier predictions for the local economy and a new package of taxes that would bring in more revenue than taxes that the Mayor proposed.
Herbert E. Berman, a Brooklyn Democrat and the Finance Committee chairman, said the Council's plan contained "creative ideas that will allow us to lessen the impact of the trauma" of shrinking the government.
But city budget officials expressed doubts about the Council's projections on economic growth and said the Council's tax proposals had no better chance in Albany than the administration's proposals.
"It's easy to be spending revenues when you adjust your revenue estimate up by $200 million," said Norman Steisel, First Deputy Mayor.
The centerpiece of the Council's plan is using $700 million that could be borrowed through a complex bond refinancing involving the state Municipal Assistance Corporation. The Council would spend $500 million for school construction projects and materials for students.
The remaining $200 million from the refinancing would be put in the city's general reserve, freeing money for operating expenses. The Dinkins administration wanted to use the borrowing to avoid layoffs, but dropped the idea after bond raters and state fiscal monitors warned it might jeopardize the city's credit rating.
 
Rohatyn's Comments
 Felix G. Rohatyn, chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, who last week sharply criticized the administration's borrowing plan, said the Council's plan "is certainly a more straightforward use of borrowing" and would probably not raise eyebrows among bond raters. But he said that it would be cheaper for the city to sell general bonds for school construction than to refinance old city bonds held by the corporation.
Besides the $700 million borrowing, the council's plan relies heavily on higher estimates of tax revenues than the city had made, predicting another $141 million in tax revenue in the fiscal year beginning July 1 and $100 million in surplus funds from the Municipal Assistance Corporation to plug shortfalls in the budget.
The Council's plan would restore $47 million the administration cut from the Police Department. The money would go toward hiring more than 1,000 civilians next year to free uniformed officers from desk jobs, and would add 364 new police officers. It also calls for restoring $18 million to the library system to reopen branches five days a week.
On taxes, the Council will push for abandoning the Mayor's $110 million package of a gasoline tax, a one-percent tax on the value of cars and a tax on suburban commuters. In its place, the council has proposed a tax on natural gas, gasoline, diesel, coal and fuel oil, penalizing fuels that produce pollution, raising $82 million in the next fiscal year.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Wisconsin;
Wisconsin 'Snoozer' Stirring to Life

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MILWAUKEE, March 25

 BODY:
"Bill Clinton has been doing fine in Wisconsin," said Robert H. Friebert, one of the Arkansas Governor's main fund-raisers in this state, as the news of former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr.'s upset victory in Connecticut lit up television screens on Tuesday.
"But local campaigns always get swamped by the national results, and what Connecticut did is going to encourage the ABC people here -- the Anybody But Clinton gang. It isn't about Jerry Brown in the Oval Office. It's about stopping Bill Clinton, but it could still be a serious problem." 
 He is not alone in sounding the alarm for the front-runner.
"There's only one avenue left for protest, and that's Jerry," said Bill Dixon, a Madison lawyer with extensive experience in Presidential campaigns. "Bill Clinton had better watch it. The $18-an-hour jobs are gone, the crime rates are going up and everyone hates the establishment."
 
Open Primary
 Wisconsin, whose Presidential primary is one of the oldest in the country, votes on April 7, the same day as New York. Only a third as many delegates are at stake here, 82 against 244, but television ads are much cheaper, and there are other elements that could work in Mr. Brown's favor.
For one thing, the primary is open, which means that Republicans who like the Californian's attacks on the political system can cross over and support him in the Democratic primary. Wisconsin also lacks several of the things that have proved central to Clinton successes elsewhere, like a sizable black or Hispanic population and a strong party structure.
Mr. Brown is "a bit more progressive in a state that invented progressivism, where Bill is sort of middle-of-the- road," said State Representative Stan Gruszynski, who is trying to make up his mind between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Brown. "People here care more about that than they do about giving their vote to the guy who's eventually going to be nominated."
Although conservatism has taken hold in Wisconsin in recent years, the liberal, reformist tradition of Robert LaFollette retains an influence, particularly in Madison, the state capital. When Mr. Brown talks about clean government and open politics, and when he rails against the nefarious influence of big money in Washington, he sounds not unlike LaFollette.
 
Drawing Crowds
 Mr. Brown came into the state last week, in the words of Jonathan Sender, executive director of the Wisconsin Democratic party, "and knocked everyone's socks off." He drew several thousand students at a rally at the University of Wisconsin in Madison and another large crowd, perhaps 1,500, at a labor hall there.
So even before Tuesday's surprise in Connecticut, Mr. Brown had pulled within striking distance of Mr. Clinton, who has not visited the state this year. A Milwaukee Journal poll of 404 likely Democratic primary voters, published last Sunday, showed Mr. Clinton ahead, 49 percent to 35 percent, with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus five percentage points.
"The thing to be careful about," said Craig Gilbert, a political reporter for The Journal, "is Wisconsin's tradition of high turnouts -- 40 per cent of the voting-age population in 1988, highest in the country. That tends to help the candidates with broad appeal and hurt the ones with a hard core of activists. It could end up hurting Brown, or helping him."
Wisconsin's primaries in the past have often generated considerable drama. In 1960, John F. Kennedy held off Hubert H. Humphrey here, even though Mr. Humphrey came from neighboring Minnesota, and established his national credentials. In 1976, Morris K. Udall came within a hair's breadth of beating Jimmy Carter and robbing him of momentum at a crucial moment. Four years ago, the Rev. Jesse Jackson drew big crowds at Serb Hall and elsewhere on Milwaukee's heavily blue-collar, central European South Side, raising vain hopes that he was putting together a biracial working-class coalition.
A few days ago, as Mr. Gilbert said, this year's Wisconsin race had "looked like a snoozer." With the unemployment rate relatively low, at 5.1 per cent, the potential for an outpouring of protest had seemed slight.
But Edward R. Garvey, the former California Governor's state campaign chairman, said Mr. Brown's victory in Connecticut had turned this into an "extremely important" state that Mr. Brown would contest strenuously, with a packed schedule Thursday and Friday in Kenosha, Racine, Milwaukee and Green Bay.
"Connecticut said this race is not over," said Mr. Garvey, a former attorney for the National Football League players who has lost two races for the United States Senate. "Wisconsin can make the point indelibly."
Mr. Clinton is coming here, too. He will speak to the State Assembly on Friday and will be back for a joint appearance with Mr. Brown at a Jefferson-Jackson dinner in Milwaukee three days before the primary.
His campaign chairman, Herbert A. Loftus, a former speaker of the Assembly, promised that "Brown's issues will get the same intense scrutiny as Bill Clinton's have, and the first thing to crash and burn in Wisconsin will be Brown's tax plan." It calls for a flat 13 percent income tax rate, along with a 13 percent value-added tax, a kind of Federal sales tax.
 
Tax Proposals Criticized
 A number of Wisconsin union leaders joined today in backing Mr. Clinton and blasting Mr. Brown's tax proposals. One of them, Candice Owley of the Federation of Nurses and Health Professionals, said the Californian's ideas on taxes were at least as regressive as the Bush Administration's.
But other labor leaders support Mr. Brown, and Joseph Gruber, a vice president of the state A.F.L.-C.I.O., predicted "a rank-and-file mobilization" behind him, at least partly because of Mr. Clinton's record in Arkansas, which has a law barring closed union shops.
As in many states, Mr. Brown has put together little in the way of an organization here. The Madison telephone number for the Brown effort, as listed by the Democratic National Committee, is in fact the home number of Doug Belknap, a psychologist who said he had never been involved in politics. An office was opened last week, he said, but it has no telephone yet.
"I got involved with Jerry Brown because I think this campaign is psychotherapy on a national cultural scale," Mr. Belknap said.
But for all the amateurism of his effort here, Mr. Brown is starting to assemble a coalition of union members who resent Mr. Clinton's support of a free trade zone with Mexico, because they fear it would lead to the export of their jobs; students and other liberals in Madison and elsewhere; environmentalists, who abound in this state of lush lakes and forests, and people who are frustrated with all incumbents and who like Mr. Brown because he is not from Washington and refuses to play politics by the usual rules.

HEADLINE: Prudential Says It Had A Good 1991

BYLINE: By PETER KERR

 BODY:
The Prudential Insurance Company of America, the nation's largest insurer, yesterday disclosed strong growth in 1991, with its capital base rising 21 percent, to $9.7 billion.
At a luncheon in New York, Prudential's chairman and chief executive, Robert C. Winters, pointed to gains last year in the company's group insurance and reinsurance businesses, as well as a turnaround in the security brokerage subsidiary, Prudential Securities. The brokerage operations earned $201 million in 1991 after losing $259 million in 1990, Prudential said. 
 The company also announced that for the first time last year its expanding managed-care operations showed a profit.
 
Reassuring Public
 As a mutual company, the Newark-based Prudential is owned by its policyholders and is not required to report per-share profits and losses. The announcement of its gains last year came as good news for a company whose rating was downgraded by Moody's Investors Service in January on concerns over its real estate and bond holdings. Like the rest of the industry, Prudential is striving to reassure a public that was jolted by several major life insurance company failures last year.
"The 21 percent increase is an impressive accomplishment considering the weak economy and the tough challenges for financial services," Mr. Winters said. "It clearly demonstrates that diversification is an all-weather strategy."
Frederick S. Townsend of the Townsend & Schupp Company, an insurance research company in Hartford, concurred. "It was an incredibly strong year for the Prudential," he said.
But Prudential, with more than $189 billion in assets and more than 50 million clients around the world, will still have to contend with worrisome real estate investments, which total 27 percent of its portfolio, analysts said. And as a result of lower returns on investments backing life insurance contracts, dividends paid to policyholders fell last year by 2 percent.
The company's statutory surplus, which is the amount of capital set aside to cover excessive policyholder withdrawals and is considered a gauge of profits, increased to $6.53 billion in 1991 from $5.39 billion in 1990. Revenues rose to $42.8 billion, from $40.9 billion the year before, and consolidated assets increased to $189 billion from $169 billion.
Prudential's results were bolstered by the restructuring of the Prudential Securities subsidiary and the rally in the stock and bond markets. At Prudential Securities, revenues leaped 20 percent, to $2.8 billion. They came as a result of an 18 percent rise in retail commissions, the company said, and a 44 percent increase in capital market revenues.
The company's group operations saw a 3 percent increase in new business premiums and fees, to $1.9 billion in 1991. New sales of managed- care plans to control health-care costs rose by 18 percent. The new customers joined a network of managed-care programs that now includes nearly 700 hospitals, 50,000 physicians and 2.5 million members.
"Managed medical-care programs, which we believe offer the best hope for curbing the rise in health-care costs, moved into the black for us in 1991," Mr. Winters said.
Prudential's revenues from real estate services increased 36 percent last year, with the company's mortgage unit originating $10.8 billion of new mortgages last year, up from 84 percent in 1990.
In January, Moody's downgraded Prudential's rating on financial strength and debt securities to Aa1 from its top Aaa rating. The rating change came as a result of questions about the future of Prudential's commercial real estate investments and the company's far smaller investments in junk bonds.

HEADLINE: Resales of Homes Soar 9.3% In Rush to Beat Rate Rise

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 25

 BODY:
Buyers rushing to take advantage of low mortgage rates in February pushed sales of existing homes to the highest level in three years, a real estate trade group said today.
Sales of previously owned homes jumped 9.3 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.52 million in February, up from 3.22 million a month earlier, according to the National Association of Realtors. Sales were 16.1 percent over February 1991 levels, the realtors said. 
 While the realtors offered their encouraging data, the Government issued a mixed report on durable goods orders, items like appliances and machinery expected to last three years or more. While total orders fell one-tenth of 1 percent in February, orders excluding military purchases rose 1.3 percent. [Page D4.]
All regions of the country posted gains. Even the Northeast, where the recession has inflicted much damage, chalked up a 2.1 percent gain.
Nationally, the February sales rate was the highest since it reached 3.62 million in January 1989, and the rise was the steepest since a 12.2 percent gain in January 1983.
"People who had been watching to see how low rates would go came off the fence as soon as rates started inching up," said Dorcas T. Helfant, the president of the realtors group. "The risk of future increases convinced them it was time to make their move."
According to surveys by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, 30-year fixed-rate mortgages rose to 8.83 percent at the end of the month from 8.67 percent at the beginning of February and a low of 8.23 percent in January. Since then, rates have risen to more than 9 percent.
Ms. Helfant said there had been some unfounded concern that prospective buyers would postpone purchases until they determined whether Congress would enact President Bush's proposed tax credit for first-time home buyers.
"Buyers seemed much more interested in getting a good mortgage rate than waiting for a tax credit to be enacted," she said.
The realtors' economist, John A. Tuccillo, said unusually mild weather also contributed to the February surge.
The Commerce Department reported earlier that sales of new homes had soared 12.9 percent in January, the biggest gain in a year. Some analysts suggested that sales continued to climb in February as the housing industry continued to lead the economic recovery.
The realtors also said that although first-time buyers had dominated existing sales activity in recent months, trade-up buyers had begun to join them last month.
The demand for homes in the higher price ranges lifted the median price of existing homes 9.3 percent above the level a year earlier to $103,800. The median means half of the homes cost more and half cost less.
 
Big Rise in the West
 Regionally, the West posted the biggest sales gain, up 17.9 percent, to a 790,000 rate. The median price there was $150,400.
Sales in the Northeast increased 2.1 percent, to 490,000. The median price was $143,100. Sales were up 8 percent from a year earlier.
Sales in the South rose 8.8 percent, to 1.24 million units, and the median price was $92,000.
In the Midwest, sales advanced 8.7 percent, to a rate of one million, and the median price was $82,500.

HEADLINE: BRITAIN TELLS ABC TO GIVE UP TAPES

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, March 25

 BODY:
ABC News and its chief European correspondent, Pierre Salinger, were ordered today by the British High Court to give the police tapes and notes of interviews with two Libyans charged in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988.
Mr. Salinger had interviewed the two men, Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, last November, and on Nov. 27, the ABC News program "World News Tonight" program broadcast brief excerpts from the interviews. Both denied that they had had anything to do with the bombing, as charged in indictments in Scotland and the United States. 
 British anti-terrorist police officers investigating the bombing, which killed all 259 passengers and crew members and 11 people on the ground, demanded the tapes and notes of the complete interviews on March 6.
 
No Disclosure of Sources
 Today, ABC News said it would comply because the demand did not require the disclosure of confidential sources.
Libya, which has been threatened by Britain and the United States with economic and possibly military sanctions if it does not allow the extradition of the accused men for trial either in Scotland or the United States, has said it will turn them over to the Arab League.
In legal papers filed with the court here, ABC News said it had resisted the order to turn over the tapes on the ground that the police had not explained the reasons for seeking them. The court order today said that the police had made the demand after seeing the excerpts in ABC's London offices in December, when it said Mr. Salinger refused to show them the rest.
The court said the police had adequate reasons for making the demand, adding, "The overall objective should be to provide the recipient with as much information, preferably in writing, as early as possible provided this is consistent with the security of the operation."

HEADLINE: Stocks Mixed; Trading Error Hurts Dow

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stocks closed mixed in heavy trading yesterday, with blue chips taking a slide at the end of the session. Traders said the dip was a result of an error by Salomon Brothers in executing an extremely large customer order. Until then, the session had been uneventful.
The Dow Jones industrial average, which was at about 3,277 just before 4 P.M., suddenly retreated sharply to finish at 3,259.39, down 1.57 points for the day. 
 After the market closed, Salomon issued a statement saying "that it made an error today in executing a customer's program order."
"Salomon expects to correct the error through market transactions over the next few days," the statement said. "The customer will be unaffected. The amount of market exposure to Salomon Brothers is not material."
Some traders estimated the value of the erroneous transaction at about $500 million. A market watcher, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the way it was handled showed bad form. "It just passed the trading desk and went straight electronic," he said.
A spokesman for the New York Stock Exchange said last night that the exchange was reviewing the transaction, in cooperation with Salomon Brothers.
Analysts said the market yesterday felt the pinch of two conflicting economic reports for February. The Government reported that durable-goods orders were weaker than expected in February, fueling some speculation that an economic recovery would be limp. But another report said sales of existing homes posted a stronger-than-expected increase in February. The mixed signals kept the stock market from trading outside its narrow range.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 192.6 million shares, up from 192.3 million on Tuesday, as losing issues held the advantage over gainers by 883 to 767.
 
Gains in Other Indexes
 The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks was off 1.36 points, to 407.52, while the American Stock Exchange index gained 0.72 point, to 400.29. Trading on the over-the-counter market pushed the Nasdaq composite up 0.80 point, to 619.48, as the Russell 2,000 closed at 206.92, down one-hundredth of a point.
Paul J. Kronlokken, a technical analyst for Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood, Minneapolis, said that a firm bond market provided early support for stocks, but that bonds sagged in the afternoon on fears that yesterday's Treasury auction of five-year notes might not go well. The auction did well, however, and bonds quickly rebounded.
"The unsettling of bond prices helped to set up the stock market and leave it vulnerable to volatility at the close," Mr. Kronlokken said.
Some analysts noted that the rebound in home sales was connected to low interest rates in February and should not last, since mortgage rates have recently begun to edge up.
In trading yesterday, Regional Bancorp fell 5/8, to 18 3/4. Gary Gordon, an analyst at Paine Webber, downgraded the stock to "neutral" from "attractive," in light of the stock's 50 percent gain in the last few months.
Quaker Oats dropped 2 3/4, to 54 1/2. David Goldman, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Company, lowered his rating on Quaker stock to a "short-term sell" from "market performer" and trimmed his earnings estimate. He noted that the company was posting double-digit declines in sales of ready-to-eat cereals.
Morton International, a specialty chemical and equipment maker, lost 2, to 61 3/8. Based on the price of the stock, Dean Witter Reynolds cut Morton's rating to a "swap" from "buy-hold," traders said.
Oracle Systems, a computer software company, fell 2 1/4, to 15, after it posted third-quarter earnings that were below Wall Street expectations. Oracle's profits rose to 12 cents a share, from 9 cents a share a year earlier. Analysts had been expecting about 21 cents a share.

HEADLINE: From Princeton to Port Authority Planning;
Public Affairs Specialist Will Help Plot Future for Region's 'Third Government'

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PRINCETON, N.J., March 20

 BODY:
Richard W. Roper is a soft-spoken but persistent man who says he has spent much of his life chipping away at the margins of seemingly insoluble problems. Those who have watched his whittling say he has been influential in shaping New Jersey's responses to important public issues for a decade.
The Council on New Jersey Affairs, which Mr. Roper has led as executive director, has issued 17 working papers over the last eight years, dealing with transportation, land use, farmland preservation, the outlook for the cities, Medicaid, state and local finance and school financing, among other topics. 
 A report in 1984 that highlighted the disparity in computer use between suburban and urban schools led to a special state appropriation to place more computers in urban schools.
On April 1, Mr. Roper will leave his office on the fourth floor of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University for the Manhattan headquarters of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, where he is expected to help plot the future of an agency known as the region's "third government."
 
Praised for His Vision
 "I had been trying for over a year to get him to join the Port Authority in one capacity or another, but he was reluctant to move," said Richard C. Leone, the Port Authority chairman. "He had become an institution at Princeton University and, in a major way, is the university's link to the rest of New Jersey.
"For the last 10 years he has put together an unexcelled group of individuals to look deeply at New Jersey's problems and its public policy, and it is precisely that vision we want to use to help the authority decide where we should go."
The challenge that finally lured Mr. Roper to the Port Authority was an appointment as director of the Office of Business Development and Strategic Planning, which became vacant in January when Emily Lloyd left that post to become New York City's Commissioner of Sanitation.
Although Mr. Roper's decision to leave Princeton after 12 years was not expected, neither was it a surprise, according to Donald E. Stokes, the dean of the Woodrow Wilson School. "The astonishing thing is that we were able to hold onto him for so long," Dean Stokes said.
Mr. Roper was not thinking of building bridges but of finishing his college education when he left his home in Brunswick, Ga., to live with an aunt in Newark in 1965. Mr. Roper, the oldest of five children of Henry and Dorothye Roper, had completed two years at West Virginia State College when he decided to drop out and get a job to pay the rest of his way through school.
"I wanted the family support to go to a younger brother who was starting college," he said.
 
Fate from a Bus Window
 He got a job on his first day in Newark, as a salesman in a Sears store, and from a bus noticed four buildings under construction at the Newark campus of Rutgers University. He enrolled and soon became a campus leader, helping found the Organization of Black Students.
Mr. Roper, who had come to the attention of Ralph Dungan, then New Jersey's Chancellor of Higher Education, was asked after graduation in 1968 to help colleges prepare to meet the needs of minority students. The state had just established an Educational Opportunity Fund, partially in response to the riots of 1967, and wanted to increase black enrollment.
"Black students made up only 3 percent of the population in New Jersey's institutions of higher education at that time," Mr. Roper said. "And we had a lot of economically disadvantaged but educationally motivated students who needed help."
In 1990, minority students made up more than 22 percent of the undergraduate population in New Jersey colleges and universities, according to the Higher Education Department.
 
From Trenton to Washington
 After obtaining a master's degree in public affairs at the Woodrow Wilson School, Mr. Roper joined the Office of Newark Studies, which he said was "a kind of think tank administered by Rutgers that didn't have to deal with the bureaucracy." It dealt instead with finding ways to improve urban education and health care.
Mr. Roper next served as a Trenton lobbyist for Mayor Kenneth A. Gibson of Newark. "One thing we were able to do was get the state to pay Newark $8 million in lieu of tax payments for all of the city property taken over for state offices and schools," he said.
His next decision was to leave Newark in 1978 for a job in Washington. In the two years he spent as special assistant to Juanita M. Kreps, the Secretary of Commerce, and as director of the Commerce Department's Office of State and Local Government Assistance, Mr. Roper said he learned how things get done at the national level.
"Decisions are often made in isolation, and there is an extreme tendency to believe that Washington knows best," he said. Mr. Roper said he fought the idea that a solution to a problem in St. Louis would work in rural New Mexico, trying to tailor available resources to the needs of cities his office was trying to help.
His next step was a return to the Woodrow Wilson School in 1980 as director of the Program for New Jersey Affairs, which helps Princeton students learn how governments devise and carry out public policy.
In 1981, a major offshoot of the program, the Council on New Jersey Affairs, was created. It reached beyond the university and brought together leaders in government, business and education to search for solutions to state problems. Former Gov. Brendan T. Byrne, who served four years as chairman of the council and is still a member, said Mr. Roper "was the contact man and was in the middle of everything."
As Mr. Roper prepares to join the authority, where he will be paid $102,000 a year, he said that he expected the agency's prime transportation and economic-development roles to grow and that he planned to work on programs to help municipalities find solutions to their solid-waste disposal and energy-conservation problems.
Mr. Leone said reaching outside the authority to fill a vacancy was unusual. "We have a lot of talented people, and usually promote from within, and that's how it should be," he said. But he said Mr. Roper "will bring a fresh perspective, and in him we'll have someone who really knows the New Jersey side."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Economic Issues;
House Sustains Bush's Veto of Tax Cut for Middle-Income Families

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 25

 BODY:
The House today sustained President Bush's veto of a Democratic-sponsored middle-income tax cut financed by higher taxes on the well-to-do.
Democratic leaders could not muster even a majority toward an override. The vote was 215 to 211 against overturning the veto, far short of the two-thirds needed to defeat the veto. The compromise bill was passed on Friday, 211 to 189. 
 Calling the veto "a declaration of political war against the Congress," Representative Dan Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat who was a chief author of the bill, said "the real issue is tax fairness" for the middle class.
The House Republican leader, Robert H. Michel of Illinois, criticized Democrats for making "a silly argument that a few-hundred-dollar tax cut is worth the price of a giant tax increase."
The tax cut, chiefly a permanent $300-per-child credit for middle-income families, would have gone to about 78 million families. The tax increase, including a maximum tax rate of 36 percent and a surtax on millionaires, would have affected about a million couples and individuals.
Mr. Bush vetoed the bill on Friday because of the tax increases, even though it contained a version of six of seven proposals he had advanced for stimulating the economy.
The bill would have reduced capital-gains taxes, but chiefly for middle-income families; rewarded businesses for buying equipment this year; granted special tax relief for real estate developers; made tax-deductible Individual Retirement Accounts available to virtually all wage earners, regardless of income, and restored a deduction for interest on student loans.
The vetoed bill would have reduced taxes by about $77.5 billion in 1992 through 1996 and increased other taxes by about the same amount.

HEADLINE: Eligibility for College Loan Program Is Expanded

BYLINE: By CHARLES STRUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEWARK, March 25

 BODY:
A seven-month-old college loan program intended for the financially strapped middle class in New Jersey was enlarged today and extended to families with annual incomes as high as $95,000.
The new loans will be backed with $50 million in bonds to be sold by the state's Higher Education Assistance Authority, which has lent $16 million to 3,700 families since the program began last September. The state expects the new round of loans to help as many as 10,000 families. 
 In announcing the expansion at the Rutgers University campus here, Gov. Jim Florio said the intention was to help the middle class, particularly families sending more than one child to college. The Governor said that more than half the loan recipients attend college in New Jersey and more than 85 percent are financing their undergraduate educations.
 
Raising the Limit
 The program, called New Jersey College Loans to Assist State Students, or Njclass, will raise income eligibility by $10,000, from $85,000 to $95,000. It will also increase the annual borrowing limit from $5,000 to $7,000 and the cumulative limit from $25,000 to $35,000. The interest rate is fixed, currently at 8.95 percent. A rate for the new loans will be fixed when the bonds are sold.
 
Decrease in Federal Aid
 The Governor, who proposed the loan program in his 1991 State of the State Message, said the loss of Federal tuition assistance in the last decade had seriously hurt middle-income families. The expansion proposal came as a result of recommendations from applicants, loan recipients and financial aid advisers at various schools, he said.
In 1981, he said, aid from the Federal Government made up 29 percent of the assistance received by New Jersey college students. The figure today, he said, is 9 percent. Recipients of guaranteed loans dropped from 20,000 in 1986 to fewer than 10,000 within two years. The decrease in both categories results from changing Federal eligibility standards.
The Federal Government has its own loan program, but with a variable interest rate and a narrower borrowing range. Other states also offer loans backed by bonds, some with income-eligibility restrictions and some without, although the amount of the loans and interest rates vary. New York is about to embark on a pilot program through the State Dormitory Authority, which would float bonds that would permit selected colleges to offer loans. The colleges would be responsible for administering the program, and they would also set the amounts to be borrowed. Connecticut has no state program.

HEADLINE: Weprin Calls for Tax Rise For Affluent New Yorkers

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 25

 BODY:
The Speaker of the Democratic-led Assembly, looking to raise the cash he said was needed to produce a budget deal, called today for higher taxes on New Yorkers earning more than $250,000.
The proposal by the Speaker, Saul Weprin, received a distinctly hostile reception from Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and the Republican-led Senate. It also quickly set up Albany's version of a tax fight that in some ways mirrors the debate in Washington, where Democrats in Congress have pressed for higher taxes on more affluent taxpayers to pay for a tax cut for the middle class. 
 Although Mr. Weprin's proposal would not cut anyone's taxes, the $200 million he said it would raise would be used to offset proposed cuts in several programs that serve the poor and the middle class, including Medicaid.
 
Plan Faces Opposition
 Under the Speaker's plan, the maximum income tax rate of 7.875 percent would be raised an additional percentage point, to 8.875 percent, for all income exceeding $250,000. Thus, a person making $400,000 would pay an additional $1,500 -- 1 percent of the $150,000 above the threshold -- in state taxes.
The proposal's chances did not appear particularly promising today. Governor Cuomo reiterated his opposition to new taxes this year and the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, declared Mr. Weprin's measure "off the table." Still, if Albany history is any guide, the idea could well come up for discussion again.
Last spring, after months of assurances that they would brook no new taxes, Mr. Cuomo and the Republicans reversed course and agreed at the last minute to an Assembly-backed plan for a temporary surcharge on incomes above $100,000.
Mr. Weprin himself had repeatedly said this year that he did not want to see any new taxes in the budget. But justifying his apparent switch in an interview today, he said: "I didn't make any pledge."
"This is a different type of tax," he added. "It's one thing to tax middle-income people or low income people when they're hurting in a time of economic distress, but the person making over $250,000 a year isn't hurting. And that person, I thought, could be in a different category and I don't consider it a violation of anything."
 
$500 Million Gapxxx
 The squabble over taxes -- as well as a less detailed recommendation from Mr. Marino to raise revenue through a new amnesty program for people or businesses who confess to having cheated on their taxes -- came as state leaders were struggling to bridge an imbalance of at least $500 million between spending and revenues in the roughly $30 billion budget due April 1.
Those talks continued to focus on Medicaid and school aid, but also included discussion of how to pay for millions of dollars in so-called member items, or special grants for everything from libraries to Little League uniforms that lawmakers like to dole out to constituents.
Mr. Cuomo, who has frequently railed against the member items as legislative pork, offered a somewhat gentler simile tonight when describing the legislators' negotiations over the items. He said they were "like the cherry laid gently on top of the exquisitely carved whipped cream" of the budget that he hoped they were about to produce.
Still, while all sides agreed that a budget deal might actually be reached in time for the April 1 deadline -- which the Governor and lawmakers have missed seven years in a row -- there were dozens of questions still to be settled. And Mr. Weprin's proposal seemed to throw a new wrinkle in negotiations.
 
Assuaging Democrats
 Even Mr. Weprin was talking about his idea in the past tense today after the Governor and Mr. Marino looked askance at it, but he made it clear that he remained an advocate. "He still thinks it makes sense," said his spokesman, Steven Greenberg. "He still thinks it's the right way to proceed."
Even if the idea does not come to pass, Mr. Weprin clearly made a move intended to assuage many fellow Democrats who have been pushing for tax increases to offset some of the spending cuts proposed to keep the budget in balance.
But it was a far cry from the tax increases of $1 billion or more that those Democrats, many of whom represent impoverished neighborhoods in New York City and other urban areas, have been calling for.

HEADLINE: GlenFed Chief Resigns; Loss Is Expected

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
GlenFed Inc., the parent of the nation's fourth-largest savings and loan, said yesterday that its chairman and chief executive, Norman M. Coulson, had resigned.
The Glendale, Calif., company, which has been hurt by its troubled real estate investments, also said it expected to post a $110 million loss for its third fiscal quarter, ending this month. GlenFed said the loss would cause it to fall below Government capital requirements. 
 Steven J. Trafton, vice chairman of GlenFed, was given the additional position of chief executive yesterday. Mr. Trafton, 45 years old, had already been directing the troubled company's turnaround efforts.
 
214 Branches in 3 States
 E. Gareth Plank, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds in San Francisco, said Mr. Trafton told analysts that Mr. Coulson's resignation had not been prompted by a request from regulators.
GlenFed is the parent of the Glendale Federal Bank, which has 214 branches in California, Washington and Florida.
Like other savings and loan companies, GlenFed encountered difficulties in the 1980's when it expanded into the real estate development business. The company has sold assets, slashed its work force and has been working to build its reserves. But the company said yesterday that additional action was needed.
For the quarter ending Tuesday, the company said it would set aside $145 million to cover bad loans. GlenFed also said it would write down the value of its real estate investments by $65 million. In taking the steps yesterday, the company blamed the "prolonged recession and the continued deterioration in the real estate markets, which have seriously affected the value of the company's real estate investments."
The increased loan-loss provision and the markdown of real estate holdings will result in a loss of $110 million for GlenFed's third fiscal quarter. For the corresponding quarter last year, GlenFed earned $1 million, or 3 cents a share. For the first six months of its fiscal year, GlenFed earned $51.6 million, or $1.51 a share.
The loss means that GlenFed will fall below Government minimum capital requirements when the quarter ends Tuesday. GlenFed said it was developing a capital restoration plan to submit to the Office of Thrift Supervision.
The company has been actively trying to raise additional capital to bolster its reserves. Options include issuing stock or finding an outside investor, possibilities made more difficult by the failure of the institution to meet capital requirements and its weak financial condition.
"There is a question about the appetite of investors to send money their way," said Mr. Plank of Dean Witter.
He said Mr. Trafton was more aggressive than Mr. Coulson in seeking outside investors and in building up the bank's reserves to cover bad loans. "Clearly Steve won out," Mr. Plank said.
Phone calls to Mr. Trafton and Mr. Coulson were not returned.
The announcement came after the stock market closed. GlenFed stock closed at $5.375, down 37.5 cents, yesterday in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Mr. Coulson, 59, had been with GlenFed for more than 30 years. Mr. Trafton joined GlenFed in 1990 and was named president and chief operating officer in October 1991.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Canada Lifts Oil Industry Investing Bar

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO, March 25

 BODY:
Canada's Energy Minister today announced rule changes that would make it easier for foreign investors to buy into Canada's oil and gas industry -- a move that may be linked to the troubles of Olympia & York, the Toronto-based real estate giant.
Existing oil regulations, which hark back to nationalistic economic policies of the 1970's and early 1980's, prohibit foreigners from acquiring healthy oil and gas companies with assets of $5 million or more. 
 Because few companies are that small, the restrictions have effectively kept foreign money out of the industry.
 
New Levels Set
 The Energy Minister, Jake Epp, said the Government was abolishing the outright prohibition and instead was setting thresholds at which foreign investment in oil would be reviewed. This is similar to the procedure that applies in other industrial sectors.
For investors from the United States, the level of asset value at which such examinations will be conducted is $150 million, the level that already applies to other industrial sectors under the three-year-old Canada-United States free trade agreement. Other foreign investors will be subject to review when the assets they seek are worth more than $5 million.
The liberalization, which has been sought for years by officials in the Alberta oil industry, would permit a company like Gulf Canada Ltd. to be bought by foreigners for the first time.
The Reichmann brothers, the owners of Olympia & York, the world's biggest real estate company, paid more than $3 billion for a 74 percent stake in Gulf in a diversification move in 1985.
 
Could Relieve Squeeze
 If Olympia & York were able to sell Gulf today, the proceeds might go far toward relieving the cash squeeze in which the brothers -- Albert, Paul and Ralph -- have found themselves as a result of the recession in commercial real estate in London, New York and Toronto, the sites of most of their holdings.
Mr. Epp did not tie the policy change directly to the problems of Olympia & York. He made the announcement in a speech to a group of oil executives in Calgary, who enthusiastically welcomed the change.
He noted that other countries, including various republics of the former Soviet Union, Argentina and Venezuela had been liberalizing their investment policies to attract more foreign investment.
He also pointed out that by allowing foreign investors to become potential buyers of Canadian assets, "we will be directly increasing the prices which Canadian producers can obtain for their assets." This would improve the "fairness of our policies towards Canadian producers," he said, and also help in financing future oil and gas investments.
Because of the size of Olympia & York's operations and the debt, estimated at $20 billion, it owes largely to Canadian and American banks, the Government has taken an especially close interest in the affair.
John H. McDermid, Minister of State for Finance, told the House of Commons Tuesday that Ottawa was working with national and international financial institutions "in assuring that there will be little disruption in the financial market."

HEADLINE: Durable Goods Off 0.1%; Military Items Plummet

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 25

 BODY:
Plunging demand for military equipment reduced factory orders for durable goods by one-tenth of 1 percent in February, the Government reported today.
But analysts noted that without the 19.4 percent drop in the military category, durable goods orders rose 1.3 percent. 
 Gordon Richards, an economist with the National Association of Manufacturers, said the report "is consistent with the slow overall course of economic activity."
David Jones, an economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, a New York securities dealer, said the report "signals a weak and uneven recovery."
He added, "The real question is is it sustainable?"
Asked on Tuesday whether the economy has enough momentum to guarantee a recovery, the Presidential news secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, replied: "There are encouraging signs of recovery. But the economic statistics are still embryonic. We'll just have to wait and see."
 
3% Growth Projected
 Most analysts project just 3 percent economic growth this year, compared with an average of 6 percent during the first year of recovery from other recessions after World War II.
Over all, orders for durable goods -- costly items like cars and communications equipment that are expected to last more than three years -- fell to a seasonally adjusted $120.5 billion, according to the Commerce Department report.
After declining 5 percent in December, orders rose 2.4 percent in January, to $120.6 billion. The January advance first was estimated to be 2.2 percent.
Orders, a gauge of future manufacturing activity, had peaked at $134.4 billion in December 1988.
The Commerce Department report showed that military orders had fallen 20 percent in January after soaring 89.4 percent a month earlier, illustrating their volatility.
But analysts said the overall trend would be down as the Government cuts back expenditures with the end of the cold war.
"Any region of the country" that had military-type activity, said Evelina M. Tainer of Prime Economic Consulting, a Chicago forecasting service, "will continue to be hurt by cutbacks."
Unfilled orders fell 1 percent, the sixth consecutive decline. These orders, now at their lowest level since September 1989, measure whether plants and manpower are sufficient to keep up with demand.
"It suggests there will be no great urgency in hiring new workers," Mr. Jones, of Aubrey Lanston, said. "It hints that the employment situation will remain soft."
Shipments of durable goods, a measure of current production, were up 2.9 percent, the 10th increase in 11 months.
Transportation orders rose 1 percent after advancing 1.9 percent in January. Demand for automobiles and railroad equipment more than offset decreases in aircraft, shipbuilding and tank orders. Excluding this category, orders fell four-tenths of 1 percent.
The only other major category posting a gain was primary metals, up 7.9 percent after rising 2.2 percent month earlier.

HEADLINE: Asking I.R.S. What's Polish for 1040

BYLINE: By STEPHEN ENGELBERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MAROZ, Poland

 BODY:
For the first time, Poland is trying to impose a Western-style personal income tax system on a country where evasion of the Communist-era tax man amounted to a patriotic duty -- and it is turning to the Internal Revenue Service in Washington for help.
Although it is tax time in the United States, two veteran American tax experts took time out earlier this month to provide a round of basic training to 25 of their newly anointed counterparts in Poland. 
 Roman Zorn's brow furrowed in concentration as one of the American instructors outlined the twisted finances of a typical tax cheat at a session at this lakeside resort. Then Mr. Zorn, one of the 1,520 inspectors who make up the newly formed fiscal police, sorted through the maze of numbers and estimated the amount of concealed income.
The arrival of the American tax agents in this village 120 miles north of Warsaw is another sign of the times in Eastern Europe. Not so long ago, Poland and its neighbors turned to their comrades from Moscow for expert advice. These days, they are looking westward instead.
All of the former Communist countries in Eastern Europe face similar problems as they try to collect taxes without the tools of a police state. In February, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development announced plans to train tax inspectors from Eastern Europe at centers in Budapest, Copenhagen and Vienna. The organization of 24 industrialized nations also said it would help the countries set up "national tax schools."
In many ways, paying taxes runs against the grain in Poland. Under the previous system, individuals' taxes were paid by the factories where they worked. Officially, people were also required to report any outside income, like pay from second jobs. In practice, a huge underground economy flourished, and it has grown when the limits on private enterprise were lifted with the fall of Communism.
Under the new system, there is some withholding by corporate employers. Self-employed people are required to report monthly to an office where they wait up to four or five hours to pay taxes each month. A computer system is expected to be operational later this year.
Collection of taxes is crucial to Poland's wobbly transition from central planning to capitalism. Until 1991, state budget revenues came mostly from Government-run companies. They stopped paying into the treasury when their profits dried up, leaving a yawning budget gap. This year, the hope is to make up the difference with tax revenue from private companies -- which are required to pay a levy on gross revenue -- and from individuals.
This year, Poland hopes to collect $10 billion in personal income taxes, about one-third of projected total state revenue of $30 billion. Reviewing the considerable obstacles of actually getting hold of this money, a recent confidential report by the World Bank observed with a touch of understatement, "The task facing Poland remains arduous."
 
Privacy of Bank Records
 At the training course, Polish tax inspectors marveled at the possibilities for obtaining data in an information-rich environment like America. In Poland, they said, permission to rummage through a taxpayer's personal bank accounts is rarely granted by the Finance Ministry, and the exercise is typically useless anyway, because most business is conducted in cash.
"You have an easier time of it," said Mr. Zorn, who works in a tax office in the northern port city of Gdansk. "In the West, it seems like you can trace nearly everything through the banks. For us, it's all cash, and there is usually no proof of what has happened."
In Poland, the inspectors face daunting odds. The private sector has well-honed and inventive techniques for hiding profits from prying eyes. Investigators have no computers yet, and in Warsaw, the country's financial center, a staff of 74 confronts more than a million business and individual taxpayers.
A second I.R.S. course is planned for tax inspectors, and the agency has also provided some advice on computer programming.
In the training course, the textbook emphasizes treating taxpayers with courtesy and fairness, but it also mentions the use of surveillance and informants to catch wily white-collar crooks.
That is a touchy subject in Poland, where people are aggressively enjoying their freedom from the former totalitarian system.
 
Furor Over Informer Bounty
 A senior tax official created a furor earlier this year when he was quoted by the leading Warsaw newspaper, Gazeta Wyborcza, as saying informers would be rewarded with chocolates or flowers for turning in their neighbors and with cash for information about large companies. The official insisted his remarks were "metaphorical," although tax officials say that since the beginning of this year, several people a day have phoned the Finance Ministry with leads.
Zygmunt Sachnowski, national director of the fiscal police, contends that the recently passed law setting up the personal income tax leans too far in the direction of protecting citizens' rights. The statute, for example, specifically bars inspectors from conducting sting operations, in which they would pose, for example, as businessmen looking for tax shelters.
"I think this is very beautiful, very noble," Mr. Sachnowski said. "But this kind of legislation is not effective for the times we have now. In Poland, this is a primitive capitalism, a predatory capitalism. We should be equipped with teeth and claws."
George F. Blair, the Internal Revenue agent from Washington who taught the class here with John R. Krawczyk, a special agent from Louisville, Ky., said his Polish counterparts faced an uphill task.
"These are very sincere people, and they want to do an absolutely good job," Mr. Blair said. "I think they will be a bit hampered by the tax laws here. There's room for a lot of loopholes. In the U.S. all income is taxable unless specifically excluded. Here the tax system points to specific items as included."
 
U.S. Officers Have More Power
 Mr. Blair also noted that in the United States, the authorities had the power to pursue an individual for failing to pay taxes on illegal income. Such powers have not yet been granted to Polish revenue officers.
At the higher end of the economic system, Poland has been victimized by dozens of sophisticated wheeler-dealers who understand far better than the tax collectors the potential for sharp dealing in a newly capitalist country. The result has been a succession of "affairs" in which the state treasury and tax authorities have been defrauded of millions, even hundreds of millions of dollars.
The budget deficit is projected to be $4.5 billion for this year, and Poland is preparing sharp cuts in the health service, pensions and other public services to stem the flow of red ink. Polish officials say that every zloty lost in taxes will have to be made up through program cuts.
Some help will arrive when Poland introduces a value-added tax on businesses. But that step has been delayed several times, and now is not expected to begin until 1993.
Meanwhile, the new tax program is going ahead, although it has not been well publicized.
"There is still a big unknown whether we will get this money or not," acknowledged Karol Lutkowski, the economist who resigned his post as Finance Minister earlier this year.

Luke Family's Reign Is Extended at Westvaco

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
The Luke family has run the Westvaco Corporation since the large paper and specialty chemicals company was founded in 1888. And yesterday the New York-based company continued that tradition by announcing that it had named John A. Luke Jr., executive vice president, to be the company's president and chief executive.
Mr. Luke, the great-great-grandson of the company's founder, will assume his duties Nov. 1. The 43-year-old Mr. Luke will replace his father, John A. Luke, who turned 65 last November. The board had asked the elder Mr. Luke to stay through this year; his brother, David L. Luke 3d, will remain as chairman. 
 Westvaco has benefited during the recession from its strategy of forgoing the commodity grades of paper in favor of higher-quality products that typically command higher prices. In recent years, for example, the company has concentrated more and more on bleached board, which is used in frozen food packaging and cigarette cartons, as opposed to linerboard, the paper that goes into shipping boxes. As a result, even though Westvaco's earnings fell about 27 percent last year, the downturn was roughly half the average decline for paper companies in 1991.
The younger Mr. Luke said he would continue to focus on the quality-products strategy, adding that he would continue to press for new product development as well as increasing sales overseas.
"We have worked hard and will continue to work hard to take our existing product lines and facilities and look for ways, through our research, to improve upon those products," Mr. Luke said in a telephone interview yesterday.
He added that he would also like to see growth in the company's specialty chemicals business, now about 10 percent of Westvaco's sales. "That growth would be through continued product development and investing in the facilities," he said.
John Luke Jr. joined Westvaco as an auditor in 1979. He graduated from Lawrence University in 1971 and holds an M.B.A. from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. By 1982, he was an assistant treasurer and became treasurer the following year. In 1989, he assumed responsibility for the international sales department of the company and its subsidiary in Brazil. He became executive vice president in 1990. From 1971 through 1974 he was an Air Force officer in Southeast Asia. He is married and has two children.

HEADLINE: Mongolia Adopts a 3-Ring Promotional Strategy

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
And now, ladies and gentlemen and children of all ages, the newest -- and perhaps the most unusual -- economic strategy yet by a former Communist country: Mongolia has run away with the circus.
When the 122d edition of the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus opens today in Madison Square Garden, its centerpiece will be a horde of 42 dancers, musicians, animal riders and acrobats from Mongolia. Never an enterprise to underplay its stars, the circus has had advance posters in a dozen cities proclaiming, "The Mongolians Are Coming!" 
 The performers make up the first major national troupe the Mongolian Government has ever permitted to tour America. A major reason for the change, Mongolian officials say, is that their nation is greatly in need of higher economic and cultural visibility to compete in a world paying increasing attention to breakaway Soviet republics and Eastern European countries.
 
A Marketing Vehicle
 Mongolia is hoping the troupe will become a marketing vehicle that will attract investment, tourism and trade benefits that will replace the markets lost after the collapse of Soviet empire.
"We feel that the circus can help serve as an economic and cultural ambassador of our country," said Luvsandorjiin Dawagiv, Mongolia's Ambassador to the United States.
Mr. Dawagiv (whose name is pronounced DAH-wah-give) has two family members who have trained as circus performers. His niece, Indra Tsogtbaatar, is a star contortionist in the Ringling show. And his 19-year-old daughter, Undra, a student in Maryland, practiced contortion in Mongolia, where it is considered to be a high gymnastic art.
Although Ringling is relying on Americans' awe of, and sparse knowledge about, things Mongolian, the performers hope to change that. "I think some Americans have misconceptions about Mongolia and Genghis Khan," said Indra Tsogtbaatar, who is 19. "He is a hero to our people, since he united Mongolia as a single state and brought together the Mongol people."
Dashpuntsag Amarjargal, a 38-year-old strongman who juggles 60-pound weights, said, "We all see ourselves as cultural ambassadors, and we would like Americans to know that the Soviet influence is no more."
 
Circus to Tour 90 Cities
 About 12 million Americans will be exposed to Mongolia's soft-sell message as the circus tours 90 cities until November 1993.
"From an advertising standpoint, this is a good marketing decision for the Mongolians," said Cindy Shevrovich, a market research analyst at Joyce Julius & Associates of Ann Arbor, Mich., a firm that estimates the monetary value of image-building.
"Just considering the people who see the show, the Mongolians' association with Ringling" is the equivalent of more than $1 million in national television advertising for Mongolia, she said. "And Ringling's own promotional advertising would be worth millions more to the Mongolians."
While unusual, Mongolia's circus act is a model for the kind of marketing ingenuity needed by former Communist countries vying with one another for favorable publicity and economic development, said Kenneth Feld, president and producer of Ringling. These are "the kinds of things these countries will be doing," said Mr. Feld, just back from the former Soviet republic of Moldova, where he was scouting circus acts.
Mr. Feld belongs to the United States-Mongolian Business Council, a Washington-based nonprofit private trade organization of 50 American business executives and corporations interested in commerce with Mongolia.
Though it was long known as the "unofficial" 16th Soviet republic, Mongolia was never formally part of the Soviet Union. "Consequently," said Richard E. Gillespie, executive director of the business council, "it has been one of the fastest of the former Communist countries to begin setting up a market economy and a multiparty democracy."
 
'Starting From Zilch'
 "As far as American trade, we are starting from zilch," Dr. Gillespie said. He hopes that joint ventures in food processing and manufacturing will be attractive to American businesses.
Ambassador Dawagiv said he had seen a sharp increase in interest from Americans looking for opportunities in Mongolia. The first major group of American companies will soon be making a trade mission to Mongolia under the auspices of the United States-Mongolian Business Council.
The nation held its first free elections in the summer of 1990, established a multiparty system that has 10 registered political parties, opened its first stock exchange on Feb. 6 and adopted a new democratic Constitution on Feb. 13, the Ambassador said. Mongolia needs help because now that it can no longer depend heavily on oil supplies and manufactured goods from the Soviet Union, its economy "is in disarray," Mr. Dawagiv said.
Traditionally, Mongolian trade has centered on leather goods, hides, cashmere and other exotic products. The country is also a mecca for hunters, with abundant bighorn sheep.
The attraction of Mongolia to the Ringling show is that the country "is strange and remote, and there are not too many places left these days that are mysterious and different," Mr. Feld said. Besides contortionists, the show features tumblers and fast-charging horseback riders. It also showcases members of the Monglian National Folk Dance Troupe.
 
Ticket Sales Are Brisk
 Their presence seems to have helped ticket sales. So far, as the show has been previewed in various cities on the way to its official opening in Manhattan, Mr. Feld said, attendance is up 18 percent over March 1990.
So far, "this is the single biggest year we've ever had," Mr. Feld said of the privately held Ringling company, which is estimated to take in between $250 million and $300 million in revenues each year. The company has two circus units, three touring ice shows and other productions.
As might be expected of a circus that has registered "The Greatest Show on Earth" as its trademark, the ringmaster, Jim Ragona, announces the troupe with traditional bombast: "From the mystic land beyond the far Himalayas, for the first time in America -- the culture and the glory of Genghis Khan and the Mongolian Empire!"
Mr. Feld first saw Mongolian performers in Poland in 1984, he said, but the Soviet-dominated Government that Mongolia had then would not permit its circus stars to travel to the United States.
Ambassador Dawagiv said he planned to see the circus this weekend. Unlike his daughter and his niece, he has not studied the art of contortion.
"Though," he added, "it might have its uses for an ambassador."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Off on Mixed Data; Gold Prices Gain Modestly

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar declined against major foreign currencies yesterday after reports furnished a murky picture of United States economic conditions.
Gold prices gained modestly. A troy ounce of gold closed at $341.10 on the Commodity Exchange in New York, up $1.50 from Tuesday's settlement price. Later, the Republic National Bank quoted a troy ounce of gold at $341, $1.50 higher than the late bid on Tuesday. 
 A pair of economic reports sent divergent signals and underscored the fragility of the economy as it struggles out of recession.
The Government's report on new orders for durable goods showed a decline of one-tenth of a percent, which was attributed largely to a slump in bookings for military equipment. Excluding the military category, orders grew 1.3 percent.
A separate report from the National Association of Realtors said sales of previously owned homes rose 9.3 percent in February.
Analysts said the reports indicated an uneven economic recovery with the housing industry benefiting the most from the interest-rate decline. The prospects for a sluggish rebound undermined forecasts for a rising dollar.
The dollar, meanwhile, lost ground against the German mark on increasing speculation that German interest rates would be moving higher in the near future. Higher rates in that country would tend to increase returns on mark-denominated holdings and encourage demand for marks.
The dollar finished trading in New York at 1.6520 German marks, down from 1.6635 marks late Tuesday.
The dollar ended the New York session at the same level against the Japanese yen as it did Monday and Tuesday. A dollar fetched 133.45 yen late in New York. In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.02 yen, to a closing 133.78 yen. Later, in London, it was quoted at 133.35 yen.
The dollar also retreated against sterling, even though the British currency has been under pressure because of the coming election in that country. The pound cost $1.7320 late in New York, more expensive than $1.7205 late Tuesday. In London, a pound rose to $1.7320, from $1.7200 late Tuesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates Tuesday, included: 1.5015 Swiss francs, down from 1.5125; 1,245.25 Italian lire, down from 1,251.50; 5.6025 French francs, down from 1.5125, and, 1.1877 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1903.

HEADLINE: CONSUMER RATES;
Many Money Fund Yields End Week Slightly Higher

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH M. FOWLER

 BODY:
The yields on tax-exempt and taxable money funds continued to reflect the recent slight overall rise in market yields, according to IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report.
"What we are seeing is that money fund yields finally are reflecting the unchanged Federal Reserve policy over the course of the first quarter, and they are remaining near their lows," Walter S. Frank, IBC/Donoghue's chief economist, said regarding the yields on taxable money funds. "This will continue until there is some action by the Federal Reserve, but we don't expect any action in the near term." 
 The Money Fund Report collects figures on the tax-exempt funds for the week on Monday and on the taxables on Tuesday.
The seven-day compound average yield for the tax-exempts rose to 2.77 percent, from 2.60 percent, while the seven-day simple yield rose to 2.73 percent from 2.56 percent.
During the same period, the 30-day compound yield was 2.60 percent, up by 2 basis points, while the simple yield was also up by 2 basis points, to 2.57 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of 1 percent.
Among the yield leaders in the three-state area, the top Connecticut fund was Dreyfus Connecticut Municipal Money Market, which reported a seven-day compound yield of 3.12 percent.
In New Jersey, the top fund was Calvert Tax Free Reserve N.J. Portfolio, reporting a seven-day compound yield of 3.16 percent.
In New York, the top fund again was the Salomon Brothers N.Y. Municipal Money Market fund. It had a seven-day compound yield of 3.47 percent, up from 3.41 percent.
The assets of the tax-exempt funds dropped by $760 million, to $97.4 billion. Donoghue's said the average number 0f days to maturity of securities held in the tax-free portfolios dropped by a day, to 51.
 
Fidelity Tops List
 Of the funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's with assets larger than $100 million, the Fidelity Spartan Municipal Money Market Fund led the way with a seven-day compound yield of 3.62 percent.
The assets of the taxable funds rose by $900 million, to $498.1 billion. Mr. Frank noted that institutions accounted for all of the inflow and more, because they put $1.3 billion into the funds, whereas individual investors withdrew money. He added that the average days to maturity of holdings in the taxable funds declined to 55, from 56.
The average seven-day compound taxable yield rose by a basis point, to 3.80 percent, while the seven-day simple yield increased by the same amount, to 3.73 percent.
At the same time, the 30-day compound yield on the taxables declined by 2 basis points, to 3.80 percent, while the 30-day simple yield dropped by the same amount, to 3.73 percent.
Fidelity's Spartan Money Market Fund also led the way as the highest-yielding taxable fund, with a seven-day compound yield of 4.39 percent.
By comparison, the average bank money market account, a prime competitor of money funds, was at 3.65 percent, off by a basis point, according to the national index of The Bank Rate Monitor.

BankAmerica: Time for a Bet?

BYLINE: By Andrew Pollack

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
IS now the time to bet on the biggest banking merger in the nation's history? The BankAmerica Corporation received permission from the Federal Reserve Board on Monday to buy the Security Pacific Corporation in a deal valued at roughly $5 billion. Now it's up to BankAmerica to combine the two California banking giants and realize the benefits it projects.
Wall Street seems to like the deal, which will create the dominant bank in the West and the nation's second largest after Citicorp. BankAmerica's stock traded yesterday at $44.625, off 12.5 cents on the day but up from $37.38 the day before the deal was announced last August. 
 That is despite several facts: California is in a deep recession and behind the rest of the nation in recovering; BankAmerica will have to divest itself of more than twice as much in branches and deposits as initially proposed, and Security Pacific has continued to suffer loan losses, raising questions about what BankAmerica is buying.
Driving the support for the deal is the belief that it will result in huge savings, largely by eliminating overlapping branches and personnel. BankAmerica estimates it will eventually save $1.2 billion a year in operating expenses.
"We see substantial earnings power coming out of this company," said Donald K. Crowley, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, who is one of the most bullish on BankAmerica. Despite changes in Security Pacific's loan portfolio and the increased amount of divestitures, "the economics of the deal remain essentially unchanged," he said.
But others see risks that could derail the stock.
One is that the savings may turn out to be less than expected. Even BankAmerica's own economists note in the bank's merger application to the Fed that nearly all the studies of commercial bank mergers in the last 20 years "suggest there are few economies to be realized in mergers: the resulting combined banks did not improve overall efficiency or profitability."
But BankAmerica's economists argue, and many analysts agree, that many of those mergers were aimed at geographic expansion, rather than at growing larger in a given market, as would occur with the BankAmerica-Security merger. After Wells Fargo & Company bought the Crocker National Bank in the same market in 1986, its expenses dropped to as little as 47 percent of revenues from more than 60 percent a year before the merger, the economists argued.
Another big risk is Security Pacific's loan portfolio. The Los Angeles bank has been rocked by a series of hefty loan losses since BankAmerica announced the merger agreement last August. How much more there will be could depend on the depth and length of the recession, which has hit Southern California and its real estate market particularly hard.
But the bullish analysts think those problems will be overcome. Ronald I. Mandle of Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, who recommends buying BankAmerica stock, said that Security Pacific was "further along than investors might have given it credit for in dealing with its problems."
Then there are the nuts-and bolts-risks from trying to combine the two big institutions. Consolidating computer operations is not easy, and there will be disruptions from layoffs -- BankAmerica has said there will be up to 12,000 -- and the combining of two different cultures.
Because of such risks, Lawrence W. Cohn, banking analyst with Paine Webber, rates the stock a hold. "We think we'll have an opportunity to buy it cheaper," he said. "There will be some bumps along the way before they get this to work."
One bump, he said, is that customers will defect, lowering first-year revenues of the combined bank. Large corporate customers, in particular, that have used both banks might now take some of their business elsewhere rather than be overly dependent on a single bank, he said. Other customers will depart because of the confusion or disruption that results from closing redundant branches.
But in the long run, Mr. Cohn said, the merger makes sense. "Anyone who's patient will end up owning a very attractive bank once it's over," he said.
More negative is Michael Murphy, editor of the Overpriced Stock Service, a newsletter that recommends issues for short selling. Mr. Murphy said that Security Pacific was in danger of failing and that BankAmerica might have been able to acquire it for next to nothing, had it waited.
His February newsletter summarizes what he thinks of the deal: "It should become clear over the next four quarters what BAC shareholders got: heavy up-front expenses, less savings than expected, more branch divestitures than expected, bigger loan losses than seemed possible and a stock price that should look like a bungee jump gone wrong."
To some extent, the results of the merger will come down to execution. Mr. Crowley of Keefe, Bruyette said that BankAmerica executives had already proved they could carry out a mega-merger successfully. Most of the managers were with Wells Fargo when it took over Crocker.

HEADLINE: A GARDENER'S WORLD;
There's a Providence In the Fall of a Tree

BYLINE: By ALLEN LACY

DATELINE: HILLSBOROUGH, N.C.

 BODY:
SINCE its founding in 1984, Montrose Nursery has become one of the best small mail-order sources of rare and unusual plants in the country, and a place I regularly visit on pilgrimage.
But Montrose is more than Montrose Nursery. Its spacious grounds have borne their name since the early 19th century, as home to several generations of the Graham family, going back to William A. Graham, a Governor of North Carolina and Secretary of the Navy under President Millard Fillmore. 
 Since 1977, the owners of Montrose have been Craufurd Goodwin, a professor of economics at Duke University, and Nancy Goodwin, the proprietor of the nursery. But the Goodwins say they are primarily stewards of this historic property, and I have long suspected that its true owners are not human beings but trees.
Billowing hedges of ancient boxwood embrace the large two-story white house and define parts of the garden, separating it from a rolling meadow that in March is a sea of daffodils. Above the garden and its broad green lawns, trees stand sentinel: magnificent hemlocks, white oaks so tall you have to crane your neck to see their crowns, and prodigiously fruitful pecans. Near the house there is an immense deodar cedar, the ground below its widespread branches carpeted thickly with the several species of hardy cyclamens the nursery grows from seed and offers as its main specialty.
But one tree in particular has always seemed emblematic of Montrose: a cucumber magnolia (Magnolia acuminata) growing by the driveway of crushed bluestone just where it curves past the house. This tree -- who can bear to talk of it in the past tense? -- comes suddenly into view from lower down the hill, where the lane passes between hollies on one side, hemlocks on the other. It can be taken in in its entirety at a single glance, despite its vast proportions and the complexity of its structure.
The tree is lovely in every season, starting in high spring when its long, pale-green leaves unfurl and it lifts its thousands of greenish chalices of flowers. The flowers bear a closer resemblance to those of tulip poplars than to the immense, open and creamy white flowers of Magnolia grandiflora, the evergreen Southern magnolia. But the cucumber magnolia and the Southern magnolia share the same sharp, bracing fragrance of lemon and spice, among the headiest perfumes in the entire plant kingdom.
This particular cucumber magnolia, by any reckoning 100 feet high and at least 250 years old and surely one of the largest and oldest in North America, is -- alas, was -- the most powerful in its beauty in winter. Bare of leaves, its architecture was revealed, as in an epiphany. From its central trunk, a massive bole six feet in diameter at its base, it tapered up to a spire like a steeple. The main branches grew outward and downward, but they seemed to have elbows that suddenly defied gravity by turning up, as if in supplication, and at their very tips they raised to heaven the buds that would unfold in spring.
This tree, I believe, was a dance, perhaps of the god Siva, perhaps of the tree gods my Druid ancestors worshiped centuries ago. It was more than a tree. It was endowed with energy that bordered on something beyond the natural order.
I have shifted to the past tense, for the Montrose magnolia is no more. For several years it had developed a noticeable lean, more and more pronounced. Tree surgeons were called to remove some limbs and branches, in hopes of saving it in a severe storm. But on March 11, late in the day and in only a moderate wind, it toppled to the ground, blocking the driveway and badly damaging a huge fir nearby. Its fall was so sudden that it killed birds nesting in its branches.
I arrived at Montrose the next morning, unprepared to discover that the tree had gone to earth. Douglas Ruhren, Nancy Goodwin's associate at the nursery, said very little. Neither did I. There were no words. But Mr. Ruhren scattered camellia and daffodil blossoms along the prostrate trunk. Five workers arrived with chain saws and forklifts and took three days to remove the tree piece by piece to a place in nearby woodlands, where it will decompose, enriching the soil with its substance.
In its life, this tree spanned much history. It was a sapling when Hillsborough was a capital of the colony of North Carolina. Cornwallis's troops, rumor has it, camped in the meadow below during part of the British attempt to crush the American rebellion. In the Dixon House in nearby Hillsborough, papers of agreement were drawn up between Sherman and Confederate officers, leading shortly to the end of the Civil War. The tree lived through other wars and rumors of wars, through periods of prosperity and periods of economic distress.
This tree had many friends and they mourn its loss, passing on the news by telephone. They called the Goodwins to offer sympathy, and to express their conviction that when this magnolia fell, it left a wound in the world that will not soon heal.
The word traveled like the news of the death of a president. Some people even visited the tree in its resting place, and carried back with them a twig or a piece of branch as some inexplicable talisman of the grace and power the magnolia had during its long, long life.
I am now going home to New Jersey, bearing a large chunk of bark torn from the tree as it fell. It will hang in the study where I write, as a symbol of both death and life.

HEADLINE: Critic's Notebook;
About Death, Bad Dreams And D. Boone Debunked

BYLINE: By MEL GUSSOW, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOUISVILLE, Ky., March 22

 BODY:
Debilitating illness and rituals of death were among the themes dramatized at the 16th annual Humana Festival of New American Plays at the Actors Theater of Louisville this weekend. In fact, there was so much medical equipment onstage in the marathon of eight plays and three 10-minute one-acts that one could conjecture that the Humana Foundation had not only given financial support to the festival but had also supplied scenery, props and costumes.
In a program note, Jon Jory, the company's artistic director, characterizes our times -- and presumably the plays in the festival -- as "fraught with fear and omens of disaster." Moving out of a hospital environment and responding to current social and economic crises, other plays dealt with violence, both actual and metaphorical. 
 This year there was no feeling of discovery, as there was when Beth Henley's "Crimes of the Heart" and Romulus Linney's "2" had their world premieres in Louisville. But there were three plays of more than usual interest. All of them are elevated by a highly individualistic sense of humor and each needs more work from the playwright before taking a next production step. Those three are Jose Rivera's "Marisol," a black-as-night comedy about urban nightmares, the most challenging of the plays in the festival; David Henry Hwang's "Bondage," a social satire set in an S & M parlor, and Marsha Norman's exuberant time-machine yarn, "D. Boone."
"Marisol" suffers from an overload of myth and portent, but it is fired by a comic ferocity. This could evolve into Mr. Rivera's most venturesome work. While some Louisvillians might have been perplexed by the weird urban extremities depicted onstage, beleaguered New Yorkers may identify them as the norm.
Deserted by her guardian angel and left to die or survive by her own wits, the doll-like title character (Karina Arroyave) bolts herself into her apartment behind a 10-foot-high door with 14 locks, and then watches fearfully, as with a click each lock falls to the floor. Standing next to her on the subway in another scene is a creature that could be a twin of the Wild Man of Borneo, and on the street she is accosted by a man with a scorched face. These and other grotesqueries are played by V. Craig Heidenreich, a masterly match for the vulnerable heroine. The play is too sprawling and ambitious to fit into the Actors Theater's small upstairs stage, but in a more fluid production and with a tighter script, angels would fly and devils would terrify.
Seeing a marathon of plays over a period of three days, theatergoers can be overcome by restlessness, or worse, but from its opening image, Mr. Hwang's "Bondage" riveted the audience to its seats. The scene is a brightly lighted Los Angeles house of dreams, in which a man, covered from head to toe with heavily zippered black leather, is hanging spread-eagled on chains. In the subsequent interplay, a similarly garbed dominatrix and this willingly masochistic client act out fantasies and demonstrate that, as one character says, "All's fair in love and bondage."
In this uncharacteristic mode, the author of "M. Butterfly" proves to be a wry observer of contemporary mores and racial stereotypes. The actors (B. D. Wong and Kathryn Layng) play their roles to the hilt, even as they unmask, an exceedingly intricate maneuver because of the technical complexity of the costuming. As the play moves from Genet-land to something approaching a romantic comedy, it occasionally stalls. An hour is too long for this escapade, but there is no denying that the playwright is having fun with his bondage badinage.
The Hwang play is a part of a new Actors Theater emphasis on multi-culturalism. Its companion one-act is Suzan-Lori Parks's "Devotees in the Garden of Love," a drawing room comedy set in a war zone. With its convoluted narrative, "Devotees" abandons the audience in a labyrinth. But there are sparks in it of the limber black patois that previously marked Ms. Parks's talent.
Ms. Norman's "D. Boone" was commissioned especially for Kentucky's bicentennial. Daniel Boone is, of course, at the top of the state's pantheon of heroes (along with college basketball stars). A tree stump in which the frontiersman is supposed to have carved his name stands in the Filson Club historical society as an artifact for the true Boone believer.
In her spoof, the playwright debunks the stump and the myth himself, and turns D. Boone into a guileful pragmatist, playing diplomacy to stall the Indians from attacking. The playwright engages in her own game of make-believe, freely mixing history with fanciful figments, as contemporary characters step through a teepee in a museum installation and find themselves Boone's companions. This "Back to the Future" framework allows the author to comment on historical revisionism and on almost anything else that enters her mind.
One might regard "D. Boone" as good ol' boy regionalism. I view it from the opposite direction, as a comedy that, with substantial revisions, might be transformed into a film starring Steve Martin and Billy Crystal, with Robin Williams in a cameo as Chief Blackfish, Boone's friendly foe. Cinematized, it could, of course, be a boon at the box office.
While Ms. Norman lightened up and revealed her droll side, John Conklin, in his debut as playwright and director, revealed nothing at all. The signs for his "Carving of Mount Rushmore" were auspicious. Mr. Conklin is one of our most creative designers of theater and opera, and the monumental subject would seem to be a natural one for his imagistic talent. But in an act that Mr. Hwang might characterize as masochistic, he unwisely turned his back on his role as scenic designer.
A tiny home movie screen used for shaky projections and dozens of chairs (a tag sale from "Grand Hotel"?) substitute for scenery. In this spare setting, actors speak randomly from the record, with one tourist quoting adjectives like "colossal" to describe the edifice we do not see. Only hinted at in this brief exercise is the serious question raised by Rushmore, whether it was a defensible act of art or a desecration of the natural environment. Ms. Norman is far more telling in her commentary on that tree stump.
The festival's other keen disappointment was John Olive's "Evelyn and the Polka King." No amount of good will toward the playwright for his past plays could justify this work's production. The story line is as tiresome as the polka music insistently played by an onstage band. Perhaps the play would have been more interesting if it had been "Evelyn and the Poker King."
Some theatergoers were touched by Mayo Simon's "Old Lady's Guide to Survival," about a lonely octogenarian who is losing her eyesight and forms an alliance with an Alzheimer's patient. Lynn Cohen in the title role is the chief asset in a play that sacrifices wistfulness for sentimentalization. In Ross MacLean's "Hyaena," a ghoulish visitor hangs around a hospital preying for patients to die. Despite a promising premise -- the title character is the opposite of the carekeepers we have seen in other plays -- this is a work without subtext. Joyce Carol Oates's 10-minute "Procedure" is procedural rather than dramatic, a slice of death as two nurses prepare a body for the morgue.
In contrast, the other 10-minute plays are exemplars of the short form: Jane Anderson's "Lynette at 3 A.M." is an absurdist cartoon about a woman's sleepless night in which she encounters the ghost of a neighbor who has just died. Lanford Wilson's "Eukiah" is a Faulknerian story about barnburning, with a jolting Wilson twist. Mr. Wilson wastes no words, offering an object lesson in artistic economy to less disciplined peers at this year's festival. He also has a warning to Kentuckians awaiting the Derby. As one of characters in "Eukiah" says, "Never trust anything anyone says if it's about horses."

The Man Who Missed Steinbrenner

BYLINE: By IRA BERKOW

 BODY:
THE good doctor was surprised to see me. After all, it had been quite a long time since my last visit. He led me to his couch.
"A terrible thing has happened to me, Doctor," I said, lying down and propping up my feet on his furniture, "and I need help." 
 "Terrible?" he said. "How so?"
"I've had a certain feeling, Doctor, which has created great guilt and angst and confusion in my mind."
"Does it have anything to do with love? Marriage? Business? The gross national product?"
"No, Doctor, the fact is, I think I miss George Steinbrenner."
The doctor sprang from his chair, rushed around his office, and returned with a cold compress, which he applied to my forehead. "No, Doctor," I said, "it's not physical. It's mental."
"You're telling me?" he said, with uncustomary sarcasm.
"Doctor, I saw in the papers where George went to a baseball game the other day. Like Elvis at 7-Eleven's, there had been sightings of George at ball games, but this was the first one actually confirmed. And something stirred in me. 'Yes,' I said, 'it was right.' "
"Hmmm," said the doctor.
"And then I saw yesterday that he wrote some cockamamie letter to the other owners, saying he's tried everything he could to get back into baseball, and he wants justice, and so on and so forth. You know there's some ploy there, some subterfuge to maybe getting a suit going even though he had a signed document that he wouldn't do it. And, Doctor, I laughed to myself when I read it."
"How loud was the laugh? A chuckle? A guffaw? Or a kind of hysteria and rolling around on the carpet?"
"Something in between. You see, I don't think I've been fooled by George in the past. I mean, I know he's often been a bully, a knee-jerk jerk, a publicity hound, a twister of facts and arms, but for all his own misjudgments and failings, I miss him. He adds something to my life."
"Your life?"
"With all the badnews every day, from the front page to the sports page, George made me laugh. He is the master of the outrageous, the king of the bizarre. He is vaudeville, Doctor. Baseball is his stage."
"You think so?"
"No, doctor, please, no more compresses." I closed my eyes. "Yes, George Steinbrenner is vaudeville. He's a pie in the face, a kick in the pants, a pratfall on a banana peel."
"How about two fingers in the eyes?"
"That too. Listen, I wouldn't want to work for him. He berates. He screams. He makes people crazy. When you go home at night from him it's like being on a work release program. But he can also be generous, I understand, and he does a lot of charity work, especially with schools and minorities. But that's not why I miss him."
I'm not sure, because it was rather dark in the room, but I think the good doctor was now applying the compresses to his own head. I went on.
"For one thing, his teams had often been competitive. They've fallen on hard times, but that doesn't mean they won't bounce back. Even the Cubs have bounced back. O.K., let's forget the Cubs. But I think, what's so important about winning? I mean, isn't entertainment the name of the game in professional sports? And George helps entertain us. He is by far the most recognizable owner in sports. The only one close to him is Gene Autry, and who would recognize him unless he's wearing a ten-gallon hat, strumming his gee-tar and warbling 'Tumbling Tumbleweeds'? And I'm sure that if you asked George, he'd jump up on his desk and sing for you, too. He's that kinda guy."
"Does he know 'Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer'?" mumbled the doctor.
"Doctor, please, no jokes. Now, what other owner would enjoy the nickname some call him, 'Attila the Hun,' and go on to read some nutsy book titled, 'The Leadership Secrets of Attila the Hun'? And underline passages, and quote it to people? One of George's favorites from the book is, 'Do not expect everyone to agree with you -- even if you are King.' And here's another he liked to quote: 'Chieftains must teach their Huns well that which is expected of them. Otherwise, Huns will probably do something not expected of them.'
"And what other owner has been quoted as widely as George? Remember when Goose Gossage was complaining about something? The Boss said, 'Goose should do more pitching and less quacking.' "
The doctor cleared his throat.
"Doc," I said, "will I be all right? Can I overcome this affliction of missing Steinbrenner?"
"Hmmm," he said, opening his appointments book. "Will next Thursday at 6 P.M. be convenient for you?"

HEADLINE: Democracy Wins in South Korea

 BODY:
South Korea's voters made democracy their own this week. Taking advantage of four years of reform by President Roh Tae Woo, they used their parliamentary election ballots to shake up an obsolete party structure, opening the fall presidential campaign to new entrants.
No specific American interests in Korea were at stake beyond the desire to encourage democracy in a country that has only recently begun to enjoy it. And while President Roh's ruling Democratic Liberal Party lost an embarrassing number of seats, the overall results resoundingly vindicate his democratic vision. 
 The Democratic Liberal Party, formed by a 1990 merger of several factions, hoped to emerge as a permanent majority force, like Japan's Liberal Democrats. Until two months ago its only serious challenger was the Democratic Party, also a coalition, led by Kim Dae Jung, the longtime dissident leader.
In their different ways these two parties represent legacies from the Korean past. Many veterans of former military regimes fill Democratic Liberal ranks. Kim Dae Jung's reputation rests largely on his courage in opposing a succession of dictators since the early 1970's.
But the sudden emergence of the Unification National Party, a pro-business group led by the founder of the Hyundai conglomerate, broke the old political pattern. Voters split their preferences three ways, denying the ruling party an absolute majority and encouraging new entrants to join the presidential race.
Koreans impatiently await a new generation of politicians. They know how to use their ballots for fine-tuned change. And they now worry more about practical issues of economic management than the old political polarities. That evolution of voter attitudes testifies to the impressive success of Mr. Roh's democratic endeavor.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Fairness and a Flat Tax;
Citing Justice, Brown Pushes Radical Idea, But Critics Call Proposal Inherently Unjust

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 25

 BODY:
Throughout the Presidential campaign, former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California has sought to portray himself as a friend of the powerless against the powerful, but many economists say the centerpiece of his economic proposals, a radical plan for a flat tax, is more friendly to the mighty than the meek.
Calling the present tax system too complicated and corrupt, Mr. Brown would scrap the progressive income tax, the corporate income tax, Social Security taxes and the gasoline tax and replace them with two basic taxes: a 13 percent flat income tax and a 13 percent value-added tax, similar to a national sales tax. 
 He insists that this would produce a simpler, fairer system that would spur economic growth. Among the backers he cites is Milton Friedman, the conservative economist, and some other conservative economists also favor the plan.
But other politicians and other economists question how fair Mr. Brown's plan would be. Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, Mr. Brown's opponent in the New York primary, launched a vigorous attack on the proposal today calling it a "war on New York tax."
And Mayor David N. Dinkins of New York signaled that he felt the same way when he gave a critical analysis of the tax plan to Mr. Brown during a visit to City Hall on Tuesday. A copy of the analysis was made available to The New York Times today by someone outside the Dinkins administration.
 
Looking Back to Mellon
 Citizens for Tax Justice, a liberal tax policy group, says that under Mr. Brown's proposal the poorest fifth of Americans would pay 26 percent of their income in taxes, up from 6.7 percent at present. The richest 1 percent, whose income averages $567,000, would pay 13.5 percent of their income in taxes, down from 28.6 percent at present, the group says.
"It will be the greatest thing for the rich and powerful since Andrew Mellon was Calvin Coolidge's Treasury Secretary in the 1920's," said Robert McIntyre, director of Citizens for Tax Justice, which is financed in large part by labor unions.
Robert E. Hall, an economist and senior fellow at the Hoover Institution in Palo Alto, Calif., proposed a flat plan a decade ago on which Mr. Brown's ideas are partly based, but he criticizes the former Governor's plan for being more regressive than his own. "The absence of a consistent, thoroughgoing effort to make it progressive seems to be the key missing element from the Brown proposal," Mr. Hall said today in an interview.
The plan that Mr. Hall developed with Alvin Rabushka, a tax specialist who is also a fellow at the Hoover Institution, would exempt from taxes the first $16,000 in income. Mr. Brown's plan has no such exemption.
Mr. Brown insists that his plan would be more progressive than the current tax system because it would eliminate most exemptions while allowing deductions for mortgage interest and rent. This, the Democratic candidate said, would allow low-income people and the middle class to deduct a substantial part of their income. (The plan also allows deductions for charitable contributions, a point Mr. Brown does not dwell on.)
"The 13 percent will lower the taxes on the middle class and the lower-income people," Mr. Brown said today on the CBS News program "This Morning." "It will shift to business the share that they have often been able to avoid by deducting their power lunches, their trips to Hawaii and all of the other things that they do that average people can't do."
Like much of Mr. Brown's Presidential campaign, the flat tax plan seems to be rapidly evolving, with some campaign officials saying it might need to be modified in light of the growing criticism that it is kinder to the rich than to the middle class.
 
Conflicting Spokesmen
 "Where unfairnesses are shown to be in there, obviously we want to get in there," said Lee Newman, a Brown spokesman.
But showing the degree of chaos in the organization of the Brown campaign, Tom Pier, the deputy press secretary, said later today that Mr. Newman was not authorized to speak for the campaign on economic issues.
"What you're seeing," Mr. Pier said, "is the intention of Governor Brown to simplify the tax system. The nuts and bolts are still to be determined, in a sense."
Mr. Brown's proposal is part of a five-page position paper called "Flat Rate Tax: A Silver Bullet Solution for the 1990's." Developed by Mr. Brown and a group of campaign staff members, the proposal says, "No amount of tinkering will correct the built-in inequities and red tape" of the current tax system.
The former Governor asserts that his plan would spur economic growth because it would lower taxes on savings and investment It would also let corporations depreciate the value of their investments in one year and would be much simpler and faster than the multiyear schedules for depreciation that companies must now wade through.
 
Effect on State Taxes
 Mr. Brown says his proposal seeks to create a pure tax program that would not be preyed upon by special interests. But analysts say there is no way that his proposals would pass intact through Congress.
One particular problem, many economists point out, is the effect of the flatrate plan on cities. It would end Federal income tax deductions for local and state taxes and would therefore increase the amount paid in Federal taxes by residents of high-tax cities and states. That would make it more difficult for such localities to increase local taxes, these analysts say, and some add it could also hurt cities by encouraging taxpayers to move to areas with lower taxes.
The study ordered by Mayor Dinkins, and done by the office of the New York City Finance Commissioner, Carol O'Cleireacain, said the Brown proposal would make New York City taxes more burdensome and would spawn a movement to cut local taxes. It noted that $4 billion in deductions were at stake and that eliminating the Federal tax exemption for interest on state and municipal bonds would increase the cost of debt service.
"It would be very difficult to continue our present tax structure without similar Federal taxes," Ms. O'Cleireacain wrote in the study.
 
Praise From Republicans
 Mr. Brown's plan has received more praise from supply-side Republicans than from liberal Democrats.
William A. Niskanen Jr., the chairman of the Cato Institute, a free-market policy institute in Washington, said he welcomed it. "I'm in favor of a flat tax," he said. "It is both pro-growth and anti-government."
Mr. Niskanen, who was a member of President Ronald Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers, said a flat-tax would raise the nation's economic output by 7 percent in the long term and would increase pressure by the middle class to reduce Government programs because the flat tax would increase that class's taxes.
"The downside," he said, "is that to move toward a flat tax and generate the same revenues we have now, there is no way to do that without raising the average tax rate of the middle class."
Mr. Niskanen said that he once urged the Reagan Administration to support a flat tax, but that Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d rejected it on the ground that it increased the tax burden on the middle class.
According to figures issued by the Brown campaign, the flat income tax would in effect be progressive because of the deductions. The average tax liability would rise from 5.6 percent for the poorest fifth of Americans to 10.1 percent for the middle fifth and would reach 10.8 percent for the highest fifth, the campaign says.
But those figures do not take into account the value-added tax, which is levied on goods at the retail level and is based on how much value is added at each step of production. Mr. Brown maintains that such a tax will be paid by businesses, but most economists say it is paid by consumers, because businesses tend to pass increases in their costs on to consumers in the form of higher prices.
The poor and middle class spend a higher percentage of their income on goods than do the rich, and so, according to most economists' studies, a value-added tax is regressive.
In a statement designed specifically to rebut the Citizens for Tax Justice's analysis of Mr. Brown's program, the candidate's campaign headquarters says, "Taxpayers at all income levels pay less in Federal income tax under the flat tax than under the existing system."
Mr. Brown also says the value-added tax would pick up the loss in Federal revenues projected by Mr. McIntyre's group.
 
Would the Deficit Rise?
 But many economists say the plan will increase the Federal deficit, which is expected to be more than $350 billion this year.
"I don't see how he could get a 13 percent tax rate to be revenue neutral if he is saying it will raise revenues that we now get from the income tax and Social Security," said Barry Bosworth, an economics official under President Jimmy Carter and now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.
When Mr. Hall, who is also an economics professor at Stanford University, published his flat tax study in 1985, he proposed a 19 percent flat tax. Brown campaign officials say they came up with the 13 percent proposal after independent computations with personal income figures.
Citizens for Tax Justice estimates that the Brown proposal would increase the Federal deficit by $200 billion. It said that for a flat tax to be revenue neutral, the rate would have to be increased to 16 percent. At that rate, it said, the bottom four-fifths of Americans in income would pay higher taxes while with a 13 percent rate the bottom three fifths would.
Mr. Pier, the Brown campaign's deputy press secretary, vigorously denied that the 13 percent rate would increase the Federal deficit, saying: "Many analysts fail to take into account the real economic growth that this tax plan would gneerate. Obviously, growth yields more revenues in the long term."
Mr. Hall said that Brown campaign officials had called to ask for his advice on modifying their plan, but that he has not returned their calls. "I have distanced myself from the Brown people," he said.
Mr. Hall said he was worried that if he advised the campaign he would become associated with its protectionist proposals, which he eschews.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 27, 1992, Friday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, a news analysis article yesterday about former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr.'s proposals for a flat tax referred incorrectly in some copies to the source of a critical analysis made available to The New York Times. The analysis was ordered by Mayor David N. Dinkins, and a copy was provided to The Times by people who are close to the campaign of Gov. Bill Clinton and who are outside the Dinkins Administration; it was not provided by Mayor Dinkins.


GRAPHIC: Edmund G. Brown Jr. has made a proposal for a sweeping overhaul of Federal Taxes a central part of his campaign for President. He would scrap the existing personal and corporate income taxes, Social Security tax and the excise tax on gasoline, and replace them with a flat 13 percent tax and a value-added tax, akin to a sales tax but imposed on wholesale as well as retail sales.
Graph: "Impact of Brown's Flat Tax Plan: Two Views"
 Who would pay more and who less under Brown's plan? Supporters and critics differ sharply, especially on the plan's impact on lower-income people. Their figures conflict in part because they are based on different sets of assumptions. Here is the analysis offered by the Brown campaign and that of Citizens for Tax Justice, an advocacy group that opposes Brown's plan.
 
Brown's Analysis
 * Compares the amount paid in four Federal taxes under current law with the flat income proposed by Brown.
 * Does not include the effect of the value-added tax, which Brown's proposal calls a tax on corporations, not individuals.
 * Calculates that his proposal would raise about as much revenue as the taxes it would replace, but that individuals will pay a smaller share and corporations a larger share.
 * Is based on 1990 income, household spending and tax figures.
 
Citizens for Tax Justice Analysis
 * Assumes that the value-added tax will be passed on to consumers by businesses in the form of higher prices.
 * Adds together the effect of the proposed flat income tax and the value-added tax.
 * Calculates that Brown's proposal would raise about 20 percent less revenue than the current Federal taxes it would replace.
 * Is based on 1992 income and tax figures, the Federal budget for fiscal 1993, and a computer model that estimates the effect of sales taxex.

HEADLINE: The Heart of the City Now Beats in the Mall

SERIES: Modern Mecca -- First of a series of occasional visits to a regional shopping mall.

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DANBURY, Conn.

 BODY:
Here, as everywhere, it is just off the highway. It is a great concrete box in an asphalt field and, with just a glimpse, a traveler can almost smell the scent of cinnamon and french fries that fills shopping-mall air everywhere.
It has been five years since the mall sprouted here, one of the climate-controlled selling palaces opened in the New York City area during the 1980's that left the region with, some experts say, the greatest concentration of giant shopping malls anywhere and helped foster a new suburban culture on the outskirts of the nation's most urbanized center.
 
Some Survive, Some Thrive
 Within a 90-minute drive of Times Square there are now 48 of them, with an average of almost a million square feet each, which means there are 2.4 square feet of mega-mall for every man, woman and child in the region. 
 Even in hard times, these are places that draw people. The recession has battered malls across the region, and there are many in the retailing industry who say a survival-of-the-fittest winnowing is beginning. But at top-of-the-line malls, like the Danbury Fair here, vacancies are virtually nonexistent; there are still crowds, and life, in a place that is now one of the region's centers, goes on.
Cause and effect will probably never be determined, but as the malls have mushroomed, downtowns across the region have faltered. Even the region's urban core, which includes Manhattan, has lost some of its share of shoppers, who for centuries have been crucial to the health of commercial centers. "The suburbs," a Rutgers University report on regional malls concluded last year, "have emerged victorious in the regional retail war."
Sociologists and urban planners call malls the new town squares. They are, said people interviewed in a series of visits to the "town square" of the Danbury Fair Mall, places not just to buy but to stroll, meet friends and, many said, to escape the dreariness and danger of old urban centers.
Legal scholars debate whether they are public places that should be open to pamphleteers and protesters. They are, Joan Didion once wrote, "toy garden cities in which no one lives but everyone consumes."
In the visits to the mall here, a picture emerged of a center that is part small town, part big top. It has a life and a character of its own, even if that character is an echo of malls everywhere.
It is a place that draws people. Some succeed at the mall, others fail. Some fall in love and some have their hearts broken there. It is a place, framed by name brands, where the lives of sometimes as many as 100,000 people intersect in a day.
Arthur Pieplow, a retired accountant, was sitting with his friends in the food court the other day. Like a lot of people here, he said he comes to the mall because it is clean and safe and interesting in its own way. And he said he had not been to downtown Danbury in years.
"Everybody, eventually, comes to the mall," he said.
Everybody comes to the mall. But in conversations over the months, many of those who came here talked about this skylit place with an ambivalence normally reserved for situation comedies and fast food.
"To tell you the truth, I hate it," said 22-year-old Matthew Schork of Brookfield. He said it, of course, at the mall. And he said he used to come so often that, for a while, he thought of himself as one of the "mall rats."
These adolescents are as much fixtures at the mall as the Tivoli lights on the food court carousel that is meant to evoke memories of the Great Danbury Fair. The real fair lasted 112 years on the same site before its grandstand and its zany facades were leveled to make room for the future.
Mr. Schork recalled the fair, where his family sometimes ran a food concession, and he said the mall replaced its honky-tonk with blandness. "This place here," he said, "you see the same thing every day, every year."
Joseph Biraglia, a gravelly voiced former Danbury detective who is the head of security at the mall here, calls it "Main Street, U.S.A." If it is, it is a starkly different kind of Main Street from the one in the memories of people here.
Danbury's real Main Street, a two-minute drive and several decades away, was once the heart of a thriving industrial city that made hats for most of the men in America before that industry vanished. Even now, five years after Wayne Newton crooned at the mall's opening ceremonies, nostalgia for the old fair is, for many, a symptom of their ambivalence about malls everywhere.
Richard Lipton, a 32-year-old doctor, was at the mall getting a spoon-feeding of ice cream from his 4-year-old son, Andrew, one day recently. "In some ways," he said, "every mall is a kind of stamped-out version of malls everywhere. If you've been to one mall, you've been to them all." It offered, he said, safety, comfort and predictability. "It's like McDonald's," he said. "If you go in, you know you're going to get the same thing all over the country."
Even though he grew up on Long Island, Dr. Lipton remembered that his father took him to the Danbury Fair when he was a child. The mall does not have the fair's character, and, if it is a Main Street, it is one without a church, or elections or a Hyde Park corner where ideas can be spouted from soap boxes. "I can't say," he said, with a look at little Andrew, "that I look forward to the day we're going to reminisce about the days we spent at the mall."
But among the things the mall lacks, too, are litter, panhandlers, cold winds or, indeed, excesses of any kind. It is private property, in this case owned and run by a family corporation, Wilmorite Inc. of Rochester, and subject to its rules.
The Wilmot family's company is one of the top 20 shopping center developers in the country, according to Monitor magazine, which covers the shopping-center industry. Like its peers in the industry, Wilmorite is a master of what has become the performance art of retailing. A computer insures temperatures remain between 68 and 72 degrees and adjusts lighting to keep it forever at the brightness of daylight, between 30 and 40 foot-candles. On the roof, a huge dish antenna insures an adequate supply of piped-in music.
The crews who work for the mall's manager, Patricia A. Frisaro, remove the wooden benches in rotation to sand and refinish them, keeping them looking perpetually new. Last spring, they put 25,000 tulip bulbs in the parking lots.
 
It's Only an Illusion
 "Everything is literally planned and controlled," said Marc Weissman, the New York City architect who designed the mall and 80 others across the country. "How the people come in, how they go out. They're not aware of it. But it's planned."
That sense of being processed, like the audiences crammed into the bleachers at Barnum & Bailey's afternoon show, may explain why some people feel uncomfortable while they stroll along the quarry-tile floor.
But it may also help explain why they keep coming back.
Across the country, the shopping mall formula has been proven to be a potent one. In a national poll conducted by The Gallup Organization for the International Council of Shopping Centers, 77 percent of respondents said they would rather shop at shopping centers than at downtown stores.
In the New York region, according to the Rutgers report, while mall developers expanded, the region's urban "core," which includes New York City and three urban counties in New Jersey, has lost some of its share of the retail shopping market, dropping from 39.1 percent in 1977 to 32.4 percent in 1987.
"America is overmalled, and New York is not only following that pattern, it is one of the driving forces in it," said James W. Hughes, a professor of urban planning at Rutgers University and one of the authors of the report. "For better or worse, malls are the focal points of our communities."
A survey conducted for The News-Times of Danbury found that in a multicounty area that stretches from Kent, Conn., in the north to South Salem in New York's Westchester County, more than 7 of every 10 residents go to the Danbury Fair Mall at least once every month.
"It's like a circus, the colors that you see in a circus, the people that you see," said David Busman, 69, of Yorktown Heights, N.Y. "It's entertaining."
It is a 1.3-million-square-foot, seven-day-a-week show. Under the big top are the selling floors of the "anchors" -- Sears, Lord & Taylor, G. Fox, Macy's and J. C. Penney. The sideshows are 215 smaller shops dominated by scores of household names: Banana Republic, The Gap, Disney.
Together, with Wilmorite's staff, the retailers practice the art of illusion. "Everything's good," said Mr. Weissman, the architect. "The stores are good. The mall is good. The food court is good. It's supposed to provoke new buying ideas."
And among the mall's people, failure does not make polite conversation. When it comes, it is usually quick and painful, and no evidence remains at the scene. This winter, the seven employees of Sterling Optical were repeatedly assured by their managers that the company's bankruptcy would not affect their store. Then, in an hour one morning, someone came from the regional office, swept all the frames into boxes and told them all they were dismissed.
For a year, down at the end of one of the mall's aisles, Eugene C. Cushman, a lawyer, and his partner, Richard Kushman, a baker, struggled against $250,000 set-up costs and an annual rent of more than $40,000 for 1,000 square feet. They thought their bakery, Benjamin Rigby's Ruggelah Factory, might be a hit everywhere, and they thought the mall's high traffic would justify costs that are many times greater than they are in most suburban downtowns.
Mr. Cushman and Mr. Kushman lost every cent they invested before they gave up. And now, it is not possible to tell exactly where it was that they had hoped to launch an empire. To any budding entrepreneur, Mr. Cushman offered this advice: "Don't go in the mall."
Sometimes, the effort of the performance is exhausting. Lili Kyritsis, 29, rents 520 square feet on the upper level for her Noah's Arc, which specializes in plush stuffed animals. Her marketing strategy, Ms. Kyritsis explained, involves encouraging hugs of the product.
Out there on those 520 square feet, she said, it is supposed to look easy. The customers do not see the carloads of boxes that have to be unloaded, they do not know about the loan on her parent's house. They do not see her late at night, when she gets so tired that she falls asleep on the cold mall walkway, as happened this Christmas season.
Not long ago, she said, a wealthy couple wandered in. They were so charmed that they began wondering aloud whether they could buy a shop like this for their daughter.
"They just saw me all dressed up and I'm having a good time," Ms. Kyritsis said. "And that's all they saw. They didn't see anything that went into it."
But when she was next seen, Ms. Kyritsis was back in character, out cuddling on the sales floor.
Mr. Weissman, the architect, said, "You try to get people to perceive certain things without noticing it: comfort, playfulness, a desire to keep shopping."

HEADLINE: PENTAGON SEEKING 140,000 REDUCTION IN RESERVE FORCES

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 26

 BODY:
Challenging one of Congress's political sacred cows, the Defense Department today proposed eliminating 140,000 military reservist positions in the next two years to balance cuts already made in the shrinking active armed forces.
Lawmakers have traditionally shielded the National Guard and service Reserves from deep cuts, partly because of the economic benefit their constituents reap from the part-time salaries and local armories. 
 On Capitol Hill today, Republicans and Democrats criticized the military strategy, and some Democrats accused the Bush Administration of seeking political advantage from the reductions, which would affect 830 Guard and Reserve units in all 50 states. There are a total of 1.2 million members in the National Guard and the service Reserves.
 
$20 Billion in 5 Years
 Over the next five years, the Pentagon wants to reduce reservists by 234,000 positions, at a savings of $20 billion. Congress would have to approve any cuts.
The outcome of the struggle between Congress and the Pentagon over reservists will not only shape the future makeup of the United States military; it also promises to mark one of the strongest clashes of wills over competing strategies to shrink the armed forces in the post-cold-war world.
"The Congress cannot have it both ways," Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said at a news conference. "They cannot tell us we have to cut the defense budget and then object every time we move to cut the defense budget."
 
No Longer Needed
 Mr. Cheney and Gen. Colin L. Powell, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said nearly 80 percent of the Reserve units designated for cuts were support troops for active-duty forces that have been withdrawn from Europe and are no longer needed.
New York State would lose 9,865 reservist positions, about 18 percent of all reservists in the state; New Jersey would lose 4,725 reservist positions, about 20 percent of all positions in the state, and Connecticut would lose 2,836 positions, about 27 percent of reservists there.
Lawmakers said they were analyzing the proposed cuts. The Defense Department proposed the reductions -- 33,000 in the current fiscal year and 107,000 in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 -- in January, but today it presented the first details of what specific units would be cut.
"What I want to do is examine very closely whether they are cutting the Guard and Reserve in order to save funds, or in order to assign those missions to active-duty forces," said Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who heads the Armed Services Committee.
Some lawmakers have urged the military to move some active duty units into the Reserves, where their maintenance costs are 25 to 80 percent of active forces.
 
Big Economic Losses
 Representative G. V. Montgomery, Democrat of Mississippi, a senior member of the House Armed Services Committee and a major supporter of the Guard and Reserves, said the proposed cuts would affect one out of every three Guard armories in the country. Mr. Montgomery said a 150-person armory pumps an average of $2 million a year into a local economy.
The clash over reservists recalls battles between Congress and the Pentagon in the past three years over the closing of military bases. After a hotly disputed first round of closings in 1988, Congress gave its blessing to a Federal commission's recommendations and agreed last year to close 34 military installations around the country.
The states with the largest proposed reservist cuts were California, with the loss of 12,775 positions; New York, 9,865; Massachusetts, 8,473; Michigan, 7,212; Ohio, 8,041; Wisconsin, 6,546, and Illinois, 5,879. Hawaii would lose only 7 reservists.
General Powell said New England would suffer the steepest proportional reductions, largely because population declines in the region have left many Reserve units there scrambling to fill positions. Under the proposal, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Vermont would lose from 26 percent to 37 percent of all their reservists.
Mr. Cheney rebutted charges of playing politics with the cuts, saying, "I did not look to see to whether we were hitting Republican districts or Democratic districts."
But he was clearly trying to make Congress feel the pain of military reductions. In recent weeks, the Secretary and General Powell have warned Congress against cutting active-duty forces faster than the 25 percent cut by 1995 that the Pentagon has planned.
 
Conflict Over Budget
 The House, which favors deeper military budget cuts in the fiscal year 1993, and the Senate, which may not, appear to be on a collision course over further reductions. Mr. Nunn, for example, has recommended against further cuts in President Bush's proposed $281 billion military budget for the fiscal year 1993. But Mr. Nunn said he favored reducing military spending by $80 billion to $85 billion over the next five years, $30 to $35 billion more than Mr. Bush has proposed.
House members favor deeper cuts than Mr. Nunn proposed over the next five years.
In addition to hurting local communities, the reductions would hurt individual families. Reservists earn about $5,000 to $6,000 a year, about 20 percent of the salary of their active-duty counterparts, for training one weekend a month and two weeks a year. Reservists are also eligible for education benefits.
The Army National Guard and Reserve would lose more than 125,000 positions in the next two years. The Navy and Marine Corps Reserve would lose about 13,000 positions. The Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard would lose only 742 positions, mainly because reservist pilots are picking up the job of flying fuel tankers that used to be handled by active-duty pilots.
Mr. Cheney said he regretted the reductions, but added that the Pentagon was a military organization and "not a social welfare agency."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Political Memo;
White House Sees Trips As Way to Revive Bush

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 26

 BODY:
The White House is counting on a series of foreign trips and diplomatic events in coming months to resurrect foreign policy as a campaign issue and reassert President Bush's primacy in world affairs before the fall election.
For Mr. Bush and his advisers, the effort is in part an attempt to redirect the political debate as the White House veers between campaign themes in its search for an approach that will cure Mr. Bush's political problems. 
 It is also an exercise in repairing the damage from frittering away Mr. Bush's greatest political strength on a disastrous trip to Japan, a hesitant approach to the breakup of the Soviet Union and by continuing to permit Saddam Hussein to thumb his nose at Mr. Bush from Baghdad.
The White House's attempts to exploit trade, the Persian Gulf war and other foreign-policy issues in the campaign have fallen flat. But so has its retreat into domestic affairs. Weeks of talking about the economy have failed to help Mr. Bush recover from his political plunge, a problem driven painfully home once again to Bush advisers by the 33 percent vote against him in the Connecticut primary on Tuesday.
 
Push for Foreign Affairs
 Once criticized for spending too much time on foreign affairs, Mr. Bush is now under fire from critics who say he has gone too far in the other direction, that his fear of Patrick J. Buchanan's isolationist campaign has, for example, hobbled the Administration's efforts to produce an aid package for the former Soviet republics.
Mr. Bush is being urged to re-engage in foreign affairs by some of his advisers and outsiders, including former President Richard M. Nixon, who chastised Mr. Bush recently for being too slow to provide aid to the former Soviet republics.
Mr. Nixon's prodding, which clearly irritated the White House, was all the more sharp since Mr. Nixon proved so adept at using his diplomatic schedule in the 1972 campaign, during which he went to China, signed a treaty with the Soviet Union on limiting nuclear weapons and moved to wrap up negotiations to end the Vietnam War.
Some Administration officials said political considerations had distracted the White House from foreign affairs, putting issues like aid to Russia on a "back burner." One official said, "The domestic side of the White House and the political operation are really driving things in a way they never did before."
 
Words of Uncertainty
 The White House strenuously denies that the campaign is hurting foreign policy. But Administration officials acknowledge that politics is now more tightly woven than ever with foreign affairs.
The President is clearly uncertain how much he can afford to concentrate on foreign affairs and travel abroad during this election year. His indecision was evident this week as he mused aloud about how hard it was to make up his mind about going to the United Nations environmental conference in June in Brazil, where Democratic lawmakers and a host of foreign leaders want him to sign an antipollution treaty that he does not want to sign.
Many Republican strategists say they believe it is imperative that foreign policy return to the political stage and that the worst thing Mr. Bush could do is to appear hesitant again.
"They got snake bit, but they have to get back into it," said a senior Republican adviser. "It's his strength and it's a perfect way to show you are governing. He ought to lead with it and do it in a style to which he's accustomed, really stepping out front and center and acting like the leader of the world."
Between mid-June and mid-July, Mr. Bush will meet with President Boris N. Yeltsin in the first Russian-American summit meeting, go to Munich for a meeting of the seven biggest industrialized democracies, visit Poland and probably attend the Brazil conference and a European security meeting in Helsinki, Finland. Campaign strategists make no secret of their delight that that schedule will end just before the Democratic National Convention in New York City.
"We need to spend the next months talking about the domestic agenda, but we need at some point in the campaign to emphasize his foreign-policy accomplishments and credentials," said Charles Black, senior adviser to the Bush campaign. "There's enough on the plate that we can have a few weeks of foreign policy, and the timing is just right."
But Administration officials fear the Brazil conference could prove to be a political trap.
 
'A North-South Fight'
 "For political reasons, we'll probably have to go to show he's got an environmental program," an official said. "But we're afraid of the conference turning into a North-South fight with us cast as the ogre of the North with no environmental agenda."
The Munich meeting should be an opportunity for Mr. Bush to play the role of leader in the club of industrialized nations. But Mr. Bush is facing political and policy problems that could taint the conference.
For one thing, the meeting is likely to be dominated by the subject of aid to the former Soviet Union, and Mr. Bush's political advisers are worried about inflaming the strong sentiment against foreign aid that has been evident in the campaign so far.
The White House is reviewing State Department proposals for further financial assistance to the former Soviet republics, including a proposed ruble stabilization fund. But such a fund would require hundreds of millions of dollars more from an Administration that is already having trouble coming up with the $645 million in aid it pledged in January.
Not only is the White House concerned about how additional aid could affect the election, but the Administration and Congress will also be hard pressed simply to find any more money. Mr. Bush has committed himself to the 1990 budget agreement, which prevents him from taking it from one obvious source, the Pentagon budget.
Beyond that, Mr. Yeltsin is clamoring to attend the meeting in Munich, backed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany. Mr. Bush does not want to snub Mr. Yeltsin, but officials said the United States is not very enthusiastic about inviting him, since it would merely open the door for the leaders of Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan to demand invitations as well.
Mr. Yeltsin's visit to the United States in mid-June seems tailor made as a campaign photo opportunity, Republican strategists said, as long as Mr. Bush can pull it off without making it seem like too crass an attempt to create a photo opportunity.
"An event like that shows Presidential stature on a turf that Bush is familiar with and comfortable with, not like domestic policy," one said. "But he must not give it a partisan or political orientation. He must govern. He must not campaign with foreign policy. When he goes overseas, or sees Yeltsin, he has to be President."

HEADLINE: Congressional Roundup;
Bill Would Open Kennedy Death Files

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 26

 BODY:
Leading lawmakers from both houses of Congress today introduced legislation to make public almost everything in Government files on the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963.
Representative Louis Stokes, the Ohio Democrat who headed the House investigation into the killing in the late 1970's, said the measure was supported by Congressional leaders and had no discernible opposition. "This resolution is going to sail through," he predicted. 
 Senator David L. Boren, the Oklahoma Democrat who heads the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he had been assured of cooperation by the directors of the Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He predicted that "99.999999999 percent of the documents" in Government files would be fully released.
Under the legislation, a five-member commission would be appointed by Federal judges to rule on whether information could be deleted or withheld. None of the panel members could be Government employees or have been involved with previous investigations of the assassinations.
 
2 Years for Disclosure
 The commission would have two years to see to the release of files from the House Assassinations Committee, the Warren Commission and any material held by other Government agencies. The bill urges Russian authorities to make public information in the files of the defunct K.G.B. and the G.R.U., domestic and military intelligence agencies of the Soviet Union.
The only grounds allowed for continued secrecy would be to protect personnel records of previous investigations, cases in which a current intelligence agent or informer's identity would be disclosed, where a current intelligence gathering method would be compromised, and where there would be a severe invasion of privacy of a living person. Some details of the autopsy of President Kennedy would also be kept from public display, Mr. Boren said.
Both leaders, and others of both parties who joined them, said it was important to make the information public to dispel suspicion, especially among young people whose view of the event came from Oliver Stone's movie "J.F.K.," which suggests that the assassination was plotted by the Government to keep the President from halting the Vietnam War.
Mr. Stokes said he doubted the files would provide any sensations. "I can assure you we didn't seal up any smoking gun in our files," he said.
 
Measure on Forests
 On the Senate floor today, an overwhelming majority approved a measure that could begin to decide the fate of the nation's last stands of virgin forests. It would carve up more than six million acres of timberland in Montana into tracts to be preserved and other tracts eligible to be cut.
The ambitious proposal sets out broad goals for managing timberlands in 10 national forests in the state. The compromise measure was adopted by a vote of 75 to 22.
This bill was developed by Montana's two Senators, Max Baucus, a Democrat, and Conrad Burns, a Republican. But Montana's Representatives, Ron Marlenee, a Republican, and Pat Williams, a Democrat, have both expressed reservations. Both environmentalists and timber companies have said they were disappointed in this bill.
The measure joins several others the House is set to consider this spring over cutting the old growth forests of the West.
The Senate bill calls for setting aside 1.2 million acres as permanent wilderness, diverting another one million acres as recreational areas and regions off limits to cutting, and designating 4 million acres to be managed by the Forest Service for timber harvesting and other industrial development.
 
America's 'Marshall Plan'
 Congress's Joint Economic Committee called for a "Marshall Plan for America" to strengthen the nation so it can compete more effectively against Japan and Germany.
The committee said cuts in the military budget should be invested in areas like high-speed rail, air traffic control systems and a nationwide data communications network. Under the 1990 budget act, such shifts from military spending cannot be made until next year; the Senate tonight killed a Democrtaic effort that would have allowed the transfers this year. House leaders have repeatedly put off votes on a companion proposal because they cannot find enough support to pass it.
Also today, the Congressional Budget Office issued a report analyzing President Bush's budget, saying it would have little effect on the outlook for the Federal deficit. It said the President's proposals would slow the accumulation of the Federal debt by just $3 billion over the next five years.

THE LIFE OF A MALL
It has been five years since opening of the Danbury Fair Mall, one of the climate-controlled selling palaces opened in the New York City area during the 1980's that left the region with, some experts say, the greatest concentration of giant shopping malls anywhere and helped foster a new suburban culture in the nation's most urban area. And while the recession has battered malls across the region, at top-of-the-line like the Danbury Fair, vacancies are virtually nonexistent; there are still crowds, and life, in a place that is now one of the region's centers, goes on.

HEADLINE: A Dealer's Lot Is Not a Happy One

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRONXVILLE, N.Y., March 25

 BODY:
Step into Dwight W. McGuirk's Ford showroom these days, and he will tell you that like lots of auto dealers his mark-up over invoice is $500 at most and sometimes as little as $200. The number is so small -- and sales have been so slow lately -- that it is a monthly scramble for Mr. McGuirk to finance the $3 million worth of cars and trucks on his lots, pay his three salesmen and keep the roof over his showroom from leaking.
In fact, he cannot do it all even though what he pays for his cars and trucks is slightly less than the much talked about "invoice price" that many car buyers believe is the dealer's cost. His profit margin can pay the salesmen, but there has not been enough to fix the roof as well. When it rains hard, the water trickles onto a patch of plastic draped on the hood of a blue Taurus sedan parked near the American flag. 
 "It's tough, real tough," said Mr. McGuirk, whose father bought Smith-Cairns Ford in this suburb north of New York City in 1961, and where Mr. McGuirk, 36 years old, has worked for 16 years. His sister Amy, the office manager, watching him dash from the showroom to the lot to the service shop to the body shop and back, has a name for the mode in which he tries to steer the dealership through this recession. She calls him "the mad jogger."
While customers often feel the deck is stacked against them when they enter a car dealership, many dealers like Mr. McGuirk are owners of small businesses trying to survive on shrinking margins and struggling with the mistakes and mandates of Detroit and the seesawing moods of consumer spending. In Mr. McGuirk's view, the deck is stacked against him.
To dealers, the world is a hostile place, strewn with printouts that tell customers what the dealer pays for a car, which some shoppers brandish like weapons; filled with trade-ins that break down almost instantly and besieged by vandals who steal everything from radios to cup holders.
Detroit's Big Three rolled up their worst losses in history last year, and 1,600 car dealers, almost 7 percent, closed their doors. The National Automobile Dealers Association estimated that most dealerships lost money last year on new-car sales, though Mr. McGuirk believes that measuring the profitability of new-car sales, used-car sales and repairs is all a matter of how a dealer chooses to allocate costs.
But with the economic recovery uncertain, competition among the 23,500 survivors seems more intense, especially in the older urban areas where dealerships abound. (Mr. McGuirk must contend with at least seven Ford and Lincoln-Mercury dealerships nearby, one of which declared bankruptcy earlier this month.) People do not have as much to spend, and everyone, including the dealers, say the fun has gone out of buying a new car.
 
Profits in Service
 Mr. McGuirk's repair shop is profitable but costly. He recently bought a $35,000 computer for repairs, the most expensive thing he says he ever bought. While the place still looks like a repair shop -- tools, lifts and pin-up pictures -- it is actually a room where computers interrogate computer chips under the hood. The best mechanics spend 10 days a year in school, learning the intricacies of electronics.
Nominally, the shop has $400,000 in inventory, but when pressed, Mr. McGuirk admits, "probably $100,000 of it is junk." When he cleaned out the parts department a few years ago, he found a radiator with a hole in the middle for a crank.
A front-end alignment machine costs $5,000, and because of tightening air-pollution regulations, Mr. McGuirk may soon have to spend $40,000 on a painting booth to contain chemicals.
But most frustrating is the new-car sales slump. Last year Mr. McGuirk sold 953 cars and trucks, down 27 percent from his best sales year in 1988. Two or three times a week a trailer arrives with new cars, and Mr. McGuirk and his salesmen wonder who will be the buyers.
"I don't have a choice to buy low and sell high," he said. "I pay what Ford charges and sell at what the market will bear. The only thing I control is overhead."
 
Solid Prospects
 Joseph and Mildred Cotter were in the showroom the other day looking for their first new car in 10 years. Mr. Cotter, a retired English and Latin teacher, said he ranked shopping just above surgery and buying a house and below every other possible activity.
Mrs. Cotter, a retired librarian, seemed to like shopping even less. "I'm a Toyota person," she told the salesman, Arthur E. Behrmann. The Toyota the Cotters drive is 23 years old, Mrs. Cotter said, and "she's a good little car, but she's beginning to show her age."
Mr. Behrmann, who has sold cars here for 39 years, thought the Cotters were a good prospect. He offered them the keys to a Taurus sedan for a test drive, and as Mr. Cotter reached for his wallet to show his license, Mr. Behrmann said, "You drove in here, that's good enough."
(Mr. McGuirk said that twice in his 16 years in the business customers on test drives had smacked up cars. Once the driver apologized and left; the other time the driver said he liked the way the vehicle handled and bought it.)
The Cotters took the Taurus out of the dealership, past the Mustang convertible that Mr. McGuirk parks every morning right out front when the sun shines. As they disappeared, Amy McGuirk was doubtful that the Cotters were ready for a new car, but Mr. Behrmann thought patience would pay off.
Customers think that car dealers are shady, said Mr. McGuirk, adding that in some ways it is hard to appear otherwise. He said he had shied away from high-pressure sales tactics. Ford makes this nearly impossible by offering rebates of $1,000 or more for a limited period, so he must tell a customer to buy this week or risk paying more. Even worse, he said, is when Ford abruptly raises the rebate, and a customer who bought a car the day before comes in to complain.
But worst of all, he said, "99 percent of your customers think you make more than you really do."
 
Low-Key Image
 Mr. McGuirk would not disclose what he makes, except to say that in a good year, which this is not, he makes a good living. His own car is a 1987 Taurus with 103,000 miles on it, partly, he says, because growing up as one of seven children of a car dealer, he got used to driving high-mileage models his father took in trade. But the Taurus is in good shape, he said, and will tow his jet ski.
Part of what a car dealer sells is himself, and Mr. McGuirk is good at that. He is also careful about his image. The only jewelry he wears is a watch, but he will not wear a Rolex, he said, because times are tough and he does not want to send the message that he is rolling in money. His business is still profitable, he said, but only because he takes a small salary and keeps overhead down.
He believes that the economy will turn around and that the dealership will survive because he is straight and honest with customers. A big part of that is a modest mark-up and a hope that a fair deal translates into repeat sales.
"There's no reason to nail a guy," Mr. McGuirk said, explaining why he would never sell a car at list price. Everybody talks cars, he said, and then the customer will know he got a bad deal. "You'll only nail him that one time."
In any case, the last time anyone routinely sold Fords at list was six years ago, when the Taurus first came out, he said. The Mustang convertible could sell for close to list price, he added, if early June brings the right buyer and the cars are in short supply. The Mustang is an exception in another way: It sits out front to lure shoppers even if they are not looking for a sports car.
 
Complex Formula
 Exactly what dealers pay for cars is more complicated than indicated by the popular factory-price printouts that are available from a host of car buying services. Most dealers pay the factory the invoice price represented on these printouts. But at the end of the calendar quarter, the dealer gets a rebate from Detroit of 3 percent of the invoice price, called a "hold-back."
In some cases, the invoice also includes an advertising budget for cooperative advertising by area dealers. It also includes some money for the cost of paying interest on the car while it is on the showroom floor, called a "floor-plan allowance."
Ford's invoice to the dealer includes $9.80 for eight gallons of gasoline the factory puts in the tank and 50 cents for the computer message from Ford confirming Smith-Cairns's order. The state takes its share, too. On each car, for example, Mr. McGuirk must calculate the amount of lubricating oil, transmission oil, power steering fluid and other fluids and pay a tax of 10 cents a quart just as service stations do.
But dealers have other chances to make money. The sharpest salesman in most dealerships, according to Mr. McGuirk, is the "F.& I. man," who had originally handled "finance and insurance." That person takes over after the price has been set and arranges any financing, often sharply marked up. That person also sells undercoating, exterior paint sealant, protective upholstery treatment, antitheft locks and extended repair warranties that can add a total of $3,000 to the price and plenty of profit.
"They could sell a snowball to an Eskimo," said Mr. McGuirk, with some admiration, though he does not push those after-sale items very hard.
"People have gotten clued in," he said. "I can't remember the last car I rust-proofed."
 
Better Than Early 80's
 But a car might sit on the lot for months, and Mr. McGuirk pays Ford one percentage point over the prime rate, which is now 6 1/2 percent. This recession is easier than the last because interest rates are lower, he said, and because the Ford Taurus and Explorer, the popular four-wheel-drive wagon, sell better than models Ford was offering in the early 80's. Back then, Mr. McGuirk added, he and his father went to auctions to buy used vehicles to have something attractive to sell.
Some aspects of selling a car have mostly disappeared. Almost no one asks about engine design anymore. And women customers, Mr. McGuirk said, arrive better prepared than men. Dealers have lost business by not taking a woman seriously if she comes in by herself. "Even if you think that way," he added, "you should never act that way."
The market will eventually pick up, Mr. McGuirk predicted. In the meantime, Mr. Behrmann managed to sell a Taurus sedan to the Cotters. But Amy McGuirk was partly right: The Cotters decided not to part with their 23-year-old Toyota. Not yet anyway.

HEADLINE: Stocks Close Day Mixed; Dow Up 8.28

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stock prices were mixed in moderatly heavy trading yesterday, with blue-chip issues firm, and the broad market weaker. The Dow Jones industrial average ended at 3,267.67, up 8.28 points for the day.
Analysts said the market hardly reacted to yesterday's news that the United States economy edged up at an annual rate of just four-tenths of 1 percent in the final three months of last year, a pace that was even weaker than previously calculated, and that the number of Americans filing first-time claims for unemployment benefits jumped to 447,000 for the week ended March 14. Instead, traders looked ahead to next week, when a fresh batch of economic data is due, including March consumer confidence and unemployment. 
 Blue-chip issues rose near the close, rebounding from Wednesday's selloff, but the late strength did not carry over to the secondary market. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks gained 0.34 point to close at 407.86, while the American Stock Exchange composite index fell 1.43 points, to 398.86. In active over-the-counter trading, the Nasdaq composite finished down 4.08 points, to 615.40, and the Russell 2,000 dipped 0.68 point, to 206.24.
 
Volume Declines a Bit
 Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 176.7 million shares, down from 192.7 million shares on Wednesday, with losing issues narrowly outpacing gainers by 842 to 765.
Dennis Jarrett, chief market analyst at Kidder, Peabody & Company, said the day began filled with high expectations that only seemed to fizzle at the end. "A repeat of the last few sessions," he said. "Investors are still not clear just how strong or how weak this economy is."
He noted that the market was not sure of the trend interest rates would take and that it did not have leadership, since economically sensitive issues and the old growth leadership stocks were locked in battle. "Coupled with investors waiting for first-quarter corporate results to emerge, and the need for fresh economic data, you have a market running in place," Mr. Jarrett said. "You need clear direction before investors can make a major decision to buy or sell."
Stocks opened firmer, as the market appeared to be correcting from a program-induced selloff late Wednesday that followed a Salomon Brothers trading error.
In trading, Borland International fell 5 1/8, to 56 3/4. David Readerman, an analyst with Shearson Lehman, cut his fourth-quarter estimate for the software company to 5 cents a share from 20 cents a share. Traders said he was one of a number who have already revised their estimates.
Citing lower material costs and improvements in United States residential construction, James Wilbur, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, repeated his "buy" recommendation on Dow Chemical . He said the recent upturn in housing construction should improve the pricing outlook for Dow's residential vinyl and plastics products, and if oil and gas prices remain low, they could lift annual earnings by as much as 60 cents a share. The stock gained 7/8 to close at 61 5/8.
American Express was up 1/2, to 24, mostly in block trading, as Alison Deans, another analyst at Smith Barney, raised her recommendation on the stock to "buy" from "hold."
Walker Interactive Systems rose to 22, up from an initial public offering price of 15, making the computer software manufacturer among the most actively traded on the Nasdaq yesterday, as 3.3 million shares traded. The most active was Intel the semiconductor company, which fell 1 1/2, to 58 3/4, on 3.9 million shares.

HEADLINE: Less Crime to Count;
Was It Community Policing? Experts Try to Explain Drops in Major Crimes

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL

 BODY:
With reported crime down in every major category in New York City last year for the first time since the early Eisenhower years, police officials are asking themselves: Did we do something right?
Experts agree it is too soon to say. But the provisional answer appears to be yes, at least to some extent. While the turnabout was marginal in some cases and hardly qualifies as a trend, examination of the figures suggests that the department's sweeping program of neighborhood patrols and saturation coverage seems to be having an effect in at least certain high-crime precincts. 
 Moreover, the dip, which bucks the national trend, shows no sign of abating. Robbery complaints were down a marginal 1.8 percent last year. But perhaps more significant is that with one exception, the city has now recorded 18 consecutive months in which the seven major reported crimes totaled less than in the same month the previous year. Robberies in December 1991 were down nearly 4 percent, and down nearly 7 percent in January and February of this year.
Predictably, questions outnumber answers in the wake of the upbeat 1991 figures, the first time since 1955 that all seven "index" crimes -- murder, rape, robbery, assault, burglary, larceny and motor vehicle theft -- went down instead of up.
Why, for example, if crime was down 4.4 percent citywide, was it down so much more sharply in some precincts and up sharply in others? Of the nearly two dozen high-robbery precincts, those with 1,000 or more robberies per square mile last year, why did some show dramatic downturns and others upsurges?
No one knows for sure, but a closer look at the figures suggests that some precincts are more responsive than others to the stepped-up neighborhood patrols of community policing, Commissioner Lee P. Brown's signature program of teams of foot officers who seek to resolve local problems before they blow up into criminal crises. Midtown South and Midtown North, both notoriously robbery-prone Manhattan precincts, in part because of the supply of business victims, recorded drops of more than 19 and 18 percent, respectively.
Yet another high-robbery precinct, the 28th, just north of Central Park in Harlem, declined a statistically insignificant 1.5 percent.
According to Assistant Chief Michael A. Markman of the Office of Management Analysis and Planning, which puts out the figures, the midtown precincts, where crime clusters along corridors like 42d Street and the day population is largely one of transient workers, are particularly responsive to saturation patrolling and community policing. Since April 1990, he said, special programs that added overtime patrols and put desk officers out on the street one day a week added an extra 150,000 tours to the police presence in high-crime areas like Midtown South.
But the same stepped-up police coverage works less well in poor, residential neighborhoods high in violent crime, said Thomas A. Reppetto, president of the Citizens Crime Commission, a watchdog group.
The hypothesis gains some support from subway crime figures, Mr. Reppetto said. With intensified patrols by the transit police, reported robberies in the subway -- included in the citywide tabulations -- were down nearly 12 percent last year. Overall reported felonies were down 15 percent last year, and every month for the last 15 months, there were fewer subway felonies than in the corresponding month the year before.
While citywide figures show interesting fluctuations, experts cautioned against seeking significance in any small sampling, such as one precinct or even a borough. Queens, for example, recorded an 8 percent increase in robbery complaints, with some precincts, like the 100th in Rockaway, showing a nearly 30 percent jump.
But the raw figures are so relatively small that a few active teams of robbers during the course of a year could push the percentages way up.
While local disparities might be interesting, the statistical portrait of crime in the city requires the same kind of perspective as a Pointillist painting: from too close it just looks like a jumble of dots.
But even the broadest brush strokes should be viewed with caution, officials say. While saying, "I'm optimistic some of the things we're doing are beginning to make a difference," Commissioner Brown said, "One year does not constitute a trend." As a career criminologist as well as a longtime street officer, he said, he knew there was no single cause of crime, or single cure for it.
Still, others found the figures encouraging. Hubert Williams, president of the Police Foundation, a research organization in Washington, said he was struck by the way New York City appeared to be "turning the corner on its own historical norms."
"Crime going down is not a phenomenon we see very much of today, especially across the board in all categories."
Marvin Wolfgang, a professor of criminology and law at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, said a 4.4 percent decline in reported crime "is very difficult to explain."
"If you had a 4.4 percent drop in unemployment, it would be very significant," he said.
But to draw further conclusions, he said, he would want to know the role of community policing in achieving such results.

HEADLINE: Region Rethinks Its Dependence on the Sales Tax;
Some Government Officials See Wobbly Revenue and an Unfair Burden on the Poor

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

 BODY:
In the 1980's, when conspicuous consumption was elevated to an art, county and state governments around the New York region enjoyed a spectacular stream of revenue from sales taxes, with receipts routinely rising more than 10 percent a year.
But when the recession hit, that stream slowed to a trickle, contributing to fiscal crises in Hartford, Albany and Trenton. In New York, for example, where sales taxes bring in about a fourth of the state's revenue, state sales-tax receipts fell $323 million between 1990 and 1991, to $5.4 billion. 
 Now, leaders in government are rethinking their dependence on the sales tax. Many have concluded that it is an unreliable source of revenue and also places an unfair burden on the poor, who generally pay a higher portion of their income for sales taxes than more affluent taxpayers.
Nationwide, experts say, state governments are moving away from the sales tax and relying more on income taxes. Connecticut, for example, adopted an income tax last year after a bitter struggle and cut its sales tax to 6 percent, from 8 percent. On Monday, the New Jersey Assembly passed a bill to roll back the sales tax to 6 percent, from 7 percent, following through on a pledge that helped Republicans win a veto-proof majority in both houses of the Legislature.
Still, the sales tax holds strong appeal for many governments. While New York State has not raised its basic 4 percent sales tax since 1965, many county governments have been raising their sales taxes to the legal maximum, largely because voters find it less objectionable than higher property taxes. That may be because people pay the sales tax in dribs and drabs, and virtually no one can say how much he or she paid in sales tax in a given year.
"There's no day of reckoning where the consumer is reminded of the aggregate amount spent, the way there is with property-tax bills and income-tax returns," said Dave Kehler president of the Public Affairs Research Institute of New Jersey in Princeton.
In New York, the average combined state and county sales tax is around 7 percent, but in Nassau County it is 8.5 percent -- one of the highest in the nation -- and in New York City it is 8.25 percent. Orange and Westchester Counties raised their sales taxes last year, and Westchester officials are seeking another increase of half a percentage point this year, to 7.25 percent.
To a degree, the increases reflect the weakness of the sales tax during the recession, which has forced counties to raise the tax rate just to break even.
Of course, revenues from other taxes have also faltered of late, but experts said the drop-off in sales-tax revenue was the steepest.
According to the Center for the Study of the States at the State University of New York in Albany, income-tax revenue rose nine-tenths of 1 percent nationwide during the last quarter of 1991, compared with the same period in 1990, but sales-tax revenue fell by 2 percent.
"During this recession, sales-tax revenues have performed even worse than they normally do in bad times," said Steven D. Gold, the center's director, "and that's because of the unprecedented depression in consumer spending.
"It makes it a lot tougher for governors and legislators to produce a balanced budget," he said.
 
In Good Times and Bad
 Connecticut is a prime example. Without a tax on wages, it depended heavily on the sales tax. During the 1980's, it had huge budget surpluses, with an increase in sales-tax revenue of as much as 17.1 percent in 1984. But by 1990, the increase, adjusted for changes in the tax rate, had fallen to just seven-tenths of 1 percent, and in the first three months of this year, sales-tax revenue actually declined an estimated 5 percent, compared with the same period last year.
"That kind of fluctuation is something you just don't see with respect to personal income," said William J. Cibes Jr., who heads Connecticut's Office of Policy and Management.
Of equal concern to longtime income-tax advocates in Connecticut, and elsewhere, is the regressive nature of the sales tax.
A study by Citizens for Tax Justice, a nonpartisan research group that favors the income tax over the sales tax, found that in 1991 Americans in the bottom 20 percent income bracket spent 5.7 percent of their income on sales taxes, while those in the top 1 percent spent only 1.2 percent.
That discrepancy, however, has often been lost on taxpayers.
"The thing about the sales tax is that, because it's taken a nickel and a dime at a time, the perception among politicians is that people won't notice it," said Michael Ettlinger, tax policy director for Citizens for Tax Justice. "But at some point there's a backlash, and New Jersey is a good example of that."
In New Jersey, Gov. Jim Florio won an increase of one percentage point in the sales tax in 1990. Though the new rate of 7 percent was relatively low by the standards of the metropolitan region, it was part of a $2.8 billion package of tax increases that led to a tax revolt.
"Taxes became a high-profile debate in the state," Mr. Ettlinger said, "and the difference between a tax that's regressive and the progressive income tax was made apparent to the public."
Frank Catania, a Republican who is Deputy Speaker of the New Jersey Assembly, said legislators had targeted the sales tax for a rollback because of its regressive nature. "It hurts the little guy," he said. "Senior citizens and low-income people are paying much more of their income on sales taxes than the wealthy."
He also said that a rollback would bolster consumer spending. "Repealing the increase in the sales tax would put $608 million back into the economy for people to spend any way they want," Mr. Catania said. "In order for our retailers to be in competition with surrounding states, we have to be more realistic."
To offset the regressive nature of the sales tax, most states exempt certain goods. In New Jersey, for instance, there is no sales tax on clothing. Connecticut exempts fuel and clothing that costs less than $50 an item. New York does not tax prescription or non-prescription drugs. None places a tax on most food bought in stores.
Many people in and out of government say the shift to a service-oriented economy in recent years has meant an erosion of the traditional sales-tax base. "More and more consumer goods, so to speak, are services," said James W. Wetzler, Commissioner of the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance. As a result, New York now applies a sales tax on the services provided by security guards, private detectives and interior decorators.
When Nassau County tried to expand its base by taxing home heating oil, however, there was such an outcry that the proposal was withdrawn. With a rate of 8.5 percent, Nassau officials believe they have arrived at an uncomfortable threshold.
"Right now, it's unrealistic to think it can go any higher," said Peter King, Nassau's Comptroller. "It's not an option, and it's not an option to consider an increase in the property tax. We're really at a crossroads because the traditional means of taxation have really been exhausted."

HEADLINE: 4 Exchanges A Step Closer To New Space

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
With the threat of losing thousands of jobs to New Jersey hanging over its head, the New York City Council yesterday overwhelmingly approved a city-subsidized effort to build a new commodities-exchange headquarters in Manhattan without knowing whether the project would go forward.
The vote removed the last governmental hurdle to a project aimed at keeping four of the city's five exchanges, which traditionally have had their headquarters in the Financial District, from acting on their threat to move to Jersey City, taking nearly 9,000 jobs and $50 million in tax revenues with them. 
 But even with the Council's approval, a spokeswoman for the four exchanges, Michele de Milly, said yesterday that the future of the project was uncertain. The project was dealt a severe blow in January when the largest of the exchanges, the New York Mercantile Exchange, pulled out of the deal, saying it was looking for another site.
 
City-Owned Parcel
 In a 42-to-5 vote with one abstention, the Council gave its approval for an 18- or 22-story building with a 51,000-square-foot trading floor on city-owned land bounded by Greenwich, West, Warren and Murray streets in TriBeCa. While the Council approved the use of the land, it has no influence on the tax incentives, a point that irked many members.
Councilwoman Kathryn F. Freed, a Democrat who represents lower Manhattan, argued against the approval, saying the Council was giving the state and city development corporations free reign to give away tax breaks for an uncertain project.
She said it made no sense to subsidize a new building while vacancy rates soaring were soaring. "This is a project that will never go forward; it will never happen," she said. "To vote yes on this project is to vote for our own loss of power."
But the majority of the Council members said that while they had misgivings about the project, they did not want to be blamed for the loss of jobs.
The project was originally to be built with $100 million in state and city grants. Two weeks ago, the city and state development corporations offered the four remaining exchanges a $60 million grant with fewer tax incentives, about $42 million over 20 years, said Carl B. Weisbrod, the president of the city Economic Development Corporation.
The four exchanges -- the Commodity Exchange, the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, the New York Cotton Exchange and the New York Futures Exchange -- have yet to respond. Ms. de Milly said the exchanges were still studying the financial underpinnings of the city's offer and had yet to decide.

HEADLINE: New Claims By Jobless Up by 15,000

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 26

 BODY:
The number of people filing new claims for unemployment benefits climbed by 15,000 in the second week of March, the Labor Department said today, pointing to what various economists say is likely to be a lackluster, slow-to-arrive recovery.
The department said 447,000 people filed for unemployment benefits in the week ended March 14, up from a revised 432,000 the previous week. It had previously put the number of new claims in the March 7 week at 433,000. 
 Wall Street economists had expected 440,000 new applications in the latest period.
"There are no signs of any strengthening in the labor force," said Kevin Flanagan, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds.
The claims numbers, said David Wyss of DRI/McGraw-Hill Inc., "were disappointing and indicated that we are certainly not out of the woods yet." He added that although claims had appeared to be declining, today's report showed that "we still have a problem."
Mr. Wyss also noted that unlike overall unemployment, jobless claims should show improvement fairly quickly as the economy began to recover.
The department said the four-week average for new claims, regarded as a more accurate measure of the number of jobless than the weekly figure, slipped to 444,000 in the latest period from 446,750.
The Labor Department said the total number of people receiving state unemployment benefits in the latest period was unavailable.
Oklahoma registered the biggest rise in new claims, with 4,124 new filings, followed by Michigan's 2,776.
Michigan said its increase in claims stemmed from layoffs in the automobile industry, reversing the trend of the previous week. Oklahoma officials did not comment.
Missouri and New York reported the largest drop in new claims, with both states reporting about 4,000 fewer filings. Missouri reported nearly 1,700 new claims the previous week because of layoffs in the food processing and transportation industries. No reason was given for the decline in New York.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices Fall on Concerns About Debt

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices fell sharply yesterday, as traders grew nervous about growing supplies of debt and several new corporate issues.
"The market has been very disappointing," said James Kenney, the trading manager at Prudential Securities Inc. in New York. "It tries to rebound, then gets hit back everytime. It's under a lot of pressure." 
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond slid 21/32 to close at 100, bringing the yield back up to 8 percent, from 7.94 percent on Wednesday.
The reversal came after two days of gains, prompted by growing signs of economic stagnation and the smooth auctions of Treasury notes.
 
Mixed Economic News
 Economic news was still favorable to the bond market. The Commerce Department revised down its growth estimate for the fourth quarter.
The Labor Depatment also reported first-time jobless claims for the March 14 week rose to 447,000, from a revised 432,000, showing employment is still under pressure.
Nonetheless, the market retreated as worries mounted about rising debt supplies.
 
Note Sale a Factor
 Traders said the aftermath of the five-year note auction on Wednesday set the tone for the day, with dealers struggling to unload paper they had acquired at the sale and had lost money on as the issue sank.
Mr. Kenney said corporate debt issues compounded the market's troubles.
The McDonnell Douglas Corporation issued a $950 million, three-part deal, far higher than the $600 million that was expected. The market was also affected by rumors that the Tennessee Valley Authority was planning a $1 billion bond issue.
The market has also been worried about a growth package out of Capitol Hill, which could force the Treasury to borrow more money to cover its budget shortfall.
 
Big Sale Causes Fall
 Traders said the longer end of the Treasury market fell early because of a large sale, possibly from a Middle Eastern investor. But buyers quickly stepped in to snap up two-year notes.
"It was not necessarily one trade, but it was one philosophical idea -- buy the front-end and sell the long-end," Mr. Kenney said.
Anthony Karydakis, the senior financial economist at the First National Bank of Chicago, said investors who had bet on a flattening yield curve between two-year notes and 30-year bonds were getting out of long positions.
The yield curve flattens out when short-term rates rise and long-term rates fall. But just the opposite occurred yesterday, as traders sold off the longer-term issues and sent rates on the 5-year, 10-year and 30-year issues higher.
Mr. Karydakis said the five-year note was at the heart of the matter, signaling problems for longer-end securities. "We have a lot of problems over the distribution of the five-years," he said. "There are no buyers."
 
3-Month Bills at 4.02%
 The bill sector ended flat. Three-month rates rose by a basis point, or one-hundredth of 1 percent, to a discount rate of 4.02 percent. Six-month rates were unchanged, at 4.16 percent, and the one-year bill was flat at 4.38 percent.
The two-year note was unchanged at 1001/32 , to yield 5.73 percent. The 7 1/2 percent 10-year note fell by 13/32 , to 9915/32 , to yield 7.58 percent.
Federal funds were trading at 4 to 4 1/8 percent late in the day, compared with the Federal Reserve's presumed 4 percent goal. The Fed added temporary reserves to the banking system at midday, as expected.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Advances Broadly; Gold Prices Decline in U.S.

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose against other major currencies yesterday, driven mostly by technically motivated buying.
Gold prices dipped in United States trading, with a troy ounce closing at $341 on the Commodity Exchange in New York, 10 cents lower than Wednesday's settlement price. Later, Republic National Bank quoted a troy ounce of gold at $340.50, 50 cents lower than the late bid on Wednesday. 
 In the currency market, the dollar's advance was more pronounced on European foreign exchange markets than at home. It finished in New York below the levels quoted late overseas but higher than Wednesday's New York finish.
Purchases of dollars abroad accelerated when the dollar moved just above 1.66 German marks, European dealers said. It finished in Europe at 1.6630 German marks, up from 1.6510 late Wednesday.
But by the time trading was done for the day in New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.6610 marks. Although below the European close, it was above late Wednesday's level of 1.6520 marks in New York.
A few weak readings on the United States economy kept the enthusiasm to buy dollars in check.
The Government pared back its estimate of overall economic growth in the final three months of last year. The gross domestic product expanded at a barely perceptible annual rate of four-tenths of 1 percent in the October-December quarter after tepid growth of 1.4 percent in the second quarter.
The Commerce Department's final look at fourth-quarter G.D.P. represented a significant downward revision from a month ago, when it estimated the economy had grown at an annual rate of eight-tenths of 1 percent.
In another report, the Labor Department said the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits climbed by 15,000 from the previous week.
The dollar finished trading in New York at 134.03 Japanese yen, up from 133.45 yen late Wednesday. But earlier in Tokyo the dollar fell 0.58 yen, to a closing 133.20 yen. It made up some lost ground in London trading and was quoted at 134.00 yen.
The dollar also strengthened against sterling, which has been weighed down by worries about the implications of the coming British election. A pound fetched $1.7245 late in New York, compared with $1.7320 late Wednesday. The pound was quoted at $1.7215 in late London dealings, a decline from $1.7320 late Wednesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates Wednesday, were: 1.5150 Swiss francs, up from 1.5015; 1,251.00 Italian lire, up from 1,245.25; 5.6340 French francs, up from 5.6025, and 1.19075 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1877.

HEADLINE: Weaker Gain For G.D.P. In a Revision

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 26

 BODY:
The United States economy edged up at an annual rate of just four-tenths of 1 percent in the final three months of last year, a pace that was even weaker than previously calculated, the Government said today.
The Commerce Department report on the gross domestic product -- the total amount of goods and services produced inside the country -- showed that the economy slowed to a near standstill at the end of last year after two quarters of weak growth. 
 The Bush Administration, however, concerned about a sluggish economy in a Presidential election year, brushed off the weak G.D.P. report and another report showing an increase in unemployment claims in the week ended March 14, preferring to point instead to more optimistic signs recently showing strength in retail sales and housing construction in January and February.
 
Brady's Explanation
 Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady told reporters that increased traffic at shopping malls and other tangible evidence rather than "bureaucratic statistics coming out of government" will be what finally convinces Americans that a recovery is under way.
"We've had a recession, and recessions are what we have in the United States, and we're on our way out of it," he told reporters.
The G.D.P. report today showed a downward revision from a month ago when the Government had estimated the economy was growing at an annual rate of eight-tenths of 1 percent in the fourth quarter. The Government's first estimate of growth in the October-December quarter put it at an annual rate of three-tenths of 1 percent, virtually the same as the third reading today.
A weaker showing in international trade and a slower buildup of unsold business goods were the main contributors to the downward revision.
The fourth-quarter revisions were not enough to change the estimate for the year that the G.D.P. fell by seven-tenths of 1 percent in 1991, the first decline since a drop of 2.2 percent during the 1982 recession.
 
Hurting Bottom Lines
 Another report today showed that the weak economy was hurting the bottom line at American corporations. The Commerce Department said that after-tax profits fell by 4.5 percent in 1991 to $188.1 billion, the poorest showing for United States companies since 1987.
A third report, from the Labor Department, showed that the number of Americans filing first-time claims for unemployment benefits jumped to 447,000 for the week ending March 14. That represented a disappointing 15,000 increase from the previous week, and analysts said it showed that widespread layoffs were continuing and that the job market remained weak.
While forecasting a pickup in economic growth this year, analysts said they remained apprehensive despite the good reports on such things as retail sales and housing construction in January and February. Many worried that the pickup might be reflecting unusually mild winter weather and would not be sustained.
 
A Pessimistic Forecast
 Michael Evans, head of a Washington economic consulting firm, said he believed that the March statistics for retail sales and housing construction would show big declines.
"People are going to get the shock of their lives when the March numbers come out," Mr. Evans said. "I believe the strength we have been seeing is all weather-related."
The economic weakness did have a beneficial side effect of lowering inflation. A price index tied to the G.D.P. showed that prices paid by United States residents were rising at an annual rate of 2.2 percent in the fourth quarter, the best showing on inflation since early 1986.
The four-tenths of 1 percent increase in G.D.P. in the fourth quarter followed anemic advances of 1.8 percent in the third quarter and 1.4 percent in the second quarter.
Those gains followed two quarterly declines as the country struggled through its first recession in nearly eight years.
The Bush Administration, which has seen the President's approval ratings plummet with the weak economy, is counting on a steadily improving economy this year.
The weak economic performance over the last three years has become a top issue in this year's Presidential campaign. Mr. Bush's opponents charge that the Administration has no clear prescription for what ails the economy.
Administration officials are forecasting that by the second half of the year the economy will be growing at an annual rate of 3 percent, which would be the fastest pace of the Bush Presidency.
Such a view is more optimistic than that of many private forecasters, who expect the G.D.P. to rise for the full year by a lackluster 1.6 percent. That would compare with a decline of seven-tenths of 1 percent in 1991.
The Democratic-controlled Congressional Joint Economic Committee said in its annual report today that the economy would be likely to turn up this year but that huge Government and private debt, plus other problems, would make the recovery the weakest on record.
For the fourth quarter, today's report showed G.D.P. rising by $5.3 billion at an annual rate to a total of $4.87 trillion, after adjusting for inflation. The biggest gain was a $12 billion rise in business inventories, although this advance was $3.3 billion below an estimate a month ago.

Who Knows How To Bring Change?

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
ECONOMIC recovery has begun, but, as this week's primary elections in Connecticut showed, voters are still anxious over the state of the economy and are looking for a President who can change it.
Knowing this, all the candidates are promising to deliver "change," in one form or other. President Bush, after more than 11 years of Republican control of the White House, blames the Democrats in Congress for the economic plight and for blocking his own proposals to cure the economy. In effect, he is saying, like President Reagan before him, "We are the change." 
 Pat Buchanan, his Republican challenger, would move his party toward the "America First" right. Jerry Brown, the Democratic victor in Connecticut by a nose, is anti-establishment and would change policy toward the left, but occasionally toward the right, as in his flat tax. And Bill Clinton, still the Democratic front-runner, proposes change toward the middle -- with tax cuts for the middle class, to be made up by tax increases on the rich.
But does anyone, politician or economist, really know how to change what's dragging the economy?
Not long ago, most economists would have said, "Of course we do," sure that John Maynard Keynes had provided the answer in his 1936 book, "The General Theory of Interest and Money." It prescribed higher government spending, tax cuts and lower interest rates for economies with idle capacity and unemployment.
But today, says Robert Heilbroner of the New School for Social Research, "Keynesian economics is dead and American capitalism is suffering from the consequences." He doubts that we will "regain our economic momentum or achieve international competitiveness until we find a successor to it."
If Keynesianism is dead, what killed it? Professor Heilbroner attributes its demise to change in the structure of the economy, especially the labor force. Back in the 1930's, he says, most workers were "unskilled or semiskilled heads of households, largely unorganized and without a public support system of any kind." So labor played a passive role in capitalism, gratefully taking whatever wages they could get. Governments could apply fiscal stimulus without worrying that it would kick off inflation while there were still workers looking for jobs.
That state of affairs changed when union membership in the United States rose from 6 percent in the 1930's to almost one-third of the labor force in the 1960's, with even greater unionization in other countries.
But the share of organized workers has actually been declining throughout the industrial world in recent decades, most of all in the United States. Here the union rolls have fallen to 18 percent, with only 12 percent of workers in the private sector union members. And, even during the high-employment years of the Reagan era, real wages stagnated.
Mr. Heilbroner rounds up other suspects in the alleged death of Keynesian economics, such as the rise of unemployment insurance and social security and the rapid globalization of finance, with credit moving from country to country seemingly at the speed of light. Such changes, he says, have made inflation "the single most feared ailment of the system." Yet he does not name as a suspect the chronic deficits of the Reagan-Bush era, which will lift the total Federal debt to $4.5 trillion by the end of the next fiscal year from less than $1 trillion in 1980.
Indeed, many economists do regard the huge deficits as a cause of the death of Keynesianism. Although politicians keep proposing tax cuts that they assert would be revenue-neutral, none has had the gall to propose fiscal stimuli that would greatly enlarge the budget deficit to spur the economy and create jobs faster.
Not all economists think Keynesianism is dead. Some, like Robert Eisner of Northwestern University and Paul Davidson of Tennessee, contend that economic policy has been unnecessarily spooked by the deficit. Mr. Davidson, writing in The New Leader, denounces "neoliberals" who argue that any fiscal stimulus will lead to inflation in the long run, calling them the laissez-faire economists of the end of the 20th century.
The neoliberals -- and many conservatives as well -- say the peace dividend should be used to cut the deficit as a means of raising national savings, long-term investment and economic growth. They would back that policy by changing budget priorities and the tax system to increase investment in education, physical capital and technology. Some even think a stronger trade union movement would spur productivity growth and could, in cooperation with business and government, help solve the nation's social, economic and environmental problems. They see America's current troubles as not primarily cyclical but as structural.
Although Keynes's famous remark, "In the long run, we are all dead," the next Keynes is likely to focus not on the short run but on how to solve industrial societies' long-run problems.

Plan to Sell Annuities

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The latest gimmick to encourage consumers to spend is a program that would turn purchases into annuities backed by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company of New York, the nation's second-largest insurer.
Consumers who enroll in a program designed by Start Inc. will see a percentage of the price of their purchases transferred to a special escrow account at the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company. 
 Once the account reaches $100, it can be converted into a Start Plus Annuity, which allows for tax-deferred savings and compounded interest through retirement. Participants can also make cash contributions in $100 increments. Withdrawals are penalized until the account owner becomes 59 1/2 years old.
But experts say that while the pitch may be another step to encourage consumers to open their wallets in a tight economy, it is not likely to work.
"Buying now and maybe getting a benefit 30 years from now?" said H. Spencer Nilson, the publisher of The Nilson Report, a newsletter based in Santa Monica, Calif. "I don't want to waste my time talking about it."
Scott Dunn, an analyst with the Life Insurance Marketing and Research Association in Farmington, Conn., said, "It's not the traditional way to sell annuities." Consumers usually buy annuities through insurance agents, banks or brokerages.
So far, participating companies include Spiegel, MCI, Club Med, Eddie Bauer, Hertz, US Travel and GE Appliances, among others.
Start Inc., a private financial services firm based in Herndon, Va., is charging consumers $25 to enroll in the program.

New Home for a Museum
The list of small American museums that have hired foreign architects to build glamorous, attention-grabbing buildings continues to grow.There was the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, whose jewel-like structure, designed by the Japanese architect Arata Isozaki, has helped raise the institution's profile. On April 8, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art is breaking ground for its new building, designed by the Swiss architect Mario Botta. And this week, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago unveiled its $55 million scheme for a classically modern, 125,000-square-foot building of glass, limestone and aluminum panels and a one-acre sculpture garden on a dramatic two-acre site overlooking Lake Michigan. It is the first American commission awarded to the Berlin architect Josef Paul Kleihues. 
 Mr. Kleihues was selected from 209 applicants solicited by the museum. "The choice had nothing to do with nationality: it was based purely on academic judgment," said Kevin E. Consey, the museum's director and chief executive officer. "The art world is a global community."
This is not Mr. Kleihues's first museum commission. The architect has also designed the Museum for Pre- and Early History in Frankfurt and the Municipal Gallery in Kornwest heim, Germany. He is currently converting the Hamburger Bahnhof train station into the Berlin Museum of Contemporary Art.
It took the Chicago museum three years of searching to find its new location, a two-acre plot between the Water Tower, a city landmark, and Lake Michigan, where the National Guard Armory now stands. The museum is moving into its slick, spacious new headquarters from a considerably smaller old building on the Near North Side. Ground-breaking for the new building is scheduled for next winter after the armory has been demolished. "This is one of the great open spaces in downtown Chicago," Mr. Consey said. "The state had declared the amory unusable even for their own purposes because it has serious structural problems." The land is being leased to the museum for $1 a year for 99 years, with the lease renewable for another 99 years. "We took up a collection and have paid for the first 99 years," Mr. Consey said.
The museum has also raised almost $44 million of the $55 million set as its campaign goal. "We're 80 percent there," Mr. Consey said, adding that $37 million has come from trustees.
The new building will give the 25-year-old institution nearly four times the space it now has to exhibit its collection of about 3,000 artworks dating from 1935 to 1992. They include large holdings of Surrealist and Minimalist art. "Essentially, we want to remain on the edge of contemporary visual culture, and that includes the performing arts," Mr. Consey said. The architect's design includes two large temporary exhibition spaces totaling 16,000 square feet, with movable ceilings ranging from 16 to 22 feet high and flexible walls. There is also 23,100 square feet of skylighted, barrel-vaulted gallery space for the museum's permanent collection. The new design also includes a 350-seat auditorium, classrooms and a 15,000-volume library.
The sculpture garden has been designed on a raised, 16-foot limestone platform facing the lake. Parking is tucked underneath. "We don't have a great sculpture collection just now," Mr. Consey said. "But it will provide the motivation to work on it."
 
31 Old Masters for Sale
 The J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif., is selling 31 Italian Old Master paintings dating from the 14th to the 17th century. They will be auctioned on May 21 at Christie's in New York. Together, the paintings are expected to fetch $1.8 million to $2.6 million.
That sum is insignificant compared to the major purchases this rich institution has made over the years, including a painting by the 16th-century artist Jacopo Pontormo for $35.2 million, bought three years ago. Art-world experts say they think the sale of these paintings this spring will help pay for Titian's "Venus and Adonis," which the museum is reportedly hoping to buy from the London dealers Hazlitt Godden & Fox, who purchased it with the London and New York dealer Herman Shickman for $13.47 million at Christie's in London last December.
While Getty officials won't say exactly what they intend to do with the money raised from the sale or confirm that they are interested in the Titian, George Goldner, the museum's curator of paintings and drawings, said all the money would be applied to future acquisitions of paintings. "We haven't exhibited these pictures for many years," he said. "And we're not anticipating to in the new museum." (The Getty is building a $500 million complex in Brentwood, Calif., scheduled to be completed in four years.)
Included in the Christie's sale are Paris Bordone's portrait of a courtesan, with a pre-sale estimate of $200,000 to $300,000; a painting of Ceres by Guillaume Courtois and Abraham Brueghel, expected to fetch $100,000 to $150,000; "Madonna and Child With St. James the Elder and St. Prosdociumus" by Pietro Marescalchi, expected to bring $80,000 to $120,000, and Pierto Paolini's "Lute Players," which is expected to fetch $100,000 to $150,000.
"Many of these artists are not household names," said Ian Kennedy, Christie's director of Old Master collections. "But among experts they are considered important."
That the paintings have been owned by the Getty, Mr. Kennedy said, would also have international appeal. "It's a name that has glamour," he said, "especially to Europeans."
 
A Franklin Furnace Gift
 Franklin Furnace, the avant-garde space in TriBeCa known for helping to launch such performing artists as Karen Finley and Eric Bogosian, reported this week that it had been awarded $25,000 by the Peter Norton Family Foundation. The money was badly needed, the organization says. Last month, the National Endowment for the Arts rejected Franklin Furnace's application for a $25,000 grant, saying that a sexually explicit tape of the performance artist Scarlet O, which Franklin Furnace submitted with its application, had no artistic merit.
"We also have a verbal confirmation from the Art Dealers Association of America for a $10,000 grant," said Martha Wilson, the director of Franklin Furnace. "This is a sign that there are groups and individuals who can see through the political charade of the National Endowment."
Anne Etheridge, the executive director of the Los Angeles-based Norton Foundation, said the board was not trying to make a political statement by supporting Franklin Furnace. "This is a larger gift than we usually give," she said. "But we felt the institution and their reputation made it worthwhile."
Unlike the National Endowment, which requires an elaborate application and review process, the Norton Foundation has few formalities. "A page-and-a-half letter is fine," Ms. Etheridge said. "We believe in being user-friendly." Since its inception three years ago, the foundation has supported the arts as well as issues involving women and children.
"Franklin Furnace is an important force in helping emerging artists," Ms. Etheridge said. "So our grant can be looked at as an advocacy gift."
 
Artforum Cutting Back
 As Artforum's 30th birthday approaches, the magazine is experiencing both personnel changes and cutbacks. Ida Panicelli, who has been the editor for the last four and a half years, has resigned. She will stay on the masthead as a contributing editor but will begin to do more writing.
"I'm not ready to talk about my next move yet," Ms. Panicelli said. She will be replaced by Jack Bankowsky, the associate editor. Meanwhile, Deborah Drier, who was one of two senior editors, was let go last week; she, too, will become a contributing editor. "The luxury of the last few years is over," explained Anthony Korner, Artforum's publisher. "All art magazines are down about a third in advertising, and we simply needed to economize."
Asked about reports that Artforum will undergo a drastic editorial transformation under its new editor, Mr. Bankowsky said: "Things won't change radically. Editorially, we will try to broaden our audience. I want to do away with the kind of academic writing that gives art magazines a bad name."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Landrum, Cut by Pirates, Joins Yanks for a Tryout

BYLINE: By JACK CURRY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., March 26

 BODY:
Bill Landrum has a glove, cleats and a truck full of gas. He is searching for a job. Still stunned over his release by the Pittsburgh Pirates last Thursday, the 33-year-old relief pitcher auditioned for the Yankees today.
Of the 10 clubs who expressed interest in Landrum, the Yankees were the first to ask him to pitch. Landrum obliged by throwing for 12 minutes and then underwent a magnetic reasonance imaging of his right knee as part of a medical examination. 
 The results of the test were not expected until later tonight, delaying any prospective negotiations between Landrum and the Yankees.
"I wouldn't be standing here if I didn't think this was a good fit," said Bob Gilhooley, Landrum's agent. "We want to get this done as soon as we can."
 
Michael: Let's Talk
 If the M.R.I. does not reveal any damage, General Manager Gene Michael said the Yankees wanted to negotiate with Landrum and sign him quickly. Michael said any decision about Landrum would be made by Friday. The Yankees are being cautious because Landrum has had operations on both knees.
Landrum is a versatile pitcher who was 13-10 with 56 saves and a 2.39 earned run average for the Pirates over the last three years. He unexpectedly became unemployed when Pittsburgh released him to open a roster spot for Miguel Batista, a 21-year-old minor league pitcher.
By releasing Landrum, however, the Pirates had to pay him only a fourth of his $1.7 million salary. He is preparing to file a grievance, which will assert that the team waived him to save money and not because of performance.
"It hit me like a brick in the face," said Landrum, who spent 10 years in the minor leagues before becoming a mainstay in the Pirate bullpen.
Signing Landrum would give the Yankees an abundance of right-handed relief pitchers because they already have Steve Farr, a competent closer, and John Habyan, perhaps the best setup man in the league. Landrum, who has only started two games in his career, said he feels he could start. But he is more likely to inherit Greg Cadaret's bullpen role since Cadaret, a left-hander, is ticketed for the starting rotation.
Joseph Molloy, the team's acting managing partner, said that should the Yankees eventually sign Landrum, it would not mean they were finished shopping for pitchers. They are still talking seriously with at least six teams and their interest is apparently focused on Milwaukee's Chris Bosio and San Diego's Jose Melendez.
"Things will be heating up in the next three or four days," Molloy said. "Our scouts have seen pitchers we are interested in and now we have to zero in on what we're going to do."
 
INSIDE PITCH
 The uncertainty ended for JEFF JOHNSON when he was finally named to be part of the Yankees' starting rotation. Johnson sealed his spot on Tuesday after he shackled the Atlanta Braves on two hits through six innings. "Just to hear it come out of his mouth was a big relief," said Johnson, after getting the word from BUCK SHOWALTER. The manager did not specify whether Johnson would be the team's third, fourth or fifth starter.
GENE MICHAEL feels he has addressed the third base problem with CHARLIE HAYES and HENSLEY MEULENS because he has no interest in KEVIN SEITZER, who was released on Thursday by Kansas City. "It would be difficult for us," Michael said. "The two guys have played pretty well." . . . Quirky statistic: In 232 games against 1,335 batters, BILL LANDRUM has not made an error or hit a batter. Quirkier statistic: The Yankees, behind six shut-out innings by Melido Perez, defeated the Montreal Expos, 5-2, and raised their spring exhibition record to 13-9.
 
 
Royals Release Seitzer
HAINES CITY, Fla., March 26 (AP) -- The Kansas City Royals released infielder Kevin Seitzer and will be obligated to pay only $401,785 of his $1.625 million salary. Seitzer has until 2 P.M. Tuesday to clear waivers. If he is not claimed, he will become a free agent.
Seitzer replaced George Brett at third base in 1987 and batted a career-high .323. His average has gone down each year since.
Bothered by sore knees that required surgery in the off season, Seitzer batted .265 in a career-low 85 games last year. He has fully recovered from the knee problem after having arthroscopic surgery, but lost his starting third-base job to the former Mets infielder Gregg Jefferies this spring.

HEADLINE: Mr. Brown's Flat Tax: Tilted

 BODY:
Taking Jerry Brown seriously means taking his flat tax proposal seriously. Needlessly, he's made that hard to do. By being careless, the former California Governor has bent a good idea out of shape. He could fix it, but until he does, Bill Clinton is right to attack the plan as a budget-buster and a dagger aimed at poor families.
Mr. Brown's basic idea -- creating a simplified code that encourages saving -- is exactly right. But he ignores all-important details. The tragedy is that his cavalier attitude has armed his critics to denounce the one truly creative and important idea to emerge from this Presidential campaign. 
 The present tax code is riddled with wasteful contradictions and complexity. For example, profit from corporate investment is taxed twice -- when earned by the corporation and again when distributed to shareholders. That powerfully discourages savings and investment -- the exact opposite of what the economy needs to grow.
The remedy is, in a word, integration, meshing personal and corporate codes so that the brunt of taxes falls on consumption, not saving. Tax reform should also simplify the code, making loopholes harder for Congress to disguise, and enact. And for reasons of elemental decency, tax reform shouldn't come at the expense of the poor.
Remarkably, there is a reform that achieves all these objectives. Robert Hall and Alvin Rabushka, economists at the Hoover Institution, have proposed an integrated code that applies a single rate to both personal and corporate income. Their plan wipes away most deductions and exemptions, permitting a low tax rate of 19 percent. The important term is not flat but integrated.
Under the Hall-Rabushka plan, individuals would pay taxes on earnings and corporations would pay tax on interest, dividends and profits. That way, every dollar of income would be taxed once and only once. The plan would subsidize saving, and create an exemption that would protect the poor.
For that very good reason, Hall-Rabushka isn't perfectly flat. But it is perfectly simple; the tax return would fit on a postcard.
Jerry Brown borrowed some of the elements of Hall-Rabushka. He too would eliminate wasteful exemptions, adopt a single rate and favor saving by exempting corporate investment. But at that point, he turns glib.
He would impose on corporations a value-added tax, similar to a national sales tax. That eliminates the elegant symmetry of Hall-Rabushka. Indirectly, Mr. Brown's variation would tax some income twice -- which is why his supposed 13 percent rate would collect revenue equal to about 20 percent of total income.
Mr. Brown's plan would also eliminate Hall-Rabushka's low-income exemption. That makes his reform even more unfair. The value-added tax, acting as sales tax, would drive up consumer prices regressively. The poor, unlike the rich, must spend most of their income on necessities.
With even a little thought, Mr. Brown could have averted these disabling details. He could have built in exemptions, credits and progressive rates to ease burdens on low- and middle-income families. He could have raised rates high enough to make his plan truly revenue neutral. And he could have followed Hall-Rabushka closely enough to produce a truly integrated code.
But for no obvious reason, he has done none of these things. He may go on contending that his campaign represents poor and alienated voters. But as it stands, his version of a superb idea turns the tax tables against them.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
Bush Report Card

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
Polls now show that Americans have more confidence in Democrats than in President Bush on every issue except foreign policy. A solid majority still sees him as a real pro on world affairs.
Which means Mr. Bush will try to capitalize on this advantage in the campaign. Which means the Democratic contender has no choice but to counter that the old pro is overrated. 
 Which led me to consult with the best minds -- Republicans, Democrats, liberals and conservatives -- to prepare this Bush report card.
The Old Soviet Union: Very slow to pick up on Mikhail Gorbachev's determination to reform the old empire. But when he got the picture, did a solid job of building up Gorby's stature and prodding him on. Then slow again to realize time to switch to Boris Yeltsin, though no harm done. Grade: B+
The Ex-Soviet Republics: Criticized justly for not being fast enough to aid democracy and capitalism in the new states. And certainly has not done well at organizing Western aid efforts. But sensible in not trying to do more than possible with a chaotic situation. Has focused on the right priority -- trying to insure that nuclear weapons don't fall into the wrong hands. Grade: B
Prewar Iraq: Overwhelming evidence now that he tried to please and appease Saddam Hussein long after the dictator had showed his true, evil colors. Actively kept helping Saddam with credits and intelligence up to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Opposed legislators who wanted to get tough, though most experts don't look good in hindsight either. Grade: F
The War Against Iraq: After two weeks of confusion, a masterful job. Grade: A
Postwar Iraq: Inexplicably foolish about not letting the war continue for another 48 hours to mop up Iraq's military capability. But right not to go on to Baghdad and take on that headache. Inexcusably didn't prevent Iraqi air power from devastating Kurds and Shiites. Has managed the situation since then intelligently. Grade: C+/B-
Mideast: Very skillful engineering of the first real Arab-Israeli peace talks. Nurtured ties with Arabs well. Was right to get tough with Israel about settlements in the occupied territories, but bullheadedly wrong in not sustaining sanctity of the overall American-Israeli democratic alliance. Grade: B
China: Terrible on human rights and too protective of Chinese dictators. But doing a delicate balancing act in a difficult situation where the U.S. needs Chinese restraint in selling arms and nuclear know-how. Grade: C+/B-
German Reunification and NATO: Slow to recognize change, but then deft in handling a major geopolitical transformation. Properly attentive to keeping Germany in the Western alliance and the U.S. in Europe militarily. Grade: A-
Japan: Good instincts on trade and Japanese sensibilities, except for the horribly conceived recent visit with Big Three auto makers. Lacks strategy. Grade: B-
Panama: Waged a questionable war to capture Manuel Noriega, then let that sad country once again become a drug haven and money-laundering center. Grade: F
Free Trade: Good anti-protectionist rhetoric on GATT and decent leadership on opening up trade in North America. But spends far too little time on these critical and difficult matters. Grade: B-/C+
New Agenda Issues: Depressingly inattentive and insensitive here. Doesn't seem to realize that foreign economic policy is now at the center of world politics. No sense of the need to adapt foreign policy and machinery of government accordingly. Inexcusably dragging his feet on U.N. efforts to stem global warming and other environmental threats. Still spending too much on interdiction of drugs rather than treatment at home. Has done little to promote energy security. Not enough backing for U.N. peacekeeping operations, but better than Congress. Grade: D
Over All: Good instincts and judgment about the familiar, old cold war problems. Particularly solid at managing crises that flow from those relationships. But without much sense of overarching strategy and sometimes blind to the sea changes under way. Much more attuned to the passing era of balance-of-power politics than to the coming world where policies need to transcend national boundaries and perspectives. Final grade: B- and sinking.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: President's Health;
Doctor Says Bush's Health Is Fine But Advises a Break From Stress

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 26

 BODY:
President Bush emerged from an annual medical check-up today with a declaration from his doctor that he was in "perfect" health. But in an unusual postscript, the doctor went out of his way to say that three years of the presidency had put Mr. Bush under great stress and that he needed to reduce his hectic schedule and take vacations more often.
In an interview, the doctor, Burton J. Lee 3d, said Mr. Bush needed a place where he "can go for a few days of peace and quiet so his engine can come back in balance from the incredible pace that he normally keeps." 
 Dr. Lee said the President was not depressed or under too much stress. He said Mr. Bush "handles stress far better than the rest of us." Nevertheless, he said, "the stress of the job has to get to him, and it is my job to see that it does not get to him in a way that it is bothersome to him in his functioning."
In the past, questions have been raised about whether the President's occasionally tangled syntax could relate to his physical state. Reporters have often noticed that when Mr. Bush gets tired, as on long foreign trips or in the heat of campaign forays, his sentences are sometimes muddled. As he tires, he sometimes seems to go into a kind of overdrive; the pitch of his voice rises and his gestures become more animated.
But the White House has consistently said that Mr. Bush, who will be 68 years old in June, was in robust health and as recently as this week told reporters that he was not unusually fatigued by his schedule.
 
Prescription for Privacy
 In speaking out, Dr. Lee raised more openly an issue he has spoken about since he became Mr. Bush's doctor: getting his patient to relax. Dr. Lee said he was becoming increasingly aware that Mr. Bush could not get away and cannot decompress. "It's a major problem," he said. "If the stress level builds up too high you start not becoming as effective as you were. It is at that point that most of us go on vacation for awhile."
"My prescription is for us to try to find a place where the man can get some privacy," Dr. Lee said, adding that Mr. Bush needed to go somewhere other than Camp David, where his working habits are much like those of the White House. He said he was working with the White House chief of staff, Samuel K. Skinner, and other officials to find such a place.
"You have to get away, to relax, to get a change of pace, to let your hair down, come out in old clothes without someone taking a telephoto picture of you, to be able to swear a little if you shank a shot on the golf course, and this guy does not have many opportunities to do that," Dr. Lee said.
But Dr. Lee said he doubted that Mr. Bush would accept the prescription, particularly in an election year and when the country is in economic trouble. "That has a bad image," Dr. Lee said.
 
'Perfect, No Surprises'
 Mr. Bush told reporters that his check-up at Bethesda Naval Medical Center was "perfect" and "everything was normal."
Dr. Lee agreed, saying the results of an extensive examination were "perfect, no surprises."
Noting that people differ in their idiosyncracies and reactions to everyday problems, Dr. Lee said:
"World crises don't bother this fellow as much as smaller things. When you are a friend of his you can pick up on those, and that is the kind of thing you want to try to intercede to help him with."
Dr. Lee said he refused to violate the confidentiality of his role as doctor and friend to Mr. Bush to provide specific examples.
But he said: "If you are dealing with anybody who is facing a lot of stress, after a while the joy goes out of life a little bit. As a friend of his, I am aware when this guy is not having any fun any more, and that is the time to try to pull it up short."
 
Weekend Work
 Dr. Lee said that although Mr. Bush could relax at Camp David on weekends and at his summer home in Kennebunkport, Maine, those retreats were still too confining.
"Camp David is in the system and he is completely surrounded by the military and Secret Service, and he is usually at his desk at 7 in the morning on Saturdays and Sundays," Dr. Lee said. "You have to have a rest from that."
At Kennebunkport, Dr. Lee said, "he enjoys it as much as any place he goes, he likes his grandchildren around, going out on the porch facing the ocean, and he considers that to be a vacation, but that is not what I am talking about."
But, he went on, "the press sits right outside the gate, and so when he goes running, shopping, sees friends or out to the dinner, everyone is right on him."
Dr. Lee has accompanied Mr. Bush on many of his trips to 33 foreign countries and said he had noticed that "no other world leader is subjected to a fraction of the pressure that an American President is put through."
 
Heart Is Normal
 In today's checkup, tests showed that Mr. Bush's heart and thyroid were normal. Last May, Mr. Bush spent two days in Bethesda Naval Medical Center after he suffered an erratic heart beat while jogging. The heart rhythm abnormality, atrial fibrillation, was traced to an overactive thyroid from Graves' disease.
Radioactive treatment in May 1991 for Graves' disease destroyed most of Mr. Bush's thyroid gland, and he now takes 0.15 milligrams daily of Synthroid as replacement therapy. Mr. Bush also takes a baby aspirin every other day, as do hundreds of thousands of other Americans to help stave off a heart attack. They are the only medications Mr. Bush takes on a regular basis, Dr. Lee said.
Last October, Mr. Bush underwent extensive cardiac tests -- including echocardiograms, a stress exercise test and a prolonged electrocardiogram -- to check for heart rhythm abnormalities. They were normal and some were not repeated today, Dr. Lee said.
Doctors used liquid nitrogen to remove four small, non-cancerous skin growths from Mr. Bush's face today. The growths, called keratosis, often follow prolonged sun exposure and can become cancerous if left untreated.
"The president's physical checkup this morning showed no evidence of skin cancer," Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said. He spoke about the skin procedure only after a photographer noticed the spots and reporters asked him about them.

Car Loan Bargain Days

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
This may be the time to think about buying a new car, because interest rates on car loans have been falling steadily. According to the Bank Rate Monitor, the nationwide average fixed rate for a four-year car loan is 10.19 percent, well below 12.55 percent in 1989 (the highest in the nine years since deregulation), and 11.96 percent a year ago. Here is a table that shows average rates and costs of a $10,000 four-year fixed-rate loan from three different types of lending institution.

HEADLINE: China Is Warned Not to Veto Plan To Place U.N. Sanctions on Libya

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, March 27

 BODY:
After voicing opposition to a plan to impose Security Council sanctions on Libya, China has been warned by the United States, Britain and France that it will risk losing trade preferences from the United States and seriously damage relations with the other two countries if Beijing vetoes a resolution on the sanctions.
Because of China's opposition and a desire to drum up maximum support within the 15-nation Council, the vote, originally expected today, is now scheduled to take place on Monday, diplomats said.
 
Abstention Is Expected
 But as a result of the warnings, delivered here and in Beijing, diplomats from the United States, Britain and France said they were now confident that China would abstain in next week's crucial Council vote, allowing them to impose a mandatory air-travel embargo against the Government of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi starting on April 15. 
 The sanctions vote is being taken because of Libya's refusal to surrender two intelligence agents accused by Washington and London of playing a role in the bombing of a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988 with the loss of 270 lives.
In addition, France wants Libya to send four men for questioning by a judge investigating the bombing of a French airliner over the Sahara in 1989 with the loss of 170 lives.
The stiffest resistance to the sanctions plan, diplomats say, has come from China, which says it opposes such Security Council sanctions against individual countries on principle.
As a permanent Council member, Beijing has a veto on all decisions. Whether it will use its veto to defend Libya is a subject of debate among diplomats here. Many diplomats call that unlikely, since China has cast only three vetoes in the history of the United Nations, and the last two of those occurred 20 years ago.
Nevertheless, to insure that China does not block the sanctions plan, diplomats say, Washington warned Beijing of an explosion of anger in the United States and pressure on President Bush to hold back the most-favored-nation tariff treatment that he has just got through Congress over sharp opposition.
As a result, the three countries backing the sanctions plan are now reasonably certain at least 11 of the Council's 15 members will vote for moving against Libya, with China abstaining and Morocco, Zimbabwe and perhaps India following suit or voting against.
Last summer, Congress tried but failed to cancel China's favorable trade status. This month it failed again to find the votes to override a Presidential veto against a bill imposing conditions on the renewal of low tariffs when they expire this summer.
 
Qaddafi Aids U.N. Effort
 The campaign to impose an air embargo on Tripoli has also been helped by Colonel Qaddafi's erratic response to the Security Council's call for Libyan cooperation, which seriously embarrassed the Arab League and Morocco, the Council's only Arab member.
This week a high-level Arab League team, including the Foreign Ministers of Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia and Mauritania, went to Tripoli in the belief that Colonel Qaddafi would ask them to take the two Libyans accused of blowing up Pan Am jet and hand them over for trial by Britain or the United States. But the talks broke down in confusion.
Under the latest draft resolution prepared by the United States, Britain and France, the Council will order all countries starting April 15 to suspend flights to and from Libya, block sales of planes and spare parts and impose an embargo on arms deliveries. Countries must also reduce the size of Libyan diplomatic missions and restrict diplomats' movements.
The United States and its allies modified a number of provisions in their draft resolution to meet objections from other Council members.
 
Sanction Reviews
 Morocco, with backing from other Islamic countries, persuaded the Council to delay the start of sanctions until the middle of next month, partly to give Colonel Qaddafi more time to hand over the Libyan suspects, but also because they did not want them to take effect during the three-day feast of Eid al-Fitr around April 3 marking the end of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of prayer and fasting.
The sanctions would be reviewed every 120 days so the Council can consider lifting them. But the Islamic countries failed to alter the resolution to spell out more clearly what Colonel Qaddafi is expected to do to show that he has renounced terrorism.
In its original wording, the draft resolution called vaguely for the Libyan leader to give concrete evidence that he no longer supports terrorism. Some Council members said that requirement could allow the United States to maintain sanctions indefinitely by making increasingly difficult demands on Libya.
The revised draft also softens the provisions requiring countries to restrict the movement of Libyan diplomats, which created problems for Austria since Vienna serves as host for a number of United Nations agencies, including the International Atomic Energy Agency.
The new draft also allows countries hurt economically by the sanctions to apply to the Council for compensation under Article 50 of the United Nations Charter. Egypt and other poorer Muslim countries fear that thousands of their nationals working in Libya may be expelled if they cut air links.
"Once the sanctions are in place, lifting them is a rather complex operation," Diego Arria of Venezuela, the current president of the Security Council, said tonight.

HEADLINE: WHITE HOUSE DROPS BARRIER TO BUYING SOVIET TECHNOLOGY

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 27

 BODY:
In a departure from policies that had restricted East-West trade, the White House announced today that it had cleared the way for the American purchase of major high technologies from the former Soviet Union.
The go-ahead for the space and nuclear purchases, which total $14 million, was characterized by the White House as a bold first step in what would be a substantial aid package to Russia. While this was presented as a major objective, it was also clear that the goods being acquired were extremely valuable and were being offered at bargain prices. 
 Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d yesterday delivered to the President his proposal for an omnibus bill that would put together all of the Administration's ideas for supporting free-market reforms in the Commonwealth of Independent States.
 
Bush Weighing Proposal
 Mr. Bush is now considering the proposal, and Mr. Baker is consulting with Congressional leaders on how best to get it approved at a time when foreign aid is unpopular.
The high-technology action comes after rising criticism of East-West trade barriers and charges of Administration foot dragging on aid to Russia, including pointed statements by such prominent cold warriors as Richard M. Nixon and Ronald Reagan.
The announcement today represented the cheapest and least politically painful part of the overall aid package. It left the Administration still facing the most difficult decisions, from the standpoint of both policy and politics, including how much to contribute to a proposed fund to stablize the ruble.
 
Purchases for Study
 Under the action announced today, the Pentagon will purchase a Russian Topaz 2 nuclear reactor for space power and four Hall thrusters for moving objects in space. Both devices are to be studied on the ground. The reactor comes without nuclear fuel. Hall thrusters use electricity rather than chemical fuels for generating thrust.
In addition, the Energy Department will buy plutonium-238 to build nuclear batteries for a new generation of deep-space probes.
The Topaz 2 is about 12 feet long and generates about 6,000 watts of electricity, or slightly less than the amount used by a half-dozen kitchen toasters. That power is enough, however, to energize many types of spacecraft.
Hall thrusters are tiny but powerful engines, the smallest ones being able to fit into the palm of a human hand. They have been used by the Russians to adjust the orbits of satellites already in space, and are too weak to be of any use in lofting spacecraft into orbit from the earth's surface.
Such purchases were unthinkable a few years ago, and Western intelligence agencies at one time would have probably paid billions of dollars to get their hands on a Topaz 2, which is similar to ones used to power Soviet spy satellites.
"These transactions clearly signal our desire to normalize trade with the new states," Mr. Fitzwater said.
On high-tech trade, private experts and some Federal officials have argued that the American acquisition of Moscow's best technologies could save Washington and industry many billions of dollars in development costs, ease Russia's economic woes, aid a fledgling democracy and discourage Russian scientists, engineers and technologists from taking jobs with third-world tyrants.
 
Worry About Military Might
 Previously, the Administration had worried that high-technology sales could also help keep Moscow's military-industrial complex alive. As a result, it quietly blocked the American purchase of rocket engines, space reactors and other aerospace goods from the former Soviet Union in order to cripple the complex and reduce future threats to the United States.
Today, White House officials said the move to buy a limited number of high technologies from Russia was meant to show political boldness during an election year, although opponents noted the modest action came only after considerable prodding by a chorus of prominent critics.
It was not clear from today's announcement whether the end of the prohibition on purchases applied to all high-tech Russian goods or just select ones. However, Marlin Fitzwater, President Bush's spokesman, said at a White House briefing that the United States was "moving to eliminate restrictions that prevented normal trade during the cold war."
 
'Significantly Lower Cost'
 He said the purchase of the Topaz 2 reactor, for some $8 million, "will give us access to new technology at a significantly lower cost than if we were to try to develop it ourselves." Private experts have estimated that such a program would cost several hundred million dollars.
In recent months and years, virtually the entire Russian arsenal and space program has gone on the auction block, often at fire-sale prices.
American experts have been particularly tantalized by high-technology items relating to rocketry and space, in which the Soviets often excelled. Many of these Russian items are not even made in the West.
Mr. Fitzwater downplayed the idea of a fire-sale bonanza, instead characterizing the purchases as the opening of a new era in East-West relations.
Steven Aftergood, a senior analyst with the Federation of American Scientists, a private group based in Washington, said the White House action was more important for what it symbolized than it did.
"It's the first opening in the exchange of high technology and hopefully a beginning of the normalization of relations," he said, adding that the Administration had apparently taken some two years to make up its mind about buying the Topaz 2.
"It's disturbing that it's taken this long for what should have been a simple transaction," he said.
Like the Topaz, the American purchase of Soviet plutonium-238 had been under consideration for years, mainly by mid-level Federal officials. Discussions began in 1989 and were all but completed in 1991 when the deal came to an abrupt halt. For nearly a year, it has languished in bureaucratic limbo as the Administration considered a relaxation of cold war policies.
Plutonium-238 is a man-made radioactive isotope that gives off heat that can be used to generate electricity. It is very different from its cousin, plutonium-239, which is used to make nuclear bombs.
The Energy Department will use the plutonium-238 to make nuclear batteries for American deep-space probes, which travel to distant parts of the solar system where sunlight is too dim to excite solar-power panels.
On the overall aid package, senior Administration officials said the proposal Mr. Baker delivered to Mr. Bush is based on the idea of getting one ominibus bill through Congress that would give the Administration authorization for all the programs it believes are necessary -- and affordable -- to assist Russia and other republics.
The proposed bill includes $12 billion for replenishing the International Monetary Fund so it can put together a package that will cover the $17 billion gap between imports and exports in Russia this year. The $12 billion would not cost the Treasury anything since it is largely a bookkeeping arrangement with the I.M.F.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Foreign Policy;
Clinton Uses Loose Circle of Advisers

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 27

 BODY:
Even at this stage in the Presidential campaign, Gov. Bill Clinton's foreign policy advisory team is still a loose collection of unpaid volunteers, distinguished by the absence of any single dominating guru and by the presence of a spectrum of traditional Democratic Party hawks and doves.
The unusually loose arrangement for advising Mr. Clinton on foreign affairs is no accident. In part it is a reflection of a campaign still primarily focused on domestic issues. In part it is a reflection of Mr. Clinton's own thinking that "we can no longer afford to have separate foreign and domestic policies," since economic policies at home increasingly determine any President's reach abroad. And in part it is a deliberate attempt by the candidate to defuse the ideological feuds between the Henry Jackson-type conservatives and George McGovern-type liberals that have dogged the Democratic Party since the beginning of the cold war. 
 "What Clinton is trying to do is to construct a foreign policy that can first bring the Democratic Party together and then the country," said Anthony Lake, director of policy planning at the State Department in the Carter Administration and the man who has been coordinating the foreign policy advice that goes to Mr. Clinton.
 
'Ideological Arguments Over'
 "In the 1970's and 1980's, every four years we refought the Vietnam War within the party," Mr. Lake said. "Every position a candidate took was a victory for either the conservative wing or the liberal wing. With the end of the cold war, those ideological arguments are finally over. This means the center has widened enormously -- in the party and in the country -- and we want to keep expanding that middle."
That inclusive approach to foreign policy goes for Mr. Clinton's advisers as well. The structure that the Arkansas Democrat has set up begins with Mr. Lake, working out of his office at Mount Holyoke College, where he is a professor of international relations, armed with a phone and a fax machine, and fans out from there into three circles.
Mr. Lake heads a volunteer working group that consists of out-of-power Democratic foreign policy "wise men" from the Carter Administration and new-wave party foreign policy thinkers who were still in graduate school when Jimmy Carter was President. They are Samuel Berger, David L. Aaron and Richard C. Holbrooke -- all former Carter Administration officials now working in the private sector -- and Janne E. Nolan, a defense specialist at the Brookings Institution; Michael Mandelbaum, an expert on East-West issues at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, and Will Marshall from the Progressive Policy Institute, a centrist Democratic research center.
This working group pulled together Mr. Clinton's first major foreign policy address, delivered Dec. 11 at Georgetown University, and provides him with daily advice and papers on major foreign policy issues.
"If you look at the people working with Clinton on foreign policy, it is hard to summarize where they stand philosophically for the same reason that it is difficult to summarize the new world -- nobody has figured it out yet," Mr. Mandelbaum said. "I think what the group has in common is a conviction that this is a new world, and that we need someone who can think about it in a new way."
Along with the core working group is what Mr. Lake calls the "consulting group," another loose collection that both advises the working group and speaks to Mr. Clinton regularly on its own. This group consists of Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee; Representative Dave McCurdy of Oklahoma, chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence; Representative Stephen J. Solarz of Brooklyn, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Asia; Representative Lee H. Hamilton of Indiana, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Europe and the Middle East; Warren M. Christopher, former Carter Administration Deputy Secretary of State, and Richard N. Gardner, Ambassador to Rome under Mr. Carter
Beyond this circle, Mr. Lake said, are "at least 100 and growing" experts in various specific foreign policy issues, from South Africa to United Nations resolutions on Iraq, who will provide specific answers or position papers for the Clinton campaign. This group of 100 includes academics, friendly Congressional staff members -- many of whose own bosses have not endorsed Mr. Clinton -- and others sprinkled throughout the Government and private business.
"Clinton likes to tap a lot of resources," Mr. McCurdy said. "No one or two people have a lock on shaping his views on foreign policy. Sometimes he'll call me, and we'll talk over a policy. Sometimes I will call him or his staff and say they need to be on top of this developing issue. Clinton understands that he needs to have a strong and credible foreign policy component, because when the economy improves, the foreign policy debate is going to come back."
It is with that in mind that Mr. Clinton is planning a second major foreign policy address in New York on April 1, at the Foreign Policy Association. Aides say he will use that address to put into much more specific terms his previously very general and vague support for aiding Russia to make the transition to a free-market democracy.
In a way, Mr. Clinton and President Bush are now in a race. Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, prodded in part by criticism from former President Richard M. Nixon, is also trying to put together a more serious package of support for Russia. It, too, could be revealed sometime next week, and it will be interesting to see who gets his on the table first.
As for some of the other foreign policy issues of the day, Mr. Clinton has argued that he "certainly would support" the use of force against Iraq again "if that were the only way to stop the development of nuclear capacity."
On the question of whether to extend loan gurantees to Israel, Mr. Clinton has adopted the politically comfortable position that he is both for the loan guarantees and for upholding longstanding American policy that views settlement building by Israel as an obstacle to peace.

HEADLINE: Cuomo, Citing Economic Issues, Cancels Quebec Power Contract

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 27

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo today abruptly cut short negotiations with the Quebec Government and canceled a 20-year contract to buy power from a giant hydroelectric complex that Quebec wants to build in the Canadian sub-Arctic.
The Governor said that New York did not need the power and that it would be cheaper to rely on energy conservation and other energy sources instead. State energy officials said consumers could actually pay less because of the move. 
 The decision represents a severe setback for Quebec, for which $12 billion in expected payments from New York was critical capital for financing the controversial project, many analysts said, and even for bolstering the province's balance of trade if it ever secedes from Canada.
Although Quebec officials insisted today that they intended to go ahead with the project in the remote James Bay region, the analysts said the decision is almost certain, at a minimum, to delay construction for several years.
The announcement by Governor Cuomo and the New York Power Authority Chairman Richard M. Flynn was hailed as a major victory by environmentalists and native leaders in Canada, who said the project would devastate the James Bay wilderness and destroy the way of life of the Cree Indians who live there.
But in a statement Mr. Cuomo released today, he said the decision was made primarily on economic grounds, not on environmental questions, which he said were ultimately up to Canadian officials anyway. New York energy analysts calculated that signing the Quebec contracts would actually be slightly more expensive for New York consumers than relying on conservation and other energy sources, including natural gas. The state was to start receiving the power in 1995.
 
A Landmark Decision
 Perhaps more fundamentally, several analysts said the New York decision was something of a landmark since it represented one of the first times that government officials had undertaken a large-scale economic review that compared the value of energy conservation against large-scale energy purchases.
"The economic arguments just were piling up," said David R. Wooley, a law professor at Pace University's Center for Environmental Legal Studies. "It's a case where environmentalists used the power of the marketplace to halt a destructive project. Conservation competes very well when you give it a chance."
Governor Cuomo said that he had recommended canceling the contract, which was done today by the New York Power Authority without penalty under an escape clause written into the 1989 agreement, "because I have concluded that the power is not required and the price is uneconomic."
Mr. Flynn said that the Power Authority had significantly increased its projections in recent years about the role that conservation would play in meeting energy demand.
The authority estimated this year that there would be an average annual increase of just six-tenths of 1 percent in the state's peak demand for electricity between now and 2007, down significantly from a projection of 1.1 percent at the time the contracts were signed three years ago.
At the same time, Mr. Flynn said that there were greatly increased estimates of the role that independent, or non-utility, power generators were expected to play in supplying the state's electricity.
Although there were many indications in the last year that New York might shy away from the contract, the timing of Mr. Cuomo's decision clearly stunned both advocates and opponents of the hydropower, because the state was not required to make a final decision until Nov. 30.
New York was expected to use the time to bargain with Hydro-Quebec, the provincial utility in Quebec, for a reduced price that could have made the power far more attractive. The state was looking for a discount of 30 percent or more.
But Mr. Cuomo's chief adviser on environmental and energy affairs, Francis Murray, said it had become clear that Quebec was unlikely to offer any major cost concessions. "We had numerous conversations with them and we had absolutely no reason to believe that Hydro-Quebec had any flexibility with respect to price," Mr. Murray said.
Pierre Bolduc, Hydro-Quebec's executive vice president for international affairs, said the utility was "disappointed" at New York's decision but held out hope that a contract might still be negotiated later. "We have done business with New York for 75 years," he said. "This is a turning point in that relationship, not the end of the road by any means."
Perhaps equally significantly, there were growing indications that many of the major downstate utilities to whom the Power Authority planned to channel the electricity wanted out of the contract. By acting now, Mr. Cuomo may well be trying to position himself as the principal force behind the contract's termination, rather than making an announcement later in the year that could almost have been received as an afterthought.
Finally, although state officials said the timing was coincidental, the announcement came just two days after the death of the state's leading opponent of the hydropower contracts, Assemblyman William B. Hoyt of Buffalo. The 54-year-old Mr. Hoyt, the chairman of the chamber's Energy Committee, collapsed and died of a heart attack on the Assembly floor Wednesday afternoon.
His funeral will be Saturday in Buffalo, and several opponents of the contract said that today's announcement was likely to be cited by Mr. Cuomo, who plans to attend, and others as a legacy of Mr. Hoyt's efforts.
"This cancellation would not have happened if it had not been for the fight which the late Assemblyman led," said Franz S. Leichter, a Democratic State Senator from Manhattan.
Although today's announcement was couched in economic terms, it was nonetheless seized upon by environmentalists as an indication that Mr. Cuomo had been swayed by their protests against Hydro-Quebec's planned Great Whale complex.
The project represents an expansion to the north of Quebec's existing hydroelectric operations in the James Bay area, and would involve the flooding of several thousand acres of wilderness and erection of a series of dams to generate electricity.

HEADLINE: History Class Reads Between the White Lines

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HEMPSTEAD, L.I., March 27

 BODY:
With dog-eared copies of "On the Road" under their arms and "Huckleberry Finn" in their bags, a class of Long Island college students is setting out on a new kind of college course -- a mad dash by sleeper bus to celebrate America -- 29 cities in six weeks, and six credits toward graduation.
Poised somewhere on the American landscape between Jack Kerouac and Charles Kuralt, these students, the tamer 1990's heirs, perhaps, to Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters of the 60's, say they have had enough of the malls and landscaped lawns in and around their campus at Hofstra University and are mad to experience a different America, from a bus equipped with beds, a television, a stereo system and even a shower.
 
The Beat Generation Gap
 For their six-week course -- SGG19, An American Odyssey: Art & Culture Across America -- the students, or their parents, will pay their full tuition of $2,450 and an extra $1,000 to zip across the country, reading a dozen authors, from Walt Whitman to Hunter S. Thompson and getting one last chance before graduation to shed their New York provincialism and discover an America that precious few have ventured to see before. 
 "When people start mistaking landscaping for nature, you know you've been in a place too long," said Alison Andrews, a 21-year-old senior, as she packed for a 6:30 A.M. departure on Saturday. "I've lived in New York far too long. Apathy and ignorance is all I see. This is my last chance to restore my faith in America and Americans."
The course and road trip were the notions of Dr. Douglas Brinkley, a 31-year old history professor, the sort who wears a battered corduroy jacket over a T-shirt and blue jeans, researches diplomatic history for a living and has a passion for Jack Kerouac, and the Beat Generation, and "the romanticism of the American road and the American way of life."
"This is not a joke. It is not a drinking bash. We are not heading for Florida for spring break," he said. "This is a serious academic program. The idea is to see America and all of its glory and all of its problems."
 
Pilgrimage of Youth
 Since the fictional Sal Paradise and his friend, Dean Moriarty, wandered across postwar America, hitching rides and riding buses, American college students have been duplicating the treks westward from New York and back. And thousands of college students have done a summer in school in Rome or Paris.
But this may be the first time that students have received course credit for a fanciful American tour by bus, hearing lectures and visiting sites by day and dozing to the sounds of a bus grinding along the highway by night, in such a structured academic way.
Perhaps, Dr. Brinkley said, one of his favorite passages from "On the Road" will echo in their ears: "The only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved . . . the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn like fabulous yellow roman candles. . . ."
 
From See to Shining See
 Dr. Brinkley said that when he arranged for his students to visit William S. Burroughs in Lawrence, Kan., an assistant to the legendary writer laughed and remarked that going on the road with credit cards and a luxury tour bus was "very 90's."
An American Odyssey, with its 16 students, Dr. Brinkley, an administrator and a bus driver, Frank Perugi, who dresses like Buffalo Bill and is something of a 90's refugee from the 60's world of "Easy Rider," will pay homage to American icons everywhere, from Presidential libraries to the Rockies, from gambling casinos to Elvis's home in Graceland.
Traveling at night to fit it all in, they will hit an Indian reservation in Oregon, a buffalo preserve in North Dakota and visit Mark Twain's boyhood home in Hannibal, Mo., and Willa Cather's home in Nebraska, tour some of America's poverty pockets and even make an appearance at a meeting of the Organization of American Historians in Chicago.
There are stops at Big Sur, naturally, and the Jack London Ranch. There will be rafting on the Rio Grande and a campsite lecture on Daniel Boone. Best Western is providing free hotel rooms. On a stop in Las Vegas at Passover, students will get a choice between the casino and a Seder.
"This is a trip designed to help young people fight the apathy toward America and our political system," Dr. Brinkley said. "I promise you that in six weeks these students will learn more about American history, our writers our culture, our music and our Presidents than they would in four years of normal university."
The idea for the trip arose in one of Dr. Brinkley's history classes last year when a student, a Russian-Jewish immigrant, Alexander Sitroin, now a researcher with the European Economic Community in Florence, asked, "Why can't we learn American history across America, rather than here on Long Island?"
Since the students were all enrolled in Hofstra's New College -- an experimental program created in 1959 to break the rigidity of traditional education -- the idea was taken seriously. Eventually, the school agreed to refund the $1,000 in dormitory charges to help students pay their way for the trip.
David Christman, dean of the New College, said the title An American Odyssey was picked to remind the students of the "intellectual and physical odyssey" in Homer. "I hope this is an odyssey too, intellectual, not physical," he said.
Dr. Brinkley is providing the mood music for the bus trip, blues in the Mississippi Delta, Chuck Berry in St. Louis, Charlie Parker in Kansas City. Students will bring one guitar, one electric piano, one computer and a video camera, to be used by a student who plans to turn the trip into a two-hour video. To add to the course's rigor, students are required to keep a journal.
Several students said that they were shopping around for a place to live, far from the traffic and crowds of the New York area.
 
'Like Another Country'
 "Long Island is different; it's like another country," said Justin Buis, a 21-year-old senior from Port Washington who plans to run his own auto detailing business as soon as he graduates.
He said he picked the course because he really wanted to go on a trip to Europe and that didn't work out. He's bringing along a few golf clubs, hoping for a chance to play in Palm Springs with two of his fraternity brothers, who also signed up.
"I'm sure we will have a great time, but this is not all good times. There are 12 books to read," he said.

HEADLINE: Witness for Prosecution Is Likely to Be Milken

BYLINE: By RONALD SULLIVAN

 BODY:
A Federal prosecutor said yesterday that there was a "substantial likelihood" that Michael R. Milken would be a Government witness in the coming securities fraud trial of a former colleague at Drexel Burnham Lambert.
It would be Mr. Milken's first public testimony about the business activities of Drexel's junk bond division, which he headed, since the Government began its investigation in 1986. 
 Any testimony could be crucial to Mr. Milken, who is trying to persuade the court to reduce his 10-year prison sentence for securities fraud. But Roger S. Hayes, Acting United States Attorney, said yesterday that any consideration of reducing Mr. Milken's sentence should be delayed until his testimony had been evaluated.
Mr. Hayes said Mr. Milken was expected to be a witness against Alan E. Rosenthal, the former head of co nvertibles in Drexel's junk bond department, who was indicted last May on charges of conspiracy, mail and securities fraud, and pension fund embezzlement.
 
 
Unusual Position
 The situation puts Mr. Milken in the unusual position of either having to admit that despite his lawyers' statements that he knew of no other crimes committed at Drexel, he was aware of wrongdoing by one of his chief lieutenants, or providing testimony that will be of little help in gaining him a reduced sentence.
Mr. Hayes's disclosure that Mr. Milken may become a highly visible prosecution witness was in a letter yesterday to United States District Judge Kimba M. Wood, who is considering Mr. Milken's application that his sentence be reduced. Mr. Milken is serving the sentence at a minimum-security prison work camp in Pleasanton, Calif.
Thus far, Mr. Hayes said in the letter, "Mr. Milken's cooperation has not resulted in the successful investigation and prosecution of other individuals."
 
 
Prosecutors Have a Voice
 Part of the arguments Judge Wood will consider in deciding whether to reduce Mr. Milken's sentence is one offered by prosecutors in which they will evaluate how valuable he has been in obtaining indictments and convictions of Wall Street figures.
"In practice," Mr. Hayes wrote, "the simple rule has been that only defendants whose cooperation has resulted in successful criminal prosecutions and successful S.E.C. enforcement actions have received substantial sentence reductions."
Mr. Hayes cited, for example, Ivan F. Boesky, Dennis B. Levine and Boyd L. Jefferies, each of whom provided testimony or evidence, resulting in either more favorable plea agreements or a prison-sentence reduction.
 
 
'Limited Results'
 Mr. Hayes said that defendants whose cooperation produced only "limited results" should receive "only a slight sentence reduction." Thus far, Mr. Hayes said, Mr. Milken fell into that category, and for that reason has not yet "merited a significant sentence reduction."
In contrast, Mr. Milken's defense lawyers, led by Arthur L. Liman, submitted a motion yesterday in which they requested a reduced sentence based on what they described as his successful cooperation. Mr. Liman said Mr. Milken was cooperating in an S.E.C. investigation, but did not provide any details.
The courtroom spectacle of Mr. Milken turning against a former colleague could also undermine his claims that he committed no crimes other than those to which he pleaded guilty and his extensive and well-financed efforts to clear his name.
Prosecutors contend that Mr. Milken had intimate knowledge of Mr. Rosenthal's purported illegal activities, on the ground that he was named a co-conspirator in the indictment against Mr. Rosenthal.
The indictment contends that the two conspired to confer unlawful economic benefits on a former Drexel client, David B. Solomon, and, in turn, to misappropriate funds from Mr. Solomon's clients. At one time, Mr. Solomon's junk bond company, Solomon Asset Management, was one of Drexel's largest clients, controlling about $2 billion, most of it from pension and employee-benefits funds.

HEADLINE: Dow Off 36.23 Over Doubts On Recovery

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stock prices were down sharply in moderate trading yesterday, as investors' fears that the economic recovery would be sluggish left the market vulnerable to bouts of program trading. Technology stocks, under pressure for weeks, were particularly hard-hit because of those doubts.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell to 3,231.44, down 36.23 points, or 1.11 percent, for the day and 44.95 points, or 1.90 percent, for the week. 
 Declines in overseas markets also weighed on the market, analysts said. Tokyo fell to a new five-year closing low of 19,636.99 on the Nikkei.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange slipped to 166.1 million shares, from 176.7 million shares traded on Thursday, with losing issues leaping ahead of winners by 1,244 to 449.
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks fell 4.36 points, to 403.50, as the American Stock Exchange composite fell 4.50 points, to 394.36. Trading on the Nasdaq was heavy. Investors jumping out of technology stocks pulled the composite down 10.73 points, to 604.67, and the Russell 2,000 index down 2.41 points.
The most actively traded Nasdaq issue was Intel, which closed at 55 1/4, down 3 1/2, after a few investment firms lowered their ratings on it. Andrew Neff, a Bear, Stearns analyst, issued a research report saying that Cyrix, a privately held technology company, was expected to introduce a product soon that will directly compete with Intel's 486 microprocessor and could be aggressively priced.
Among the other technology stocks that took heavy hits were Borland International down 2 3/4, to 54; Lotus Development down 2 5/8, to 31 1/2; Micsosoft , down 3 3/4, to 121 1/4, and Novell, down 2, to 57 1/4.
Blue-chip issues tumbled in afternoon trading, under pressure from the significant weakness in the technology sector, and some futures-related selling.
News that Household International, the financial services company, expected to see first-quarter results that are 40 to 50 percent below analysts' estimates caused some nervousness in the market. The stock fell 9 1/4, to 46 3/4, on the Big Board.
Stocks also reacted yesterday to the weaker-than-expected gain in the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index and to the larger-than-expected increase in the February personal income and personal spending numbers.
John Brooks, a technical analyst for Davis, Mendel & Regenstein in Atlanta, said the mixed economic signals being emitted might be decent for bonds, "but I'm not sure the stock market will ignore weak economic numbers."
He continued: "The market also ran into problem with Salomon Brothers' error this week. You have a market that is psychologically shaky at best and than you throw in one error by one brokerage firm, it exposes fragile structure of the market."
William Maguire, a Merrill Lynch analyst, lowered his earnings estimates and intermediate-term rating on Chiquita Brands International to "neutral" from "above average," citing uncertainty over the pricing of bananas in Europe. The stock fell 1 7/8, to 29 1/8, as the analysts noted that Europe accounts for more than 65 percent of the company's earnings.
James Parker, an analyst with the Robinson-Humphrey Company, added Hi-Lo Automotive to the firm's "best buy" list, as the stock rose 1 1/2, to 17 5/8.
The share price of Handex Environmental Recovery collapsed after the company said it expected first- quarter earnings to fall as much as 30 percent. The news caused the stock to plunge 7 1/2 and close at 14.
Catalina Markets, a distributor of store coupons, was up $8 from its initial public offering price of $20 in heavy trading yesterday.

HEADLINE: WALDHEIM IS GIVEN WELCOME BY KOHL

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BERLIN, March 27

 BODY:
Chancellor Helmut Kohl met with President Kurt Waldheim of Austria in Munich today and then angrily criticized prominent Jews who had deplored the meeting as inappropriate.
In a nationally televised news conference after the meeting, Mr. Kohl said he alone would decide with whom he was to meet in Germany. 
 "I don't need any advice," he said in response to leaders of Jewish organizations who had scorned him for becoming the first Western leader to receive Mr. Waldheim since his election in 1986. The Austrian leader has been widely shunned since then for having concealed his role as a German Army officer in World War II.
 
'Dishonor to Germany' Seen
 In New York, Elan Steinberg, executive director of the World Jewish Congress, said Mr. Kohl "brought dishonor to Germany." He contrasted the Chancellor's behavior with that of Germany's President, Richard von Weizsacker, who, he said, "by not meeting with Mr. Waldheim defended Germany's honor."
German Jewish groups also denounced the meeting.
At the meeting with reporters, where he was accompanied by Mr. Waldheim, Mr. Kohl said he did not understand such criticism. He lashed out in particular at the World Jewish Congress, accusing its leaders of having tried to derail efforts toward German reunification after the fall of the Berlin wall.
Visibly annoyed, Mr. Kohl declared: "I ask the gentlemen of the World Jewish Congress for a reply to a request for information about an occurrence in November 1989, when they sent an emissary to East Berlin, where he polemicized in an outrageous manner against German reunification, and thereby against Germany's right to self-determination." Mr. Kohl said he had not received a reply to a request for an explanation.
Answering Mr. Kohl's charge, Mr. Steinberg said in a telephone interview that the organization's president, Edgar Bronfman, had been informed of the charges last year in a letter from Mr. Kohl, in which the allegations were attributed to a report based on information contained in East German Government files.
Contradicting the Chancellor, Mr. Steinberg said the World Jewish Congress had denied the charges in a letter sent by Mr. Bronfman to Mr. Kohl in October.
 
Criticism From Opposition
 The encounter and a luncheon in Munich's elegent Prinzenpalais, which was attended by Bavaria's Prime Minister, Max Streibl, also drew criticism from the opposition Social Democratic Party, which accused Mr. Kohl of currying favor with conservative supporters by welcoming Mr. Waldheim.
Leaders of the Free Democratic Party, the junior partner in Mr. Kohl's coalition Government, said the meeting displayed "lack of sensitivity."
The 72-year-old Mr. Waldheim, who served as United Nations Secretary General from 1972 to 1982, has been treated as a virtual pariah by Western leaders after disclosures during his 1986 presidential campaign indicated that he had covered up his service in a German Army unit that was accused of atrocities in the Balkans in World War II. His six-year term as President ends in June.
Officials in Mr. Kohl's office have been careful to describe the visit by Mr. Waldheim to Bavaria, where he received an award from a conservative foundation for contributions to freedom, as a private visit. He was accompanied by Austria's Foreign Minister, Alois Mock, a supporter of Mr. Waldheim and one of the major proponents of Austrian entry into the European Community, a goal Germany supports.
Mr. Kohl's Christian Democratic Party faces elections in the states of Baden-Wurttemburg and Schleswig-Holstein in coming months, and the Chancellor has been at pains to win the favor of conservative voters as his party struggles to prevent a heavy loss of votes to the far-right Republican Party.
Mr. Steinberg said: "Chancellor Kohl, who brought us Bitburg, showed shocking insensitivity to the moral concerns of the Jewish people as well as others who feel deeply the tragedy of the Holocaust and those terrible years."
Mr. Steinberg was referring to the Chancellor's visit with President Reagan in 1985 to a military cemetery at Bitburg, Germany, where soldiers of the Nazi SS are buried. The visit brought strong criticism from Jewish organizations and also from American veterans' organizations.
Mr. Steinberg contrasted the behavior of Mr. Kohl with that of Mr. Weizsacker, who has always staunchly refused to meet officially with Mr. Waldheim.
German-Jewish ties, always sensitive because of the slaughter of European Jewry at the hands of Germans in World War II, have been tense since the Persian Gulf War, when Bonn was initially hesitant in its backing of the coalition effort against Iraq. Though Bonn subsequently agreed to a large share of the financing of the war, relations have continued to be troubled by Israeli objections to Bonn's willingness to take in large numbers of Jews from the former Soviet Union whom the Israelis would prefer to see settled in Israel, and to German willingness to follow the American lead in refusing loan guarantees intended for the construction of settlements for the immigrants in Israel.
To relax those tensions and to provide assurance that Bonn is dealing with a surge of radical right-wing political activity against immigrants to Germany, German leaders have invited several recent high-level delegations of American Jews to the country. This led some prominent Jews to express surprise that Mr. Kohl would welcome Mr. Waldheim.
 
Meeting Called Inappropriate
 "Given Mr. Waldheim's record, to host him when no other leader in Europe would do so is inappropriate," said Malcolm Hoenlein, the executive director of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, who is on a tour of Germany sponsored by Mr. Kohl's party. Mr. Hoenlein said the attacks against criticism by Jewish organizations were "not warranted."
"Certainly it is directed at Mr. Waldheim and anything that would give him acceptability and legitimacy," he said.
Mr. Waldheim has said he will not seek re-election. That announcement ended months of debate among Austrian leaders, many of whom feared that a second candidacy would further mar Austria's reputation as it seeks entry into the community.
Later today, at a ceremony in which Mr. Waldheim was awarded a prize by the conservative Peutinger Foundation, Bavaria's former Economics Minister, Otto Schedl, praised him for dedication to the values of peace and freedom, and mocked the accusations brought against him because of his wartime record. In a thinly veiled reference to the Austrian President's Jewish critics, Mr. Schedl said, "Once the accusations had collapsed like a house of cards and the intriguers were unmasked, one hardly read or heard anything more about them."

HEADLINE: G.E.-Tungsram Venture In Hungary Hits Snags

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUDAPEST, March 27

 BODY:
The General Electric-Tungsram joint venture that opened to much fanfare here in 1989 has called a timeout in its light-bulb making as losses of more than $13 million a year continue and substantial layoffs seem possible.
The suspension of many Tungsram operations is the worst setback yet for the emerging market economy of Hungary, which has attracted more than $2.3 billion in foreign investment, more than its Central European neighbors combined, except for Germany. 
 The Tungsram venture has been a drawing card -- and case study -- for other Western companies considering setting up shop in Hungary.
"Because of G.E.'s high profile, it draws additional attention," said Theodore Boone, an East European specialist for Arnold & Porter, the Washington-based law firm. "But for a lot of people who are very active here, it's not something that's a complete surprise."
Tungsram continued to advertise "for a brighter world," in newspapers and on billboards this week, but as of Monday most of the operations at 10 of Tungsram's 11 Hungarian plants were suspended for two to five weeks, and workers were sent home with 80 percent of their salaries.
The company announced a 90-day moratorium on new investments in the venture. Tungsram's chief executive, George Varga, predicted that G.E. would cut by half its planned $40 million investment this year.
Mr. Varga, a Hungarian emigre who had risen through G.E.'s ranks and won the coveted job of nurturing the infant joint venture, attributed its losses to the combination of 30 percent annual inflation and small devaluations of the Hungarian currency, the forint: 1.9 percent in mid-March, following devaluations of 5.8 percent in November 1991 and 15 percent in January 1991. The company's loss last year came despite a rise in sales of 16 percent.
"Since 75 to 80 percent of Tungsram's products end up in the most competitive markets, in the United States and Western Europe, if costs in Hungary multiply 90 percent in three years, then it is logical that the profit margin should fall," Mr. Varga said. He added that "the East European market has practically disappeared."
The Central Statistical Office reported that as of February the annual inflation rate had fallen to 25.8 percent, from 33.2 percent a year earlier.
 
 
Government Criticized
 At a recent news conference, Mr. Varga lashed out at the Hungarian Government. "I understand that the Government's first priority is the fight against inflation," he said. "But I am convinced that in such a time of recession a tight monetary policy hardly serves the interests of industry," he said.
The daily newspaper Nepszabadsag quoted him this week as having said, "I think it is fatal to have the Finance Ministry be the ruler in economic policy."
Mr. Boone commented, "G.E. has built up so much good will through their investment here, I think they feel they should be listened to." Mr. Varga is reported to be frustrated that in three years he has been unable to get Hungary's Prime Minister, Jozsef Antall, to receive G.E.'s chairman, John F. Welch Jr., even for a courtesy visit. Finance Ministry officials declined to comment on the matter today.
"Economically and politically, the first priority is inflation," said Maria Zita Petschnig, senior scholar at the Monetary Research Institute. "You can't solve unemployment in the short term, but you can achieve something with inflation."
 
 
Motivations Questioned
 Dr. Petschnig questioned Tungsram's real motivations in suspending operations at the plant, saying that while the forint was overvalued, this was a less significant factor in companies' economic well-being than their markets, for example.
"Maybe Tungsram is being used as a Trojan horse for domestic enterprise lobbyists," she ventured. "A lot of people are threatened with unemployment, but there's no direct social pressure."
Similarly, Laszlo Lang, an economist, suggested, "If a company with G.E.'s backing can't sustain its market, it may go back to reasons other than an overvalued currency."
He added, "Even with an overvalued currency, some Hungarian companies have been cashing some good export receipts in the past two years."
Mr. Lang described G.E.'s purchase of its share in Tungsram as a "strategic buyout," to get a well-known brand in the regional market. "Perhaps some in G.E. are wondering if it was worth the price just to get a trademark," he said.
It is still too early to tell whether Tungsram's problems will have an effect on the flow of other Western investments into Hungary. Mr. Boone said, "Companies currently considering investments may analyze some of the risk factors more closely."
When G.E. purchased its share of the business for $150 million in 1989, the Tungsram joint venture inherited a manufacturing operation that was overstaffed, like most state-owned enterprises in Eastern Europe.
 
 
Minimal Layoffs
 Mr. Varga's team opted for a "soft" approach, offering early retirement options to about 4,000 employees instead of laying off workers.
"We've gone down over 5,000 in two years, but with only 400 real layoffs," said Jim R. Conheady, Tungsram's vice president for organization and personnel development, said last month. Now Mr. Varga is pointing to more drastic moves.
"We are planning about a 25 percent cutback in personnel, which first of all will affect the approximately 1,000 people in administration," he told Nepszabadsag.
Union officials at the plant said they understood the motivations for suspending operations. Still, they are nervous about the future.
Gyorgy Selmeczy, head of the Tungsram Workers' Independent Trade Union, said: "On the positive side, it looks as if the enterprise will survive. But every one of the employees wonders which of us will end up on the street next."

HEADLINE: Beliefs

BYLINE: By Peter Steinfels

 BODY:
Abortion is the great white shark of American politics. At the moment this intractable, emotional moral issue is gliding silently below the surface of the Presidential campaign. But that won't last.
Within a few months the Supreme Court will almost certainly rule on the constitutionality of a Pennsylvania law that hedges access to abortion with a number of conditions. The Court's decision may show the extent of the vulnerability of Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that gives women the right to choose abortion. 
 Whatever the outcome, Congress this summer will take up the proposed Freedom of Choice Act. The bill would codify Roe v. Wade, although some of its supporters, as well as all of its opponents, say the legislation would go beyond Roe in barring any legal restrictions on abortion.
Both sides in the debate are eager to make abortion an issue in the general election, forcing candidates and voters to stand up and be counted. Less enthusiastic are those Republicans and Democrats whose strong beliefs on abortion are at odds with their party's positions. Their plight is a poignant one, and looking into it reveals much about the dynamics of moral frustration.
"I have never been a single-issue voter, but that's changing," said Ann Stone. "I don't know how many Republican candidates who are anti-choice I could vote for." Ms. Stone is the national director of Republicans for Choice, a group seeking to repeal the Republican platform's endorsement of a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion.
The Republican dissidents have at least won a hearing for what the late Lee Atwater, President Bush's campaign director in 1988, called the "big tent" -- a party with "enough room for all kinds of positions."
Democratic dissidents have not scored a comparable success. With the Democratic Presidential candidates pledged to support the Freedom of Choice Act, there has been no talk of a "big tent" for Democrats.
Last Jan. 27, Gov. Robert P. Casey of Pennsylvania, a Democrat, complained that his party's unqualified support of abortion rights was alienating millions of voters. Mr. Casey delivered his analysis at the National Press Club in Washington in January and plans to make his case in detail at the University of Notre Dame next Thursday.
Yet quite apart from questions of political consequences, the Democratic and Republican positions have created moral misery for some who have been active party members and who find precious principles pitted against each other.
Ms. Stone, an important fund-raiser for Ronald Reagan, says she is committed to keeping government out of people's lives. "We can't be a party that says we trust corporate executives but we don't trust women," she said. "It's not good politics and it's not good ethics."
Politically active Democrats who oppose abortion sound even more torn. Some link their opposition to abortion to their qualms about military force and the death penalty. For Democrats like Governor Casey, opposing abortion is of a piece with access to improved health care and nutritional programs for infants and mothers. They are bitterly opposed to President Bush's economic policies.
David Medema is a case in point. In the early 1980's he left social work to become an aide to Stephen Monsma, a liberal Democratic state legislator from western Michigan who fought for many welfare measures but opposed state financing of abortions.
"We expected tolerance from the Democratic Party but found that tolerance evaporated around the abortion issue," Mr. Medema said. "For pro-life Democrats, money would dry up in election campaigns."
By 1988 he concluded that the party was simply losing touch with religiously and culturally conservative constitutencies. Today he is an independent and directs Justlife, an interdenominational Christian group that endorses liberal Congressional candidates who oppose abortion.
For many other anti-abortion Democrats the split conscience is simply reflected in a cooling of ardor. James R. Kelly, for example, is the chairman of the sociology department at Fordham University, a lifelong Brooklynite and a Democrat who voted for the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Mayor David N. Dinkins.
"Oh, I'll vote Democratic once again," he said. "But I'm no longer a proselytizing Democrat, and I think my name is legion."
These politically seasoned people seem to be objecting to something beyond the painful compromise that is inherent to a democracy. They believe that views like theirs are being silenced and caricatured.
Ms. Stone speaks of pro-choice Republican women who feel "intimidated." Governor Casey said "pro-life Democrats get written off as Neanderthals, and religous stereotypes come to the fore." Both sets of dissidents decry "litmus tests" and, at the very minimum, hope for a recognition that their parties can legitimately contain diverse views.
"If all the Democratic candidates show up at a National Abortion Rights Action League rally, couldn't they find a Birthright center for unwed mothers to visit?" Mr. Kelly asked. "Couldn't they make a gesture recognizing that some Democrats could be against abortion without being against women, or without being made to feel like they're fascists?"
Of course, that is exactly the kind of mixed message that many advocates of the right to choose abortion, and many of their anti-abortion counterparts, will not tolerate. Insofar as democracy ultimately demands a vote for or against, a case can be made for their pressure on parties to adopt clear-cut positions on abortion.
But democracy also demands rich and unconstrained exchanges of opinions. It is eroded by the disaffection of conscientious people who feel that their voices are stifled. The polarization of the parties on abortion is certainly generating such disaffection.

HEADLINE: Personal Incomes Jump 1.1%; Consumer Spending Up 0.9%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 27

 BODY:
Personal incomes jumped 1.1 percent in February, the biggest leap in three years, the Government said today. The gain helped support a nine-tenths of a percent increase in consumer spending that will be crucial to any economic recovery.
February's strong figures "may overstate the underlying strength of the economy," said Lynn Reaser, an economist with First Interstate Bancorp of Los Angeles. But "there is an indication that the recovery process is under way," she added. 
 At the White House, the Presidential spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said the spending increase in February and a similar one a month earlier meant that real consumption is rising at a solid 5 percent to 6 percent rate in the first quarter.
Noting that consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the nation's economic activity, he said the gains "represented a significant positive contribution" to overall growth.
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, addressing a luncheon audience in New York, cited "a number of important signs that the U.S. economy is returning to a pattern of growth," including stepped-up activity in housing and higher retail sales.
But he counseled the Federal Reserve, as have others in the Administration, against a repeat of last summer when the central bank allowed money-supply growth to slow and the economy stalled. "If that happens again in the spring or summer of 1992, the recovery will be threatened and an opportunity lost," Mr. Brady said.
It was the latest call for monetary easing by an official of the Bush Administration, which is hoping for interest rates to remain low and for the recovery to be solidly in place by the time President Bush goes head-to-head with the Democratic nominee in Presidential campaigning this summer and fall.
In a separate report yesterday, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation said 30-year fixed-rate mortgages declined this week for the first time in nearly two months. Rates averaged 8.98 percent, down from 9.03 percent last week.
Consumer spending rose nine-tenths of 1 percent in both February and January, the sharpest gains since back-to-back advances at the same pace in February and March last year, the Commerce Department said.
Spending totaled $4.03 trillion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate last month, up from $3.99 trillion in January. The department reported on Thursday that personal consumption remained flat through the final quarter of last year.
"The increase in spending is critical because there had been a buildup of inventories last year," Ms. Reaser said. "That had caused a reduction in orders from factories and a cut in production. That seems to be reversing now."
Incomes reached a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $4.97 trillion, up from $4.92 trillion in January. The increase was the largest since a 1.3 percent advance in January 1989, the department said.
But it also reported that January's revised two-tenths of 1 percent drop in incomes was a bit steeper than the original one-tenths of 1 percent estimate.
The report said income growth was driven by a $33.2 billion jump in wages and salaries, an increase in farm subsidies and a speed-up of life insurance dividends to veterans.
The 1.5 percent advance in wages and salaries, excluding Government payrolls, was the biggest since a 1.7 percent gain in December 1987. The Labor Department had reported earlier that 164,000 new jobs were created in February and the average workweek increased by four-tenths of an hour.
Disposable incomes -- incomes after taxes -- rose 1 percent after slipping one-tenth of 1 percent a month earlier.
Americans' savings rate -- savings as a percentage of disposable income -- rose to 4.7 percent in February, up from 4.6 percent a month earlier but down from 5.6 percent in December.

HEADLINE: Treasuries Up Sharply on Stocks' Plunge

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Big losses in the stock market and rumors that some investors were moving to bonds from equities helped send Treasury bond prices sharply higher yesterday after evidence of new economic strength failed to shake investor confidence.
"Part of the upward bias is the stock market," said Lawrence Schuster, the trading desk manager at Harris Government Securities in New York. "There might have been reallocation going on." 
 After sliding back on new signs of economic strength in February personal income and spending data, the benchmark 8 percent 30-year bond abruptly changed direction, closing 20/32 higher at 10020/32 .
The bond's yield sank to 7.94 percent, from 8 percent on Thursday.
 
Goldman Talk Cited
 Rumors that investment analysts were telling investors to shift out of stocks and into bonds gave way to talk that Goldman, Sachs & Company, the investment bank, had changed the asset allocation of its model portfolio.
Goldman quickly denied the rumor, saying it was still bullish on stocks.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 36.23 points yesterday to close at 3,231.44 in a market vulnerable to fears about the strength of any economic recovery.
Traders said the bond rally was also spurred by heavy short-covering, once the market proved itself able to withstand the shock of big increases in personal income and spending for February. Shorting occurs when when investors sell borrowed holdings in the hope that prices will fall so they can buy back the bonds at a low cost.
Evidence of economic strength usually undermines the bond market by increasing the possibility of higher interest rates and inflation.
 
Short-Sellers Caught Short
 But strong economic data failed to shake bonds yesterday, making prices rise and forcing investors who had sold short to scramble to buy back the bonds.
In yesterday's reports, personal income rose 1.1 percent in February and spending increased nine-tenths of a percent. Most traders had expected the figures to rise by seven-tenths of a percent and eight-tenths of 1 percent, respectively.
Treasury prices experienced an initial jolt after the data were released. But when the 30-year futures contract for June reached a floor price of 981/32 , the security met with investor demand and began to rebound.
 
Yield's Range Confined
 Analysts said the long bond's yield was basically boxed into a trading range of 7.9 and 8 percent.
"It's a fairly wide range to be fluctuating in, but we're in uncertain economic times," said Dan Seto, economist at the Nikko Securities Company International Inc. in New York.
The bill sector ended flat. Three-month rates fell by one basis point, or one-hundredth of a percent, to a discount rate of 4.01 percent. Six-month rates were down by 2 basis points, to 4.14 percent, and the year-bill was 3 basis points lower at 4.35 percent.
The two-year note was slightly higher at 1005/32 , yielding 5.67 percent. The 7 1/2 percent 10-year note climbed by 12/32 , to 9927/32 , to yield 7.52 percent.
Federal funds were trading at 3.62 percent late yesterday, compared with the Federal Reserve's presumed goal of 4 percent.

HEADLINE: Land Price Begins Fall In Japan

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 27

 BODY:
After soaring to such heights that mere patches of Tokyo were worth more than the entire state of Florida, the price of land, Japan's most precious asset, is falling.
The National Land Agency reported on Thursday what real estate agents, bankers, some of the world's biggest manufacturers and scores of bankruptcy judges already knew: Land prices throughout the country have fallen significantly for the first time since 1975. 
 After years of sharp gains, any declines come as a shock, especially since many speculators are deeply in debt. Real estate analysts say that the Government's survey vastly understates the true magnitude of the declines, in part because large landholders are too frightened to reveal the prices they have received for some of their holdings.
 
Drop in Stocks
 According to the official statistics, prices dropped more than 5 percent nationwide and upward of 15 percent in Tokyo. In Osaka and Kyoto, which saw some of the most substantial run-ups in recent years, residential land was down 25 to 35 percent.
The real estate bust has propelled the decline of Japanese stocks and provided further evidence of the economic slump that has gripped the country.
Falling property values are in part the deliberate result of Government policies, like discouraging bank lending for speculative land deals, that the country's leadership is now under tremendous pressure to reverse.
 
Bankruptcy Filings Up
 Already the decline in land prices has caused a good deal of chaos in an economy that prides itself on calm and stability. Real estate speculators and large corporations that sought to cash in on rising prices now face major losses, as do the banks that backed them. Bankruptcy filings are up sharply.
The battle over land prices here is one of those subterranean tremors that shatters the myth of Japanese harmony. This one has pitted the banks, big manufacturers and real estate speculators against millions of young Japanese who grew up certain that they could never afford a home.
"Individuals and businesses have very different interests," said Tokunosuke Hasegawa, the executive director of the Research Institute for Construction and Economy, which was established by Japan's construction ministry. "Businesses saw through the 80's that Japanese land was a way to easy profits, and now they are hurting and putting a lot of pressure on to stop the decline."
But most people are cheering, and today several of the country's most influential newspapers urged the Government to stop putting industry's interests ahead of consumers, as the ruling Liberal Democratic Party almost always does.
 
More Decline Called For
 "The Government should not repeat past mistakes this time," warned Asahi Shimbun, in an editorial that called for land prices to decline an additional 20 or 30 percent. "Businesses and individuals that suffered losses in expectation of rises in the price of land should not be bailed out thoughtlessly."
Even the far more conservative Yomiuri Shimbun, while stopping short of seeking further declines, warned there was already evidence that the Government was cracking under the pressure and said that the nation's wavering land policy "looks like a repeat of past policy failures, and that could reignite the land price boom."
Joining the calls for a steeper decline is one more interested party: the United States. In trade negotiations over the last several years, American officials and business leaders have called Japan's phenomenally high land prices one of the biggest obstacles to doing business here. In theory, lower land prices should make it possible for more American companies to establish manufacturing and distribution centers in Japan and rent more offices and stores. In reality, the prices are still so high in comparison with the United States that the current decline is unlikely to persuade most American executives that Japan is suddenly a bargain.
In fact, it is not. Since 1986, when the current land boom began, prices in the hottest residential and commercial districts -- notably in Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto -- have doubled or tripled. By most measures, less than half of those increases have been washed away in the last 18 months or so. "I think it still has a long way down to go," said Akio Mikuni, the president of Mikuni & Company, a bond-rating service that spends much of its time assessing the true value of land held by companies.
The total amount of debt involved in bankruptcy cases in 1989 was only 1.2 trillion yen, or about $9 billion at current exchange rates. The figure soared to $60 billion last year. Not all of these debts reflected bad real estate investments, but many involved speculators who borrowed when Japan's interest rates were among the lowest in the industrialized world, and secured their loans with the land they were purchasing. Now, they cannot unload it, and there is beginning to be a surplus of office space.
The speculators also included some of the country's biggest manufacturers. They bought land in the 1980's rather than report huge profits that would have subjected them to more taxes, the specter of new regulation and pressure to reduce their prices. Many borrowed against their land to finance new factories, new offices and new equipment.
The run-up in prices led to international comparisons that seemed to border on the ludicrous. The Imperial Palace grounds in the center of Tokyo was estimated to be worth more than entire American states, including Florida. The market value of the whole country's real estate, according to Government estimates, exceeded the market value of the United States -- even though Japan is about the size of California. In the Ginza, the commercial heart of Tokyo, a piece of property about the size of this newspaper page was worth roughly $50,000.
 
Windfalls For Some
 There were scores of unlikely beneficiaries. Among them were American companies, which sold office buildings and other property purchased in Japan during or just after the postwar American occupation of Japan. Australia sold 54,000 square feet of its embassy's land for something in the neighborhood of $400 million, and sent the money home to retire part of the national debt. Myanmar, formerly Burma, sold some of its property, leading to speculation by diplomats that it was using the money to arm more troops against rebel groups battling its repressive government.
Many ordinary Japanese who own their own homes -- more than 60 percent of families do -- found themselves overnight millionaires. But their enthusiasm for high prices was tempered by the high inheritance taxes levied on their huge assets.
For a while, the skyrocketing market turned small Japanese companies into huge real estate investors, many of them using quick profits to buy political influence, touching off several of the scandals that have shaken Japanese politics.
"It was more like money earned gambling," said Masashi Kojima, the president of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the giant domestic telephone company and one of the country's biggest landholders. "It will take the banks two years or so just to determine what their losses are, and what loans can be recovered. Only when the economy sorts this out can we move forward again." Falling real estate values have helped account for an 80 percent drop in Nippon's stock price since 1987.
 
Pressure on Banks
 The decline in prices is attributable at least in part to a half-hearted Government initiative to bring the real estate market down slowly, rather than risk a calamitous crash. The Government put pressure on banks to stop lending for land deals, a ban that was eased several months ago. Local governments reviewed proposed sales, and refused to issue permits and approvals if they thought the prices were too high.
But the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, fearful of the effect on its own campaign coffers, stopped short of enacting the significantly higher real estate taxes that would discourage companies from using property to store their wealth.
Officially the Government says that it wants prices to fall further, so that a Japanese family could buy a standard house or apartment for five times an average annual salary. That would mean housing that costs about 30 million yen, or $225,000, for a home considerably smaller than the average in America, and much farther from the center of large cities. Right now the average Japanese cost is twice that or more.

Dollar Falls Despite Release of Favorable Economic Data

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar settled lower on world currency markets yesterday despite the release of positive economic news.
Gold prices were mostly higher. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $342.40 an ounce, up $1.30 from Thursday. The Republic National Bank said gold gained $1.70 an ounce to a late bid price of $342.20. 
 In two reports that were more positive than many economists had expected, the Government said personal incomes posted their biggest increase in three years in February, rising 1.1 percent. And the Commerce Department said consumer spending, a key to economic revival, rose nine-tenths of a percent in both February and January.
Despite the fresh signs of growth, some analysts cautioned that the figures might be overstating the economy's underlying strength.
The dollar was down in both European and domestic trading, falling to its lowest levels in several weeks. Analysts said the currency was the victim of overall bearish sentiment.
"To see the dollar break down in this situation leads me to believe it is structurally weak," said Randolph Donney, research director of Pegasus Econometric Group Inc. in Hoboken, N.J.
The dollar was also undermined by speculation that the Bundesbank of Germany may have to raise interest rates and widespread expectations of a rate cut by the Bank of Japan.
Also putting pressure on the currency were comments by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, who warned that the economy could falter again if the Federal Reserve failed to provide enough money to sustain the recovery.
Lower interest rates make dollar-denominated securities less valuable to investors, diminishing their need for the United States currency.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.65 yen to close at 133.85 yen. Later in London, it was quoted at 133.15 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 133.05 yen, down from 134.03 on Thursday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.7385, from $1.7215 late Thursday. In New York it cost $1.7430 to buy a pound, compared with $1.7245 on Thursday.

Moratorium Spawns New Hope for Salmon

BYLINE: By Nelson Bryant

 BODY:
One of the major obstacles to the restoration of significant spawning runs of Atlantic salmon to the rivers of Newfoundland, mainland eastern Canada and New England has been swept away, and champions of the species are elated.
The obstacle was a fixed gill net fishery in Newfoundland that was depleting that province's salmon stocks and also intercepting salmon bound for their natal streams in other provinces and New England. Some estimates, based on the recapture of tagged fish, had suggested that more than half of the salmon headed for the United States were being waylaid in the Newfoundland nets. 
 Earlier this month, Canadian officials overcame the obstacle and announced a moratorium on commercial salmon fishing in Newfoundland for at least five years. This will be coupled with a voluntary buyout of salmon licenses held by Newfoundland commercial fishermen. One-time payments to those licensees who wish to accept the offer will range from $8,000 to $50,000. Total cost of the program is estimated at $40 million, to be shared 70-30 by the Canadian Government and Newfoundland. In Labrador, which is part of Newfoundland, there will be no moratorium, but the same buyout offer is being made. Labrador's commercial salmon fishermen hold more than 400 of the approximately 3,000 licenses in all of Newfoundland. Labrador was exempted from the moratorium because of its high dependence on commercial salmon fishing, but the allowable commercial salmon catch in Labrador will decrease as the licenses there are retired.
The announcement was made by John C. Crosbie, Canada's Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, and Walter Carter, Fisheries Minister for Newfoundland. Commenting on the buyout payments, Carter said, "This offer allows fishermen the option of accepting up to eight times the value of their best year's landings since 1989, and given the current state of the resource may be acceptable to many license holders."
Approximately 433 metric tons of salmon were taken in the Newfoundland-Labrador commercial fishery in 1991, 39 percent below the lowest year in the 1980's and the fourth consecutive year of a declining harvest.
Carter noted that commercial salmon fishing was banned in Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick nearly 10 years ago.
David Clark, president of the Canadian-American Atlantic Salmon Federation, the largest and most influential salmon conservation organization in North America, said: "This will produce a healthy recreational fishery and will be a boon to local economies through outfitting, tackle and tourism industries. Salmon conservationists have worked for over 40 years to reach this moment."
While acknowledging that salmon netting has been a way of life in Newfoundland for scores of years, those who oppose it have long pointed out that an angler-caught salmon is worth 10 or more times more to the local economy than one in a commercial fisherman's net. The average guided angler in Canada spends about $350 to catch a single salmon. There was a time when those who opposed salmon netting believed that salmon farming, which was pioneered in Norway, would take the heat off wild stocks. That hasn't happened, even though farmed fish now account for most of the salmon that go to market: In 1990, only 10,000 of the 235,000 metric tons of salmon sold worldwide were wild fish.
While at sea, salmon from the United States, Canada, Europe and the United Kingdom congregate in the Davis Strait off Greenland. After one, two or three years, the survivors return to their natal streams to spawn. In the early 1960's, native Greenlanders launched a high-seas drift net fishery for salmon. That fishery is now under a quota set by the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organization and in recent years, with dwindling salmon stocks, that quota has not been met.
Some salmon conservationists think the Newfoundland development -- which had the backing of the Atlantic Salmon Federation's Newfoundland Council -- could result in further curtailment of the Greenland fishery. It might also result in more intense efforts to end the unlicensed drift net fishery for salmon that goes on off Ireland.
 
On the Fly
 A show devoted exclusively to fly fishing is scheduled for Park Plaza Castle in Boston April 24-26. Arranged by the magazine Fly Rod and Reel, it will include more than 85 manufacturers, shops and lodges, and experts will be on hand to discuss all aspects of the sport in both fresh and salt water. There will be a preview party from 5-9 P.M. April 24. Hours on April 25 are 10 A.M.-6 P.M., and 10 A.M.-4 P.M. on April 26. Tickets, available at the door and at some fly fishing shops, are $25 for the party and $7 for daily admission. The Park Plaza Castle is at 64 Arlington Street.

 
 
Croton Cleanup
 The streams of the Croton River watershed offer some excellent trout fishing, and there is no better way to learn about them than to attend one of the monthly meetings of the Croton Watershed Chapter of Trout Unlimited, which are open to the public. The next meeting is at 7:30 P.M. April 21 at the Fox Lane Middle School in Mount Kisco. Or, you might jump the gun and take part in a major Croton watershed trash cleanup on April 11 in which the Croton chapter is one of several organizations participating. To find out how you can help, call the Croton chapter's Richard Jogodnick at (914) 632-1269. . . . Trout Unlimited's New York City chapter will hold its Opening Day Gala and spring auction at 6:30 P.M. April 8 at the Salmagundi Club, 47 Fifth Avenue (12th Street).

HEADLINE: The Weekend Warrior War

 BODY:
If you get up early tomorrow you may see them, trooping through the morning mist to their armories in midtown Manhattan and suburban Seattle, as they do on many weekends during the year: They are the reservists and National Guard members who serve as the country's second line of defense. But if Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has his way, their numbers will drop by 140,000 in the next two years.
His proposal has ignited an expected counterattack from members of Congress and others eager to keep all those armories open. But on this military personnel question, Mr. Cheney is unarguably right and he deserves support. America can't cut the defense budget and redeem the peace dividend if it also tries to preserve peacetime patronage for part-timers. 
 But the Pentagon's full-time personnel policy suffers from its own flaws. The Defense Department wants to keep more active-duty forces than it needs. And it's resisting further budget cuts by contending these would require it to lay off more troops. The collapse of the Soviet threat warrants larger reductions in both active and reserve forces.
Part-time soldiers typically make about $5,000 a year for training one weekend a month and two weeks in the summer. And National Guard armories bolster communities in every state. That kind of patronage may be tolerable when it has military justification. But many units serve no purpose now that the forces they supported in Europe have been withdrawn. Eliminating 234,000 positions over five years will save $20 billion.
But reducing reserves offers only a start on prudent economies. Les Aspin, the House Armed Services chairman, wants to cut Mr. Cheney's proposed $281 billion budget by an additional $15 billion. That need not require, as Mr. Cheney contends, drastic cuts in active-duty personnel.
There's much to be saved by eliminating wasteful weapons like the B-2 bomber and the Army tactical missile system, and deferring others like the new aircraft carrier. Other savings can be realized by cutting back exercises and using fewer escort ships in carrier battle groups.
The Pentagon is right to resist hasty reductions in the active-duty force. That could damage military morale, break faith with service families and swell unemployment rolls. But it's extravagant to keep all of its so-called "base force" of 1.6 million troops.
The best way to spare its people undue hardship would be to plan now for inevitable cuts later. As any personnel manager knows, nothing so saps morale as repeated layoffs and continuing uncertainty. Then Congress needs to find ways to cushion the impact with job placement and retraining. America owes that to those who have served the country well, weekend warriors and full-time military personnel alike.

HEADLINE: Battery Park City Adds to New York Economy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
A March 8 news article speaks of Battery Park City as a project that no longer contributes to the economy of New York City. The Battery Park City landfill was completed in 1975 after four years of work, at a cost of about $80 million. From 1980 to 1988, the Battery Park City Authority spent about $11 million a year on such improvements as streets, the esplanade and public parks. 
 The authority has spent more on construction in each of the last three years than any past years. We will complete a $20 million park in May and the esplanade, north of Stuyvesant High School, joining Battery Park City to West Street ($3.2 million) in June. This year we begin on a four-block street ($2.6 million) and a two-acre park ($6 million).
By September the authority will complete construction for the Board of Education of the new Stuyvesant campus at a cost of approximately $150 million.

HEADLINE: S. & L. Role of Offcial Scruntinized

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 27

 BODY:
Agriculture Secretary Edward R. Madigan is being investigated by Federal authorities along with the other directors and executives of a failed Illinois savings association over their role in the institution, Federal officials said.
The investigation, which is standard practice in every failure of a bank and savings association, is concerned with whether Mr. Madigan and the other directors and officers were negligent in their management of Olympic Federal Savings Association of Berwyn, Ill., a western suburb of Chicago. 
 Officials said the investigation might determine whether to bring a civil lawsuit against the directors to make up the taxpayer losses or to refer the matter to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution.
 
Assets Are Sold
 The investigation came to light as the Government announced today that it had sold the assets of Olympic.
The investigation is one of hundreds into the conduct of directors and officers of failed institutions conducted by three Federal agencies that supervise the nation's banks and savings companies. The agencies have stepped up their investigations in recent months as they face increasing pressure from Congress and statute-of-limitations deadlines for bringing civil lawsuits.
Olympic was seized on Dec. 14, 1990, by Federal officials after it was unable to meet regulatory requirements. Its failure will cost taxpayers $111 million.
The assets were sold today by the Resolution Trust Corporation to 12 other institutions. The association had $521 million in assets and $621 million in liabilities, including $450 million in deposits.
Mr. Madigan was a director of Olympic from September 1983 until June 1990, the same time he served as a Congressman from Illinois and rose to the position of ranking Republican on the Agriculture Committee.
 
Another Inquiry
 He is the second senior Administration official known to be under investigation over the failure of a bank or savings association. Regulators have said that President Bush's national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, is being investigated over his role as a director of the National Bank of Washington, which failed in 1990.
Roger D. Runningen, a spokesman for Mr. Madigan, said that the Agriculture Secretary "has not been alerted to any investigation" and that Mr. Madigan had been told that an audit last year by the Office of Thrift Supervision in a different legal proceeding had found no evidence of bad decisions by the Olympic directors.
A financial-disclosure report filed by Mr. Madigan last year showed that he was paid $56,900 in director's fees from Olympic and that he donated the money to charity. The disclosure statement also indicated that Mr. Madigan took out a 30-year mortgage of between $15,001 and $50,000 from the savings association in 1989, at a interest rate of 10.5 percent, for a condominium in McLean, Va., a suburb of Washington.
Mr. Madigan became Agriculture Secretary last year, replacing Clayton K. Yeutter, who left to head the Republican National Committee. He is one of three Cabinet members to disclose recently that as a member of Congress he had written checks on the House members' bank without sufficient funds to cover them.
On March 17, Mr. Madigan said his House bank account had had 49 overdraft checks after 1987, including one for $8,618.84 for a real estate settlement. The other two Cabinet members, Labor Secretary Lynn Martin and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, said they had written fewer overdrafts.
The failure of Olympic figured prominently in the appointment of T. Timothy Ryan Jr. in 1990 to head the newly created Office of Thrift Supervision, which regulates the savings industry. On March 21, 1990, Olympic persuaded a Federal district judge that the Government could not seize it because the agency's acting director and his predecessor, M. Danny Wall, had been appointed unconstitutionally.
Mr. Wall and his immediate successor, the acting director, Salvatore R. Martoche, had not been nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate when they took their posts at the agency after it was created as part of the industry bailout bill signed in August 1989.
Other larger institutions then moved to block their seizures, and Mr. Ryan was quickly approved by the Senate in a bitter confirmation fight to avert the paralysis of the agency.

HEADLINE: Concern for Greece Delays U.S. Move on Yugoslav Republics

BYLINE: By DAVID BINDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 27

 BODY:
Concerned about the fragility of the Greek Government, the Bush Administration has delayed action on recognition of the successor republics of shattered Yugoslavia because of Greece's objection to an independent republic called Macedonia.
 The Macedonia dispute pits one Balkan nationalism against another, that of the Greeks against that of the South Slavs who call themselves Macedonians. 
After a referendum last year, the Republic of Macedonia declared independence from Yugoslavia. Greece, which had already been cool to the republic, began to insist that nobody but Greeks could use the name Macedonia, which they say is part of their heritage from classical antiquity. They call the state north of their border "the Republic of Skopje," a reference to the Macedonian capital.
 The Greek Prime Minister, Constantine Mitsotakis, has a two-vote majority in Parliament, and members from northern Greece have threatened to abandon him if he gives any ground on the Macedonia question.
 
Bush Spoke With Mitsotakis
 Administration officials said President Bush had told Mr. Mitsotakis last week that the United States would not recognize Macedonia in early April as previously planned. On April 6, the European Community, which has already recognized Slovenia and Croatia, is to meet to discuss recognition of Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. But American officials said today that it was increasingly unlikely that recognition would be extended to those republics at that time.
 Although the United States in principle is ready to recognize the sovereignty of all the former Yugoslav republics, it will probably wait until the European Community moves before it will go ahead with recognition of any of them.
 Last weekend, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3rd sent a letter to the 12 members of the European Community, including Greece, saying the United States still intended to follow the community's lead on recognition.
 At the same time, Mr. Baker said it was United States policy to give equal treatment to all of the pieces of the former Yugoslavia that have emerged from the six-month war of 1991 as independent republics. That means diplomatic recognition for four successor republics, Administration officials said.
 
40 Countries Followed Europe
 The European Community members extended recognition in mid-January to Slovenia and Croatia, which had seceded from Yugoslavia six months earlier. About 40 other countries followed suit.
 At a meeting in Brussels this month, community members agreed to try to grant recognition to the troubled multi-ethnic republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and perhaps to Macedonia at their next session, on April 6.
 But a community consensus on Bosnia and Herzegovina, the scene of sporadic fighting in recent weeks between Serbs and an alliance of Croats and Muslim Slavs, has not yet been reached, European diplomats said. Now as before, Greece stiffly refuses to approve joint European recognition of an entity called Macedonia.
 European diplomats said the community -- and now the United States -- had agreed to pause on the Macedonia issue to give "diplomacy time to work." Portugal, which now holds the community presidency, is trying to mediate a compromise on the name of Macedonia -- perhaps something like "Slav-Macedonia."
 
U.S. Won't Delay for Long
 But Administration officials said the United States would not delay recognition for long. "The way I understand it, we will recognize Slovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina soon after the European Community acts on Bosnia-Herzegovina," one official said. "Then, after a short pause, we will recognize Macedonia, too, regardless of what the others do."
 For the 12 members of the community, the Macedonia issue has become a new test of its intention to maintain a common foreign policy. The question of recognizing Slovenia and Croatia was already very contentious. This time, several countries, notably Denmark and the Netherlands, have indicated that if the community could not reach an adequate consensus, they would feel free to recognize Macedonia.
 For the 10 million Greeks and the 2.5 million Macedonians, the issue has become much more than a matter of what's in a name.
 In the judgment of Bush Administration officials, the Macedonia dispute has stirred Greek emotions more than any issue since Turkey invaded Cyprus in 1974. They noted that on Feb. 14, more than a million Greeks demonstrated against the Macedonian Republic in Salonika, the capital of northern Greece.
 
Greeks See Slavic Threat
 Northern Greece, a region the Greeks call Macedonia, was inhabited mainly by Slavs before World War I. They were largely supplanted in the 1920's by Greek refugees from Asia Minor after the Greek-Turkish war, although thousands of ethnic Slavs remain in Greece.
 An Administration official specializing in Greek affairs said that despite the collapse of the Communist system in Europe and the collapse of Yugoslavia, many Greeks seem to fear a revived Slavic threat, even though the new Macedonian republic has no army. As a result, he said, Washington now acknowledges that a hasty move could topple Mr. Mitsotakis.
 There is tension north of the border too. In Skopje, President Kiro Gligorov has come under increasing pressure to promote Macedonian nationalist causes from radical members of the large political formation called the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization-Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity.
 The radicals' cause has been strengthened by severe deterioration of Macedonia's economy resulting from the Yugoslav civil war and from sporadic Greek measures blocking commercial traffic.

HEADLINE: DOES SHE SPEAK FOR TODAY'S WOMEN?

 BODY:
New York NOW members march and demonstrate for reproductive choice and civil rights for lesbians and gay men, but we have also worked long and hard to help women assert their economic rights and to change the laws that maintain the unequal status of women as wives and mothers as well as in the workplace. Very little of this activity gets reported by the news media or is understood by the public. 
 For example, in both New York City and New York State, the largest number of phone calls to NOW have consistently been from women seeking help with problems of sex discrimination on the job (particularly pregnancy-related discrimination) and domestic-relations law issues. Some women may feel that NOW doesn't represent them, but the truth is, when these women need help, NOW is still the place they call.

HEADLINE: Columbia's Big Medical Center Plans Expansion

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
THE Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, already the most formidable private force in upper Manhattan real estate, is poised to expand significantly westward, to the river side of Riverside Drive, where its affiliate, the New York State Psychiatric Institute, would build a new home.
The site is an empty 1.37-acre tract south of 168th Street. Wooded and shrubby, the land looks much like the surrounding Fort Washington Park, but it is owned by Columbia University. If developed, the six-story institute would be one of few large structures ever built on the west side of Riverside Drive. It would also have pedestrian bridges over the drive. 
 Although the project is still taking shape, it has already been criticized as an intrusion in a parklike setting.
"I just think you can't put a building on that open space," said Betsy F. Gotbaum, the Parks and Recreation Commissioner. "I think they're going to have a hell of a time with the community if they don't leave it." She said that although the plot is privately owned, it is shown on the official city map as parkland and she is trying to raise money to acquire it.
Meanwhile, the medical center is also poised to expand eastward, across Broadway, where Columbia would develop three blocks around Mitchel Square as a research park. It would begin with the first phase of the Audubon Research Building, between 165th and 166th Streets, behind the facade of the old Audubon Theater and Ballroom. Next would come the Center for Disease Prevention, on St. Nicholas Avenue, between 167th and 168th Streets.
Given that construction has virtually stopped in New York -- and that upper Manhattan never saw much in boom times -- the $84.3 million Psychiatric Institute project and the $37.6 million Audubon project represent notable initiatives.
"It will give us expanded space that will give additional employment opportunities," said Dr. John M. Oldham, director of the Psychiatric Institute. "And many of the employees come from the neighborhood: clerical people, data-processing people, support staff."
Dr. Herbert Pardes, Columbia's vice president for health sciences and dean of the faculty of medicine, said: "We've had a large number of companies from the U.S. and abroad come to us and say: 'We want to have a collaborative program with you. We want to be near you.' That's the kind of thing that made the Boston and Palo Alto areas thrive. But we've had no place to put them."
"THIS center is in one of the tightest straitjackets of any academic center in the country," Dr. Pardes said. "We've been working on ways to develop the center in such a way as to keep Columbia right at the top and also develop opportunities for science, clinical programs and increased economic activity in the area. We're the biggest economic entity in this part of town."
Some 14,000 people work for the Presbyterian Hospital and Columbia University at the medical center.
The Audubon project has already been at the center of intense debate, out of which emerged the plan to preserve as a memorial the Broadway facade and much of the old ballroom, where Malcolm X was killed in 1965. And the Psychiatric Institute project is also likely to come in for sharp scrutiny.
Officials of the 97-year-old state-run institute, which has been affiliated with the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center since the 1920's, believe that a new building is the only practicable way to provide patients, researchers and staff with quarters that are modern, smoothly running and capable of meeting accreditation codes.
Financed by state bonds, the new building would contain 300,000 to 350,000 square feet. Its six floors would cover almost the entire lot. It would be directly across Riverside Drive from the existing institute, linked by overhead bridges to the Dr. Lawrence C. Kolb Research Facility and the Milstein Hospital Building. The architects are Ellerbe Becket, of Manhattan.
Within the building would be 72 patient beds, treatment areas, offices for administrators and residents, an auditorium, classrooms, some research departments (most are in the Kolb building), a psychiatric library and outpatient research clinics for depression, late-life depression, anxiety, memory disorders, eating disorders, schizophrenia and child psychiatry.
As soon as the Psychiatric Institute vacated the existing building, it would revert to Columbia. No decision had been made yet whether to demolish the structure or put it to some kind of limited use, said Dr. William A. Polf, a deputy vice president of Columbia.
The existing building, which has four finger-like wings and rises to a 20-story tower, was completed in 1929. It has almost as much square footage as the new building, but only about half is usable, Dr. Oldham said.
"The building is configured and constructed in a way that's very outdated," he said. "In many ways, we're extensively out of compliance with current, existing codes."
For example, he said, the long wings do not allow fire exits at both ends. The narrow configuration also does not permit enough common rooms for patient care.
MOREOVER, Dr. Oldham said, there has been no major renovation in 63 years and "the infrastructure has become quite marginal, with fairly frequent breakdowns and emergencies."
The boilers, he said, are barely hanging on. Ventilation is inadequate. The building does not have sprinklers. A water main has broken twice. The driveway had to be closed. There is not enough power for buildingwide air-conditioning.
Going back to the early 80's, Dr. Oldham said, various renovation plans were considered, but "the more we studied it in earnest, the more we realized the difficulties involved in doing anything with the existing building."
The institute could not find "a way to locate adequate swing space and then to build around ourselves," he said. "It would take much more time and our money would not cover those additional expenses."
That was when officials looked to the west, to Columbia's land across Riverside Drive.
Columbia and Presbyterian each own a tract between Riverside Drive and the Henry Hudson Parkway, 165th and 168th Streets. They are part of the Harkness patent, a gift of 22 acres made in 1925 by Anna M. Richardson Harkness and her son, Edward S. Harkness, to the medical center, which was coming into existence. A 1928 rendering showed that three small buildings were envisioned on the west side of Riverside Drive.
As to Presbyterian's current thinking about its parcel, David L. Ginsberg, the executive vice president and chief planning officer, said: "We have absolutely no plans for that. It's a piece of parkland and we left it as such in our master plan."
The Columbia and Presbyterian parcels were mapped as parkland in 1966, said Jack T. Linn, an assistant commissioner in the Parks and Recreation Department. He said there were one or two other instances around the city of this kind of anomalous mapping.
Ms. Gotbaum said the city had received an $828,000 grant from the state, through the Environmental Quality Bond Act, toward the purchase price of the parcels, which she estimated as $2 million. It would be "foolhardy," she said, if the city did not try to acquire the land as part of Fort Washington Park.
However, Dr. Oldham said: "It isn't parkland. Technically, there is a clear title owned by the university." He said the process by which building could take place was "still being worked through" and that the institute was committed to an environmental review. "We want as much input as we can," he said.
Any suggestion of construction in a park could raise the temperature of the debate, since the project involves Columbia, which was paralyzed in the 1960's by its plan to build a gymnasium in Morningside Park.
Councilman Stanley E. Michels, a Democrat who represents upper Manhattan, said of the proposed building site that "even though Columbia owns it, the community regards it as parkland."
"To do something on the other side of Riverside Drive is very disturbing," he said. "I think the community will be very resistant to it. We have nothing built on that side. You have beautiful views of the George Washington Bridge and the Palisades."
But Dr. Oldham said: "Our feeling is that we've worked very hard to be sensitive to community concerns. One example is our attempt to keep the building at a low level, so it won't interfere with the view corridor." Considering the local topography, he noted, "if you were standing on Haven Avenue, you'd be one story above the roof."
Councilman Michels said he would keep his mind open but confessed to "some very, very bad feelings about what they want to do," adding that "they're going to have to prove to me that this won't be a bad precedent."
Other elected officials from the area seem more positively inclined toward the project.
"I don't have a major opposition to it," said Assemblyman Herman D. Farrell Jr., a Democrat. He added, "I could be educated."
"I am not dying because you're on that side of the street," he said, "but I know people who would get upset about that. I think they've dealt with the problem of blocking of light by lowering it, so that when you're standing on 168th Street, you'll be able to look across to New Jersey."
As for the property itself, Mr. Farrell said: "That area is nothing but a strip zone and anyone who gets caught there after sundown is in dire trouble. It isn't like an area that's being used constantly, that we're stealing from folks. When they finish cleaning it, it gets dumped on again."
Indeed, the area was dubbed Dead Dog Park after Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern came upon a dog carcass there.
State Senator Franz S. Leichter, a Manhattan Democrat whose district embraces upper Manhattan, said: "I'm not supporting the project yet but clearly the medical institutions up there are very important. Finding space is always a problem. I think they've been good neighbors to the community and the community has to recognize the importance of reaching an accommodation."
The chairwoman of Community Board 12, Maria Luna, said the board has not taken a position, as it had not seen the proposal until last Tuesday. She said, however, that it was widely assumed in the neighborhood that the building site was part of the park.
The Audubon plan had to survive a controversy of its own, since Columbia began by proposing to raze the old structure entirely. As the site of the assassination of Malcolm X, the ballroom drew many defenders -- among them Borough President Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan -- who wished to see it preserved for its historic significance. A compromise was reached and the project was approved by the Board of Estimate in 1990.
As the plans now stand, the first Audubon Research Building will be constructed on the northeast side of the block on which the 80-year-old theater sits.
This commercial building, Dr. Polf said, is intended for companies that want to be located near the medical center or that spin off from research conducted at the center. The first phase will have about 100,000 square feet and rise six stories. The second phase could include up to 250,000 square feet more.
The architects for both the preservation and new construction are Davis, Brody & Associates of Manhattan, one of whose partners, J. Max Bond Jr., has been associated with the Audubon project since 1984.
The existing Broadway facade -- a vibrant but badly deteriorated terra-cotta fantasy -- will be preserved, as will a major portion of the ballroom. There will be a community health clinic and stores on ground level.
The city will pay for the $1.6 million demolition job. Preservation will be financed by $7.1 million from the city and $1.1 million from the borough president's office. Construction will be financed by $11.2 million from the city, $8.1 million from New York State and $8.5 million from Columbia.
"IT'S a project that's moving forward and it will be a tremendous economic benefit for northern Manhattan and the city as a whole," said Carl Weisbrod, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation.
"We're providing a significant amount of public funding to this phase," he said, "because we want to jump-start it."
The next installment in the research park plan would be the first phase of the Center for Disease Prevention, which might involve a building of at least 150,000 square feet, growing over time to 290,000 square feet. Three small structures now stand on the block -- a bank on St. Nicholas Avenue, a two-story commercial building next door and a day-care center on 168th Street. No one lives there, Columbia officials said. The university's current plan is to develop along St. Nicholas Avenue, after relocating the day-care center and commercial tenants.
One block south is a parking lot owned by Columbia, which will also be the site of a commercial building, but that development is "a long way down the pike," Dr. Polf said.
The Presbyterian Hospital completed the enormous Milstein Hospital Building in 1989 and the Allen Pavilion, at the northernmost tip of Manhattan Island, in 1988.
Today, "there are no major new buildings anywhere near on the horizon," Mr. Ginsberg said. However, he said the hospital would support and join in redeveloping the Fort Washington Armory, at Fort Washington Avenue and 168th Street, which is now an enormous men's shelter.

MEDIEVAL MUSIC
 Two men and two women calling themselves the Voice of the Turtle will sing and play the music of medieval Spanish and Portuguese Jews, known as Sephardim, at Temple Israel in Westport on Friday at 8:30 P.M. The temple has chosen to mark the 500th anniversary of the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492 with this performance. 
 The music group, based in Boston, was formed 13 years ago. It travels throughout the United States, Canada and England, performing Sephardic music.
"We discovered the music through hearing someone sing it and listening to musicologists' recordings made in Jerusalem, New York and other places where Sephardic communities exist," said one of the musicians, Julia Wachs. There is almost no written text; the songs are passed on orally from one generation to the next.
Most of the music is sung in Ladino, the medieval Judeo-Spanish language, and some of it reflects the influences of the eastern Mediterranean countries to which Spanish Jews fled, including Greece, Turkey and Morocco.
Appearing in traditional costume, the musicians accompany themselves on antique instruments or reproductions. The psaltery, harp and rebec are the more familiar ones, but there is also the kamanja, a Turkish fiddle; the shawm, ancestor of the oboe; cornetto, descendant of the shofar or trumpet-like ram's horn; baglama and saz, Turkish lutes of varying sizes, and the Spanish medieval bagpipe with only one drone, a smaller instrument than its Scottish counterpart.
The concert, at 14 Coleytown Road, is open to the public free of charge.
 
BASS FISHING
 Larry Nixon of Bee Branch, Ark., a professional bass fisherman to be reckoned with. was voted best overall angler on the Bassmaster Tournament Trail last August by The B.A.S.S. Times, a fishing publication, and he won the 1990 B.A.S.S. Megabucks Tournament in Leesburg, Fla.
Mr. Nixon will conduct free seminars on his favorite subject, complete with demonstrations, Saturday and next Sunday in New Milford at 10 A.M. and 1 P.M. each day at the Fischel Marina on Lake Lillinonah. The marina is on the West Street Extension. Call 354-2578 for more information.
 
SISTINE FRESCOES
 The next best thing to visiting the Sistine Chapel in Rome may be to view the film that documented the restoration of its ceiling frescoes. "Return to Glory: Michelangelo Revealed," filmed on the scaffolding from which the frescoes were cleaned and narrated by Edwin Newman, will be screened on Saturday at 4 and 7:30 P.M. in the Stanley Center, 1255 Corbin Avenue, New Britain.
The viewer may observe at close range the paintings and the actual restoration process. Candle grease, air pollution, dirt and incense built up over centuries, were removed.
Showings of the film will help support the restoration of Andrew Wyeth's painting "McVey's Barn," owned by the New Britain Museum of American Art. Tickets, at $10, may be reserved by calling 229-0257.
 
SYMPHONIC PSALM
 Arthur Honneger's symphonic psalm "King David" will be performed at 7 this evening in Wethersfield, commemmorating the 100th anniversary of the composer's birth in 1892. The performance, adhering to the original 1922 orchestration, will take place at the First Church of Christ, 250 Main Street, under the direction of David Spicer.
The Rev. Alvan Johnson, pastor of Bethel A.M.E. Church in Hartford, will be the narrator; Christine Andreas will portray the witch, and Peter Harvey will be the tenor soloist. The First Church Choir and Cantata Singers, the church's youth choirs, the City Singers of Hartford, the junior and senior high school choirs of Rocky Hill and five adult soloists will take part. Admission will be $7, $5 for students and the elderly.
 
OLD AND YOUNG
 Explaining the death of a loved one to a young child is a daunting task for most parents. "The Arkansaw Bear," a play by Aurand Harris, deals with the subject in a manner that children can respond to without fear or distress. It will be presented by the Hartford Children's Theater today at 2 P.M. in the Roberts Theater of the Kingswood Oxford School, West Hartford.
Using the circus as a setting, the story concerns an aged bear who must inevitably confront the Ringmaster, the play's symbol of death, a non-threatening figure in a brightly colored uniform. A young girl saddened by the impending death of her grandfather learns to understand something of life's continuity by helping the bear teach circus tricks to a young student.
Tickets are $8, $6 for children. Call 523-4479 for reservations.
 
LOVE OF GARLIC
 Requests for garlic ice cream may be limited (garlicless ice cream will also be available), but visitors to the Garlicfest at Notre Dame High School in Fairfield will surely salivate over steak, chicken, focaccia, pork and beef bracciola, pasta and vegetables cooked, stuffed or garnished with a variety of garlic sauces, chopped garlic, whole garlic and garlic in many manifestations dreamed up by chefs from more than a dozen local restaurants.
While most of the dishes will be Italian, there will be some Greek and Thai foods prepared with the celebrated bulb, and a garlic gourmet shop will be stocked with garlic dressings, seasonings, wines, jellies, mustards, pastas and olive oils. Other items for sale include T-shirts, garlic storage jars and garlic presses.
The school is at 220 Jefferson Street, and the festival will be open on Friday from 5 to 11 P.M., Saturday from noon to 11 P.M. and next Sunday from noon to 6 P.M. Admission will be $1. Proceeds will aid the school's scholarship fund. Call 372-6521 for more information.
 
RIGHTS AND NATURE
 A conference titled Earth Rights and Responsibilites, at the Yale Law School in New Haven Friday through Sunday, will explore the connection between human rights and environmental protection. Among the speakers are Guido Calabrese, dean of the Yale Law School; Sherwood Rowland, president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science; Chief Joagquisho, director of Native American Studies at the State University of New York; Senator Al Gore, author of "Earth in the Balance: Ecology and the Human Spirit," and Kerry Kennedy-Cuomo of the Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Human Rights Foundation.
Topics to be discussed in daily roundtables include establishing standards by which a healthy environment can be measured; the legal rights of individuals, groups and communities to participate in decisions affecting their environment, and ways in which world populations might influence decisions made by the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to pursue projects of global import.
A sampling of experts taking part in the discussions includes Eduardo Viola, professor of sociology at the University of Santa Caterina, Brazil; Andras Sajo, professor of law, Budapest University; Lalaneth De Silva, lawyer for the Environmental Foundation Ltd. of Sri Lanka, and United States Representative John E. Porter, House Foreign Affairs Committee.
Conference hours are Friday noon to 6:15, Saturday 8 to 6:45 and Sunday 8 to 2. Registration and two breakfasts cost $35, but the fee may be waived for economic hardship. Lunches and dinners are available at extra cost. Call 432-4876 for more information.

HEADLINE: Perspectives: Rental Housing;
Taking Steps to Head Off Abandonment

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
WITH a fervent "Thank you O Lord!" Linda Frank walked out of a City Hall hearing room a happy woman last Tuesday.
An arcane city body called the In Rem Foreclosure Release Board had just voted to allow her to redeem the eight-family house at 36 Hawthorne Street in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn that the city had taken for nonpayment of taxes. 
 Mrs. Frank is a nurse who bought the house in 1977. She sank her savings into improving it, she said. She also fell behind on taxes after a seriously leaking roof forced a $10,000 repair and used up her savings. "I paid the contractor cash and the city came down on me," she said. Ultimately, she worked out a repayment plan. City officials supported her redemption appeal.
It was another vignette in the tax-foreclosure drama, played out against the background of concern in housing circles that property takeovers by city government will rise again as a consequence of the recession. Tax delinquencies have already risen amid bankruptcies and workout efforts.
Most delinquencies are repaid before city vesting, or takeover, occurs. Even after that many properties are redeemed, some during the four-month period when redemption by the city is mandatory if the taxpayer pays, and others during the discretionary redemption period thereafter. The Foreclosure Release Board is the body with the discretionary power. It seems kindly disposed to owners who want to pay up.
But housing thinkers these days are looking at ways to keep buildings from getting into the foreclosure bind in the first place. Essentially they want to head off owner abandonment, the housing scourge of the 70's and the cause of staggering rehabilitation costs in the 80's and 90's.
A new report from the Citizens Housing and Planning Council, "Preserving New York City's Low-Income Housing Stock," warns that new approaches are needed to do this.
Operating costs are rising sharply in some areas. Rent increases to offset them are either not affordable by low-income tenants or not available under the rent-regulatory system.
"Because there isn't the ability to raise operating income, buildings will eventually be milked or fall into city hands," said Joseph B. Rose, executive director of the council, a 55-year-old civic organization concerned with housing, planning and urban development.
Mr. Rose noted that the most drastic cost increases, for property taxes and prospectively for water use, have been caused by government itself.
The curative medicines prescribed by the council involve a mixture of new subsidies, rent passalongs and cost-capping, but not an overhaul of the rent-regulation system. "We recognize the need to operate within the context of current regulatory policies," Mr. Rose said.
The report was written by the council's research director, Frank P. Braconi, under the direction of a 14-member committee headed by Marvin Markus , an investment banker. It will become available to the public next month.
THE latest figures from the Department of Housing Preservation and Development show that vestings, or city takings, have averaged about 6,200 dwelling units a year over the last three years. About two-thirds of the units have gone back to owners in the redemption process.
The number of dwelling units finally abandoned, and left to the city to demolish or resell after a rehabilitation process, has averaged 2,000 units over the last three years. In some years of the 70's and early 80's, the city was taking 10,000 to 30,000 housing units and owners were redeeming very few of them.
The most recent projections are not encouraging, especially in Manhattan. There has been a 44 percent pick-up in the ratio of unredeemed to redeemed properties over the last two years.
The housing agency expects that 86 Manhattan buildings with 690 apartments will be abandoned in the the current fiscal year, ending June 30.
The greatest immediate danger to housing is that rent levels cannot cover rises in operating costs, endangering maintenance and fiscal stability.
Low-income neighborhoods are particularly threatened. There are about 350,000 privately owned regulated units in the 19 census districts where the poverty rate exceeds 25 percent, the council said.
A large number of the tenants in this housing already receive housing or other subsidies. To offset property tax increases, the housing council proposes a new program similar to the Senior Citizens Rent Increase Exemption program. That program provides exemptions from rent increases for elderly tenants earning under $15,000 a year who pay more than a third of their income as rent; owners are compensated by tax reductions equal to the rent exemptions.
THE housing council would expand this approach, providing nonelderly, nonwelfare tenants who pay more than a third of their income as rent with a similar exemption. The result would be greater tax savings for buildings in which owners cannot collect rent increases to which they are entitled because many tenants cannot afford higher rents.
Other recommendations, none of them novel, include an increase in the shelter allowance for welfare tenants; a new process to make hardship rent-adjustments possible in regulated housing, and more powers for the In Rem Foreclosure Release Board to enable it to help buildings return to financial viability.
To meet the prospective rise in water costs as metering takes hold, and to further metering's conservation goals, the council proposes a 50 percent pass-along of water and sewer charge increases for stabilized apartments. It would also cap at 15 percent the increase in water and sewer charges that any building could experience in a single year.
To private and nonprofit owners alike, a surge in water and sewer charges is the biggest immediate threat to operations. Many private owners have decided against metering their buildings because of the leap in charges they have heard about from others that did.
Ultimately, the city will meter those buildings itself. New or recently gut-rehabilitated properties are already metered.
The promotion of water conservation was one of the main purposes of the turn to universal water metering, which began in 1986. But the council notes that when metering is completed, nearly 1.1 million households in rental units will not be billed directly for their water use. They will have little incentive to conserve.
AT the Department of Environmental Protection, Steven P. Ostrega, director of the Bureau of Water and Energy Conservation, said that only 5,000 multifamily buildings have been metered so far. The estimate of the number of buildings with five units or more is 80,000.
Metering has already demonstrated an enormous range in average water use in multifamily buildings -- from 70 gallons per unit a day to a remarkable 800 to 1,000 gallons per unit a day. Malfunctions or leaks may explain some of the high figures, he said. Under national standards, "moderate" use is considered 70 to 110 gallons on average per day; 110 to 140 gallons is deemed "very high."
A joint study by the environmental agency and the Rent Guidelines Board is planned to determine the impact of metering on various types of multifamily units. If an unacceptable impact on housing is confirmed, the study would presumably lead the city to change its rent guidelines or a revise the rate structure. But officials speak guardedly of the possibility.
So far, many owners who lose their properties through tax foreclosures are finding ways to redeem them. But occasionally the tenants fight against redemption; they want the building in city hands or their own after a dismal experience with an owner.
That situation led to a lively battle over the six-story loft at 545 Broadway, at Prince Street, last year. The In Rem Foreclosure Release Board -- a body set up under the charter revision of 1989 and consisting of the Mayor, the president of the City Council and the Comptroller, each with two votes, and the five Borough Presidents, each with one vote -- returned the building to the owner.
"Any owner who wants his property back needs to get involved in the process before the hearing," said Jeffrey E. Glen, the lawyer who represented the owner. "To think you can come in and simply write out a check is naive."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: The Diamond District;
Behind the Glitter, Recession Hurts an Exotic Bazaar

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS

 BODY:
GREETING everyone by name, Robert Waldron Jr., leasing agent for 36 West 47th Street, a 16-story, turn-of-the century building in the heart of the Diamond District, was making his weekly rounds of tenants occupying booths on the "exchange" -- the building's first floor retail space of 7,500 square feet.
It is here among the 62 booths that dealers, some born in Eastern Europe, Russia, Israel, the Middle East, India, Hong Kong, Korea and Iran, spend the day among a glittering cornucopia of gems, selling their wares in a lively atmosphere that combines elements of the Lower East Side a century ago with an Oriental bazaar. 
 From one of the booths a matronly woman acknowledged Mr. Waldron with the wave of a check, promising to keep it safe in her cash register so she could pay her rent promptly. "You see," she said as she shook it vigorously, "I'm putting it aside just for you."
In the recession that has dealt a mortal wound to a growing number of the district's smaller dealers, the personal touch can become the Midas touch to a landlord anxious to survive and prosper.
Rents in the district have fallen from a high of around $50 a square foot in the late 80's to around $25 today. Instead of a waiting list to get into the buildings along the block, owners must now aggressively market their space when it becomes vacant and coddle the tenants who remain. Instead of prompt rent payments they have to deal with arears and often must work out payment schedules.
Rents are slipping even at 580 Fifth Avenue, the district's 34-floor Beaux-Arts flagship building at 47th Street that houses the Diamond Dealers Club of New York. Its 10th-floor, 23,000-square-foot bourse is where many of the major deals are still clinched over an old-fashioned handshake and the Hebrew greeting, "mazal u'bracha" (luck and blessing).
"This business is like family," said Edwin M. Roer, the building's managing partner. "You do what you can to help. We want to keep our tenants. They're good people."
Moreover, the district itself is contracting. In the 70's and 80's it was rapidly spilling over from its original one-block nucleus on West 47th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues onto parallel stretches of West 46th and West 48th Streets and even -- the most radical reach of all -- onto the East Side of Fifth Avenue between 47th and 48th Streets. Now some dealers are abandoning what became a sort of jeweler's diaspora to return to the heartland.
ANOTHER reason space abounds is that rents spiraled so high in the boom years that it drove some jewelry manufacturing to Long Island City and the West 30's where rents were cheaper, said Frank Ring, owner and manager of 20 West 47th Street.
Other dealers had grown so prosperous they hankered after the prestige of a Fifth Avenue address to impress their growing international clientele. They moved into fancier buildings on the east side of Fifth that had rarely catered to diamond dealers before and many of them are not returning.
But there is always good in the bad, as the philosophical dealers would be quick to point out. Consider the experience of Amir Eli, a dealer who came to the United States from Israel 16 years ago.
A booth along Diamond and Jewelry Way, as the block was named a decade ago, had long been his dream. But it had also been out of his financial reach. By last November, however, rents had fallen low enough at 36 West 47th Street to transform his dream into reality. "Its where all the good customers come to look," said Mr. Eli, who sells accessories such as jewelry boxes and settings. "This is it."
The story of the 100,000-square-foot building at 36 West 47th Street mirrors, in part, the experience of other buildings along this colorful block where yamulkas and fedoras remain as much a symbol of its close fraternity as baseball caps at a truck stop.
Back in 1988 the building was considered a gold mine when it was bought for $25 million by a partnership headed by Harry Skydell, a developer and builder. Escalation clauses in leases had taken some rents as high as $70 a square foot -- on a par with the best midtown skyscrapers.
A $2 million renovation was planned. But just as it got under way, wholesale and retail sales of jewelry fell sharply as the impact of the 1987 stock market crash began to be felt in the industry. Tenants began leaving and by April 1991 occupancy was down to 58 percent, Mr. Waldron said, with half of the remaining tenants more than 60 days in arrears. Others were so fearful of the future they refused to sign new leases.
Existing leases were renegotiated to "more reasonable levels," said Mr. Waldron's brother, Eric, vice president and managing director of Waldron Associates, which had been brought in to handle the workout. Settlements were reached concerning arrears. Emphasis was placed on getting to know each tenant personally. "Around here it's still a people business," said Robert Waldron. "It makes a difference if they know you really care."
New leases were offered for only one or two years, enabling the removal of escalation clauses that has caused so much distrust and distress.
As rents dropped to around $25 a square feet and renovations were completed, word got out that the building was once again a good deal -- reputation being a prime marketing tool in the Diamond District, as Eric Waldron put it.
Today occupancy is up to 85 percent with only 5,000 square feet left to fill. About 10 retail booths are still available.
THE district is in flux in other ways. In a business where thousands of dollars of merchandise is often carried around in a breast pocket, security is a major concern. The dealers' insurance companies began making increasing demands. The result is that today visitors to the district quickly get the feeling that they have wandered into an armed camp. Closed-circuit monitors, turnstiles requiring electronically coded access cards and uniformed guards on patrol keep tabs on the comings and goings in all the buildings.
This need has also brought a new kind of tenant. Symbolic of the change was the transformation a year ago of 10,000 square feet of basement area in Mr. Ring's building at 20 West 47th Street into a headquarters for DGA Alarm Services. "It wasn't good enough to respond from 45 minutes away," said Brendan Gillespie, a DGA vice president. "You had to have a presence on the street."
The downturn has also forced other buildings to make changes in order to compete. Lobbies and hallways are starting to lose their dowdy 50's look and take on the spiffier character of the 90's. More of the street's first-floor exchange areas offer a contemporary ambience that combines dazzling mirrors with lots of gilt, glass and chrome.
The bourse itself was redesigned in the mid-80's at a cost $3 million to become the epitome of sophistication -- a floor-through area with soft carpeting and open seating, decorated in muted shades of gray and filled with an array of electronic gear. "Our place was too old world," William Goldberg, a former president of the Diamond Dealers Club, had remarked to his peers. "It smelled a little of herring. It was time to move into the Pepsi generation."

HEADLINE: In the Region: Connecticut and Westchester;
A Restoration Aims to Perk Up Hartford

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
THE architectural centerpiece of Connecticut is about to be rejuvenated in ample time for its 200th birthday in 1996. The Old State House at the heart of downtown Hartford, the oldest legislative building in the country, the state's first capitol, an erstwhile City Hall and frequent candidate for demolition, has served as a museum and exhibition hall since 1979.
Topped with a gold-leafed dome, it sits on an acre and a half of prime real estate called State House Square, the same site where in 1639 the first written constitution in America was signed in a plain wooden meeting house. The handsome Federal-style building designed by Charles Bulfinch of Boston was completed in 1796. 
 Still clad in its original brick and brownstone, the deteriorating structure will be strengthened and restored with historical accuracy at a cost of $7 million. The state supplied $2.3 million, the rest was raised from corporations and individuals.
"We are creating a focal point," said Wilson Faude, executive director of the State House, "combining Williamsburg and the Faneuil Hall-Quincy Market in the middle of a business district."
The ability to mount exhibitions and run educational programs will be enhanced by upgrading the interior. Outdoors, on the east lawn, a year-round schedule of concerts, theater and holiday programs will be devised in conjunction with the Hartford Stage Company, the Hartt School of Music of the University of Hartford, the Hartford Symphony Orchestra and other institutions.
On the west lawn along Main Street, costumed vendors will hawk Connecticut produce, crafts, plants, flowers and foods from wagons and stalls. Lunches may be bought and eaten in a picnic area, and the tower bell, long silent, will again toll the hours. "We hope to double our 1991 attendance of 322,000 visitors," Mr. Faude said.
The restoration is symptomatic of the city's longing to polish its tarnished image and climb back to an economic as well as symbolic status befitting a State Capitol. But the recession remains an obstruction.
"The renovation is one factor in the revitalization of downtown, but it's no panacea," said Nicholas Fusco, chairman of the City Council's Operations, Management and Budget Committee. "Unemployment is almost 16 percent compared to 7.3 percent statewide, and we have not yet dealt with 7,500 workers let go at United Technologies."
Carl Traub, vice president of Cushman & Wakefield Commercial Realtors, summed up the market this way: "Office vacancies are running around 18 percent. There is no new construction and nothing planned. Rents are down 15 to 20 percent from two years ago, in the teens and low $20's per foot. Tenants can make deals, and there is free rent available."
Traffic congestion and a shortage of parking that plagued the city for years have abated as vacancies have risen. "There are a dozen garages within walking distance of State House Square, the Wadsworth Atheneum, the Hartford Stage and the Civic Center," Mr. Faude said.
Smith Edwards, Hartford architects, have spent five years planning the rehabilitation of the former capitol's 20,000 square feet. The west foundation will be shored up to support a newly excavated 10,000-square-foot underground wing that will display significant treasures of the Connecticut Historical Society. The museum shop will be expanded with 600 square feet of unused basement space.
The Great Hall at street level, once an open-air arcade passing through the building, will house a Connecticut Hall of Fame, flanked by the former Supreme Court chambers and an art gallery. The second floor contains the old Senate and House chambers and a museum of the building's history. Once a year the General Assembly will hold public sessions in the chambers, and an elevator will be installed to insure access by the disabled and elderly.
After many years, the west side gates on Main Street will be opened, permitting entry and egress east and west, and the east lawn will be enclosed by a reproduction of its 19th-century wrought iron fence.
Facing the building across Main Street is an ugly crater left by demolition when the Society for Savings planned new construction on the site, now stalled by the recession. The bank responded to complaints about the vacant lot by agreeing to create a paved and landscaped open-air market complementing the one at State House Square. It will remain until building plans are reactivated some five years from now.
Jim Williams, manager of 750 Main Street, an 18-story, 1922 landmark office building facing the Old State House, is a member of the restoration committee. He looks forward to the project as an amenity for his tenants. Most of them, like those in other buildings that overlook the former capitol, pay $10 a window for the privilege, contributing some $25,000 a year to its annual operating budget of $500,000.
CURRENTLY, only half of the 135,000 square feet at 750 Main Street is leased. "I've renewed tenants at half the price of their expired leases," Mr. Williams said. "Competition is keen and demand is rising. Lower rates are now affordable to people who went to the suburbs or were planning to relocate there."
"Taxes," he added, "are a problem that the city must address. We pay $5.50 a square, foot compared to $1.25 in the suburbs." Until a revaluation is done in 1994, bringing commercial property values down from their 1980's highs, taxes will not decrease. And tax abatements sought by new developers are a problem for a city "supporting 10,000 welfare cases when we budgeted for 4,000," Mr. Fusco said.
Among pending projects are the acquisition of the bankrupt and vacant Summit Hotel by a Manhattan investment group; the installation of a manufacturing company in the North Meadows Redevelopment Project and the disposition of the defunct Sage-Allen Department Store. The Pan Pacific Development Corporation of Vancouver, Canada, a shopping mall developer, plans to demolish it and build a $320 million Hartford Town Center on the site, according to Terry Partington, managing director for the company's eastern region. It will be Penn Pacific's first New England venture.
Meanwhile, three times a day, 365 days a year, cannoneers in Revolutionary War uniforms roll out the bronze cannon at the east gate of the Old State House and fire it in a Yankee Doodle Salute, "a spectacle as grand as the changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace," Mr. Faude said.

HEADLINE: Jane Jacobs Versus the World

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I was one of those fortunate enough to work with Jane Jacobs on Architectural Forum more than 30 years ago, so I was delighted to read Robert Fulford's perceptive article on Jane and her book "The Death and Life of Great American Cities" -- even though I am not in full agreement with him or, even now, with her. 
 Mr. Fulford failed to mention one of Jane's enormously important accomplishments. In the 1950's and 60's, Robert Moses and an assortment of real estate operators had a harebrained scheme to construct a Lower Manhattan Expressway to cut right across what is now known as SoHo. The Lomex, as I called it, would have destroyed most of the wonderful 19th-century cast-iron buildings south of Houston Street and most of the great warehouses and other architectural delights of that area.
Jane Jacobs, almost single-handedly, stopped this mad scheme. She stopped the bulldozers in their tracks and even went to jail to make her point. She and a small handful of artists forced the city and its planners to abandon their favorite project and, as a result, created SoHo -- a district that may well go down as the only successful "urban renewal project" of those years in New York. It owes its existence not to any architect or planner, but to this one idealistic person who had the courage of her convictions.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
The Brokers Are Prospering, But Will It Last?

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
On the American economic landscape, there are companies where profits never crumbled during the recession and there are companies where optimistic analysts see recovery coming soon. But there are not very many industries where it can genuinely be said to be a boom time.
Wall Street, as it happens, is one of the few. The quarter just ended may have been the best ever for America's brokers. The first of them to report profits, discounter Quick & Reilly, said earnings almost tripled in the quarter ended Feb. 29. For every dime of revenues, better than three cents fell into the pre-tax profit line. 
 All over Wall Street, brokers cannot believe their good luck. Individual investors began this year trading with more fervor than at any time in years. Corporations are retiring bonds, and selling new ones, at a feverish pace, generating underwriting fees for brokers. With markets rising, any firm that keeps inventories of securities is watching the profits role in.
Some of the highest fees come from the booming market in initial public offerings. The eagerness of buyers in that market was illustrated again Friday when Catalina Marketing, a company that distributes supermarket coupons to consumers, went public at $20 a share and saw its shares leap to above $28. At that price, the company is valued at 16 times its revenues for the last year, and 75 percent higher than the minimum offering price the company indicated when it filed to go public six weeks ago.
Amid the joy, the average brokerage stock has more than tripled over the last 17 months, while the S.& P. 500 rose 33 percent. So far in 1992, the S.& P. is off 3 percent, while the brokers are up 13 percent.
Even Salomon's little error last week, in which a clerk got confused and unleashed hundreds of millions of dollars of errant sell orders, was not enough to shake investors very much. Salomon shares fell only 62.5 cents, to $27.875. The other news from Salomon may yet prove more significant. Deryck C. Maughan, the anointed successor to interim chairman Warren Buffett, has spent the last nine months in a fancy hotel, with Salomon paying $1,000 a night.
Such costs could yet serve to remind investors that the history of Wall Street is that surprisingly little filters through to the shareholders when times are good. The bosses raise their pay, perks seem to multiply, and lots of people are hired. It was supposed to be different this time, but if the new Salomon is acting this way, what about brokers not in the spotlight?
It is never easy to tell when a boom will end, but some think this one is on its last leg. Jack Sullivan, a principal in Van Kasper & Company, a San Francisco brokerage firm, is convinced brokerage profits are peaking. He pointed to signs that individual investors have cut back from January's fevered pace, and forecast that the boom in companies going public will slow. That is why, he said Friday, "I'm shorting a basket of brokers."

HEADLINE: World Markets;
Britain's Evolving Beverage Industry

BYLINE: By Steven Prokesch

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
British giants in the world alcoholic beverage market Bass, Guinness, Grand Met and Allied -- have been reshaping themselves in recent years by making a slew of acquisitions and divestitures, with various degrees of success, in the view of analysts.
One impetus has been the British Government's resolve to make the domestic beer market more competitive. By Nov. 1, brewers must greatly reduce their control of the nation's bars, or pubs, as Britons call them. 
 That is one reason analysts generally like Grand Metropolitan P.L.C. and Guinness P.L.C. as long-term investments the most, Allied-Lyons P.L.C. next and are divided on Bass P.L.C. Guinness, whose shares have recently attracted the savvy investor Berkshire Hathaway, never owned British pubs. Grand Met completed its withdrawal from brewing last year and put many of its pubs into a joint venture. By contrast, Bass, Britain's largest brewer, gets two-thirds of its operating earnings from beer and pubs. What is more, Analysts still question the wisdom of its $2 billion purchase in 1990 of Holiday Inn hotels, a business being squeezed by the American recession.
Only Grand Met and Bass have actively traded American Depository Receipts on the New York Stock Exchange. Each of their A.D.R.'s equals two shares.
Not coincidentally, Allied, Guinness and Grand Met rank among the leaders of the global spirits market, offering them some protection from the American and British recessions as well as from the turmoil in brewing and pubs. They have been highly successful in marketing more expensive drinks and cultivating markets in East Asia, South America and Southern Europe. Analysts rave about how Guinness, in spirits and beer, and Grand Met, in spirits and food, have exploited brands to generate fat profits.
Guinness owns Johnnie Walker, Bell's and Dewar's scotch whiskies, Gordon's vodka and gin and Tanqueray gin. Its Guinness Stout is one of the few global beer brands.
Grand Met's brands include J&B scotch, Gilbey's and Bombay gins, Smirnoff vodka and Inglenook, Almaden and Christian Brothers wines. It also owns Pillsbury foods, Haagen-Dazs ice cream, Alpo pet food, Pearle Vision eyewear centers and Burger King. Analysts predict Pearle, the British pub interests and Alpo will be sold, but expect Grand Met to wait for a good price.
"Grand Met will continue to deliver above-average earnings over a five-year period," said Edouard de Boisgelin of Merrill Lynch. With few concrete signs of economic recovery in America and Britain, though, he is neutral on the stock over the short term.
More bullish, Derek Brock of Nomura Research Institute Europe Ltd., said: "If you're looking for a play on the U.S. recovery, that's the stock" to buy.
In London, Grand Met shares were trading at more than 12 times anticipated earnings for the year ending next Sept. 30. Its A.D.R.'s closed Friday at $30.125, down from the high of $34.50.
With Guinness trading in London at a relatively high multiple of more than 15 times expected 1992 earnings, several analysts advise short-term investors to hold on to what they have or cautiously buy more. They think the stock has been helped by rumors, just confirmed, that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. has been buying the stock. Its stake is less than 2 percent.
Analysts also admire the way Guinness Brewing has expanded in regional markets via joint ventures, licensing agreements and acquisitions.
How about Allied-Lyons shares? "I would hold them because the company is going through a period of rapid change," said Michael McCarthy of Smith New Court Securities Ltd.
After suffering a big foreign-exchange loss last year, Allied shook up top management and divested some businesses in an attempt to focus on its main brands. They include Balantine's, Canadian Club and Teacher's whiskies, Beefeater gin, Courvoisier cognac, Harvey's Bristol Cream sherry, the Mister Donut and Dunkin' Donut chains, Tetley tea and Baskin-Robbins ice cream.
The British Government is investigating plans of Allied and Carlsberg to put their British brewing units into a venture that would have about 20 percent of the market. It also remains to be seen whether the Conservative Government allows a deal that calls for Allied to lease 734 pubs to Brent Walker Group P.L.C. and for Walker's pub division to buy most of its beer from Allied.
If the Labor Party wins the April 9 elections, it could take new steps to curb the rapid rise in beer prices, warns Ian Shackleton, an analyst at James Capel & Company. While he thinks Grand Met and Guinness are safer stocks than Allied and Bass, he likes Bass at its current price. Snap up the shares if the Conservatives win, he says. Bass A.D.R.'s closed last week at $18.25, down from $20.20.
He predicts that Bass will slash its interest bill and its brewing unit's operating costs and its pre-tax earnings will be 575 million pounds, or $1 billion, in the year ending Sept. 30. But that is 15 million pounds to 25 million pounds more than most forecasts. A big bear on the stock, Christopher Wickham of Lehman Brothers International Ltd., expects 480 million pounds.

HEADLINE: Can Snelling Brainard Sell His Global Fishing Vision?

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
It is no accident that Snelling R. Brainard's yacht is named Tenacity. His efforts in the mid-1980's to show New England's conservative fishermen they could make profits using 30-mile lines with thousands of hooks instead of environmentally destructive nets ended buried in debts. But now Mr. Brainard, a 64-year-old Harvard-educated banker, business consultant and real estate developer, is back with a daring global venture rooted in the same technique.
This time Mr. Brainard hopes to do a lot more than save fishing stocks from overexploitation and seabeds from being scraped clean of habitats for various creatures. He envisions creating billions of dollars of new business for American shipyards threatened by the downturn in military spending and helping developing nations profit from their natural resources. 
 Mr. Brainard plans to convince investors from developing nations to buy fishing fleets mass produced in the United States by arranging financing along with the training and worldwide marketing system to operate profitably. Foreign investors would operate the fleets as joint ventures with the Consolidated Seafood Corporation, Mr. Brainard's company, whose 49 percent stake would be given to the fleet's employees after 10 years.
There are a lot of places where the plan could fall apart. To sell the fleets, Consolidated must help develop means to help foreign investors tap capital markers . It must also set up a new air distribution and marketing network to help them unload the fish they catch. But Mr. Brainard and his advisers have addressed enough of the basic challenges to intrigue disinterested observers like Richard S. Johnston, an Oregon State University fishing industry expert. "It sounds to me that he's thinking through the issues pretty well," said Professor Johnston after a reporter briefed him on the venture.
Plenty of potential partners in developing nations agree. Mr. Brainard said he already has preliminary orders from 14 countries for more than 36 fleets, each with 32 vessels.
Mr. Brainard said that fishing groups in Russia have ordered 18 fleets and could order 12 more in a matter of months. "The Russians immediately saw this project as the future of fishing and wanted in," said Frank J. Giovino Jr., Consolidated's representative to the former Soviet Union. "They have the largest fishing fleets and the lowest productivity in the world. They see this as a chance to leapfrog." Mr. Brainard says that more than $5 million has already been invested in the project by potential fleet purchasers and strategic partners who expect to build and outfit the fleets.
Daniel Georgiana, an economist at the University of Massachusetts campus at Dartmouth on Cape Cod, said developing countries that want their own fleets could do better by buying existing boats at huge discounts or signing favorable profit-sharing deals with existing fleets.
Yet many seem to like Consolidated's approach. "The financial proposals were what really attracted us," said Luis F. Paredes, president of Industrial and Marine Enterprises, a Venezuelan company that ordered a fleet early this month.
Purchasers must put $200,000 into an escrow account "as soon as possible." They must eventually raise $1 million for their 51 percent stake. Mr. Brainard is counting on loan guarantees from the United States Export-Import Bank and similar such subsidies to help raise the billions of dollars to mass produce the boats. With the guarantees, he says, each 32-ship fleet could be financed by bond issues of about $100 million.
Mr. Brainard expects to file the first formal application for Ex-Im Bank support in the next few weeks on behalf of Papua New Guinea, which would allow construction to begin as early as next year.
Each fleet will have clusters of 60- to 75-foot "mini-liners" working with a 265-foot "multiliner" with added freezing and processing space. The fleet will have a support tender, a barge-like vessel that would remain in or near port and provide repair, communications and training services.
Longliners, as the vessels are known, are already commonly used to harvest certain species of fish in various regions. But no group of fishermen has ever used longliners as extensively or in as coordinated a fashion as Consolidated plans to.
Its fleets would sport satellite-based communication systems, which some fishermen use today to pre-sell fish they have located but not caught. The fishermen learn via satellite how the fish should be processed and packaged for a particular customer. Consolidated expects to use such technology to make its air distribution system more efficient.
"No single idea is brand new but the combination is," said John W. Gilbert, a naval architect based here who has drawn up construction designs for the fleets.
The biggest losers if Mr. Brainard's vision works would probably be fleets from countries like Japan, Spain, Russia and Korea that routinely take huge catches from the waters of developing nations with little local competition. More-efficient third-world competitors might also make it hard for American fleets to hang on to their 40 percent of the domestic market. And those that sell pricey fish like tuna and swordfish to Japan and Europe might face more competition.
The American fishing industry is already struggling. Despite revenues of about $3.5 billion, only a small percentage of the 17,000 registered ocean-going vessels are thought to be profitable. Too many boats are pursuing too few fish. And few have the resources to invest in advanced technology. "American fishermen are in the Dark Ages," said Mr. Brainard. "There's no fishing company of any size in this country you can organize to do it right, and no one has capital."

MR. BRAINARD is counting on support from domestic manufacturers who will benefit from building the fleets to counter any protests in Washington by the domestic fishermen. "This has got to go fast and it's got to be big to work commercially, but the risk is mostly political," said Mr. Brainard over take-out Chinese food in the kitchen of the modest condominium in East Boston that doubles as Consolidated's headquarters and the home of his daughter, Rebecca, who is a student at Harvard. "The world has to want this to happen."
Peterson Builders Inc., a Sturgeon Bay, Wis.-based shipyard that will serve as the lead yard for mini-liners, and Bollinger Machine Shop and Shipyard in Lockport, La., which expects to build the first multiliners, are projecting savings of 50 percent or more from mass producing the vessels instead of building them one at a time. Those savings would make them cost-competitive with overseas shipyards that pay lower wages. High volumes would justify investment in new equipment, which would cut costs for other types of ships, said Larry Maples, Peterson's chief financial officer.

THE hurdles to Mr. Brainard's success, however, are formidable. Getting enough backing to finance a large number of Russian fleets, for example, would require Congress to increase the limits on Ex-Im Bank exposure to the former Soviet Union or to provide other forms of guarantees.
The biggest wild card may be how much of a premium Consolidated's fleets can charge for higher-quality fish. Mr. Brainard's earlier longlining venture failed after overfishing in the Georges Bank, off New England, flooded the market with product, sending overall prices of fish to much lower levels than he and his investors had projected.
There are also tough marketing and distribution questions. For example, Consolidated's transportation consultant, Robert Maidman, president of Romar International Inc., based in Columbia, Md., is working to find freight that can be "backhauled" to Australia so that chartered flights bringing fish from Papua New Guinea do not end up returning empty to the western Pacific.
Mr. Brainard said Consolidated is negotiating with "a major food distribution company" to handle the fish once they arrive in the United States. Most fresh fish is distributed by several regional firms that would be harder to integrate into Consolidated's scheme.
And then there's Consolidated, which Mr. Brainard said needs to hire a person to run the company as it approaches commercialization. Consolidated currently has no employees -- all work is done for it on contract and Mr. Brainard has donated his time.
Mr. Brainard said a private sale of stock would eventually account for about 40 percent of Consolidated's equity. A public offering would be made of 9 percent of the shares. He expects to transfer the remaining 51 percent to a charitable foundation devoted to conservation projects.
Mr. Brainard does not figure to be easily fazed if Consolidated's future is bumpy. Last year, when Tenacity was being overhauled, he found himself sailing a rented yacht as Hurricane Bob approached New England. Unable to convince anyone to go with him, he set off alone for Maine in an attempt to outrun the storm rather than risk damage to the boat in port. The storm caught up but Mr. Brainard emerged unscathed.
"It actually worked out that I came away with some ideas for improving the ability of our longliners to survive typhoons," he said cheerfully.
 
 
 
WHEN LONGLINING WORKS BEST
 Longlining is environmentally sounder than trawling, but just how much better depends on the skills of the fishermen and the species targeted.
Longliners may use 4,000 hooks or more when going after species like tuna, or 10 times that many when pursuing bottom-swimmers like halibut and cod. The type of bait and hook or trap used results in a large proportion of the prey being mature individuals of the target species.
Longliners can work effectively even when a target species moves into another's spawning grounds because spawning fish will not take bait.
By contrast, even the most careful trawling results in waste and, when bottom fishing, in destruction of fish habitats on the seabed. Studies show that huge numbers of young fish of the target species are killed before they have reproduced, along with other marine creatures that often are simply tossed overboard. Immature fish theoretically small enough to escape through a trawler's net can find their passage blocked by larger fish.
Longliners also have a quality advantage because they land and handle fish one by one as lines are retrieved. But even advocates of longliners say they are not suitable for species that move in dense schools near the surface, like herring, or in the seabed, like scallops.

COMPANIES
 
It's Hard Times at Canada's Giant Olympia & York 

 
The superlatives are hard to control when discussing the Reichmanns of Canada, one of the wealthiest families in the world. Paul, Ralph and Albert Reichmann own the world's biggest collection of real estate, including some of the most ambitious projects anywhere, like the World Financial Center in Manhattan and the Canary Wharf project to transform London's docklands into a 71-acre financial district. Now Olympia & York is involved in what may be the largest-ever restructuring of a private company. The company quietly disclosed last week that it had a "liquidity crisis" and was negotiating to rearrange billions of dollars in debt. Paul Reichmann, the company's chief strategist, stepped aside as president in favor of Thomas S. Johnson, former president of Manufacturers Hanover. And Olympia & York retained a number of prominent American and Canadian investment advisers to get to work quickly in stretching out its debt deadlines.
 
Buffett Goes With Guinness . . .
 
Warren E. Buffett became something of a cult figure by getting exceedingly rich on Wall Street using techniques that can be comprehended even on Main Street. Mr. Buffett's gimmick, which seemed exotic in the 1980's, was to take large stakes in companies whose products he believed in or whose management he admired and then hold the stock for the long term. This has worked extremely well with the likes of Coca-Cola, Geico and Capital Cities-ABC. Now there is a new name in the lineup: Guinness. Mr. Buffett, through his control of Berkshire Hathaway, has invested $264 million in the British brewer. Mr. Buffett, who has made a point in the past of saying how much he enjoys Cherry Coke, did not specifically praise any of the Guinness products, which include Johnnie Walker, Dewar's, Gordon's and a number of other liquor brands.
 
. . . But Plans a Salomon Exit
 
Mr. Buffett has been chairman and chief executive of Salomon Inc. since the firm's former leadership was ousted in the wake of the scandal involving bids at Treasury auctions. The embarrassments keep cropping up. Last week, for instance, it came out that the top two executives at the time of the investment firm's transgressions claim they are owed about $24 million in back pay, bonuses and severance. And it developed that the company is paying $1,000 a day to put up Mr. Buffett's hand-picked second-in-command, Deryck Maughan, and his family in a Manhattan residential hotel.
 
. . . As Another Gaffe Surfaces
 
In the meantime, there is one more Salomon embarrassment to look into, one apparently caused by bumbling rather than venality. On Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average dropped an estimated 16 points in the last five minutes of trading. Reason? A Salomon clerk apparently made a mistake, instructing a computer to sell 11 million shares, rather than $11 million worth, of various stocks. Fortunately, some of the sales were not executed, and Salomon said it would repair the damage to the owner of the shares through other trades. But many on Wall Street said the incident showed the market's vulnerability to errors in this era of instantaneous trades by computer.
 
McDonald's on the Road
 
McDonald's, which sometimes seems to have a restaurant on every corner, may soon seem to have an outdoor ad on every road. The company is planning its first national billboard campaign, using 20,000 signs. The fast food company said the project, which will begin on May 1, would be the largest outdoor advertising campaign ever for a single brand.
 
Rockwell's Environmental Fine
 
Rockwell International pleaded guilty to violating Federal hazardous waste laws and agreed to pay a fine of $18.5 million for its management of the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant near Denver. The plant is said to have released cancer-causing chemicals into streams and to have burned hazardous wastes. But Rockwell said it had agreed to the settlement only to save the cost of a trial and it maintained that the Department of Energy, which owned the giant plant, had made policy decisions that produced the shortcomings at the plant. A Federal judge deferred a hearing on Rockwell's guilty plea until June 1.
 
Chicago's Very Own Gambling?
Hilton Hotels, Circus Circus and Caesars World have proposed investing $2 billion to build a gambling and entertainment center that would cover more than 100 acres in Chicago. The project would include casinos and hotels as well as a sports arena and theme park. Chicago's Mayor, Richard Daley, quickly backed the idea, but Gov. Jim Edgar indicated that he had serious reservations about allowing land-based casinos in Illinois.

 
 
ECONOMY

 
At Last, a Healthy Income Gain
 
The conventional wisdom is that if the United States is to have a solid economic recovery, consumers must lead the way. At last, there are signs that they may have the wherewithal to do so. In February, personal income advanced 1.1 percent, the largest monthly gain in more than three years.
 
Sales of existing homes also rose strongly in February, gaining 9.3 percent and reaching the highest sales rate in three years.
 
Little Hope for the Deficit

In the wake of a string of huge budget deficits in recent years, the White House Office of Management and Budget last year made a comforting prediction: that the Federal budget would have a surplus in 1996. Now that prediction has been sharply adjusted. The O.M.B.'s new projection is that the Federal budget will do no better than record a deficit of $180 billion in 1996 and worsen after that.
 
Redel at the Comex
 
Donna Redel was elected chairwoman of the Commodity Exchange of New York, becoming the first woman to lead a United States futures exchange. She will also be the first head of the Comex to be paid -- the salary is $125,000 a year. There are plenty of problems. Volume of trading in precious metals futures and options has been dropping, and new products have not filled the gap. Still, hope persists that a merger can be worked out with the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange.
 
Sayonara, the Tax Bill
 
The tax bill, passed just under President Bush's March 20 deadline and promptly vetoed, died with a whimper last week as the House failed to muster a majority to override. The sense of urgency that existed when President Bush set his deadline two months ago seems to have dissipated.
 
The 13 Percent Solution
 
With Congress's tax plan out of the way, attention turned to the plan offered by the new No. 2 Democratic candidate, former Gov. Edmund G. Brown of California. His approach is very simple: a flat income tax of 13 percent and a 13 percent value-added tax, which is like a sales tax imposed on wholesale as well as retail sales. The only deductions for income taxes would be for charitable contributions and for mortgage or rent payments. This feature, Jerry Brown says, means that middle-class and low-income people would pay less than they do now. But many others maintain that the biggest advantages would go to the wealthy, as they did with the previous attempt to simplify the tax structure: the 1986 tax law.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
Chrysler Sheds More Mitsubishi

Chrysler, which has said it will spend about $13 billion in a three-year modernization program, has raised about $205 million by selling almost half of its remaining stake in Mitsubishi Motors of Japan. It is left with control of less than 5.9 percent of the Japanese company's stock, down from a high of 24 percent. Last year Mitsubishi bought Chrysler's half of their Diamond Star joint venture. Besides raising cash, the sale continues Chrysler's process of disengaging from its Japanese alliance. Chrysler's chairman, Lee Iacocca, has been a vocal critic of Japanese auto sales in the United States, and his designated successor, Robert Eaton, has suggested that American auto makers have been selling too many Japanese cars.
 
Banks Neatening Up Overseas

Not too long ago, a bank's weakness could be measured in large part by the size of its foreign loan portfolio. Then it was real estate loans. Now, it develops, prospects of collecting on some past-due loans involving overseas borrowers are improving. American bankers reported this week that they were making progress in talks with officials of Brazil and Argentina about repaying overdue interest and rescheduling their debt. It appeared, in fact, that some of the loans might end up having more value than is now shown on the banks' books.
 
Perrier Goes to the Swiss
 
When the Agnelli family of Italy acquired a big stake in Source Perrier from Exor S.A. three months ago without consulting influential members of the French business establishment, it set off a concerted effort to prevent the Italians from gaining total control of the bottled water company. In the end, Perrier agreed to be acquired for $2.7 billion by the Swiss, namely Nestle, which had allied itself with BSN of France. For Nestle, already the world's largest food maker, the acquisition means a sudden rush to the forefront of the mineral water business. But the Agnellis did not do badly. They will receive a big profit on their Perrier shares and collect extensive Paris real estate and the prestigious Chateau Margaux vineyard. Even with the settlement, however, Perrier's fate is not yet sealed. The European Community Commission said it would investigate whether the sale violates European rules on free competition.

Mr. Taxes in the House . . .

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
This, many thought, was to have been the finale for Dan Rostenkowski, the year the 64-year-old chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee would pack up his gavel and, after 17 terms, slip into a comfortable steak-and-golf retirement.
As he contemplated the political twists that kept him from becoming Speaker of the House or Mayor of Chicago, Mr. Rostenkowski would be consoled by such legislative successes as the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and the leftover campaign contributions -- in his case, about $1 million -- that those retiring by the end of this Congressional session could take along. 
 Instead, the Chicago Democrat decided to stay on and has just survived a bruising primary battle in a redrawn district. And far from putting tax legislation behind him, he now finds himself in the awkward position of believing no tax bill should be passed this year but being responsible, for political reasons, for trying to push one through anyhow.
"The one time I agree with the economists," Mr. Rostenkowski said recently, referring to near-unanimous professional advice urging inaction, "I'm forced to do something other than sit on my fanny and do nothing. The political climate insists that we have something."
That something is still to come, however. A week ago, Mr. Rostenkowski closeted himself with Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, to iron out differences between Democratic tax plans. The compromise legislation was passed by both houses but immediately vetoed by President Bush, who objected, among other things, to an increase in the top tax rate and challenged Congress to pass instead the seven-point economic program he proposed in January. Last Wednesday, the House failed to override the veto.
Whether any tax changes will become law this Presidential election year is unclear, but what seems certain is that Mr. Rostenkowski will play a central role in the jockeying to come. Mr. Bush's veto, he said last week, was "a declaration of political war against the Congress."

Henry Bloch's Season to Shine

 BODY:
It's that time of year again, the homestretch before the April 15 deadline for filing tax returns.
For Henry W. Bloch, the 69-year-old chairman of H & R Block Inc., it has been a typical tax season -- with a twist. 
 As in years past, Mr. Bloch has been busy starring in advertisements and commercials for Block, by far the nation's largest tax preparation company. Mr. Bloch's appearances are designed to alert taxpayers to the latest changes in the law -- and, of course, to drum up more business for the company he co-founded with his brother Richard in 1955.
There's plenty to tell taxpayers this year, said Mr. Bloch. Among other things, he said one recent day before rushing off to tape a television spot, most taxpayers are not aware that the requirements to qualify for the so-called earned income credit have been loosened.
And many people will attempt to write off credit card interest even though 1990 was the last year it was deductible.
"We live in a plastic-oriented society," Mr. Bloch said. "There are some people who will be sorely disappointed that the interest they pay on their cards cannot be deducted."
The twist in Mr. Bloch's routine was his announcement earlier this month that he had passed the title of chief executive to his son Thomas. The younger Mr. Bloch, who is 38, had already been president and chief operating officer.
"It is nice to build something up," Henry Bloch said after the March 17 announcement, "and then be able to pass the running of the company on to someone in the family."
But the senior Mr. Bloch has no intention of retiring, either. He will remain as chairman, overseeing strategic planning for the company, which is based in Kansas City, Mo., and is spelled Block for easy recognition. Last year, Block had revenues of $1.2 billion and net earnings of $140 million.
Although the chain already prepares about 12.4 million returns -- roughly one out of every nine that are filed -- Mr. Bloch sees more growth as the tax law becomes ever more complex. And he hopes to make acquisitions related to Block's non-tax businesses. The company already owns the computer database Compuserve and a temporary-help concern called Personnel Pool of America.
But that's in the future. These days, Mr. Bloch is still keeping busy awakening taxpayers to the dangers he sees lurking all around them. One of his biggest concerns: that employers are now withholding less from paychecks, courtesy of President Bush, who saw the move as a way to prime the economy. The problem, said Mr. Bloch, is that many people could find themselves with tax bills instead of refunds next year. (The change can be undone by filing a new W-4 form with employers.)
"Taxpayers tend to blame their preparers when they owe money," said Mr. Bloch, in what amounted to a pre-emptive strike. "In this case, they should blame the tax man."

. . . and in the White House

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
On tax policy as well as almost every other aspect of economic and domestic affairs, Richard G. Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, was the dominant figure in the first three years of the Bush Administration.
He was the driving force behind the sweeping budget compromise the Administration struck with Congress in 1990, which caused President Bush to break his campaign promise of "no new taxes." And he is the primary architect of the tax policies the President wants enacted this year, including a lower capital gains tax. 
 Mr. Darman, who is 48, has held Government positions most of his adult life. He has been in every Republican Administration since Richard M. Nixon's, working in six Cabinet departments and the Reagan White House. As Deputy Treasury Secretary in the mid-80's, he was more responsible than any other official for gaining enactment of the monumental Tax Reform Act of 1986.
No one else in the Administration has Mr. Darman's understanding of the agencies, programs and inner workings of the Federal Government, and he has years of experience in dealing with Congress. Independently wealthy and a graduate of the Harvard Business School, Mr. Darman has told interviewers he has no professional ambition other than to hold top Government positions.
But Mr. Darman has a quirky personality, many enemies and strong views that are often at odds with the Republican Party's right wing, and that may prove to be his undoing. Indeed, he has become a lightning rod for criticism of Administration policies from the right.
Samuel K. Skinner, who became White House chief of staff in December, is said by some insiders to want to clip Mr. Darman's wings. In January, Mr. Skinner forced him to stop the presses that were printing final budget documents and excise politically sensitive passages about health care. The passages suggested how to slow the growth of Medicaid and Medicare to help finance tax credits and other assistance for people without health insurance.
Some Administration officials expected Mr. Darman to resign. But others say President Bush believes him to be indispensable and will go to great lengths to keep him around.

HEADLINE: The Executive Life;
A Forthright Manager, A [Expletive] Trial

BYLINE: By Mary Billard; Michael S. Malone writes frequently about Silicon Valley from Los Altos, Calif.

DATELINE: LOS ALTOS, Calif.

 BODY:
A few years back, a profile by Tom Wolfe in Esquire of Silicon Valley pioneer Robert Noyce described how, in the early 60's, the employees of Fairchild Semiconductor, one of several companies he founded, gathered at the windows to gawk at a limousine and driver. Limos are no longer an oddity in Silicon Valley, but in this down-to-earth culture any symbol of social stratification still causes squemishness. That is evident in the periodic failed attempts to establish here that bastion of East Coast urban life, the private club.
"The high-tech community doesn't have much use for things like this," said Paul Franson of the public relations firm of Hagerty & Associates in San Jose. "They don't go out to fancy lunches. You're lucky to have a sandwich at your desk." 
 Exclusive clubs in Silicon Valley have had to open their gates to the rabble to stay in business. Courtside in Los Gatos had to open its restaurant almost immediately to the public. The De Anza Racquet Club, near the Cupertino headquarters of Apple Computer Inc., went broke and is now owned by the City of Cupertino. The Decathlon Club, perhaps the most celebrated of these ventures, quietly opened its dining room to the public, too.
Now comes a new contender for the patronage of patrician-pretenders: the Silicon Valley Capital Club, part of a Dallas-based chain operating in the West. While many of its counterparts bowed to the 80's gestalt by emphasizing fitness and fine dining, the Capital Club, atop the tallest office building in the redeveloping downtown of San Jose, has forgone lockers and racquetball courts in favor of wood paneling and neoclassical furniture. The only people who break into a sweat here are the waiters.
With many of the hot little start-up companies now residing on the Fortune 500, it is betting that aging tycoons are tired of equality and ready for a private club. Since it opened in 1989, the club has grown to 850 members, despite a $2,400 individual initiation fee and dues of $79 a month. But there is not much Silicon Valley in the Silicon Valley Capital Club. Most members are lawyers, accountants and bankers from downtown San Jose. So where are all those powerful electronics tycoons? "Maybe it's the mystique about going to downtown San Jose," said Ellen G. Harris, membership director.
Such organizations are anathema to a place created to contradict the hierarchical East Coast business establishment. Here, entrepreneurship, building one's life from scratch, rules -- and the guy in the Grateful Dead T-shirt sometimes turns out to be the vice president of research and development. The industry's two most important role models, Bill Hewlett and David Packard, were unassuming engineers who ate in the company cafeteria with the rest of the staff. In their wake, even an executive dining room seems unnecessarily plutocratic. Combine this self-conscious commonness with the demands of a 90-hour work week and it is no mystery why executives might rather go for a three-mile run than to an exclusive dining room for a meal bulging with cholesterol.
High expectations may also work against the club's success. "Back East, because there are so many private clubs, many of them around for literally hundreds of years, there is a much greater tolerance of the form," said Tom Fanella, president of the local PBS affiliate, KTEH. "In Silicon Valley, the Capital Club is the first of its kind and people have very high expectations. I personally think it's a nice private club, -- if you can call anything with 1,000 members private. It's a good place from which to see and not a bad place to be seen."
Norman C. Hulberg, president of Hulberg & Associates Inc. real estate appraisers, points out a subtler deterrent. "Some clients say, gee, this is a nice place; I'm glad Hulberg is successful enough to take me here," said Mr. Hulberg. "But some will resent that I can afford to belong to such a place, so I have to be careful."
Mr. Franson, a charter member, finds the place fine for press conferences, but otherwise "pretentious." "People with taste giggle about it," he said. "At dinner, there's the clicking of covers, the intrusive service, waiters calling you endlessly by name, frozen forks, giant pepper mills and all the other cliches you've ever heard of. I suppose it's not a bad place to take an out-of-town client -- if you don't mind the waiter being part of your group."
But perhaps the most telling assessment comes from another charter member, Jack Gorry, chief executive of CXR Corporation, which makes electronic medical instruments in San Jose. "All the Capital Club is is a high-class restaurant," he said. "It wanted to be a club but nobody showed up. That's because you can't do business and socialize at the same time. It's a contradiction in terms -- and that's why most clubs here haven't worked."
Mr. Gorry belongs to the one private club in San Jose that works, the century-old Sainte Claire Club. Tucked into a modest three-story brick building just five blocks from the Capital Club, Sainte Claire is everything the upstart is not: small (120 members), anachronistic (all-male) and expensive ($35,000 initiation). It does not try to meld business and pleasure. Its one fast rule: no papers or briefcases allowed. Mr. Gorry aside, the Sainte Claire Club has not a single member even remotely connected with Silicon Valley.
Meanwhile, the Capital Club becomes less exclusive. A recent letter to members proudly announced that guests would now be allowed to pay for members' meals.

HEADLINE: Back to Basics? Turn to Natural Gas . . .

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Talk About a Slogan for the Back-to-Basics 90's: Electrify!" (Technology, March 8) cites an example that debunks the "ecowatts" theory -- a high-efficiency natural-gas glass melter. Many many more could have been cited. The glass furnace will be 20 percent more efficient than conventional glass melters and 40 percent less expensive than electric equipment. It will also lower emissions of carbon dioxide -- all by direct use of natural gas. 
 Although the ecowatts concept is simplistically appealing, it is critically flawed. Efficiency improvements and emissions reductions have been driven in large part by an entire new generation of gas equipment -- efficient residential furnaces, fast-food cooking equipment and industrial processes. Coming down the road is a gas heat pump that heats and cools homes for the lowest cost of any energy option. (Let's see ecowatts match that!)
Electricity is important to America's future. And natural gas will be used in large volumes to produce it cleanly. But there is also a role for the direct use of clean, efficient gas. Unlike new power plants, gas is one resource that is economical and abundant in North America.

HEADLINE: Time to Build a Job Engine

 BODY:
To the Editor:
America cannot survive as a world industrial power without an economic plan to deal with the global economy ("Will Aerospace Be the Next Casualty?" March 15). During World War II, President Roosevelt created the War Production Board to meet the challenge of Nazism. The board, staffed with industry members, built the greatest industrial machine the world had ever seen. Now, we have lost our job engine, the manufacturing sector that for decades gave us world economic leadership. 
 To survive as a world economic power we need to establish an independent Industrial Policy Board staffed by people from the business community, whose agenda would be:
* Assume full responsibility for all trade agreements. All other government agencies involved in the trade process would relinquish this authority.
* Identify those industries essential to the welfare of the United States and establish mechanisms to revive these industries.
The board could accomplish these objectives by introducing a market sharing policy, identifying which portions of our market should be dedicated to domestic manufacturers. We have a precedent. Our Government has such a policy for the United States steel industry, which is assured 80 percent of the United States market. We protect the peanut and sugar cane growers. Why not jobs for our workers in industry?
Introducing market sharing would create a revival of manufacturing in America. These job engines would create millions of well-paying jobs for our citizens, reduce welfare and poverty and make available to this and future generations an opportunity to realize the Great American Dream.
The alternative is to see America sink into a third world economic status.

BYLINE: By Jed Stevenson

 BODY:

Exposition Anniversary
The very first United States commemorative coin is 100 years old this year. The controversy it stirred has long since abated; it is easily acquired today as a curiosity or to start a collection of American commemoratives. 
 The 1892 Columbian Exposition half-dollar began life in 1892 after the exposition's manager proposed that 40 million of the coins be minted as admission tokens. But Congress agreed to an order of only five million coins, to be sold at twice their 50-cent face value. Money from their sale was to help pay for thee fair, in Chicago. Congress also ordered that the Mint at Philadelphia strike the commemoratives, using silver recycled from older United States coins.
The coin's designers thought of using a portrait of Columbus, but in 1893, few people had any idea what he looked like. Old paintings were studied, statues photographed, fanciful drawings drawn, to design the definitive portrait of Columbus.
The designer of the coin's obverse, Charles E. Barber, copied from a plaster model by Olin Levi Warner, whose own model had been a 1892 Spanish medal modeled from a statue. The statue had been modeled on a portrait in the Spanish Naval Museum; the artist was a Frenchman, Charles Legrand.
As for the reverse side, the designer, George T. Morgan, used a Spanish replica of the Santa Maria as his main model. He placed the ship atop two globes, the Old and New Worlds.
Criticism of the designs was quick in coming. Newspapers said Columbus looked like Sitting Bull, Daniel Webster or Henry Ward Beecher.
At any rate, the commemorative's Columbus had not the dashing good looks expected of a fearless explorer. Even the reverse came in for some criticism, with charges that the Santa Maria looked like a wagon on wheels.
But the mint kept striking the coins. In 1892 950,000 were minted, 4,052,105 in 1893. Selling the 50-cent coins for a dollar was hard going in an economy in which the average working man made $6 or $7 a week.
When the Columbian Exposition closed in 1893, 3.6 million coins were still unsold.
In 1894, the Government sent them into general circulation to be used at face value. Suddenly, the coins bought for a dollar were worth only what was printed along the rim of the obverse -- "half dollar."
Ultimately, about half the coins were melted.
Even so, the Columbian Exposition half dollar was a familiar piece of pocket change around the turn of the century.
Today, commemoratives of lesser grade can still be bought fairly cheaply; they are the ones that show the battering that pocket change gets. Better examples, looking as though they had never been touched, can sell for hundreds or even thousands of dollars.
 
Mint Offers 3 Olympic Coins

The United States Mint has begun offering a set of three Olympic coins. The set is composed of one five-dollar gold piece, a silver dollar and a half-dollar copper coin clad in nickel.
The gold coin depicts a sprinter, while the silver one shows a pitcher in motion. The clad coin is of a gymnast. The reverses of all three use the five interlocking rings of the Olympic Games.
The half-dollar in proof grade, the finest, is $9.50, while the silver dollar is $32. The gold $5 in proof is $230.
In uncirculated grades, the coins are slightly less. Various sets consisting of different combinations of the coins are also available. The most complete is a six-coin set of three proof coins and three uncirculated coins. It costs $445.
A portion of the price of each coin or set goes to the United States Olympic Committee for the training of athletes. For more information, call (800) 572-8326.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
It's 1992, and No One Is Leading Europe's March to Unity

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
After nearly three years of epochal change and grand visions of the future, the European Community, much like the United States, is bogged down in the mundane realities of recession and parochial politics.
What Europe seems to lack is a leader articulating a clear vision of where the community is going and what its ultimate purpose is, now that the certainties of the cold war have been replaced by uncertainty and economic chaos in the countries that used to make up the Soviet Union. 
 European unity is more easily said than done, something the 12 heads of state and government who negotiated the Treaty on European Union in Maastricht, the Netherlands, a little over three months ago would all probably agree on now. At Maastricht, they decided in principle to create "an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe" by introducing a common currency as early as 1997, making more foreign policy decisions together, and eliminating most internal border controls in the barrier-free market that they plan to complete by the end of this year.
But instead of coming into its own as the world's largest and most prosperous market, eclipsing the United States and surging ahead with elan toward ever greater economic and political union, Europe is in a slump.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany might have been the man to lead the way out of the crisis, but he and his country have been too preoccupied with the political and economic difficulties of German unification to know how to do that. One way or another, however, Germany seems fated to define Europe's destiny, which would be much diminished if the Germans decided to go it alone. Mr. Kohl saw European union as the best way to anchor the new, united Germany in the changed strategic environment. At Maastricht, he was one of the principal proponents of monetary union, cooperation in foreign policy and harmonization of social and labor relations among the member states, a principle agreed to in the "social chapter" of the treaty by all of them except Britain.
 
Jitters in Germany
 But since then, many Germans have become increasingly worried not only about how to pay for unification, but also about who will be asked to pay to keep Russia, Ukraine and the rest from utter collapse. They fear that it will be them, and that they can't afford it. Unification proved far more expensive than Mr. Kohl had led his voters to expect in 1990, and government borrowing set off an inflationary spiral that the German central bank, the Bundesbank, has moved to control. Now Germany, no longer in a boom, faces recession.
The Social Democrats, who control the upper house of the German legislature, the Bundesrat, complained that Mr. Kohl had sold out the mark for a nebulous new "European Currency Unit" to be controlled by a European central bank, without insisting in return on new democratic powers for the European Parliament to watch over the financiers. Until this month, they were threatening to block ratification of the treaty. This threat has eased, but the states now want input of their own into community decisions. Both Germany and Mr. Kohl seem to be in an irritable mood, resentful of all efforts to circumscribe their freedom, as shown by Mr. Kohl's insistence Friday on having lunch with the ostracized President of Austria, Kurt Waldheim.
From the start, the axis of the European Community has been French-German cooperation, but France's President, Francois Mitterrand, has been thrown seriously off stride. He and his Socialist Party are deeply unpopular after a decade in office. His strategic vision for Europe, if there is one, is apparently to seek German cooperation in a new European military capability that would shoulder the United States, politically and militarily, out of its strategic position in Europe.
 
Campaigning in Britain
 Britain has always resisted this strongly, and under Prime Minister John Major and his predecessor Margaret Thatcher, it also put a brake on any attempt by the other Europeans to move toward a more federal union. Questions about Europe have had no impact in the British general election campaign, which is preoccupied with arguments about the income tax and proposals to change the National Health Service. But if the opposition Labor Party wins on April 9, its leader, Neil Kinnock, promises to sign onto the "social chapter" on principles of labor relations and fair compensation agreed to by the 11 other states at Maastricht, and to go ahead with monetary union if Britain qualifies and Parliament approves. Still, leading a party that campaigned against British membership in the European Community less than a decade ago, it is doubtful that Mr. Kinnock could emerge as a visionary European leader, any more than the pragmatic and low-key Mr. Major.
At last count, more than 80 percent of the measures necessary to implement a single European market without trade barriers this year had been adopted, leaving mostly petty disputes to be resolved: Spain currently permits bananas to be imported only from the Madeiras, for instance. But in some countries the Maastricht treaty itself has become unexpectedly ensnared in domestic politics.
Ireland negotiated a protocol to the treaty that safeguards the anti-abortion provisions added to its constitution in 1983. But after last month's political crisis over a teen-aged rape victim who was briefly barred from traveling to England for an abortion, Prime Minister Albert Reynolds wants to redraft the protocol to include an affirmation of the general right to freedom of movement between Ireland and other community countries, and the right to "lawful information" on abortion, before submitting the treaty to a referendum. Rejection by Irish voters would kill the treaty altogether.
Spain and Portugal have been disappointed by the failure to make much progress on a fund agreed on at Maastricht that would transfer money from rich northern European countries to their poorer southern cousins. Jacques Delors, the president of the European Community's executive commission, proposed setting up such a $3 billion "cohesion fund" by 1997. But even the Germans were taken aback by another proposal from Mr. Delors -- a plan to raise the community budget over the next five years from $81.9 billion to $107.6 billion, plus inflation. Now, with talk that Mr. Mitterrand may need Mr. Delors to replace Edith Cresson as Prime Minister, the futures of the the expansionary budget and the cohesion fund are in doubt. This leaves the Spaniards, in particular, feeling done in.
 
Differences Over Farms
 In many other important ways, too, momentum has dissipated. A dispute between the United States and the European Community over agricultural policies has snagged negotiations on a new General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which President Bush hoped to conclude by April 15. But no European leader seems willing or able to push through the necessary compromises, making a mockery of two years' worth of pious promises by the leaders of the world's biggest industrial democracies to get a GATT accord.
In addition, Germany showed last winter that a common European foreign policy is a sometime thing at best. The Germans steamrollered over their European partners and recognized Croatia and Slovenia unilaterally as independent republics, hoping to press the Serbs into ending the Yugoslav civil war. It worked, but the other Europeans, who followed suit two weeks later, seemed bruised and battered by the experience.
By the end of this decade, the community will be politically even more amorphous, with at least 15 members. Austria and Sweden have applied to join, and Finland is about to. Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein, the other European Free Trade Association countries, will be non-voting members, in effect, when a free trade zone agreement with the community goes into effect at the end of the year. After that, the question is what to do with Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, which have association agreements and want to become full members. Ukraine, Russia and the other eastern Europeans all want in as well. But what does "Europe" want, except to prosper? For the moment, nobody seems to know.

HEADLINE: CIRCUIT BREAKER;
The 'Longest of Long Shots' Is Suddenly a Contender

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Where did Jerry Brown come from? What does he stand for? Where, if anywhere, is he going? What's going on around here, anyway?
It is an improbable political year, and not only in the United States. In France, the party structure seems to be fracturing, with the left the big loser. In Britain, the left, meaning the Labor party, seems within reach of a parliamentary majority, which many doubted that it would ever again approach. In the first months of the post-cold war era, electoral politics everywhere is full of doubt and contradiction as voters grope for a way forward. 
 But nowhere has there been anything more startling than the emergence of Edmund G. Brown Jr., a former governor of California, son of another former governor, twice a failure as a national candidate, underfinanced, underorganized and understaffed, as a major contender for the Presidency.
It is said that the news media and the political professionals "missed" his candidacy, in the sense that they noticed it late in the game. Perhaps. But in that sense, they missed the candidacy of Paul E. Tsongas, too, until Mr. Tsongas started moving up in the polls in New Hampshire as Bill Clinton began to falter.
From the start, Mr. Clinton got attention, not always the kind he wanted, because he had the most money, the most big-name backers, the best organization. Such candidates don't always win (Edmund S. Muskie in 1972, is a notable example of one who didn't), but they are always strong contenders, at least for a time. Mr. Tsongas got himself noticed by winning New Hampshire.
Bob Kerrey and Tom Harkin got a little more attention than Mr. Brown, though it didn't help them much, because they were the only senators in the race and senators often end up with Presidential or Vice Presidential nominations -- Kennedy, Nixon, McGovern, Johnson, Humphrey, Quayle, for a few recent examples.
 
Out of the Swim
 Only very, very rarely does someone so far out of the political swim as Jerry Brown, who last held political office almost a decade ago, manage to win the Presidential nomination of a major party. John W. Davis, a Wall Street lawyer who had served a lone term as a member of Congress, emerged from a deadlocked Democratic convention on the 103d ballot in 1924, and Wendell L. Willkie, a charismatic utilities lawyer and executive, won the thankless task of running against Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940.
So as Mr. Brown wandered through the early primaries, winning less than 10 per cent where the press was watching, in New Hampshire and South Dakota, Georgia and Maryland, winning nothing on Super Tuesday, doing best in the West (Colorado and Utah) while Mr. Tsongas and Mr. Clinton dueled elsewhere, he got short shrift.
He was able to last, when rivals could not, for the same reason he was so little noticed in the early going: the unorthodox nature of his effort. A campaign that uses little or no television advertising, a candidate who sleeps in backers' spare rooms, an entourage limited to a few people, needs little money to keep going.
Mr. Brown's fortunes were transformed by three things: the withdrawal of first Mr. Harkin and then Mr. Tsongas, which left him as the only viable alternative to Mr. Clinton; the shift of the electoral terrain to northern industrial states, where he could capitalize on the fear among industrial workers displaced by a rapid shift toward a service economy and increased foreign competition; and his success in finally amassing enough money (in the $100 increments to which he has limited himself) to get his message on television, albeit not very extensively, in Michigan and Connecticut.
In Michigan, with its crumbling auto industry, he finished second to Mr. Clinton, edging out Mr. Tsongas, who was still an active candidate. Last Tuesday in Connecticut, another economically battered state, which has a habit of backing mavericks, he won his first nationally spotlighted victory. Not until then, the 18th primary of the year, did his vote total exceed 30 percent.
Mr. Brown has had plenty of emotions to play on -- generalized contempt for politicians, dissatisfaction with the quality of the Presidential field and substantial doubts about the trustworthiness and electability of Bill Clinton.
He has done so with skill. Call him a hypocrite or a Johnny-come-lately in his condemnation of big money in politics, recall his years as a champion money-raiser as chairman of the California Democrats, fighting to get contribution limits relaxed, and he makes himself sound like Paul on the road to Damascus, a man who suddenly saw the light. Listening to him work the themes of reform and redemption in New Haven last week, the Rev. Jesse Jackson commented, "We have the Rev. Jerry Brown with us."
That approach makes it difficult to mount an effective challenge to his policies, even though some, like his opposition to fast-track negotiations with Mexico on a free-trade zone, are wildly inconsistent with his earlier positions, and others, like the flat tax, are dismissed by most experts as impractical and undesirable.
By casting himself as the foe of the Establishment, moreover, this scion of a political clan as prominent in California as the Daleys in Chicago, if not the Kennedys in Massachusetts, positions himself to shrug off criticism as the carping of people or institutions threatened by his insurgency. Thus Mr. Clinton and the news media can be portrayed as the voices of corporate interests, lobbyists and out-of-touch officeholders.
 
Getting Ideas
 He is the master of the political gimmick, the catchy idea that sets him apart. The 800 number as a fund-raising tool is one; he used that one in his earlier Presidential efforts in 1976 and 1980. At one time, he favored a balanced budget amendment; now it's the flat tax.
In his role as the fearless teller of truths that others shrink from, he is willing to go well beyond what most politicians will say about members of their own party. In Wisconsin on Friday, for example, he called Mr. Clinton "a Bush look-alike who's mired in conflicts of interest, paid, fueled and financed by the same top 1 percent." In case anyone missed the point, he pressed on: "Clinton is not going to get the nomination. You can put that in your tape recorders and ask me about it in a couple of months."
Most politicians refrain from that kind of slash-and-burn stuff in primary campaigns because they don't want to harm their party or because they know they might need a future favor. After taking a merciless pounding from Mr. Brown in Connecticut for a week, Mr. Clinton called his opponent "my friend Jerry," without sarcasm, in a national television interview.
But Mr. Brown, with nothing to lose, fires away, day after day, despite periodic promises of a more positive tone. Last week, Ron Brown, the party chairman, said he had "crossed the line in terms of inappropriate attacks," but Jerry Brown just picked up that grenade and hurled it back with a crack about a "conspiracy of silence enforced by our political leaders."
If the times were not so unsettled, the temptation would be to say that Mr. Brown, the candidate, cannot possibly win; as it is, he seems "the longest of long shots," as he described himself a week or so ago. But he and his band of guerrilla warriors could certainly do a lot more damage to Mr. Clinton, an already damaged candidate, if they could win in New York or Wisconsin or both on April 7 and in Pennsylvania or Ohio after that. And California's primary, of course, closes the whole extravaganza on June 2.
There are only four options now -- Mr. Clinton, Mr. Brown, a late-starting candidate or a brokered convention. Of the four, the nomination of Mr. Brown, unlikely as the thought may seem, is certainly no less likely than alternatives three and four.

HEADLINE: Selling Out?;
Pushed and Pulled, Environment Inc. Is on the Defensive

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
At stake in the Senate last week were six million acres of the nation's last virgin forests, a green arc of pine sweeping across most of western Montana. In less time than it takes lawmakers to eat lunch, the Senate voted overwhelmingly to make at least one million acres of that wilderness eligible to be cut to the ground.
In the finger-pointing afterward, national environmental groups were criticized for being too complacent. The Wilderness Society and the National Audubon Society did not actively oppose the bill until the last few weeks, said Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate. The National Wildlife Federation, the country's largest environmental group, announced that it had no opinion on the legislation, which still faces consideration in the House. 
 "They talk like Rambo in their fund-raising letters but the big national groups are wimps when it comes to dealing with the bad guys," said Tim Hermach, executive director of the Native Forest Council, a regional environmental group in Eugene, Ore., that opposes logging in national forests.
Brock Evans, vice president for national issues in Washington for the National Audubon Society, conceded that the movement is under siege. "What seems to be selling out is trying to get something done in a very rough situation," he said. "It struck me last summer that we're being savaged on the right and attacked on the left and maybe the center cannot hold."
On one side, leaders of hundreds of state and community environmental groups say the national organizations have become soft and are largely absent from battles over such issues as pollution in minority and rural communities. They also complain that the groups have grown so large and desperate for money that they are accepting financial help from some of the very forces whose disregard for the environment led to the movement.
"We can't get funding from the national environmental groups for our work," said Linda Campbell, director of Southern Women Against Toxics, in Livingston, Ala. "They're nowhere to be seen in our fights."
From another direction have come slashing attacks by land owners, timber companies and energy corporations who say the Wildlife Federation and its sister organizations are too rich, too powerful, and so prone to hyperbole about ecological dangers that the economic cost of environmental protection is threatening the American way of life.
"The big environmental groups in a way polluted themselves with power," said Charles S. Cushman, executive director of the National Inholders Association, a group that represents landowners, ranchers and miners who have property within national parks and forests. "Frankly this movement has become a preservation industry that is mainly interested in preserving itself."
Leaders of the big environmental groups say that much of the criticism comes from polluters posing as born-again populists. "Look behind the fancy rhetoric and you realize this is a movement to bash environmental groups that is funded by the oil and gas industry, the mining industry and the development community," said Jay D. Hair, the president of the National Wildlife Federation.
The national groups say that because they are working in a political arena where they have to compromise, they cannot be as aggressive as the new grassroots coalitions that have sprung up by the dozens in militant response to specific problems. These include groups like the Military Production Network, which works on pollution issues that affect the nuclear weapons industry, and the Virginia-based Citizens Clearinghouse for Hazardous Waste, which -- supporters are quick to point out -- is one of the few nationwide environmental groups headed by a woman.
In the case of the bill to open Montana's wilderness to timbering, mining and oil drilling, staff members of the national environmental groups said they did not want to embarrass Senator Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who negotiated the pact with Montana's Republican Senator, Conrad Burns, in what he said was an effort to balance his state's economic needs with environmental concerns. Mr. Baucus, who has been one of the strongest environmentalists in the Senate, received an award from the Sierra Club for helping defeat a proposal by President Bush last year that would have opened the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling and limited citizens from reviewing proposals for new nuclear power plants. The Senate approved the Montana measure 75 to 22, in large part because it is customary to support the position of a state's two Senators on bills primarily affecting their turf.
To a large extent the assault on environmentalism is a result of the movement's political successes in the last 20 years. As much smaller organizations in the 1970's, the national groups helped to bring about the world's first comprehensive laws for clearing the air, cleaning the water, protecting wild habitat and safeguarding people from pollutants.
In the 1980's leading organizations like Greenpeace, The Nature Conservancy, the Environmental Defense Fund, the Natural Resources Defense Council and the World Wildlife Fund doubled in size. The Wildlife Federation, Audubon and the Natural Resources Defense Council built new headquarters in New York and Washington. Staff members introduced a new array of national and worldwide environmental threats like global climate change, depletion of the atmospheric ozone shield, soil erosion, nuclear contamination, ocean pollution, forest destruction, and the accelerating rate of extinction of plants and animals.
But ever since the passage of the Clean Air Act in the fall of 1990, the groups' influence has waned in Washington and across the country. Efforts by Congress this year to rewrite the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act came to a virtual halt after lawmakers sympathetic to environmental goals determined that both bills could be weakened if they were opened to change.
According to some of the White House's top environmental aides, President Bush has been emboldened by the confusion he sees in the national groups. In January he announced a 90-day moratorium on new regulations and a review intended to weaken or eliminate existing rules. Two weeks ago, he dropped a Clean Air Act regulation requiring auto makers to install equipment to capture gasoline fumes. Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. sided with the coal industry in a case the industry is pressing to dismantle Government enforcement of strip mining laws. The Environmental Protection Agency proposed rules to weaken Federal hazardous waste laws. Agriculture Secretary Edward R. Madigan wants to limit the ability of environmental groups to stop clear cutting in national forests by barring appeals in the agency's administrative courts.
Environmental groups count as their one significant victory in the last two years the defeat of the President's 1991 proposal to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling. The bill's failure, though, was also the result of active protests from the utilities and auto industries, which opposed some of the energy conservation measures.
The environmental groups' problems come amid a recession that has halted growth and made fund-raising a preoccupation. The National Wildlife Federation, the Wilderness Society, the Sierra Club and Greenpeace have all issued layoff notices in the last year and the Natural Resources Defense Council is considering staff cuts. Staff members meanwhile bristle at the six-figure salaries their directors command. Mr. Hair, the president of the National Wildlife Federation, earns $250,000 a year, according to a spokeswoman.
The financial problems have caused some of the organizations to turn for help to the same industrial polluters they have long criticized. The chairman of Waste Management Inc., which has racked up millions of dollars in environmental fines at its landfills and hazardous waste dumps, is a major contributor and sits on the board of the Wildlife Federation. The National Audubon Society's acclaimed "World of Audubon" television documentaries are financed by the General Electric Company, which has been at the top of the E.P.A.'s list of companies with the most superfund toxic waste sites.
Frances Beinecke, deputy director for programs at the Natural Resources Defense Council in New York, said that though the messengers are under siege their message is as important as ever.
"We haven't taken this as seriously as we should have and we're late in responding," she said. "We're still optimistic that the movement as a whole still reflects the commitment of the people in this country to protect fragile resources. But the anti-environmental movement that's developed around the country is a very serious threat to the gains we have made. We have to face up to it and deal with it."

HEADLINE: THE REGION: Q. & A.: Barry F. Sullivan;
New Deputy Mayor, a Banker, Outlines His Business Plan

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins's relations with New York City's business community have often been rocky, but last week he hired a high-powered repairman who won Wall Street's cheers. Barry F. Sullivan, a 61-year-old career banker who retired as chairman of the First Chicago Corporation, is the new deputy mayor for finance and economic development. He succeeds Sally B. Hernandez-Pinero, who left to head the city Housing Authority.
Mr. Sullivan will continue to earn $780,000 a year as a consultant to First Chicago -- more than the pay of the next five deputy mayors combined -- and give his $112,000 city salary to charity. "We're frankly all a little scared of him," one senior mayoral aide said. 
 That is clearly how some in the business community, frustrated with the administration's handling of fiscal policy, want City Hall to feel. Mr. Sullivan was recruited by his old boss at Chase Manhattan, David Rockefeller, but says he will not serve the private sector only and knows that broader interests must be weighed. It remains to be seen just how the former Georgetown basketball star, who still speaks in the streetwise accents of his native Bronx, will fit in as the Mayor tries to cope with the recession. Sarah Bartlett and Todd S. Purdum of the Times metropolitan staff discussed his agenda with him last week.
Q. What is your analysis of the city's problems?
A. The key issue as the economy recovers is: will the city be sensitive to the recovery, or will it lag? The four-year plan [the city's projected budget plan] uses about a year's worth of lag to the national recovery. That's a fairly conservative view.
Q. Do you share that view?
A. I don't know. It really depends upon how sensitive the financial community is to the recovery. I think the investment banking side is going to be reasonably sensitive, but the commercial banking side may not be. And the commercial banking side is a big employer. And it's got the Chemical-Manufacturers Hanover merger as part of its digestion process.
Q. How can the city jump start or guide the economy?
A. Well, the first thing is that you've got to retain what you have. But retention tends to be retaining the larger firms. They tend not to be the engines of growth. But if you lose them, you're dead. You can't let the base erode. My suspicion is that by the end of '93 the retention game will be won or lost. But it doesn't cause employment growth, and that gets you into small and medium-sized businesses. And that is a much more difficult game in terms of how you help them grow. Another area that we've got to think about is international business. We're obviously a natural point of attraction.
Q. Do you have any opinions yet on the manufacturing sector and what you'd like to see done to help it?
A. Markets work. And to the extent that certain kinds of activities are able to be better done somewhere else, you watch the pull of the market. Then you watch the city saying, how can we provide some incentives that affect the operation of markets, one of which is tax abatements? And manufacturing just may be a harder one to deal with than some of the other kinds you can deal with. But I wouldn't give up on it.
Q. What did your experience in Chicago teach you?
A. I would say there's two things. One is that the political process really does take more factors into consideration than the business process -- and it ought to. And secondly, the time horizon for the political process is longer. On the whole, government will make a decision 18 months after the business community will make it.
Q. Is it the role of the deputy mayor to make sure there is no additional lag?
A. You also have a deputy mayor for economic development as a recognition that when you're adding up the gross city product, the private sector is the biggest part of that. And you ought to, as a government, pay a lot of attention to that. They're the provider of tax resources and a variety of other things. And it seems to me that one of the things that David Dinkins has done is to take the risk of hiring someone who presumably knows the private sector game and, armed with the right facts, will be an advocate for the private sector -- and do it in a way where the Mayor and the other people will have to at least listen.
Q. Did the Mayor give you any explicit charge?
A. Not as in, "Barry, I wish you'd do the following." But, I would say, a feeling that he certainly wants to have a good relationship with the business community. And I know he expects me to say to him, "This is what I think you have to do to have those relationships." And I think part of it is, "Help me explain to them what we're doing."
Q. Did you ask for any explicit commitments?
A. No, I figure that I know how to figure out what we ought to do, and if I can't persuade him, then I'm the problem.
Q. So, you've made peace with the fact that you'll make recommendations to him that sometimes . . .
A. Sure. He's the C.E.O. I'm not the C.E.O. here. I ought to recommend what I think ought to be done. And from time to time, he's going to turn it down. If he turns me down a lot, he's got the wrong guy.
Q. What's in it for you?
A. Part of the motive in retiring from First Chicago was to get more involved in community service. And this is community service in my hometown. It also had just the sheer intellectual interest and sort of looking at the animal that I had been a part of -- the private sector -- from a totally different point of view.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Oh, for a Chance to Chatter at the White House!

BYLINE: By JAMES ATLAS

 BODY:
As Bill Clinton and Edmund G. Brown fight it out for the Democratic nomination, pollsters and public opinion experts are assessing their strength among the constituencies they need to win. How are they doing with the middle class, labor, blacks, Jews? What no one has troubled to look into is how they are doing among that statistically insignificant but intangibly crucial sector -- intangibly crucial in their own eyes, at least -- the intellectuals.
As a class, American intellectuals have never been more than minor players in electoral politics. Or, indeed, in much of anything else. Isolated in universities, "marginalized" -- to borrow a term from contemporary academic discourse -- by the specialization of literary studies, they're perpetually on the verge of obsolescence. In his influential book, "The Last Intellectuals: American Culture in the Age of Academe," Russell Jacoby lamented the possible disappearance of an "endangered species" from American life: "While the aging industrial plant of America elicits much talk, the aging intellectual plant passes unnoticed." 
 The last two Republican administrations have only exacerbated the intellectuals' sense of isolation. A handful of neo-conservatives -- influential columnists, editors of well-known journals and denizens of think tanks -- may imagine themselves in proximity to power, but Republicans have always been defiant philistines. The golf course is their chosen turf. (How could Mr. Clinton have ignored such obvious symbolism on his ill-advised jaunt to the Country Club of Little Rock?) Ronald Reagan never pretended to have any use for intellectuals, and neither does George Bush.
 
The Glow of Camelot
 The Democrats, on the other hand, have always cultivated intellectuals, and intellectuals have returned the favor. "He thought that if Adlai could beat Ike in the November election, Culture would come into its own in Washington," Saul Bellow wrote of the crazy poet Von Humboldt Fleisher in his novel "Humboldt's Gift." Humboldt, like his real-life model, Delmore Schwartz, was convinced that "if Stevenson is in, literature is in." But Mr. Stevenson was out. "The Republic summons Ike,/ the mausoleum in her heart," as Robert Lowell summed it up in his poem "Inauguration Day: January 1953."
And so it was until the election of John F. Kennedy, who celebrated his inauguration by inviting Robert Frost to read a poem. The nostalgic glow of Camelot is greatly dimmed now, but for intellectuals the Thousand Days was their last great moment. President Kennedy's brain trust "emptied the Harvard faculty," as Hannah Arendt put it. The White House was a virtual salon. The dinner parties were legendary. "We all drank a great deal, and had to sort of be told not to take our champagne into the concert, to put our cigarettes out -- like children -- though nicely," Mr. Lowell remembered.
In a BBC program aired in 1964, the year after the Kennedy assassination, the English writer A. Alvarez went around Manhattan with his tape recorder and gathered eulogies from the New York intellectuals. "Kennedy's style was superb," testified Norman Podhoretz, the editor of Commentary. "He was a man who was post-Freud, post-Marx, post-Einstein." He "thickened things up and gave people a certain sense of our actuality in the social structure," said the critic Lionel Trilling. Norman Mailer called him an "existential hero." Intellectuals revere power as much as any other group, if not more; Kennedy rewarded them with the illusion of it, if not the reality.
It was rough sledding after that. Lyndon Johnson was enraged by the opposition of prominent intellectuals to the war in Vietnam; when Mr. Lowell refused to attend a White House Festival of the Arts in 1965 in protest against Johnson's foreign policy -- and drafted a public statement signed by 20 prominent intellectuals to explain his refusal -- the President was apoplectic. So much for the salon.
There was no one for intellectuals to like until Eugene McCarthy, who wrote poetry (Mr. Lowell tagged around with him on the campaign trail), and Robert Kennedy, who read Camus and was once observed with a copy of Edith Hamilton's "The Greek Way" in his pocket. But they didn't become President. The next Democrat who did was Jimmy Carter, a middle-brow; his favorite poet was Dylan Thomas.
Is Bill Clinton the intellectuals' savior? As long ago as 1988, reporting on their diminished role in American life, U.S. News & World Report compiled a Who's Who of "that endangered modern species" -- and there, between photographs of Robert B. Silvers, the distinguished editor of The New York Review of Books, and Hanna Holborn Gray, president of the University of Chicago, was . . . Gov. Bill Clinton. Why Mr. Clinton? The article didn't explain. Never mind. He was perceived to be on the side of intellectuals. He was there. And success, as Woody Allen said, is largely a matter of showing up.
But what about Jerry Brown? He's also got high-minded friends. In New York, preparing for the primary on April 7, he often stays at the East Side home of Joan Didion and John Gregory Dunne, old friends from California. He's spent time with the radical educator Ivan Illich in Cuernavaca, and among his intellectual cronies is the Mexican novelist Carlos Fuentes. For policy advice he's said to depend on the economist Lester Thurow and on Richard Goodwin, who was a member of Kennedy's inner circle. (Mr. Brown and Mr. Clinton both read Mr. Goodwin's forthcoming book, which is tentatively entitled "Promises to Keep: A Call for a New American Revolution," in manuscript.) Is he a big reader? "He doesn't read as much as he vacuums," Mr. Dunne says. "If he sees a book, he will pick it up, take it back to the bedroom and be ready to discuss it in the morning."
The trouble with Mr. Brown, as far as some intellectuals are concerned, is that he's too New Age. While Mr. Clinton golfs, he hangs out at the Buddhist retreat Tassajara in Big Sur. Also, his chances of winning are slim, and intellectuals like a winner as much as anyone else. As the Democratic front-runner, Mr. Clinton has been eagerly adopted by the Endangered Species -- if you include in that category some of the more literate journalists. In the corridors of mental power, Mr. Clinton is clearly the man, the one to revive intellectuals' perennial hope of sharing in a power they've never had, and probably never will have. "Clinton is about the renaissance of policy," declared the political commentator Sidney Blumenthal in a New Republic cover story last month that featured a caricature of Mr. Clinton as Superman. The cover line read "The Anointed."
Not that Mr. Clinton, despite being a Rhodes scholar, is necessarily an intellectual himself. He's not like Gov. Mario Cuomo, quoting Teilhard de Chardin to every Albany beat reporter who wanders into his office. On the campaign trail in Illinois, Mr. Clinton pulled out a copy of Sara Paretsky's "Guardian Angel" -- she's a mystery writer, but a literary, highbrow mystery writer. His favorite writers, he has said, are Robert Ludlum and P. D. James -- neither likely to top the "10-best" list of subscribers to Partisan Review. (Well, maybe P. D. James.) But Mr. Clinton seems brainy: he graduated from Yale Law School, he's a Rhodes Scholar, he knows -- and is known to know -- intellectuals.
 
The Right Aura?

 He's not, however, a member of the Eastern Establishment. "Kennedy was an insider in that world," notes Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., who still is. "Clinton is an outsider."
What matters is his intellectual aura: Garry Wills publishes an admiring piece about Hillary Clinton in The New York Review of Books, noting her contributions to the Yale Law Journal and the Harvard Educational Review, and describing her as "one of the more important scholar-activists of the last two decades." Arthur Schlesinger detects "an end-of-an-era feeling" that prefigures change -- a kind of Hegelian tide that confirms on the mental plane his theory of a 30-year cycle in American history.
Perhaps even more significantly, Mr. Clinton strikes the right intellectual note -- one of worldliness and self-deprecation, of rueful irony. In the latest issue of The American Oxonian, the journal of the Association of American Rhodes Scholars, his entry in the 1968 Class Letter reports that daughter Chelsea, "age 11, 5 feet 2 inches, size 9 shoes," loves ballet more than politics.
"Accordingly, says Bill" -- in the artful paraphrase of class secretary Robert B. Reich, the policy analyst from Harvard's Kennedy School of Government who is one of Mr. Clinton's chief advisers -- "he and Hillary must have done something right." If Governor Clinton wins, Mr. Reich observes, "Bill will be the very first U.S. President from our Oxford class."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: White House;
Could Baker's Grip on Tiller Right Bush Campaign Drift?

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD with THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 28

 BODY:
George Bush, Jim Baker and Pat Buchanan are in a rowboat that sinks. Who gets saved?
The answer to the joke, now making the rounds in Washington, is: Israel. 
 When the President was told the joke, and asked who gets saved, he reportedly provided his own punch line: "Baker."
It was a natural response. James A. Baker 3d has long been considered a master at saving himself from getting drawn into distasteful political situations, even those involving his old friend George Bush.
 
'Always on the Phone'
 Salvation and sibling rivalry are the threads that have always run through the 35-year relationship of the President and the Secretary of State, who are jokingly referred to in some quarters as Bobby and J. R. Ewing, the brothers of "Dallas" fame. Mr. Bush helped save Mr. Baker from thinking about his first wife's death, back in Houston in 1969, by getting him involved in politics. Mr. Baker reluctantly agreed to give up his job as Treasury Secretary to run the Bush campaign in 1988 and help save his friend's Presidential bid.
Now, with the President wounded and adrift, the question is once again being raised in news reports and political circles: Will Mr. Baker have to come in and save Mr. Bush?
Mr. Baker has been talking more about politics with the President. "The President and Baker are always on the phone, and it doesn't take a genius to figure out that they are talking about other things than foreign policy," said one top White House aide.
White House officials describe the President as "very miserable" and "irritated" by the indecisive and chaotic performance of his political advisers in the White House and in the campaign, and by his inability to get ahead of the political curve.
The President himself shows no sign of craving Mr. Baker's return to the campaign, say aides. Mr. Bush is said not to be frightened about his chances of being re-elected. He is "chagrined," as one Bush intimate put it, about the political advice he has been getting, and the thin-skinned President is upset with the Republican voters who have turned on him when he was expecting a coronation, not a crucifixion from the right and the left.
But whether Mr. Baker's return would provide redemption may not be that simple. In this year when politics trembles with rage and dislocation, when the campaign trail has become the wild earth, when voters are fed up with old boys' clubs and Washington insiders and excessive attention to foreign policy, it is likely to be rough weather for the patrician pals who have relished their years striding the world stage.
"This is a moment in history for the Harris Woffords, the David Dukes, the Jerry Browns, the Pat Buchanans, the Bernie Sanders," said Kevin Phillips, the author and conservative analyst. "George Herbert Walker Bush and James A. Baker 3d don't get called to the colors by this sort of an unhappy populace."
While he would do anything he could to avoid being drawn back into managing another campaign, Mr. Baker understands that his fate is tangled up with Mr. Bush's. So he and friends have been trading calls about what greater role he might play behind the scenes to bring some discipline to the White House and campaign organization.
After Bush campaign officials dealt with the Buchanan threat by "running around like chickens with their heads cut off," in the words of one top White House official, even the generally apolitical Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser, suggested to Mr. Baker and the President that Mr. Baker visit the campaign team and try to "settle everyone down." Mr. Baker refused, saying he was the Secretary of State.
"Baker looks over here and is just horrified," said one White House official. "This looks to him like a three-ring circus."
 
Staying Away From What Won't Work?
 Mr. Baker, who is obsessed with shedding his image as a political handler and being remembered as a statesman, dreads the thought of returning to the circus, his friends say. He keeps his public distance from the campaign team of Robert M. Teeter, Frederick Malek and Samuel K. Skinner, the White House chief of staff, who have been criticized inside the White House and in Republican circles for their inability to make decisions and bring consistancy and substance to the campaign.
"You can judge what Baker doesn't think will work by what he stays away from," Mr. Phillips said. "His picture hasn't been seen posing with Skinner, Teeter and Malek. That would be a portrait of Machiavelli and the Three Dwarfs."
There is a division of opinion in the White House about the prospects of the Democrats. Some Bush officials feel confident about the disarray in the Democratic field and predict that Bill Clinton will either self-destruct on the character issues or fall prey to Republican attacks tarring him as a weak executive and a liberal. Others, including the unlikely alliance of Mr. Baker and Vice President Dan Quayle, have a healthy respect for the Arkansas Governor's political skills and an appreciation for the volcanic nature of this political season.
Everyone at the White House these days seems to have an opinion about whether Mr. Baker would ever come back to run the campaign. The overwhelming majority side with the Baker friend who has been talking to the Secretary of State about it and says, "I would bet you $10,000 to $500 it won't happen." Others say, though, that if the campaign goes into "meltdown," as one Administration official put it, in the general election campaign, Mr. Bush will have to swallow his pride and ask Mr. Baker to take the helm.
It is a moment both men dread. The President does not want his biography to read that Mr. Baker was his Svengali, and Mr. Baker does not want his biography to read "that he was a professional campaign manager who took a few stints in other areas of policy," as the political analyst Norman Ornstein put it.
It would be hard for Mr. Baker to save Mr. Bush, since they are both part of the problem: It is their style that has helped give the impression that this Administration is out of touch with the lives and needs and yearnings of ordinary Americans. It is ironic that their shortcomings, foreshadowed early in the Administration, can be seen so clearly in the foreign policy arena where they have focused all their energies and claimed many successes.
When the world all seemed to be coming their way, with Communism crumbling on their watch, they got by with their elitist "we know best" approach, with decisions being made in a very close circle without either man explaining policies to the American people to summon support, or articulating the emotion of a moment for a nation hungry for a voice.
Speaking about the cold war's end, one White House official said, "People don't feel good about what is happening, because they have never been told why they should."
 
Cold-Blooded Eyes, Events of Passion
 In today's world, where ethnic and cultural passions are boiling, and when Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker need to galvanize a broad national constituency to support very unpopular foreign aid for the former Soviet Union or exploit an opportunity for peace in the Middle East that requires getting tough with Israel, their cold-blooded pragmatism and their clubby attitude about world leaders is out of sync.
A lot of this arose from the fact that Mr. Bush was fleeing the shadow of Ronald Reagan, and Mr. Baker, despite his reputation for political savvy and his promise to bring domestic considerations into foreign policy, has sometimes shown a surprising aversion and lack of touch for the politics of his job.
"Bush was so afraid of being handled that he never understood that Reagan properly communicated to the country and set the stage for what he thought was important," said one top Republican. "Bush threw the baby out with the bath water and decided to only talk inside baseball about the new world order."
The truth is that, Mr. Baker, who was a great manager for Mr. Reagan, is unable to complement Mr. Bush in this area: While the President feels no need to explain his policies to the public, the frosty Mr. Baker cannot compensate because he hates politicking and engaging with the public.
For the last three years, Mr. Baker has studiously scaled back the usual hand-holding sessions with American Jewish leaders that his predecessors routinely put up with. This is partly out of his own closed style of management. The fact is, explained one State Department official who insisted on anonymity, "Baker doesn't like meeting with anybody: Jews, Arabs, Palestinians, Japanese, foreign service officers, ambassadors. . . the rest of the State Department."
Mr. Baker rarely gives speeches, never gives in-depth interviews, and has failed to cultivate domestic constituencies for his foreign policy initiatives -- be it for aiding the Russians, dealing with China through a nuanced combination of carrots and sticks, maintaining the special relationship with Japan, or coming down hard on Israel for its settlements in occupied territories.
"For these guys, there is no relationship between politics and policy," argued Michael Mandelbaum, a foreign policy adviser to Mr. Clinton, in a remark that may presage the general election debate. "In the Bush-Baker world view, you do ugly, distasteful things to get elected. You hire people like Lee Atwater and John Sununu to do what has to be done. And then when you get into office, you do what you think is right. The idea that you should have to explain yourself to them is grubby."
When they are pressed by an anxious public to justify a major foreign policy initiative, they tend to reach for the crudest sort of domestic rationale.
When Secretary Baker found that the Administration was having a tough time explaining a possible war with Iraq to Americans who did not want to shed blood for oil, he finally said that the real reason was economic: "Jobs, jobs, jobs," he said.
A year later, when President Bush found himself criticized for too much travel overseas before a state visit to Japan, he finally said the real reason was economic: "Jobs, jobs, jobs."
"Both of those moments revealed their contempt for the public," said Ann Lewis a Democratic consultant from Boston. "It was as though people were yammering at them to do something about the country while they were trying to make great decisions on the international front. When they talked about jobs, it sounded like they were saying, 'Are you satisfied now?' It rings so false."
 
Declining to Explain Their Strong Case
 When some Administration officials suggested to Mr. Baker that on one of his trips to Israel it might be a good idea to go on a popular Friday evening television news show there and give an interview that would explain to the Israeli public exactly what he is doing and why, Mr. Baker rejected the idea. "I won't beg anyone for peace," he said.
The Administration foreign policy has suffered from failing to fashion an understandable framework in the wake of the cold war for its continuing relationship with Israel. Therefore, even though a strong policy case could be made for Mr. Bush's refusal to grant loan guarantees to Israel unless it halted settlement building in the occupied territories, Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker did not make the case.
They never really explained publicly why they were imposing the restrictions they did except by citing generalities about advancing the cause of peace. Therefore, the policy was widely interpreted as flowing from Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker's personal antipathy for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel or from their obsession with settlements, rather than a coherent substantive case.
 
Policy Lapse Exacts A Personal Price
 Mr. Baker has paid a personal price for this failure to connect his ideas with the heart of an important constituency. When reports surfaced that he had used a profanity to dismiss Jewish supporters of Israel, which he vehemently denied, not a single American Jewish leader was ready to stand up and defend him, even though he is the first Secretary of State in history who managed to bring the Arabs to the peace table for direct talks with Israel on terms acceptable to Israel.
The Administration is having a very tough time getting Congressional approval for its latest aid package for Russia because officials simply have not developed any domestic support for it. Congress wants the President to go first; the President, gauging the public mood, is reluctant to press a high-profile foreign aid initiative at this time. The result is gridlock. No wonder some State Department officials were quietly applauding when former President Richard M. Nixon chastized Mr. Bush for responding "pathetically" to this historic moment, hoping that it would shame Mr. Bush into action.
"I think the country is crying out for leadership," said Representative Jim Leach, Republican of Iowa. "When there is a major issue of our time that is not being addressed, such as the Russian aid question, the alternative party usually steps forward. This time the Democrats have not, which is why in this void the new moral voice in America is Richard Nixon."

HEADLINE: A Siberian Town: Not a Secret and Ready to Deal

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KRASNOYARSK-26, Russia, March 26

 BODY:
At the huge secret heart of the former Soviet military-industrial complex is a place that looks like a well-kept little town in Germany, though it is surrounded by electrified barbed wire and checkpoints.
Unlike most cities throughout the former Soviet empire, the streets here are beautifully paved and maintained; the shops are clean, attractive and well stocked; there are ponds and parks; the apartment buildings are elegant and substantial, and the wooden windows are nicely varnished, rather than covered with flaking layers of badly applied paint. 
 To come here to this town in Siberia, 2,500 miles from Moscow and 80 minutes' drive north of Krasnoyarsk itself, feels a bit like the landing in Oz must have felt for Dorothy and Toto. While hardly Greenwich, Conn., Krasnoyarsk-26 is a vision of what generations of Soviet leaders hoped would be the future for the general population, with Lenin standing tall in Lenin Square, the hammer and sickle everywhere and an engaged, cultured life in pleasant surroundings.
But the seal of this city of 100,000 people -- a place that appears on no map and has only three main employers -- shows a Russian bear handling a ball of radioactive material, while atoms orbit around him. The city is powered by an underground nuclear reactor, and there are radiation-dosage meters posted on public streets.
Founded under Stalin in the late 1940's in the wide expanses north of Krasnoyarsk, Krasnoyarsk-26 was devoted to the mining and production of nuclear materials in the race to make a Soviet atomic bomb. Run by Lavrenti P. Beria, Stalin's security chief, it attracted the country's scientific elite and cossetted them, isolating them entirely from any of the problems of the ordinary civilian economy.
Today, with the Soviet world ruptured and then turned upside down, this secret, secure, privileged world, entirely dependent on the military is also trembling. Krasnoyarsk-26 and the cities like it, named in a utilitarian fashion after their postal codes, suddenly have to earn a living in a more commercial environment. And with some distaste they are setting out at least some of their wares before Western businessmen and governments, looking for investment partners and hard currency.
It is a kind of fire sale at which the United States and other countries are looking to buy high technology at cheap prices, or to farm out dirty jobs like the reprocessing and storage of spent nuclear fuel. But for the proud industrial barons of the towns, who are among the country's best managers and who feel they honorably and patriotically served their country's highest interests, it is also a great humiliation.
"Frankly speaking, the people here supported the August coup" against Mikhail S. Gorbachev, said one of the 11,000 workers at the Scientific Production Association of Applied Mechanics, which makes military and civilian communication and navigation satellites and wants Western customers and investors.
In an office on the shop floor, there is a portrait of Leonid I. Brezhnev, whose long rule is now generally sneered at throughout the nation as the "time of stagnation," but under whom towns like this one still had the best of everything.
"It is only very recently that military-industrial leaders begin to realize that they cannot go back," said Yuri F. Tarasyuk, chairman of the subcommittee on defense and conversion of Russia's Supreme Soviet. "Before, they thought that all this would be temporary, that military orders would shortly return, that the state would finance them and they would have all the privileges they used to have."
 
Business Executives Visit
 Efforts first begun by Mr. Gorbachev to convert part of the gigantic Soviet military-industrial complex to civilian production had only a small effect in cities like this one, whose very existence was revealed by Soviet officials only in 1988 and which has only been open to invited foreigners in the last three weeks. A visit to the city this week by an international group of businessmen specializing in telecommunications was put together by the Paris-based Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development.
With Russia sharply cutting its military spending while moving toward a free market based on world prices, the breakdown of the centralized distribution system and generally wretched state of the real Russian economy have been a considerable material and psychological blow to Krasnoyarsk-26.
The need to make money, to manufacture efficiently, and to take care of the thousands of employees and their dependents in what had been an almost entirely uncompetitive world is a staggering task. So the huge enterprises here are trying to sell some of their products and expertise to Western companies and countries for hard currency.
 
Best Food and Supplies
 Otherwise, the secret towns, which are thought to number about a score, and all of the other 240 or so towns in the former union wholly dependent on military spending, will wither. And their substantial buildings and theaters, museums and concert halls, markets and hospitals, will deteriorate as well, sinking to the level of the economy surrounding them.
"I hate what is happening in this country," said a young woman resident who helped translate for the businessmen, and who found great pleasure in speaking to the first foreigner she had ever met in a language she had studied from books and tape recordings.
She considers herself a good Communist still, and said there were many like her in Krasnoyarsk-26. Without quite blaming the downfall of the Soviet Union on foreign meddling, she kept a polite but careful distance from these foreigners, and asked that her name not be printed. Her mother works in one of the plants at something "extremely secret," she said, involving software; her father works in a distribution center for food supplies.
Previously, the town received the best supplies of meat and vegetables, including tropical fruits like bananas and pineapples the year around, even during the Siberian winter. Krasnoyarsk-26 was still comparatively well provisioned, she said, while admitting she had no clear picture of the way most Russians live.
 
Contact With the Outside
 That is hardly surprising. When the city was begun in the Stalin period and until only recently, foreign travel and contact with foreigners were forbidden. Residents were denied access to ordinary telephones. Travel outside the city was discouraged, and bonuses were paid if annual vacations were taken inside. Close relatives were allowed to visit only once a year, and that at the discretion of the security forces. Russians spoke only of those working "beyond the barbed wire."
The new Mayor of the town, Vladimir Kretov, said the visit of the foreigners was "a very historical event for us." He spoke of the enormous sacrifice made by the nation to support cities like this one and its work.
"But we can no longer be protected from outside events," Mr. Kretov said, or remain dependent on only a few big firms.
They must convert more to civilian production, he said, and the city in the meanwhile was trying to encourage the establishment of smaller commercial enterprises and cooperatives. There was even some talk of changing the name of the town, he said, to make it more ordinary. He favored "Severo-Krasnoyarsk," or North Krasnoyarsk. Others favor Atomgrad or Kosmosgrad -- Atomcity or Spacecity.
 
Nuclear Reprocessing Plant
 Valery A. Lebedev, his silky gray hair cut as well as his dark suit, is the director of the Mining-Chemical Enterprise, which still produces nuclear materials and reprocesses spent nuclear fuel. He said only 79 percent of his firm's work now is military, and the rest civilian, and he is looking to interest Westerners in buying superpure materials like aluminum, gallium and tellurium used in electronics.
He said a new plant to make polycrystalline silicon would be in operation in 1994, with an eventual output of 1,450 tons a year. He was also overseeing a new plant to reprocess nuclear fuel from power plants that could handle between 2,000 and 3,000 tons a year, a huge figure.
"We'll put it out in the Siberian taiga," or forest, he said lightly, implying that the Russian environmental movement had never been Krasnoyarsk-26's biggest concern.
The Western businessmen, for their part, seemed largely unimpressed.
"Some of the materials are good and cheaper, and no one in the West wants to do nuclear reprocessing," said an American businessman from a large telecommunications company. "But their satellite technology is nothing special, and Western satellites carry many more channels and last twice as long."
Still, he said, "they didn't show us much more than a metal-bashing shop," and it was difficult to know the real capabilities of such highly protected enterprises.
A Frenchman was harsher.
"It is a nice place for Russia, but it is doomed," he said. "Even now, it looks like a nice little provincial town in Germany, but only a place you drive through, not somewhere to spend the night."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Political Memo;
When Trouble's Ahead, Clinton's Staff Is Ready

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL

 BODY:
Responding to a series of potentially damaging news reports, the Presidential campaign of Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas has crafted a multitiered plan to discredit and respond to accusations. His process has transformed the classic political strategy of doing research on the opposition into a plan to beat reporters at their own game.
After surviving, with luck and persistence, tabloid accounts of marital infidelity, while his campaign struggled back in New Hampshire early in the year, Mr. Clinton and a cadre of aides now have a system in place that has so far managed to limit each new round of damaging reports to a 36-hour cycle. 
 "You try to figure out what they think they've got and marshal every possible resource" to combat it, said George Stephanopoulos, the deputy campaign manager.
The damage-control mechanism, intended to blunt the effect of what Mr. Clinton's rival, Edmund G. Brown Jr., refers to as "a scandal a day," operates on at least three levels. Mr. Clinton himself is the chief weapon. Backing him up is a crew of aides who scour every report for what they consider to be omissions and a group of advisers in Little Rock who search through public and private records and provide affidavits and statements that rebut the central conclusions of each new report.
The Clinton campaign also uses the competitiveness among news organizations to defuse issues that might otherwise spin out of control. In confidential chats, aides roam through the campaign plane, taking reporters aside either to question the motives of an article's author or of the publication itself.
The strategy was put on its best display earlier this month when a New York Times article raised questions about Mr. Clinton and his wife, Hillary, and their business relationship with a developer who ran a failing savings and loan that was represented by Mrs. Clinton's law firm.
Within hours, questions that the campaign's lawyers had been unwilling or unable to answer for the article's author were answered at length in stacks of documents distributed at a hastily called news conference in San Antonio, Tex.
That same approach was on display last week when The Los Angeles Times reported that Mr. Clinton had pressed state lawmakers on behalf of a state bond contract that benefited one of his political contributors.
There have been constant, though undocumented, reports of articles that were never published because the Clinton damage controllers went on full alert before final publication decisions were made.
This works "more often than you think," Mr. Stephanopoulos said.
Mr. Stephanopoulos and Paul Begala, another senior adviser who travels with Mr. Clinton, and Dee Dee Myers, the press secretary, are the top aides dispatched to defuse damaging reports with members of the press.
Ms. Myers, for instance might underline a favorable passage in a news clipping, hand it to a reporter and say nothing. She calls this "silent spin."
Or Bruce Lindsey, the campaign director, might sidle up to reporters after each new report to offer a seemingly casual comment like, "Wasn't that morally indefensible?"
In Little Rock, Jeff Eller, deputy press secretary, disseminates information provided by Betsey Wright, Mr. Clinton's former chief of staff who is now a volunteer for the campaign; Eli Siegel, a businessman and veteran Democratic campaign strategist who is working with the campaign, and Loretta Lynch, a lawyer.
Members of Mr. Clinton's inner circle have traded off the damage control chores. James Carville, a consultant, was played the leading role during the episode in which Gennifer Flowers, a former singer and state employee, was selling her story of a 12-year affair with the Governor to the supermarket tabloids.
He now hangs back, addressing himself more to subjects of overall campaign strategy. "We are now at the point where we respond very well," Mr. Carville said. "Generally the more you do something, the better you get.
"If you just lay back, you get eaten alive."
 
Building 'Fire Walls'
 The best approach, campaign advisers have discovered, is to construct a series of "fire walls" to protect themselves against allowing bad news to spread. Campaign aides first take their side of the story to the news services, then to the television networks and then to reporters for major competing publications.
"From our point of view, stories are only damaging if they run like a wildfire through the media chain," Mr. Stephanopoulos said.
Senior campaign officials said their strategy is driven by the conviction that Mr. Clinton is being treated unfairly in the press. Damaging allegations, they argue, are frequently on the front page of a newspaper while more flattering accounts of his record as Arkansas Governor are relegated to inside pages.
"It leads to another problem," Mr. Stephanopoulos said. "What is the purpose of these stories? To tell a story, or to play gotcha?"
David Wilhelm, the campaign manager, said they were "a little bit behind the curve" when the first negative reports hit. "The campaign is not set up to run a whole counterintelligence operation -- on ourselves anyway," he said.
Investigative news reports, and rumors of coming ones, had become such a fact of daily life around the Clinton campaign that staff members now joke that they should open a hospitality room at the Capital Hotel in Little Rock, where many reporters visiting the city to do research, stay.
But no matter how skillful the Clinton forces get at deflecting bad news, they say they realize that it is always better not to have to deal with the problem in the first place.
"Any day we spend attacking the weakness of a story is a day spent not talking about health care, the economy and taxes," Mr. Stephanopoulos said.
Perhaps the most important tool the Clinton campaign uses is the candidate himself. Always displaying a measured amount of outrage at a new report, Mr. Clinton holds news conferences on the fly between campaign events to dismiss the news as "misleading" or "false."
Asked as he flew on his campaign plane to Wisconsin yesterday if he thought his media strategy was working, Mr. Clinton responded: "We started to get a step ahead yesterday." And he smiled.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Independents;
Perot, the 'Simple' Billionaire, Says Voters Can Force His Presidential Bid

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, March 27

 BODY:
In a year in which half the cards in the political deck seem to be jokers, the ultimate wild card may be playing out in a corporate suite full of Norman Rockwell paintings in a high rise here.
"I'm a very simple person," said H. Ross Perot, the Texas entrepreneur and billionaire, who the telephone company says has received more than a million calls from would-be volunteers over the past three weeks since he discussed a possible Presidential bid on the Larry King Show. "I told the people if they do their job, I'm obligated to do my job, and I will not come up with some limp-wristed excuse because it's unpleasant." 
 The people's job, as Mr. Perot has explained it, is to put his name on the ballot in all 50 states. Committees in every state seem intent on trying to do that. He has said he will use as much as $100 million of his own money to put together a third-party Presidential bid if they do.
 
Offering America a Vision
 By any standard measure, Mr. Perot's potential third-party candidacy is the longest of long shots. But more than a few political observers see the potential for an explosive form of political combustion in the combination of an angry, frustrated electorate and Mr. Perot's iconoclastic, take-no-prisoners, persona and anti-politics politics.
In a year of angry, resentful politics Mr. Perot offers not ideology but a vision that is one half-angry Jeremiah and one half corporate Mr. Good- wrench willing to slash government spending and work with businesses to revamp the economy.
"I think people are underestimating what a phenomenon he's going to be," said Peter Elkind, editor of the weekly Dallas Observer here. "He is the most single-minded man on the face of the earth, and he seems to have decided he wants to be President of this country."
There are ample reasons to be skeptical. No third-party candidate has ever been elected President, and over the last half century only George C. Wallace has received more than 10 percent of the vote when he got 13.5 percent in 1968.
There is no guarantee he will get on all 50 state ballots. Skeptics say Mr. Perot, who in the past has dismissed talk of a possible Presidential bid by saying, "Jeez, I've never run for dogcatcher," may look better in the abstract than he will when his specific positions are scrutinized.
"Ross Perot is the untested wild man, and while that may be attractive here at the beginning, I'm not sure it will be attractive at the end," said Karl Rove, a Republican consultant and party loyalist in Austin. "What's his message? I'm the zillionaire that built his company on government contracts?"
But over the last week, Mr. Perot added a phone system with an open capacity to his 100-line phone bank here. Phone company officials say he got 257,139 calls on Wednesday alone after he appeared on the Phil Donahue show that day and has received 1.1 million calls since March 16 when he appeared on the King show.
Volunteers in Tennessee say they already have enough signatures to get him on the ballot there, and Mr. Perot said there was "a very strong indication" of meeting his goal of getting on the ballots in every state.
At the least, Mr. Perot has the potential to radically change the political arithmetic in some major states like Texas.
 
Republicans Chief Worriers
 Some analysts think Mr. Perot's could gather enough of the anti-incumbent vote to hurt a Democratic challenger more than President Bush. But it is the Republicans who seem most worried about Mr. Perot's appeal to disgruntled conservatives.
"If he takes votes from the President in sufficient numbers to deliver the state to Bill Clinton, then we've got big problems." said Jim Oberwetter, chairman of the Bush campaign in Texas.
At the most? Admirers say in this political year of living dangerously, anything is possible.
"The response we're getting is overwhelming; it's like a holy war," said Thomas O'Neil, a consultant coordinating the effort to get Mr. Perot on the ballot in New Jersey. "At this point, in this country, to have someone come forward who could have been designed by an engineer trying to solve the problems of this country, it's almost mystical."
Mystical is not a word often applied to the 61-year-old Mr. Perot, who first gained public attention when he turned a $1,000 investment in his own computer company, Electronic Data Systems, into a $220 million fortune in six years and has since evolved into something of a Texas billionaire populist.
 
Texas Folk Hero
 Mr. Perot was labeled a right-wing superpatriot when he spent $1.5 million in 1969 to take mail, medicine and Christmas meals to American prisoners of war in North Vietnam. He became a folk hero in 1979 when he mounted an expedition that freed two employees from an Iranian prison.
And in recent years, he has developed a reputation as a maverick beyond political categorization in efforts to improve education in Texas, an unsuccessful attempt to revamp General Motors, and as a critic of government waste and the Persian Gulf war.
Mr. Perot, whose 17th-floor office is full of Norman Rockwell Americana, the painting of "The Spirit of '76," and mementos from exploits like the rescue mission in Iran, is a pint-sized, jug-eared man who talks in a rapid-fire East Texas twang so insistent that The Fort Worth Star-Telegram columnist Molly Ivins once compared him to a Chihuahua.
Mr. Perot insists he has no desire to be President, a job he has described as "the toughest, dirtiest, most thankless job in the world." But in a steady stream of television appearances in recent weeks he has fanned the flames of his prospective candidacy.
He calls for the development of strategic plans, industry by industry, to revive the economy; a new tax system; taking away Congress' ability to raise taxes without popular approval; a line item veto; strict limits on the ability of former public officials to serve as lobbyists; the elimination of political action committees and dramatic cuts in the perquisites available to both Congress and the executive branch.
"What we have now is a system where if you have potholes in your city, all the politicians hold conferences on potholes," Mr. Perot said. "If and when I ever have to do this job, we're going to get hot asphalt, get a shovel, fill potholes, move on to the next one and skip the press conference."
Still, most of the specifics of his program remain unclear.
Mr. Perot talks insistently about an "electronic town hall," in which he would explain issues in detail to people on television, and they would express their views to the members of Congress, cutting special interests out of the process. But on most specific issues like changes in the tax system or health care, he said, he would convene panels of the most knowledgable people to develop solutions.
He voices disdain at the idea voters would want to know his position on specific issues, saying the positions offered in a campaign are necessarily so vague as to be meaningless. "If you want a position paper, I'll give you a position paper, but it will be a total waste of time," he said.
Skeptics say that is a sign of someone unlikely to make the transition very well from business to politics.
"As smart as the guy is, he has never run for public office before and that can be a very dangerous thing in politics," Mr. Oberwetter said. "That's why he has to have some good advice, and, get this, he actually has to take advice from someone else, which will be hard for him to do."
Still, Mr. Perot finds himself in the unique position this year of an angry man, who is able to draw support from across the political spectrum.
In fact, despite Mr. Perot's conservative pedigree, Mr. Rove assails him from the right, while George Shipley, a Democratic consultant in Austin, almost gushes: "This is about public service in its pure terms; it's not Mr. Smith goes to Washington, it's Horatio Alger goes to Washington."
 
Question of Scrutiny
 Not everyone sees so pristine a picture. Mr. Perot is not believed to be utterly bereft of ego himself, and Republicans are quick to accuse Mr. Perot of harboring a longstanding grudge toward President Bush.
Mr. Rove said Mr. Perot's across-the-board appeal is not likely to stand up under scrutiny. "He can't be the conservative to conservatives, the moderate to moderates and the liberal to liberals," Mr. Rove said.
Still, in a year when voters seem to be screaming for a break with politics as usual, Mr. Perot may be presenting the clearest break yet.
"We've got a patient whose heart has stopped beating and has broken fingers and toes, and all the politicians want to talk about is the fingers and toes," he said. "I want to go straight to the heart."

HEADLINE: Some Gains Seen in Environmental Talks, but Big Divisions Remain

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, March 28

 BODY:
Delegates from the 160 countries planning to attend the Rio de Janeiro environmental conference in June are edging toward agreement on a sweeping plan for making economic progress ecologically sustainable, but remain deeply divided over how to pay for a global cleanup.
As a five-week preparatory meeting for the Rio conference enters its final week here on Monday, rich and poor countries disagree not only over how to pay for higher environmental standards but who should accept moral responsibility for problems like global warming and pollution. 
 As the talks on the economic plan continued, the Bush Administration made a small concession to the developing world last week on aid. But the United States remains isolated over the single most important agreement that leaders attending the Rio conference hope to announce: a binding international convention to stabilize the global climate by freezing production of gases that warm the atmosphere.
This convention is being negotiated outside the preparatory meeting, and the next round of talks is to be held in Paris next month. Last week President Bush, who still has not agreed to to attend the meeting in Rio de Janeiro, called again for an agreement without gas emission targets that could force the United States to cut gasoline consumption.
 
Statement of Principles
 On Wednesday, the European Community's environmental commissioner, Carlo Ripa di Meana, denounced the American stand, calling it "an attack on the very heart of the Rio conference." He accused the Bush Administration of staking out a position to win political support from industry.
But delegates say they are within sight of agreement on an 800-page set of guidelines aimed at allowing economic growth without long-term destruction to the environment.
The economic document, known as Agenda 21, sets nonbinding principles for promoting development while covering issues from toxic waste disposal to the protection of nature.
"We are close to agreement on a detailed package for international cooperation in the field of environment and development through Agenda 21," the spokesman for the conference, Jean-Claude Faby, said on Thursday. A senior American official agreed on Friday, saying the United States expects agreement on most of Agenda 21 by the end of next week and full accord at the Rio meeting.
But on the core issue of how the developing world is to pay for these higher environmental standards, North and South remain far apart.
Putting Agenda 21 into effect will cost developing countries $125 billion a year, or $70 billion more than the $55 billion they now receive in aid.
Most of the extra money could be found if industrialized countries met the target they have set of devoting 0.7 percent of economic output to aid, which would provide an additional $50 billion a year.
But it appears unlikely that the industrialized countries will achieve that goal. European delegates predict that the North will have a maximum of $3 billion to $5 billion to offer in new aid at the Rio summit meeting.
The developing south wants this "new and additional" aid paid into a new Green Fund that it would control and is seeking free access to environmentally safe technology. Industrialized countries insist that all new cash be funneled through existing aid institutions, where they exercise more control than the recipients.
 
'Earth Charter' in Peril
 Hopes that rich and poor countries could draw up an "Earth Charter" setting out the broad environmental principals underlying Agenda 21 are meanwhile on the point of collapse.
Southern countries still insist on a document that would attribute the world's environmental difficulties to the North's pursuit of self-interest and would call on industrialized countries to reduce consumption.
Since this approach is unacceptable to the north, some delegates are now suggesting abandoning or at least postponing the Earth Charter negotiations.
