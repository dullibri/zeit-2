HEADLINE: Educators Generally Favor Clinton's College Proposal

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
President Clinton's proposals for making college more affordable were generally greeted positively yesterday by college presidents and other higher education officials, though some said the plan emphasized tax relief for the middle class too much.
"This plan would help insure that a college education is within the reach of virtually every American," said Stanley O. Ikenberry, president of the American Council on Education, a nonprofit organization that represents the nation's colleges and universities in Washington. 
 Thomas Kane, a professor at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, called it "good news for the lowest income college students." But Professor Kane added: "While it is probably a relief to middle-income families, it's not educational policy. It won't be driving enrollments up."
The centerpieces of the program are tax deductions of up to $10,000 a year for college tuition or job training and tuition tax credits, in which the Government would refund up to $1,500 a year for the first two years of college. The President said these were intended to insure that every American could afford at least two years of community college.
When Mr. Clinton laid out these ideas in the Presidential campaign, some education officials and policy analysts criticized the plan for directing too many dollars to the middle class at the expense of the lowest-income students. Yesterday's proposal was modified to address those criticisms, Federal education officials said.
As originally proposed, low-income students without taxable earnings might still have been eligible for refunds. As modified, they will not. Instead, Mr. Clinton proposed using the money to expand direct aid, like Pell grants, to the neediest students.
Mr. Clinton proposes raising the amount available to needy students through Pell grants to $3,000 a year. The maximum grant is now $2,470 and is scheduled to rise to $2,700 for the next school year. He would also make more students eligible for Pell grants by raising income limits and by including many students who are not dependent on their parents for support.
"It will also open the doors of college education wider than ever before," he said yesterday.
Other highlights of the President's higher education proposals include a reduction in fees for Federal student loans, which now amount to 4 percent of the loan, and a measure that would allow families to use savings in their tax-deferred individual retirement accounts, or I.R.A.'s, for educational expenses. Currently, savers must pay a penalty if they withdraw their money before the age of 59 1/2.
Some higher education officials interviewed yesterday welcomed the changes, but many also said they did not go far enough.
Michael S. McPherson, president of Macalester College in St. Paul, a specialist on the economics of higher education, also criticized the tax breaks as a way to make college more affordable.
"Once you introduce a whole new category of tax breaks into the tax code, you start down a certain road that is worrisome," Mr. McPherson said. "You are going to have a lot of people lobbying to expand the program over time and that money is going to tend to be siphoned away from other forms of higher education support."
He, like others, also expressed a concern that some colleges might try to raise their tuition to try to share some of the subsidy that would be available through the tax breaks. And that, he said, could lead to proposals to try to regulate tuition.
L. Jay Oliva, president of New York University, said he was generally pleased with the president's focus on higher education, but had some reservations about the package.
"Anything that gives encouragement to students to go to college is terrific," Mr. Oliva said. 'But we have to make sure Pell grants don't get clobbered in the process. I don't see any evidence of it here, but the political process is a long one."
But officials at the Department of Education said they were concerned both with helping the neediest students and with helping middle class families who have been squeezed by tuition prices that are still going up faster than inflation and incomes.
"We've listened to some of the concerns that were raised," said David Longanecker, assistant secretary for post-secondary education. "Although the program was designed unashamedly to help middle-income people, it did help lower-income people too."

HEADLINE: Mob Fighter Named Chief of Javits Center as It Switches Focus to Growth

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
Gerald T. McQueen, a veteran police executive and specialist in organized crime who has been a central figure in the fight against corruption at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, was nominated to be the center's chief executive yesterday. The nomination comes as the center shifts its focus from fighting mob influence to expanding its marketability and size.
Mr. McQueen, 60, has been the center's inspector general since April 1995, having taken the job after a 30-year career that included posts as head of the organized crime unit under the Manhattan District Attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, and chief investigator for the Ethics Committee of the House of Representatives. In his new post, he replaces Robert E. Boyle, who was named yesterday as head of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. 
 "He was a vital part of Bob Boyle's team as they rooted out corruption," Gov. George E. Pataki said in making his recommendation, which is expected to be taken up by the center's board before the end of February.
In separate interviews, both Mr. Boyle and Mr. McQueen said a top item on the convention center's agenda had become plans to expand the center by adding enough space so that it could compete with far larger -- and more profitable -- convention halls in Chicago, Las Vegas and other cities.
"We are back," said Mr. McQueen, referring to the center's recent efforts to root out corrupt labor union employees and attract more business. "Now expansion becomes more important because other cities continue to grow. We could get lost in the pack."
Although proposals to expand the center have been circulating for years, and have been supported by Governor Pataki, none have won the endorsement of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, whose support is considered essential. Indeed, economic advisers to the Mayor have differed, sometimes angrily, with those to the Governor, as Mr. Giuliani's aides have suggested the focus should be more on creating convention space elsewhere in Manhattan.
But in recent days, city officials appear to have become more receptive to some form of expansion plan at the Javits site.
"There is no question that we have a thoroughly inadequate convention center," Fran Reiter, the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development, said yesterday.
Although Ms. Reiter said she and other top city officials had yet to examine the plans in detail, Mr. Boyle said yesterday that a proposal would be made to double the center's existing 900,000 square feet of exhibition space. The addition would extend the center, now bounded by 34th Street, 39th Street, 11th Avenue and 12th Avenue, three blocks north to the south side of 42d Street. The plan was first reported yesterday by Crain's New York Business.
"We think this plan is good in every way," said Charles Gargano, the chief economic adviser to Governor Pataki. The Governor has suggested several times that the best way to expand Javits Center would be to make it accessible from a rejuvenated 42d Street.
Several hurdles would have to be mounted for the expansion plan to succeed, including how to finance what Mr. Boyle estimated at $700 million in land acquisition and construction costs.
After years of bickering over the future of the center, city and state officials would also have to come to terms over political control. Mayor Giuliani is known want more influence over the operations of the center -- which is largely state-controlled -- in return for his support of an expansion plan.

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Adopts Derivatives-Disclosure Rules

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
The Securities and Exchange Commission adopted rules yesterday that will force most American companies to provide additional information to investors about the derivative securities they own and the risks those securities entail.
The rules were altered in several ways from preliminary proposals announced last year, largely to give companies more discretion in how they make the disclosures and, in some cases, to allow companies to combine disparate items in the reports to avoid giving competitors access to sensitive information. 
 "Derivatives are terribly important, if properly used," said Arthur Levitt Jr., the chairman of the S.E.C. "But there has to be greater understanding by investors of how derivatives should be used."
Derivatives include options, futures contracts and swaps.
The rules had been subject to substantial lobbying by companies worried about the cost of compliance and fearful that they would have to disclose competitive information. Representative Michael Oxley, an Ohio Republican and a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, sent a letter to the S.E.C. asking for details on how the commission had concluded that the benefits of the rules would be greater than the costs.
In an interview, Mr. Levitt said that the S.E.C. estimated that complying with the rules would cost American business $40 million. He played down the size of this figure, saying that he had previously served on the board of a charitable foundation that had suffered a $30 million loss from the misuse of derivatives by a money manager.
The rules would require disclosures of financial risk -- measured in one of three ways -- stemming from derivatives and other financial instruments. For financial institutions and large companies with a market value of at least $2.5 billion, they take effect for fiscal years that end after June 30, 1997. They will apply to smaller companies a year later.
The new rules, while they will require disclosures, will not change the accounting for derivatives. The Financial Accounting Standards Board is considering a rule on that and is expected to act later this year.
By giving companies the right to use any of three methods of disclosing financial risk, the S.E.C. has reduced the comparability of information among companies, and it will look at the issue again in three years. But it has also given in to the fact that there is a widespread dispute as to the best way to disclose such risk.
The ways that will be allowed include providing a table showing the fair value and contract terms of instruments, a choice that is likely to be chosen by companies with few derivative instruments to disclose. The other two are sensitivity analysis, which expresses the potential loss or gain stemming from possible changes in interest rates or other relevant market rates or prices, and value-at-risk calculations, showing the potential loss from market movements with a certain likelihood of occurrence.

HEADLINE: Clinton Concedes China Policy Hasn't Helped Much on Rights

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 28

 BODY:
President Clinton conceded today that his doctrine of "constructive engagement" with China had failed to engender the progress on human rights last year that he had hoped it would, but he added that he still believed "that the policy we're following is the correct one."
Speaking at the first news conference of his second term, at a moment when Washington and Beijing are in the process of setting up reciprocal visits between Mr. Clinton and President Jiang Zemin of China, the President came close to predicting the ultimate demise of the Communist government. 
 "I believe that the impulses of the society and the nature of the economic change will work together, along with the availability of information from the outside world, to increase the spirit of liberty over time," he said.
"I don't think that there's any way that anyone who disagrees with that in China can hold that back. I just think it's inevitable, just as inevitably the Berlin wall fell."
Administration officials said on Monday that the annual United States report on human rights around the world, due on Thursday, would sharply criticize China. It is said to conclude that there are no active dissidents left in China, all having been jailed or sent into exile. One official said the report makes no effort "to disguise China's retreat on human rights in 1996."
On another pressing foreign policy topic, the President said he still expects to meet in March with President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, despite reports from Moscow that Mr. Yeltsin's fragile health following a heart operation might force a postponement or cancellation of the summit conference. After quintuple bypass surgery last Nov. 5, Mr. Yeltsin contracted double pneumonia this month and has been little seen in public since then.
In theory, the March meeting should be in Washington, since the two men last met in Moscow last April. But American officials said today that the meeting might be held in a third country, closer to Moscow, to ease the strain on Mr. Yeltsin.
He appeared on Russian television today for the first time in three weeks, smiling and seemingly alert, but he has canceled a trip to the Netherlands on the advice of his doctors, who said he should not fly yet.
"We have a huge, full agenda," Mr. Clinton declared, naming the expansion of NATO, which Moscow has vigorously opposed, and Russian ratification of the START II treaty on reducing nuclear arsenals as major items on the list. "So I think we'll go right on, and I expect to have that meeting in March. I expect it to be an important one and, I hope, a successful one."
Final details of the conference are to be worked out by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin of Russia and Vice President Al Gore here next week.
Mr. Clinton also sought, in an indirect but unmistakable way, to hold the feet of the Saudi leadership to the fire in the investigation of the bombing that killed 19 American soldiers last year. Twice he said that he had been personally assured by the Saudi Government that it would provide answers to all questions posed by the American investigators.
At one point, he said that he had received such assurances from "the very highest levels" of the Saudi Government -- a formulation that might be taken to mean King Fahd himself.
The director of the F.B.I., Louis Freeh, who is in charge of the American investigation, and Attorney General Janet Reno complained last week that the Saudis were not cooperating fully enough. Mr. Clinton did not contradict them directly, declining to answer a question as to whether he was satisfied with Saudi cooperation to date.
"It's still in process," he said. "We have to see if it comes out all right. But there are further requests for information that are ongoing. We'll see how it comes out."
The President's concession that his China policy had produced disappointing results represented a distinct shift for the Administration. Over the past year or two, when asked when results would begin to be visible, such varied officials as Mr. Gore, former Secretary of State Warren Christopher and the late Commerce Secretary, Ron Brown, had suggested they were imminent.
Mr. Clinton has declined to treat progress on human rights or on restricting the spread of nuclear weapons as prerequisites for high-level meetings and preferential trade status. His critics say this policy has the effect of putting economic considerations ahead of all others and taking the pressure off China's leadership.
The President disagreed.
"I still believe," he said, "that over the long run being engaged with China, working with them where we can agree, which helps us on a whole range of security issues that directly bear on the welfare of the American people, like the problems on the Korean Peninsula, and continuing to be honest and forthright where we disagree, has the greatest likelihood of having a positive impact on China."
In response to another question about China, Mr. Clinton said that he was "concerned" about indications that the Chinese might restrict civil liberties when they take over Hong Kong from the British later this year. Noting that the Chinese had promised to leave the system of government in Hong Kong intact, even though it will be a part of China, he said "there may be some ambivalence" as to exactly what the Chinese leadership has in mind.
"I'm not so sure that it can exist," the President added, "with all of its potential to help China modernize its own economy and open opportunities for its own people if the civil liberties of the people are crushed.
"So I would hope very much that they would look for ways to maximize the continuation not only of the economic system, but of the personal freedoms that the people of Hong Kong have enjoyed in making it such an economic engine."

HEADLINE: Balanced-Budget Politics

 BODY:
The House Republicans pledged an early vote on the balanced-budget amendment in part to bolster their wounded Speaker by giving him a quick victory. But the two-thirds majority that Newt Gingrich and his allies thought they had may be slipping away, a reflection of Mr. Gingrich's diminished control and the 10-seat electoral swing to the Democrats. The outcome is also uncertain in the Senate, where the first committee vote is scheduled for this week.
Even so, President Clinton's steadfast opposition is essential to defeating this dangerously misguided amendment. After the elections he temporized, telling Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, that they could reach a compromise on the popular amendment if it could be written to protect the economy during recessions. But goaded by Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, Mr. Clinton has steadied and, at yesterday's news conference, strongly rejected an idea he knows would recklessly tamper with the Constitution and, no matter how worded, threaten the economy. 
 Mr. Clinton would do well to focus his persuasive powers on two first-term Senate Democrats, Robert Torricelli of New Jersey and Tim Johnson of South Dakota, who backed the idea of an amendment during hard-fought campaigns but appear to harbor reservations -- as well they should.
The amendment would prohibit the Government from spending beyond its revenues unless three-fifths of both houses vote to suspend the prohibition. The economic threat is obvious. When the economy slows and tax revenues decline, the amendment would drive Congress to cut spending and hike taxes, precisely the opposite of what a wounded economy needs. The three-fifths waiver provision offers little consolation because Congress is always slow to recognize downturns and never nimble enough to react in time.
Worse, the waiver provision gives a minority of legislators the power to throw government into default and the economy into a downturn unless their colleagues fork over concessions.
The amendment contains no enforcement mechanism, which raises the possibility that the courts or the President would replace Congress in dictating how the Government will spend its money during years of looming deficits.
Mr. Clinton's first responsibility is to press pivotal Democrats like Mr. Torricelli and Mr. Johnson to reject an idea that looked good in the abstract but is dangerous in reality.

HEADLINE: Market for PC's Rose 16% in '96

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: FRAMINGHAM, Mass., Jan. 28

 BODY:
The worldwide market for personal computers rose 16 percent last year, a slowdown from the 24 percent growth in 1995 and the slowest growth rate since 1991, a market research firm said this week.
The Compaq Computer Corporation led the market, followed by I.B.M., which gained market share for the first time since 1993, the International Data Corporation said. Apple Computer Inc. lost market share, while the Hewlett-Packard Company moved into the top five for the first time. 
 Compaq increased its market share to 10.3 percent from 9.8 percent. I.B.M. increased its share to 8.9 percent from 8.1 percent last year.
Apple's market share fell to 5.2 percent from 7.9 percent last year, knocking it to fourth place from third. Packard Bell NEC Inc. moved into the No. 3 spot worldwide, with 6.2 percent of the market. Hewlett-Packard was No. 5, with 4.4 percent.
The slower worldwide growth was caused by poor retail sales in the United States and sluggish economies in some regions. The slowdown is expected to continue this year, International Data said.

Prices for Bonds Advance on Wage Data

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The prices of Government securities increased yesterday after a four-day slide, with investors showing relief as a report on wage increases in the fourth quarter indicated no likely near-term spur to inflation. Prices had been falling because of anxiety that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates in an effort to head off inflation.
The 30-year bond finished trading in the New York session up 6/32, to a price of 94 22/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, fell to 6.92 percent, from 6.94 percent on Monday. 
 Interest rates could still come under pressure in the days ahead just from supply alone, as a number of issues come to market. Today, the Treasury will sell $7 billion in the new inflation-indexed securities, and tomorrow, $19.25 billion in one-year bills. Corporate issuance is also expected to reach about $3.5 billion during the week.
In when-issued trading, the inflation-indexed security was being offered at a price to yield 3.51 percent, up three-hundredths of a percentage point from the previous session.
Early yesterday, buyers drove up the price of the long bond by as much as 1 10/32. But the release of a report showing a slight rise in consumer confidence in January shaved off some of the gains.
The Conference Board's index of consumer confidence jumped to 116.8 points in January from a revised 114.2 last month. Gains in consumer confidence can be negative for the bond market because they may foreshadow increased inflation, which erodes the value of bonds.
Bonds were helped, though, by the Labor Department's report on wages. The employment cost index, which measures wages and benefits, rose only eight-tenths of 1 percent in the fourth quarter and a smaller-than-expected 2.9 percent for all of 1996.
Kenneth J. McCarthy, founder of the Economic Intelligence Company, said this measure, more than any other, showed that the fear of wage-driven inflation had been overstated.
Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, noted that while wages and salaries had continued to climb, benefit costs had lagged noticeably.
The relatively benign overall employment cost figure, he said, would give the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy-setting arm, greater freedom to keep interest rates steady at its next two-day meeting, which begins on Tuesday.
"At the same time, however, employment costs certainly appear to be on an upward path, albeit a gradual one, and could well be a cause for considerable concern at the Fed at some future point," he said.
Mr. Fine said that the bond market's response to the consumer confidence report was muted. "That's because at this stage of the economic cycle, the consumer confidence index tends to be a lagging indicator vis-a-vis consumption patterns," and may be overstating current confidence levels.
Today's release of December durable goods orders will be closely watched by market participants to see whether the anticipated rise reverses the decline reported the month before.
"Over the last few years," Mr. Fine said, "there have been a number of times that the December figure has increased substantially, and certainly with the decline we saw in November, 1996 could well repeat the pattern."
Since 1982, Mr. Fine said, there have been only two years in which December orders for durable goods have declined. The average rise over that period, including negative years, was 2.9 percent, with the average increase in the last four years 3.5 percent in December. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News expect a 1.1 percent rise.
After the report, the market will probably turn its attention to testimony by Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, before the Senate Finance Committee tomorrow.

HEADLINE: THE SECOND TERM: THE DISTRICT;
Clinton Agrees on Idea of Tax Relief in Capital

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 28

 BODY:
President Clinton said today that he agreed in principle with the idea of tax relief for the District of Columbia and that in fact he would introduce his own plan to revive the flagging economy of the nation's capital.
"I think there needs to be an economic incentive in the form of tax relief," the President said at a news conference in which he was asked to comment on a plan for the District that was introduced today by Eleanor Holmes Norton, the capital's nonvoting delegate to Congress. 
 But Mr. Clinton declined to embrace the specifics in Ms. Norton's plan, especially her proposal to place a 15-percent ceiling on Federal taxes paid by Washington residents.
"The last time this came up, the folks at Treasury and O.M.B. thought that the proposal was more costly than we could afford," the President said, referring to the Office of Management and Budget.
Ms. Norton has argued that her plan will help stem the flight of middle-class residents from the District to the suburbs, and it has been backed by Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Senate majority leader.
As for his own ideas, Mr. Clinton said he intended to offer a program that would be "a significant incentive for people to invest in D.C. and to help to grow the economy there."
The head of the District's financial control board, Andrew Brimmer, said that no plan would be effective if it was meant to substitute for the $660 million that Congress gives the District each year and that the District must be allowed to tax the incomes of suburban commuters who work in Washington.
Mr. Clinton agreed with that point, saying, "You can't expect any city to function and be successful if they have to pay the state's costs as well as the city's costs, raise taxes, when people can go right across the Potomac River or right up the road into Maryland."
Up to two-thirds of the people who work in the capital live in Maryland or Virginia, and they pay no commuter tax. Moreover, the District government must bear many costs normally paid by state government because it is not part of any state.
The President said he agreed with Ms. Norton that the Federal Government ought to assume costs now carried by the city that in every other municipality would be the responsibility of the state government.
The discussion of Ms. Norton's plan, whose main points have been made before, was the latest reminder that Washington has problems (crime, decaying streets, sewers and bridges, not enough money) that are common to older American cities and also has problems that are unique.
Besides its inability to impose a commuter tax and have it collected by a state government, the District is handicapped in raising money because more than 40 percent of its prime real estate is tax exempt, since it consists of government buildings, foreign embassies and universities.
And having been more or less a stepchild of Congress for decades, the District is still struggling to arrive at a consistently efficient, honest city government.

HEADLINE: THE SECOND TERM: THE BUDGET;
Clinton Toughens Stand On Changing Constitution

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 28

 BODY:
With the issue at the top of the Congressional docket, President Clinton took his strongest stand ever today against a constitutional amendment that would require a balanced Federal budget.
"The Congress has an obligation to think of what could happen here in the future and ask themselves whether they really want to straitjacket the United States," the President said at his news conference. 
 The Senate Judiciary Committee is planning to approve a constitutional amendment this week that would require the budget to be balanced in 2002 and every year after that unless the Senate and the House voted by three-fifths majorities to waive the requirement.
Both houses are expected to vote on the amendment next month, and vote counters of both parties say the outcome is too close to call.
Polls show that the public favors a balanced budget amendment by a large margin. But the amendment would do nothing to bring the budget into actual balance. The difficult spending and tax measures would still have to be enacted, and those presumably would be less popular.
For an amendment to become part of the Constitution, the Senate and the House must approve it by two-thirds majorities -- 67 yes votes in the Senate and 290 in the House, if all members are voting. It must then be ratified by the legislatures of three-quarters of the states, or 38.
The balanced budget amendment has been a central part of Republican doctrine since the party won control of Congress in the 1994 elections. In early 1995, the last time the proposed amendment was fully debated, the House approved it, but the Senate fell one vote short.
In the Senate this year, all 55 Republicans are committed to voting for the amendment, and the 9 Democrats who voted for it in 1995 are expected to do so again. That means the proponents need 3 votes from the 6 freshman Democrats.
Two of the freshmen, Richard J. Durbin of Illinois and Jack Reed of Rhode Island, voted against the amendment when they were Representatives in 1995 and have announced their opposition this time. Two others, Tim Johnson of South Dakota and Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey, voted for the amendment when they were in the House two years ago, but they have sent signals to both sides that their votes cannot be counted on for certain this year. Mr. Torricelli may announce his position at a news conference on Wednesday.
The only two freshmen who have never cast votes on the matter, Max Cleland of Georgia and Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana, have not publicly tipped their hands. Both said during their campaigns that they favored a balanced budget amendment, but they never said they favored the measure now being offered by the Republicans. So they could vote against the Republican amendment without being inconsistent.
At a news conference on Monday, Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the chief sponsor of the Republican amendment, predicted victory but conceded that he did not have firm commitments for 67 votes. The Democratic leader, Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, said the vote could go either way.
The situation is even more unpredictable in the House, where advance vote-counting is more difficult than in the smaller Senate.
"I think that it's within probably two or three votes either way," Representative Robert L. Livingston of Louisiana, the Republican chairman of the Appropriations Committee, said in a television interview last weekend. Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader, said the vote was "too close to call."
A staff assistant who is keeping a vote count for the proponents in the House offered this arithmetic: All but 1 of the 227 Republicans (John Hostettler of Indiana) are expected to vote for the measure. So are the 47 Democrats who voted for it in 1995 and 10 freshman Democrats who have signed on as co-sponsors, for a total of 283. Assuming no Democrat who voted against the measure two years ago changes sides, this means that the proponents must get the votes of 7 of the remaining 32 freshman Democrats, at least 6 of whom have already announced their opposition.
At his news conference on Monday, Senator Hatch described the amendment as the Republicans' "No. 1 priority" and said it was essential "for our children's economic freedom."
But the Clinton Administration maintains that the proposal would hamstring the Government's efforts to spend its way out of a severe economic downturn and in any case is a distraction to pending bipartisan negotiations to achieve balance in the budget.
At his news conference today, the President said he would work with Congress to produce a balanced budget by 2002, but he described the amendment as a risky enterprise. He declared:
"It would almost certainly require -- after a budget is passed, if the economic estimates turn out to be wrong -- the executive branch, the President and the Treasury Department, to impound Social Security checks or to turn it over to the courts to decide what to be done. And it would put us in a position, in my view, of doing things that are counterproductive."
As they had in the past, Democrats in Congress offered a counterproposal today that was meant to give political cover to lawmakers who want to vote against the amendment but fear repercussions in their next campaigns.
Led by Senators Dianne Feinstein of California and Byron L. Dorgan of North Dakota, the Democrats offered their own amendment, which would require a balanced budget by 2002 but exclude Social Security from the calculations.
This amendment, certain to be rejected, is based on a practical impossibility. Without counting Social Security revenue, lawmakers would have to find an additional $465 billion in savings to bring the budget into balance by 2002, according to the latest calculations of the Congressional Budget Office. Congress would never vote for that amount of spending cuts or tax increases, and the Democrats did not suggest how so large a sum might be found.
But the counterproposal gives Democrats in a shaky position politically a way to say in their next campaigns that they voted for a balanced budget amendment, one that protected Social Security benefits.
Asked today where savings could be found to accommodate the Democratic amendment, Senator Feinstein did not reply directly but said, "I really think it's possible to do it."
The Senate Republican leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, described the Democrats' proposal as merely a guise to conceal their opposition to a workable constitutional amendment.

Princeton's Fees To Rise 3.9% Next Year

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: PRINCETON, N.J.

 BODY:
Undergraduate tuition, room and board at Princeton University will rise 3.9 percent to $29,439 for the 1997-98 school year. It is the second year that Princeton has announced a low rate of increase, and it is the first increase below 4 percent in 30 years. 
 An undergraduate education at Princeton now costs $28,325 a year; that represents a 4.6 percent increase over the previous academic year. Next fall, tuition will rise 4.2 percent to $22,920, while room and board will increase 3 percent to $2,987 and $3,528, respectively.
For graduate students, tuition will rise to $22,920, from $22,000, and room and board will increase about 3 percent.
The new fees were approved by the university's trustees last Saturday, when they adopted Princeton's fiscal 1998 operating budget of $502.6 million.
To keep costs down, the university said, "the faculty will not expand for the foreseeable future," although $1.05 million will be added to the faculty and staff salary pools to allow pay increases above the inflation level.
This year's budget is projected to be in balance, unlike last year's, when the university predicted a budget deficit of nearly $4 million. (AP)

HEADLINE: Noninflationary Pay Report Relieves Markets (for a While)

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 28

 BODY:
Despite a tight labor market, American workers have not won pay and benefit increases large enough to push inflation up at a faster rate, Government figures showed today.
The report came as a vast relief to inflation-sensitive financial markets, which soared after the Labor Department issued a report that its Employment Cost Index had climbed just eight-tenths of 1 percent in the final three months of 1996, the same as in the first half of the year. But the stock and bond markets retreated later in the day as traders questioned whether the figures were as reliable as initially thought. 
 Economists said the eagerly awaited tally, which many had feared would show a surge of 1 percent or more, virtually extinguished the already remote chance that the Federal Reserve would decide to raise interest rates at its two-day strategy meeting next week. And it could well postpone any increase past the Fed's March meeting unless other data point to the emergence of fresh wage pressures.
"You can probably call off Fed tightening on Feb. 5," said Paul L. Kasriel, chief domestic economist at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago.
Alan Greenspan, the central bank's chairman, and other Fed officials have suggested in recent months that they are paying much greater attention to pay and benefit indicators in judging whether higher interest rates will be needed to help curb the threat of inflation. Mr. Greenspan has specifically cited the Employment Cost Index as one statistic he follows closely.
Although the unemployment rate is flirting with eight-year lows, workers' insecurity about holding on to jobs has so far kept them from pressing hard for higher pay. But Mr. Greenspan warned in Congress last week that "at some point" this implicit bargain in which workers accept smaller raises in return for greater job security "has to come to an end."
The Labor Department's reassuring report sent interest rates tumbling across the board and powered the Dow Jones industrial average to an early advance of nearly 100 points. Subsequently, however, the bond market lost part of its gains and the Dow ended the day with a small decline. The dollar, which gained across the board against other major currencies, remained strong.
Blunting the morning gains was a separate report from the Conference Board, a business-oriented research group, that consumer confidence jumped unexpectedly to the highest point of the current economic expansion that began in March 1991. The report would indicate more buying contributing to a stronger economy and possibly more inflation.
The markets were also unnerved by a rumor that swept Wall Street in midafternoon that the Bureau of Labor Statistics had made an error that caused the index to understate compensation.
The agency's staff was swamped with inquiries, officials said. The talk among traders originated from figures deep in the report showing a decline, six-tenths of 1 percent, in overall compensation for workers in the finance-insurance-real estate category.
Wall Street brokers, many of them flush with record bonuses, found this suspicious and William G. Barron Jr., the bureau's deputy commissioner, said in a late afternoon interview that he did not disagree.
He said the relatively small samples on which the index was based inevitably produced some erratic figures. "We're not supposed to create confusion," Mr. Barron said. "If that is what we're doing here, we should reconsider publishing this particular number."
Since bonuses account for under 3 percent of benefits for this group of workers -- themselves only 8 percent of the private-sector work force -- the effect on the overall index would be no more than one-tenth of a percentage point, B.L.S. officials said.
The report also showed sizable increases in compensation of workers in retail trade, a relatively low-paid category that includes many who began receiving an extra 50 cents an hour from the increase in the Federal minimum wage that took effect Oct. 1. Pay and benefits for those in stores selling general merchandise climbed 1.4 percent -- and 1.7 percent for wages and salaries alone -- with retail trade as a whole up 1 percent for the quarter.
Analysts said they considered it a plus that the index absorbed the initial effects of this upward pressure without accelerating.
Still, economists said that the report was not entirely reassuring since the index has been creeping higher -- 2.9 percent in 1996 compared with 2.7 percent in 1995 -- and there was little prospect that fringe benefits, which have been a moderating force, could help much more.
"The report does not completely put to rest the concerns that in a tight labor market you could see an emergence of accelerating labor costs," said Richard D. Rippe, senior economist at Prudential Securities.
Indeed, there are growing signs of worker militancy, reflected in strike threats by airline pilots and the walkout today of 500 United Automobile Workers who make seats at Johnson Controls plants in Michigan and Ohio.
The Labor Department's report found wages and salaries of civilian workers up eight-tenths of 1 percent for the final 1996 quarter and 3.3 percent for the full year. Benefits rose seven-tenths of 1 percent for the quarter and 2 percent for all of 1996, the skimpiest annual rise since the index was created in 1982.
The Conference Board's confidence index, which had been expected to retreat a couple points, vaulted instead to 116.8 in January from 114.2 in December.
"The rising tide of consumer optimism that was characteristic of 1996 has spilled over into 1997," said Lynn Franco, a board official.
Consumers' appraisal of current conditions climbed 4.1 points, to 139.8, while expectations moved up 1.6 points, to 101.5.
Those who viewed jobs as "hard to get" declined for the third straight month, a sign that job insecurity might be on the wane.
But while consumers may be willing to spend, Mr. Rippe observed, "the key determinant" of the economy's course is what happens to their jobs and incomes.

HEADLINE: Market Place: Starting Today, 10-Year Bets On Inflation;
New U.S. Bond Promises To Match Cost of Living

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
The Government that helped bring America rampant inflation 15 years ago, and that since then seems to have brought it under control, has a deal for you: Today it will offer bonds that provide protection against a general rise in prices. Buyers of the bonds will prosper if inflation returns, but not if it remains quiescent.
The Treasury will auction $7 billion in 10-year inflation-indexed bonds, creating what could eventually become a staple in the investment portfolios of millions of Americans. The bonds are likely to pay an interest rate of slightly above 3.5 percent. 
 That may sound low compared with the 6.64 rate available on normal 10-year Treasury bonds, but it may prove to be quite good, because it is a "real" yield. Inflation can eat away at the returns on normal Treasury bonds, but buyers who hold the new bonds until maturity will be guaranteed that roughly 3.5 percent return, above and beyond any inflation from now until 2007.
Just how good such an investment turns out to be depends on how vigorous inflation becomes. In the 1970's, such a bond would have outperformed almost any other financial investment. But in recent years such bonds would have provided relatively poor returns, compared with gains as high as 30 percent or more in some years on blue-chip stocks.
If inflation averages 3 percent a year for the next decade, about the current rate, an investor would do just about as well with these bonds as with normal 10-year bonds. If it is higher, the new inflation-adjusted bonds would perform better.
Still, for investors seeking to preserve wealth, the bonds offer a level of protection not available to most investors before today. Indeed, one of academia's most prominent advocates of buying stocks, Jeremy J. Siegel, a finance professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, has declared himself "most enthusiastic about inflation-indexed bonds." Mr. Siegel, best known as the author of "Stocks for the Long Run," a 1994 book arguing that stocks were the best long-term investment, notes that a major problem with bonds in recent decades has been their exposure to inflation, which can demolish the principal of normal bonds.
The new bonds will work like this:
While they will be sold in initial amounts of $1,000, as with other Treasury notes and bonds, that principal amount will be adjusted daily, based on changes in the Consumer Price Index three months earlier. The increases for each day of the month, when added together, will be enough to offset the monthly rise in prices.
If the bond carries a 3.5 percent coupon rate -- and that will be determined in today's auction -- every six months it will pay half that amount, or 1.75 percent, on the then current principal value. So, assuming that consumer prices continue rising, every six months the coupon payment will be a little higher. At the end of 10 years, the buyer will get back the inflated principal. To the extent the Consumer Price Index is an accurate gauge of inflation, the money returned will be worth just as much as the $1,000 invested in 1997.
And since the interest that was paid also rose with inflation, the investor will have received -- pretax -- a real, inflation-adjusted return of the amount promised when the bond was sold. "For the first time," Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said, "the United States is offering investors protection from inflation."
Until today, about the only option for investors truly worried about inflation was buying short-term securities like Treasury bills, whose rates tend to rise when inflation fears grow. But their rates are in effect for only a few months and they provide a lower yield than would be expected from longer-term, inflation-indexed securities.
At today's auction, the betting is that most of the buying will be from Wall Street and from two types of institutional investors: pension funds, whose ultimate obligation -- payments to retirees -- is closely tied to inflation, and endowments, which seek to preserve their principal while spending the income.
Individuals who want to buy at today's auction can do so through brokers or directly from any Federal Reserve Bank, until noon, Eastern standard time, today. But the expectation is that relatively little of the issue will go to individuals.
If so, that may be too bad. It appears that the initial auction will effectively be charging what amounts to a very small premium for giving investors insurance against inflation, said Gerald Lucas, a Government bond strategist for Merrill Lynch.
There are three likely reasons for low individual demand. The first is unfamiliarity with the product. The second is that inflation is not very scary right now, and the final one is the tax treatment of the bonds.
An investor must pay tax each year not just on the interest that has been received, but on the rise in the principal value, even though the cash from that increase will not come in for years. As a result, the bonds are probably better suited for tax-deferred retirement accounts.
For now, few investors can put such securities into 401(k) retirement accounts, which normally restrict investor options to a menu that changes infrequently. But both Dreyfus and the Benham group of American Century have announced plans for mutual funds that will buy these securities, so they will become available for at least some such accounts.
One of the major imponderables is whether these bonds will draw money from stock investments. Certainly, the returns on stocks in recent years have vastly outpaced anything that can be expected from inflation-adjusted bonds. The real return -- after inflation -- on the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index in the 10 years that ended in December was a very impressive 11.2 percent a year. Compared with a real rate of 3.5 percent or so to be expected on these bonds, stocks would seem to have it going away.
But such stock returns are far from guaranteed. Indeed, in the 10 years through July 1982 -- a period that ended just as the great bull market of the 1980's was about to begin -- the real return on stocks was a negative 3.7 percent a year.
For people saving for retirement, it might make sense as retirement nears to take some money out of stocks and put it into inflation-protected bonds, since those bonds, unlike normal bonds, are assured of maintaining their purchasing power. On the other hand, since the new bonds are safer than regular bonds, some investors might decide that they could buy some of them and then have more money to risk in the stock market.
For now, these bonds are plain Jane things. But that won't last long. They can be "stripped," that is, sold in pieces like zero-coupon bonds. So if you lay out a certain amount now, you'll know that you will have a given amount -- expressed in 1997 dollars -- when you need the money, perhaps at the time of retirement or when a child enters college.
Soon, too, there may be companies issuing their own inflation-indexed bonds. For most companies, assuming the risk of inflation would seem to be very risky indeed: unlike the Government, corporations do not have their own dollar printing presses. But the expectation is that Wall Street will create derivatives that will allow companies to "swap" out of that obligation, passing on some or all of the inflation risk.
For the Government, of course, these bonds could prove very expensive, even given Washington's ability to print more dollars. Had all old Treasury securities been issued with inflation protection, the national debt -- and its burden on taxpayers -- would be much greater than it is now. But given the relatively small amount of these new bonds that will be outstanding in coming years, that risk is not large.
Indeed, economists say that over time, the cost to the Government of issuing inflation-indexed bonds ought to be lower than that of issuing traditional bonds. That is because most investors are only willing to buy bonds if they receive a premium for the risk that inflation might be higher than expected. By eliminating that risk and offering what is in effect an insurance policy against inflation, the Government should be able to persuade investors to lend it money for less.
One risk investors in these bonds are taking is that the Government will "improve" the Consumer Price Index in a way that would make it rise more slowly. Many economists believe it now overstates inflation and have called for changes. These bonds tread a fine line on that question. If the changes are technical, the investors will have to live with the revised C.P.I. If the changes are deemed political, however, the changes will not affect them. It will be up to the Treasury Department to categorize any changes.
The Treasury is worried about making sure the bonds have adequate liquidity. It wants them to trade with a narrow spread between the price at which dealers are willing to buy and the price at which they want to sell. An adequate supply would encourage that, and that is one reason $7 billion in bonds are being offered, $2 billion more than many had expected. And the Treasury has indicated that in three months it will auction more such bonds, raising the supply even further.
Once the Treasury concludes that there are enough bonds outstanding with maturities in 2007, it is expected to move on and issue 5-year and 30-year inflation-indexed bonds.
In some ways, inflation-indexed bonds hark back to the situation that existed before the Depression, when all Treasury bonds -- and all corporate bonds, as well -- were payable in gold. Then, it was clear that any shrinkage in the value of paper dollars was the problem of the Government, not of the investor. But Congress changed the rules, making bonds redeemable in paper money, and the Supreme Court, in a 5-to-4 decision in 1935, said that was legal.
Since then, all bonds have posed the risk of their principal's eroding because of inflation, and investors have demanded varying interest rate premiums depending on how worried they were that prices would escalate. With the introduction of these bonds, investors have the choice of who should take that risk -- them or the Government.
At the moment, passing on the risk to the Government may be a wise strategy. Inflation worries are low, and it appears that inflation insurance is going to have to be priced very low to sell these bonds. That implies a higher rate of interest than might have been expected.

The new inflation-indexed 10-year bonds that the Treasury puts on sale today guarantee investors both the safety of their principal and a return that will not be eroded by rises in the cost of living. Investments in stocks and other kinds of bonds may, of course, continue to outstrip the promised returns on the new securities. But the inflation-busting bonds can serve the needs of several kinds of investors:
 
SAVING FOR COLLEGE OR SIMILAR EXPENSES
 These investors can calculate the amount that they will need 10 years in the future and invest now, knowing their money will grow safely toward that goal.
 
SAVING FOR RETIREMENT
 Particularly as part of a tax-deferred retirement account, like an I.R.A. or a 401(k), the bonds provide guaranteed returns without short-term risk.

 At the returns that they are expected to yield, the Treasury's new inflation-indexed bonds, which go on sale today, would have generally underperformed regular 10-year bonds as well as stocks over the last 10 years. But they would have done better than three-month Treasury bills, the usual investment for keeping ahead of inflation. And they would have done better than stocks in the weak market years before 1982.

HEADLINE: First Bill to Fail in 5 Years Shows Republicans' Rift

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 28

 BODY:
It is an article of faith here that by the time a bill gets to the floor of the Senate or the Assembly for a vote, it is certain to pass. The leaders of each chamber, who strictly control what bills come before the membership, simply do not allow a vote until they are sure they have enough support for passage.
In fact, the last time the Senate voted down a bill was in 1992, and the Assembly last did it in 1982. But today's Senate vote against allowing casinos in several regions of the state was an exception to the rule, illustrating the unusually deep divisions on the issue among the Republicans who control the Senate. 
 Rather than risk an all-out fight, the majority leader, Senator Joseph L. Bruno of Rensselaer County, who supported the casino bill, did little to enforce the usually ironclad party discipline. Nor did he try to make a deal with Democrats who might have given him the votes he needed.
Mr. Bruno told his members they were free to vote as they wished, though he admitted later that it was hard to give up control. "To see a bill on the floor and hear some of the conversations and know what's happening and to sit there and just watch it happen, I can tell you, is very difficult," he said.
Some of his colleagues suggested that he had no choice, because he could not have held the Republican majority together by force. Others, noting Mr. Bruno's stated ambivalence about gambling, thought he was just unwilling to expend any political capital on a difficult vote.
The five Republican Senators from Nassau County all voted against the bill. They were torn between allegiances to Senator Bruno and to Joseph N. Mondello, the county's powerful Republican leader. Mr. Mondello is president of the Nassau Downs Off-Track Betting Corporation, which could have lost gaming money to casino competition, and he opposed the bill.
Most of the Democratic Senators, particularly those from New York City, walked into the chamber without having taken a public position on the bill, signaling that they were open to a deal for their support. ButMartin Connor of Brooklyn, the minority leader, and other Democrats, said Mr. Bruno made no offer.
Many New York City legislators embraced Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's position, that the bill should be defeated because it would allow casinos in the Catskills and some upstate locations, but not in the city. Senator Alton R. Waldon Jr., a Queens Democrat, said, "I think that the people in the Rockaways deserve a casino," and voted no.
Republican leaders suggested that the Democrats had been influenced by Donald Trump, the real estate mogul and Atlantic City casino owner, who contributed $100,000 last year to two campaign committees controlled by Mr. Connor.
"I'm not going to accuse the minority leader of any impropriety, but a review of contributions to that committee would be appropriate," said Senator Nicholas A. Spano, a Republican from Westchester County who strongly backed the bill. Mr. Connor called the implication "absurd," and noted that Mr. Trump has long been a heavy contributor to politicians of both parties.
Just 3 of the 25 Democratic Senators present voted for the bill. Two of them, Anthony R. Nanula and William T. Stachowski, are from the Buffalo area, and said they needed a casino to keep gambling dollars from flowing across the Canadian border to a casino in Niagara Falls, Ontario. The third Democratic vote came from Efrain Gonzalez Jr., of the Bronx.
Republican Senators insisted that the loss did not undermine Mr. Bruno's authority because he had invested so little in the vote. But some, particularly those from Long Island, were clearly uncomfortable defying their majority leader, and said little during the debate. Senators from upstate, where Republicans dominate, were almost evenly divided on the bill, torn between the economic case for casinos in their regions and arguments that gambling would bring social ills.
The only vehement arguments in favor of casinos were made by lawmakers who felt that their districts had something to gain, economically. Religious groups that had lobbied hard against the bill claimed a measure of credit for its defeat. "In one way or another, the social, moral arguments had an effect," said John M. Kerry, executive director of the New York State Catholic Conference.

HEADLINE: In Reversal, Mt. Sinai Accepts City's Terms in Hospital Pact

BYLINE: By ESTHER B. FEIN 

 BODY:
In an abrupt turnaround, Mount Sinai Medical Center agreed yesterday to link the amount of money it is paid to run two city hospitals to how well it meets certain health care goals and to give the city more control over who works in the hospitals.
Less than a week ago, Mount Sinai rejected similar terms offered by the city, derailing negotiations over a $100 million contract to staff Queens and Elmhurst Hospital Centers. 
 Earlier last week, after negotiations broke down, city officials said they would seek a new partner for the deal through open bidding.
But on Friday, Mount Sinai's president, Dr. John Rowe, asked the hospitals corporation president, Dr. Louis Marcos, to delay the opening of the bidding, saying he thought their differences could still be worked out. And by yesterday, the two sides agreed to a deal even more favorable to the city than the one under consideration last week.
The deal represents a significant victory for the Giuliani administration and the hospitals corporation, which has been determined to take greater control over its 11 public hospitals by demanding more oversight and accountability from its partners before signing new affiliation contracts. Under such contracts, the city pays private medical institutions set fees to provide doctors, nurses and administrators for its public hospitals.
In the deal signed yesterday, the hospitals corporation agreed to pay Mount Sinai $94 million to run the two hospitals in fiscal year 1998 -- $6 million less than it would have paid last week. That amount drops to $91.7 million the next year and may come down about another $20 million if the city decides to shift some technical workers from Mount Sinai's payroll to its own.
More importantly for the city, the new contract gives the hospitals corporation the authority to appoint and remove the medical directors at Queens and Elmhurst -- a point Mount Sinai had refused to cede in the earlier round of negotiations, people familiar with the deal said.
Mount Sinai also agreed to let the corporation levy financial penalties if the hospital failed to meet certain health care benchmarks. For example, the deal requires that 95 percent of the children getting their primary health care at the hospitals must be fully immunized by age 2 or Mount Sinai could face sanctions of up to $20,000 a year.
Earlier, Mount Sinai had said it would only agree to such penalties if the corporation agreed to pay comparable fines for failing to provide adequate support, like sufficient doses of vaccines or timely retrieval of charts.
Mount Sinai dropped that demand and settled instead for an agreement that the hospital would not be penalized if it could prove that it failed to meet its prescribed goals because of problems within the corporation's control.
"This deal proves that the value that H.H.C. brings to the city health care marketplace should not be undervalued," said Dr. Marcos, who had already printed 40 copies of the guidelines for bidding on the project and had taken out ads in The City Record seeking bidders. "Mount Sinai coming back and agreeing to these demands proves that this is a new era for H.H.C., in which we will take an increasingly powerful position."
Dr. Rowe said that he was relieved and pleased that he reached an agreement with the hospitals corporation. He said that for Mount Sinai, the importance of the deal was not the roughly $100 million it stood to lose if the contract went to somebody else.
For his hospital, he said, the decision was based on strategic economic considerations and the longstanding relationship between doctors and the people of Queens.
Mount Sinai depends on the two Queens hospitals to attract customers and give itself a presence in the borough -- important factors to the managed-care companies that increasingly control how health care is delivered in the city.
"We're very pleased with this agreement," Dr. Rowe said. "Look, we would prefer to get more, but we're satisfied."
City officials have long complained that the agreements they have with private medical institutions to run the city's 11 public hospitals have given them little control over how their dollars are spent. Last year, the hospitals corporation paid $505 million to private medical schools to provide staff for the public hospital system.
But all its latest contracts have included provisions giving the corporation greater say over quality and productivity.
Earlier this month, the corporation won a pivotal victory in its drive to gain greater control when Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons agreed to the new terms in its contract to run Harlem Hospital -- the first time one of the major academic medical centers agreed to such a deal.
Although Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has been outspoken in his desire to get the city out of the business of running hospitals -- saying the private sector can do a better and more efficient job -- some H.H.C. officials are wondering privately whether reports of the corporation's demise have been greatly exaggerated.
These officials are now saying that the willingness of prestigious medical school affiliates to agree to strict productivity terms highlights the value and the power of the city's public hospitals in the current health care market.
"For Mount Sinai to cave means that H.H.C. is stronger than anyone imagined," said one official, who spoke only on condition of anonymity. "This corporation may yet rise from the ashes and assume a key role in reshaping health care in the city."

HEADLINE: Man in the News: Robert Eugene Boyle;
Trusted Trouble-Shooter for Port Authority

BYLINE: By BRETT PULLEY 

 BODY:
When Robert E. Boyle was named chief executive of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center two years ago, skeptics wondered whether he was cut out for the task of eliminating the mismanagement, labor problems and mob corruption that had long consumed the state-run center. "I can't wait to prove the skeptics wrong," he said at the time.
For the most part, that is what he did, as he confronted the unions, lowered costs for exhibitors and improved service at the city's primary convention hall. Yesterday, his efforts were rewarded, as Gov. George E. Pataki of New York and Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey selected Mr. Boyle to be Executive Director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. 
 "Bob Boyle transformed the Javits Center from a mob-infested facility burdened by high costs and poor service into one of the premier convention centers in the world, with a seemingly unending list of shows and exhibits," Mr. Pataki said as he announced the selection of Mr. Boyle, a longtime friend and political supporter, to replace George J. Marlin as head of the Port Authority.
In his new job, Mr. Boyle, a 60-year-old construction industry entrepreneur from the Governor's hometown of Peekskill, will now head a much larger operation with a vastly different, and possibly more challenging, set of problems.
As the guardian of the region's gateways and the developer of major real estate projects, the Port Authority has been criticized by officials in both New York and New Jersey as a bloated bureaucracy whose focus has moved too far beyond its central purpose: to run airports, waterways and transportation links. The agency is in the midst of downsizing its workforce and shifting its focus from real estate development to improving the region's transportation infrastructure, including dredging its port channels and expanding its three major airports, and selling or privatizing management of real estate holdings like the World Trade Center.
"The biggest challenge is the next few years is going to be putting the port back in Port Authority," said Jon Orcutt, associate director of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, a New York-based policy watchdog. He criticized the agency as being "all over the map in its activities," and said that Mr. Boyle must rein in the agency, focus on issues like dredging the port channel to allow for bigger ships and more trade, and improve cooperation between New York and New Jersey.
The tension between the two neighboring states has often lurked just beneath the surface of relationships at the Port Authority. Mrs. Whitman, who was angered two years ago when Mr. Pataki announced his decision to appoint Mr. Marlin without consulting her, said yesterday she was pleased with the selection of Mr. Boyle.
But in a statement, she took care to note that Lewis M. Eisenberg, the chairman of the agency, whom she appointed, would continue to play an integral role at the agency. Mr. Boyle's "management skills will augment the leadership of Port Authority Chairman Lew Eisenberg," Mrs. Whitman said.
Yesterday, Mr. Boyle referred to "the number of significant issues that are dogging the Port Authority" as "a list too numerous to mention." In a telephone interview from his office in the convention center, he said his first priorities at the Port Authority would be to assess the relationship between New York and New Jersey and to consider how far the current downsizing at the agency should go. Since August 1995, the agency has reduced the number of employees to 7,300 from 9,100.
"Corporate America has been doing that kind of downsizing for years and increasing productivity at the same time," Mr. Boyle said. "You always hear criticism that its too much, too fast. Sometimes it's true. Sometimes it's a little true. Sometimes it's not true at all."
When Mr. Boyle arrived at the Javits Center in April 1995, his experience had been limited to running small and medium-sized companies. Although he had been widely credited with turning around the Hudson Valley Hospital Center, where he was volunteer chairman, not all of his business dealings had fared so well.
After graduating from La Salle University in Philadelphia, Mr. Boyle worked for a New York City concrete company, where he advanced in administration and operation. By the mid-1960's, he was part owner of Westchester Concrete, a company in Tarrytown, N.Y. As part owner of the company for more than two decades, he was financially successful, but one of his partners was accused by a Federal judge of dealing with a union official who was linked to organized crime.
Mr. Boyle, however, has said that he was better prepared for the Javits Center challenge because he had successfully fended off organized criminals in his businesses.
A condominium project that Mr. Boyle attempted to develop in Vermont also went into bankruptcy midway through construction.
As chairman of the hospital board, Mr. Boyle invited Mr. Pataki, a state assemblyman, to join the board. He became treasurer of Mr. Pataki's campaign for governor, and the two were so close that Mr. Boyle gave a $10,000 personal loan to Mr. Pataki in recent years.
At the Javits Center, Mr. Boyle trimmed administrative personnel and lowered labor costs. One of the other major challenges he faced in the $125,000-a-year job was the need to make the center larger and more attractive to conventions, which create far more money for the local economy than the trade exhibitions that currently dominate the center's calendar. In response, Mr. Boyle recently created a plan to expand the center.
The expansion proposal is still in its infancy, but Mr. Boyle will be in a position to help see it through. Even after assuming his $170,000-a-year post at the Port Authority, he will retain his position as chairman of the Javits Center's board.
"Bob has proven he is a good manager and can solve problems," said Charles Gargano, vice chairman of the authority. "I don't think there's a guessing game anymore about whether Bob can do the job."

HEADLINE: A Consensus Is Sought On Coding

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 28

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration's top overseas representative on cryptography -- or data scrambling -- told a group of skeptical computer industry executives and technical experts today that important allies support the Administration's position that governments should have access-coded computer files and digital communications.
The speech by David L. Aaron, made on the opening day of a computer security conference, was part of a renewed effort by the Administration to gain support for its efforts to control data-scrambling technologies, which are increasingly viewed as crucial components of electronic commerce and communications. 
 The Administration named Mr. Aaron, who is officially the special envoy to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, to the position late last year as part of its effort to establish an international consensus on use of the scrambling technologies.
The Administration is trying to persuade other governments to support its effort to create a de facto global standard that would force computer users to submit the keys to their codes for scrambling data to a separate authority, which would hold them in escrow.
Advocates for privacy rights have opposed such proposals because, they say, they compromise privacy and can easily be misused by governments and outside individuals and organizations.
The Administration has treated data encryption software as a weapon and restricted exports, angering American companies that believe the restrictions on exporting data-scrambling hardware and software will give competitive advantages to foreign concerns.
Indeed, today's speech by Mr. Aaron renewed the debate, which last year was heard out in Congress and in Federal courts, where the export regulations have been challenged.
Underscoring the likelihood that the debate will not go away soon, Senator Conrad Burns, Republican of Montana, said today that he would soon reintroduce legislation intended to limit the Administration's ability to control the export of the technology as well as efforts to enforce escrow systems that would create electronic backdoors to permit Government monitoring of data communications.
Mr. Burns, speaking to the conference via satellite, said he did not believe that the Government's efforts to control the spread of data-scrambling technology were workable. "I just don't think it will work," he said. "If bad people want to do bad things to good people, they're sure not going to give their keys to the F.B.I."
Mr. Aaron said the Government had made a good-faith effort to balance the interests of all the parties in the dispute, adding that the Government had significantly altered its position to accommodate business interests.
"I want to stress that this policy in no way seeks to expand the powers of law enforcement nor reduce the privacy protections of individuals," he said in the speech to a conference sponsored by RSA Data Security.
The president of the Information Technology Association of America, a computer and communications trade group, sent a letter to Mr. Aaron today that was critical of current draft guidelines of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. The guidelines, which are intended to develop an international consensus on data scrambling restrictions, are supposed to be in place in the spring.
"We believe there is a clear lack of balance in the most recent draft of the guidelines," wrote Harris N. Miller, the president of the association. "This lack of balance could have a detrimental effect on international trade and the world's ability to use the Internet for electronic commerce."
In an interview today, Mr. Aaron disputed the industry's view that the efforts to control cryptographic technology are being outstripped by the pace of the technology. "When I talk to other governments," he said, "they still don't feel that the cat is out of the bag."
Mr. Aaron said he had discussed cryptography issues with representatives of France, Britain, Germany, Belgium and Canada.

HEADLINE: THE SECOND TERM: THE OVERVIEW;
Options Are Open, Clinton Says, On How to Gain Balanced Budget

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 28

 BODY:
President Clinton said today that he would not rule out raising Medicare premiums for the wealthy or cutting capital gains taxes more deeply than he would prefer, in negotiating a balanced budget agreement with the Republican Congress.
At an hourlong White House news conference today, the President acknowledged Congressional criticisms of budget proposals he has made so far. But interpreting -- and answering -- the increasingly vigorous semaphore from Capitol Hill as he prepares to present his budget next week, Mr. Clinton argued that the tone of the criticism marked a significant and positive change. 
 "The most encouraging thing has been, to me, the way that my budget proposals have been received," the President said. "Even in criticism, they have not been rejected outright. You know, four years ago when I came here, nobody in Congress took a President's budget seriously. They said, 'Oh, his budget scenario is always rosy, the numbers are always cooked.' "
But he predicted that his budget would satisfy deficit hawks while fulfilling his campaign promises, including a proposal that he announced today for spending more on education. "The budget finally moves us beyond the false choices that have held us back for too long," he said, "and shows that we can cut our debt and invest in our children."
Mr. Clinton made his remarks in a news conference in the East Room that lurched from tax relief for the District of Columbia -- he said he favors it -- to progress on human rights in China under the Administration's policy -- he acknowledged that there has not been much, but argued that there would not have been much anyway. [Page A6.]
In his opening remarks, the President was husky and expansive in sketching his dreams for education in the United States.
But he grew testy and finger-pointing as he defended his Administration -- and, indeed, American politics in general -- from suggestions that big money had so corroded the political system that widespread cynicism was justified.
Mr. Clinton's remarks on the budget were the latest volley in indirect negotiations under way in the press between the White House and the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, and the House Ways and Means Committee chairman, Bill Archer, with Speaker Newt Gingrich hovering in the background.
White House aides said Mr. Clinton was intent on laying out his budget goals without condemning his opponents' priorities. But it remains unclear what the President hopes to gain during the coming private negotiations from such open-mindedness.
"I have tried to practice what I preach here," Mr. Clinton said today, in declining to rule out deeper capital gains tax cuts than he plans to propose in his budget. "I want to keep our powder dry; I want them to keep their powder dry."
The President said he would fight a constitutional amendment to enforce a balanced budget. But he also said he would submit a budget that continues to erode the annual deficit while increasing spending for education and welfare benefits for legal immigrants -- and containing an overall tax cut.
On Monday, Senator Lott said the Administration continued to "duck" the politically unpleasant task of passing some Medicare costs on to wealthy beneficiaries.
But even before today's news conference, Mr. Lott tried to take the edge off his criticisms of the President today.
"If you just read the headlines, for instance, maybe the perception would be that my remarks were harder than they were intended," the majority leader said, adding that he was "trying to rattle his cage just a little bit right here one week before he sends his budget."
Mr. Clinton also said today that his budget would make good on a campaign promise of a narrow exemption on the capital gains tax for the sale of homes. Republicans want a far deeper cut, a 50 percent reduction in the overall capital gains tax, which now has a top rate of 28 percent.
The President said that capital gains tax cuts were not a "particularly high priority with me," partly because he was not convinced they would drive economic growth. But he refused to limit the negotiations by ruling such cuts out.
In discussing his budget plans, Mr. Clinton fully revealed his hand only on education financing today, calling for a range of increases in Government spending.
Mr. Clinton's aides said that his education initiatives -- a combination of new tax credits, tax deductions, and money to hook classrooms up to the Internet -- would require $50.5 billion in additional spending over the next five years, but that they would all be paid for in a budget that would balance by the year 2002.
"We have altered the debate that has been raging in Washington for a decade," said Rahm Emanuel, senior adviser to the President. "You can balance the budget while increasing spending for education and other investments. That's a dramatic break with the past."
Most of the new education money would go to finance three forms of new or expanded tax relief or other assistance for college students. Depending on its financial situation and the cost of a student's college, each eligible family would choose one or a combination of the three options, Administration officials said.
As the President first proposed in a commencement speech at Princeton last June, he called today for financing new "Hope Scholarship" tax credits for the first two years of college -- "to achieve our goal," Mr. Clinton said, "of making two years of college education as universal as a high school diploma is today."
The program would provide up to a $1,500 tax credit for a student's first year of college, with another $1,500 for the second year if the student maintained a B average. Some critics have said the program may force the Internal Revenue Service to start checking report cards.
The credit, intended to help middle-income families scraping to meet tuition costs, would be available to families earning up to $100,000 a year. At the same time, Mr. Clinton said he would seek to expand financing for Pell Grants, which provide tuition assistance for families generally earning less than $40,000 a year. Some families could qualify for a combination of both Hope Scholarships and Pell Grants.
The President also proposed spending $17.6 billion by the year 2002 to offer a tax deduction of up to $10,000 for the cost of each year of college. The Administration said the deduction would be phased out for families earning from $80,000 to $100,000 a year.
Mr. Clinton emphasized today that, despite such new spending, his budget was headed toward balance by the year 2002. But he rejected the idea of a balanced budget amendment as "bad economic policy and bad policy."
"When you amend the Constitution, you do it forever," he said. "No one can foresee the circumstances that will come a generation from now or 50 years from now or even 10 years from now."
The President was far less definitive when it came to his stand on Medicare. Repeatedly during his re-election campaign, he stressed his role in budget negotiations in 1995 as a bulwark against Republican cuts in Medicare. But he declined to rule out an increase in premiums for the wealthy today, noting that he had once sought such an increase as part of his unsuccessful plan to overhaul the nation's health care system.
"I have never said that I would rule that out, but I didn't want to rule it in," he said today. "I'm prepared to meet with Senator Lott and discuss that and other issues."
Mr. Lott was more direct today in describing the political peril of being the first party to propose unpopular budget cuts, in discussing with reporters some of the conversations he has had with Mr. Clinton.
"We keep talking about holding hands and jumping off together," he said. "But we're still saying, 'You first.' "

HEADLINE: THE SECOND TERM;
Excerpts From the First News Conference of Clinton's Second Term

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 28

 BODY:
Following is President Clinton's opening statement at a news conference today, and excerpts from his exchange with reporters, as recorded by the Federal Document Clearing House, a private transcription service: 
 Good afternoon. Thank you.
Before I take your questions, I would like to make a brief statement about the balanced budget that I will send to Congress next week. This budget shows that we can meet two of our most crucial national priorities at the same time. It proves we can protect our children from a future burdened by reckless debt even as we give them the educational opportunities they need to make the most of the 21st century.
The budget finally moves us beyond the false choices that have held us back for too long and shows that we can cut our debt and invest in our children.
The budget will help to renew our public schools. It will expand Head Start, help rebuild crumbling classrooms. It will double funding for public charter schools, giving parents more choice in how they educate their children.
It will increase funding for Goals 2000 by 26 percent.
And it will help our students to reach high standards and master the basics of reading, writing, math and science.
It will also enable us to protect -- excuse me -- to connect our schools and our libraries to the information superhighway. The budget more than doubles our investment in technology to hook our children up to computers and the Internet. And it increases by a third our investment in partnerships with teachers and industries to develop quality educational programming and technology.
In short, the budget will connect our children to the best educational technology in the world.
It will also open the doors of college education wider than ever before. I'd like to take a minute now simply to outline our unprecedented commitment to higher education.
With this budget, national support for college education in the year 2002 will be more than double what it was on the day I first took office, going from $24 billion to $58 billion a year.
The budget will fully pay for a $1,500-a-year tuition tax credit, a HOPE scholarship for the first two years of college, to make the typical community college affordable for every American and to achieve our goal of making two years of college education as universal as a high school diploma is today.
It will also allow a working family to deduct up to $10,000 a year for taxes for the cost of any college tuition or job training. And with our special I.R.A. for education, most parents will be able to save for college tuition without ever paying a penny in taxes.
In addition, my balanced budget takes further steps to widen the circle of educational opportunity. It provides a 25 percent increase in funding for Pell grants, the largest increase in the maximum scholarship in 20 years, so that over four million students will get up to $3,000 a year. We'll make 130,000 more students eligible for these scholarships. And we will open the scholarships to 218,000 older, low-income Americans who want to go to college.
Second, under the balanced budget we will present, we will continue to reform our student loan programs to make college loans easier for students to get and easier to pay back. We will cut interest rates on loans to students while they're in school. We will cut loan fees for four million low- and middle-income students in half. Fees on two and a half million more will be cut by 25 percent. Taken together, these two steps will save American families $2.6 billion over five years.
Third, we will increase funding again for work-study positions for students. That will take us, over about a three-year period, from 700,000 work-study positions to one million work-study positions per year.
And it will help us to meet our goal of getting 100,000 of those work-study students to participate as tutors in our initiative to make sure that all of our 8-year-olds can read independently.
To encourage community service, we will also provide tax incentives to encourage loan forgiveness for students who, after college, choose professions that give something back -- people who use their education to work as teachers, in homeless shelters, as doctors in remote rural areas.
Altogether, these proposals will move us much closer to our clear national goal -- an America where every 8-year-old can read, where every 12-year-old can log on to the Internet, where every 18-year-old can go to college, where all Americans will have the knowledge they need to meet the challenges of the 21st century. I am very proud of this budget.
Finally, let me say a word about campaign finance reform. We all know we need to find a new way to finance our campaigns and to bring the aggregate spending levels under control. Anyone who is involved in politics must accept responsibility for this problem and take responsibility to repair it. That is true for me and true for others as well. Last week I met with Senators John McCain and Russ Feingold and Representatives Chris Shays and Marty Meehan. They have introduced tough, balanced, credible bipartisan campaign finance reform legislation. I pledged my support to them. I pledge it again today. I pledge again to help them pass this legislation.
Any legislation we pass should be bipartisan, should limit spending and should leave the playing field level between parties and between incumbents and challengers. This is our best chance in a generation to give the American people campaigns that are worthy of the world's oldest continuous democracy. I call on the members of both parties to work with us to get the job done.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Q. What should the American people think of a Presidential campaign in which a day at the White House is sold for $250,000 a couple and the Republican Party sells a season ticket of access to Capitol Hill for $250,000?
A. Well, first let me say I dispute a little bit the characterization there. I can't speak for the Republicans. They'll have to speak for themselves. But the people who were there on the day in question were not charged a fee. Some of them were our contributors; had contributed in the past -- they had raised money for me in the past. Some of them had not. And so I don't think it's quite an accurate characterization.
But I will say this: If you look at the money that was raised and spent -- not only by the parties and their respective campaign committees in the Senate and House, but also by all these independent and apparently independent third-party committees -- and you look at the exponential cost of the campaigns that are related to communications, surely we can use this opportunity to make something positive come out of this.
I mean, I think that . . . every one of us who has participated in this system, even if we did it because we thought we had to do it to survive or to just keep up, has to take some responsibility for its excesses. And I take mine. But we have got to do something about it. And the only way we can do anything about it is to pass the legislation, the McCain-Feingold bill or some acceptable variation thereof.
Q. Mr. President, with all the focus on the Democratic fund-raising right now, why are you attending a million-dollar fund-raiser tonight? What kind of -- what kind of an image do you think this leaves? And why do these donors make these big-money contributions? What do they get in return?
A. Well, first of all, under all conceivable campaign finance reform scenarios, it will still be necessary for the parties to raise some money. And there is -- neither party has the capacity to raise all their money from direct-mail campaigns and contributions of $100 or less. The Business Council, the group that is having this fund-raiser tonight, is one that would be quite consistent with the McCain-Feingold bill, were it to pass. And I frankly am very appreciative of the fact that these folks have been willing to come and help us, and that we have increased the ranks of, particularly, younger, more entrepreneurial people in the Democratic Party supporting us.
So I think it's an important thing to do. I don't think there's anything wrong with raising money for the political process. The problem is, it is the volume of money, the amount of money, the time it takes to raise, the inevitable questions that are raised.
Now, I can tell you what they get from me. I don't know -- you have to ask them what they expect. What they get from me, I think, is a respectful hearing if they have some concern about the issues. It think it's a good thing when contributors care about the country and have some particular area of expertise they want to contribute. But nobody buys a guaranteed result, nor should they ever. They should get a respectful hearing. The President should do what's right for the country.
Tax Cuts and Increases
Q. Mr. President, in your new budget that you'll submit next week to Congress, there will be tax cut proposals, including some of the education tax cut proposals you outlined today. But there also, presumably, will be some tax increases in the form of what you would describe as corporate welfare -- getting rid of some of the tax breaks that big businesses have now. Some Republicans are already suggesting that net-wise, your tax -- your budget proposal will have a net increase in taxes as opposed to a net decrease. Is that a fair assessment----
A. No.
Q. of your budget?
A. I believe that's incorrect. And let me say I also believe -- and again I'm speaking from memory now, I have not discussed this with Mr. Raines in the last several weeks -- but I believe that, No. 1, I believe it's incorrect, that we do have a net tax cut. . . .
No. 2, I believe that virtually all of the corporate loophole closings that we have in this budget are ones that we had discussed with and reached at least minimal agreement on with the Congressional leadership back during the budget negotiations when we were having them last year. I believe that to be the case. And if it's not, I'll stand corrected, but I think that's accurate.
Q. Mr. President, Boris Yeltsin has been out of work for more than six months now because of his health problems. How has that affected your ability to do business with the Russian Government? And a related question: how will Yeltsin's health problems affect the timing and location of the next U.S.-Soviet summit, which had been set for March?
A. First let me make the most important statement I think I can make to your question, which is, I have no private information that is inconsistent with the public statements of the Russian Government on President Yeltsin's health. I have no reason to believe, based on any information I have, that his condition is any different from what the Russian Government has said it is. . . .
Secondly, I have been very impressed by the extent to which President Yeltsin made appropriate delegations to Mr. Chernomyrdin during the period of his convalescence leading up to the surgery, and then in this period after the surgery when he developed his illness.
And the Vice President and Mr. Chernomyrdin are going to meet pretty soon in their ongoing relationship. We have a huge, full agenda. And we have been given no impression by the Russians that we aren't still going to have the Yeltsin-Clinton meeting in the March time frame. . . . And I expect it to be an important one and, I hope, a successful one. . . .
Q. Mr. President, in your inaugural address eight days ago, you outlined some quite lofty goals -- for example, the education proposals you were speaking about today. But in the days since, many questions in the press and in Congress have focused on issues like campaign fund-raising. My question is whether you are worried that the well is being poisoned even now for the realization of these goals before you can even get out of the gate, particularly on the issue of bipartisanship?
A. No. But all I can do is speak for myself. I have tried to conduct a Presidency and regard my words in a way that would make it clear that I intend to follow through on my commitment to try to establish a working partnership and a dynamic center -- not a stable, stale one, but a dynamic one -- with people in both parties.
I think we will have to continue to work on that. . . . You know, just a few days ago, there were -- someone asked me if I thought that in the House, the issue of the Speaker would poison the well. And I didn't, and I don't. I don't think it has.
I just think that when matters come up that have to be dealt with, they need to be dealt with and disposed of. But the American people expect us to focus on how we can lift their lives and improve our conditions and move our people together and deal with the things that are before us. And I think if we do that and do it in a good-faith way, we'll be able to go forward. . . .
The most encouraging thing has been, to me, the way that my budget proposals have been received. Even in criticism, they have not been rejected outright.
You know, four years ago, when I came here, nobody in Congress took a President's budget seriously. They said all these budget scenarios, always rosy -- the numbers are always cooked.
We now have four years in a row when I presented conservative budget figures, when we brought the deficit down by over 60 percent and when -- now both sides are keeping their powder dry enough to create the possibility we can reach a balanced budget agreement.
So on balance, I'm still quite hopeful.
Bombing in Saudi Arabia
Q. Mr. President, both your Attorney General and the F.B.I. Director recently expressed concerns about the level of cooperation from Saudi Arabia into the investigation into the bombing that killed 19 American soldiers last year. What's your assessment of their level of cooperation? And do you have confidence in the security of the U.S. men who are still on duty there?
A. Let me answer the second question first. We have worked very hard, as you know, since the Khobar incident to enhance the security of our armed forces personnel in Saudi Arabia. In that endeavor, we have received the cooperation of the Saudi Government. We have relocated a large number of people. We have done a lot of work. We've invested a lot of money. So have they.
And we believe that there is no such thing as a risk-free world, but we believe that our armed forces are more secure today. And we feel good about that.
On the investigation -- clearly from our point of view and our Government, the F.B.I. is in charge of that. They have sought the answers to some more questions. The Saudi Government has assured us from the very highest levels that they would get answers to those questions. And so I expect that to happen.
And that's all I can tell you at this time. The process is ongoing. The investigation is ongoing. The relationship is ongoing.
As you can imagine, this creates -- an investigation of this kind phrases all kinds of complex questions about cooperation against sovereignty, about what other interests of that nation might be in play. But I'm confident that, in the end, they will do what I have been assured personally by the highest levels of the Saudi Government they should do.
Q. So you're satisfied with the level to this date?
A. Well, it's still in process. We have to see if it comes out all right. But . . . there are further request for information that are ongoing. We'll see how it comes out. Yes?
Q. Mr. President, the Chinese have been making a lot of noise about clamping down on civil liberties in Hong Kong. How concerned are you about this? And will this upset our relationship in any way?
A. Well, it wouldn't help anything. I'm concerned about it, and I think the -- we don't know yet what's going to happen. But the Chinese have basically said that it would be a part of China, but its system would be left intact.
And I think there may be some ambivalence about what it means to leave their system intact. And I think maybe some would assume that you could impose political uniformity on Hong Kong and leave its economic vibrancy intact. It really is in some ways almost a perfect open market, you know.
And I don't know if that's true or not. It's a complex society. I think anyone who's ever been to Hong Kong more than once -- and I've been there on several occasions in my life -- probably leaves with the feeling I had, that you could go there a thousand times and you might not ever understand it all.
It's a complicated society. And I'm not so sure that it can exist, with all of its potential to help China modernize its own economy and open opportunities for its own people, if the civil liberties of the people are crushed.
So I think it would be wrong on its own merits, but I think it might wind up being less useful to China. So I would hope very much that they would look for ways to maximize the continuation not only of the economic system but of the personal freedoms that the people of Hong Kong have enjoyed in making it such an economic engine. . . .
Q. Back on this issue of fund-raising. You've talked about it maybe in general terms, but specifically last week the White House put out a list of coffees. It showed that at one coffee that included the Comptroller of the Currency, the Secretary of the Treasury, there were people who -- bankers who had contributed something like $325,000. You attended that coffee. There was another coffee with another regulator of the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Something like $500,000 was contributed by people who were at that coffee.
And I wondered if, in retrospect, you had any feelings about, No. 1, regulators being at political coffees, and also your own participation. Obviously you're not going to be doing this again for your own re-election, but is this something that you have decided you will continue doing? And what have you come to in your own mind on this issue?
A. I have a different opinion about my participation and the regulators' participation. First let me tell you about the -- I can only comment on the first instance you mentioned, the bankers meeting.
I think it is an appropriate thing and can be a good thing for the President and for the Secretary of the Treasury to meet with a group of bankers and listen to them and listen to their concerns and, if they have certain issues, to explore those issues.
I can tell you categorically that no decision ever came out of any of those coffees where I or anyone else said, "This person is a contributor of ours; do what they ask us to do." But I think those meetings are good. I think the President should keep in touch with people. I think he should listen to people. I never learn very much when I'm talking, and I normally learn something when I'm listening. So I think that they're good.
In retrospect, since the D.N.C. sponsored it, I do not think the Comptroller of the Currency should have been there. I agree with Mr. Ludwig. And he should have been told who was sponsoring it, and it would have been better had he not come. I agree with that.
But I think there's a distinction to be made between the President meeting with people, listening to them, and then, at least, if they raise some serious issues, having them looked into. But I never made a decision for anybody because they were contributors of mine. I don't need that.
But I do think it's important to listen to people. But you're right, I mean -- or he was right. It would have been better if he had not been there. Regulators should not come to meetings that are sponsored -- that have any kind of political sponsorship, I don't think. . . .
Q. Do you intend to keep going with these coffees?
A. I don't know. But I can you tell you that I -- well, I intend to keep going with coffees. I don't know whether they'll be sponsored by the D.N.C. or whether we'll just bring them in through our own regular offices.
But I also had lots and lots and lots of coffees over the last four years that had nothing to do with the D.N.C., where a lot of people came -- were not contributors or even active supporters of mine, but they were from different walks of life around the country. And I found them very helpful -- where I just sit down and talk for four or five minutes, and then listen for an hour or so, and maybe ask questions based on whatever people had to say to me.
I think it's an effective way for the President to hear firsthand how the operations of the Government or developments in the country are affecting people. So I think that the coffees themselves are a very good device. But I do believe, particularly if sponsored by a political party, it's not appropriate for the regulator to be there. . . .
Social Security
Q. A number of Democrats in Congress oppose a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution unless the Government promises to stop spending surplus Social Security funds, borrowing them and spending them. Would you -- though you oppose an amendment, you will propose a balanced budget. Will you stop using surplus Social Security funds?
A. Well, the using -- the funds that are collected on Social Security are going to be invested in some way. When you say using, what they do, they cover the deficit by basically being sold for Government securities.
Social Security is not therefore in effect separated from the Government. But those securities will come back with interest to the Government later on. And, by then, what will have to happen is when we start running short of money, 20 years or so from now, the Government will have to have been on a balanced budget for some years by then so that when the bonds are repaid, they can be used to pay Social Security.
We couldn't right now, neither the Republicans nor I and the Congress could produce a balanced budget tomorrow that could pass with -- if you said the Social Security funds cannot be counted, if you will, as part of the budget.
But let me say -- you raise an interesting question, however, and this is why I don't favor this amendment.
I've given the Congress a plan to balance the budget. I've made it clear that we will work with them to meet the Congressional Budget Office budgetary projections, and we're going to do this. And now, they know that I have credibility, because we've worked on it for four years and we've done almost two-thirds of the work.
When you amend the Constitution, you do it forever. No one can foresee the circumstances that will come up generations from now or 50 years from now or even 10 years from now. And the way I read the amendment, it would almost certainly require -- after a budget is passed, if the economic estimates turn out to be wrong -- the executive branch -- the President, the Treasury Department -- to impound Social Security checks or to turn it over to courts to decide what's to be done.
And it would put us in a position, in my view, of doing things that are counterproductive. You know, we -- the Congress is set to vote on this, the House is, against a background of four years of stable growth and four years of declining deficits. But we don't know what external factors in the world might be brought to bear on our country in the next 10 or 15 years that might have terribly counterproductive impulses if we were cutting aid to children and raising taxes in the teeth of a big recession, or we were impounding Social Security checks or something of that kind.
I just think that, you know, the Congress has an obligation to think of what could happen here in the future and ask themselves whether they really want to straitjacket the United States. What we ought to do is follow prudent policies, balance the budget and go forward. But we shouldn't compromise what might happen 10, 15 years from now with an amendment to the Constitution.
I think it's bad economic policy and bad policy. And I think we're going to wind up with some decisions in the courts and some decisions on Social Security and aid to kids and other things that future generations won't be very grateful to us for, just because it seems so popular now because we haven't balanced the budget since 1969. . . .
Q. Could I just follow up on one thing? There are a number of reform plans around that would give people part of their taxes back to put into private accounts. If it was only part of their taxes, and some sort of safety net was preserved, would you favor some private accounts out of Social Security tax money?
A. Well, first of all, I would favor nothing that would compromise the integrity of the system.
Secondly, even the Social Security advisory commission couldn't agree on that. So I can't make a decision on that to support something like that without knowing more about it.
There are two different options, you know, that were recommended -- or three different ones, and I just -- I think that what we need to do, as I've said before, we need to make some changes in Social Security to lengthen its life a little bit. We don't want to start getting in trouble in 2019. It ought to have a longer lifespan than that.
And we ought to do it through a bipartisan process that is either like the one that was done in 1983 or that at least consults all the people who will be affected by it.
And I think, if we start now, we can make modest changes that won't be too burdensome to anybody that will secure Social Security for another 50 years, and I think that's what we ought to be doing. . . .
Q. Your annual human rights report is about to come out this week. It's reported that it will say there are no active dissidents in China. They're either all exiled or they're in jail. Does this mean that your policy of constructive engagement has failed to get the kind of results you wanted to get on China's human rights behavior?
A. It means that we have not made the progress in human rights that I think -- that I had hoped to make, yes. But it does not mean that if we had followed a policy of isolating ourselves from China, when no one else in the world was prepared to do that, that we would have gotten better results.
And I think -- I still believe over the long run, being engaged with China, working with them where we can agree -- which helps us on a whole range of security issues that directly bear on the welfare of the American people, like the problems on the Korean Peninsula -- and continuing to be honest and forthright and insistent where we disagree, has the greatest likelihood of having a positive impact on China.
Keep in mind the time horizon here for how we judge them has to be broadened a little bit. They tend to look at things on a long-time horizon. They're going through some significant changes themselves within their country, economic and political changes. And I believe that the impulses of the society and the nature of the economic change will work together along with the availability of information from the outside world to increase the spirit of liberty over time. . . .
Q. Mr. President, some lawmakers on Capitol Hill still think it would be a good idea to appoint an independent counsel to investigate some of the campaign fund-raising that occurred last year. And at the same time, if -- what's your latest thinking on that?
And at the same time, if I may, you often decry what you call a cynicism that you believe is pervasive in Washington. But given the amounts of money that were raised last year, the way they were raised and some of the explanations for the way they were raised, isn't the public entitled to a little bit of healthy skepticism, if not cynicism, about the entire process?
A. Well, to answer your first question, I'm going to take Bob Dole's advice, because that's a decision for the Attorney General to make. And to answer your second question, yes, healthy skepticism is warranted.
But keep in mind, I would say to the skeptics, the vast majority, the huge percentage, way over 90 percent, the vast majority of the money that was raised by both the Democrats and the Republicans was raised by -- in a perfectly lawful fashion, completely consistent with the requirements of the law. The vast majority of the people who gave money to both the Democrats and the Republicans were people who believed passionately in the course that those two parties were pursuing, in the candidates and what they were trying to do, and to the House committees and to the Senate committees.
The problem is that the margins create great problems because of the sheer volume of money that is being raised today. As I said before, it's too much money, it takes too much time to raise, it raises too many questions. And the cynicism is well founded -- the skepticism is well founded. If it becomes cynicism, then it removes the incentive on the part of the Congress to pass campaign finance reform, because cynics will say it won't make any difference anyway.
If you look at the present campaign laws, I think you can make a compelling case. I know I heard this point made, but I believe it to be true. I believe when these reforms arose out of the Watergate thing, back in the mid 70's, I think that worked pretty well for several years. I believe they elevated the reputation of politics, and I think the reforms worked pretty well.
What happened is no system in a world changing like ours can be maintained indefinitely because the economy changes and, particularly, look at how your work has changed. I mean, you've got -- when you travel with me, you carry those little computers around and you run these pictures up on computers and you send them from the planes somewhere else. I mean, just think of all the things that have changed.
This system has not been fixed in over 20 years. During that 20 years, there has been an explosion in ways of communicating with people and an exponential increase in the cost of communicating. And a system which, I would argue to you, really worked pretty well from after it was passed in '74 and going forward, yes, frankly, it had been overtaken by events.
So cynical, no; a healthy skepticism, you bet. We should always be skeptical. But we need to change the system. It's got to be -- it's just outdated. . . .
Q. Mr. President, what specific mechanisms do you plan on working with the private sector, in terms of creating more welfare jobs for people who are on welfare?
A. Primarily, two. One, I will offer a special tax incentive. And there's a story about it today, I think, in The New York Times -- a special tax incentive. It'll be a 50 percent credit for up to $10,000 a year in pay for people who are clearly, provably hired from welfare and put in a new job.
Secondly, we have given the states -- and there was a story, I think, in The Post today talking about how a lot of the states are trying to push this down to the community level. That's good. That's not bad. That's good, as long as they give the communities the means they need.
The second thing is that every community should know that the employers in that community, if they hire people from welfare to work, can get what used to be the welfare check for at least a year to use as an employment and training subsidy.
Why? The welfare rolls have gone down 2.1 million in the last four years. It's the biggest drop in history. I think a fair reading of it would say about half of this decline came from an improved economy and about half of it came from intensified efforts to move people from welfare to work. Now, I don't have any scientific division. But anyway, there is some division there.
The rest of the people that are on welfare now by and large are people who will be more difficult to move from welfare to work and have stay there. So I think, you know, we're going to have to give some incentives.
But if it works, and if every community in the country would set up an employment council and turn this into a family and an employment program, like Kansas City has, and every -- all employers have those two incentives, I think we'll be able to meet the requirements of this welfare reform bill in a way that will be good for the people on welfare and good for their kids.
Help for Legal Immigrants
Q. Mr. President, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee over the weekend laid down some markers for what he thinks would create a few chances for your budget to be alive on arrival on the Hill. On welfare, one of the things he mentioned was increased spending for legal immigrants. And he said he hoped you wouldn't insist on it. How do you deal with that in your budget? And will you continue to insist on it? . . .
A. Well, let me say I like Mr. Archer very much. . . . But there have been reports in the last couple of days about Republican governors with high immigrant populations coming back to their Republican Congressional leaders and saying please reconsider this. I have to -- my budget will contain funds and proposed changes consistent with the promises I made when I signed the welfare reform bill and when I campaigned to the American people on this issue. I believe that the bill is counterproductive in the way it treats legal immigrants who, through no fault of their own, wind up in desperate circumstances. . . .
So I will propose some changes, and I hope that when you get all through here, that, again, I hope this will be treated just like the budget issue. I would ask our friends on the Republican side, and the Democrats who care as passionately about this as I do, to keep our powder dry. Let us make our case on the merits. . . .
Q. Mr. President, your Medicare reform plan was criticized for relying too heavily on savings squeezed from health care providers. Why shouldn't Americans who can afford to pay higher Medicare premiums pay them?
A. Well, let me respond to the criticism. First of all, in my health care reform proposal I supported higher income -- increases in Medicare premiums on higher-income Americans, but it was part of a comprehensive health care reform.
What I was attempting to do after meeting at some length with Secretary Shalala, who worked through these issues with me, the specifics of the Medicare reform, was to demonstrate that we could balance the budget, meet the Republicans halfway and put 10 years on the life of the trust fund without a premium increase.
If we're going to have a longer term Medicare reform, I never said that I would rule that out. But I didn't want to rule it in. I presented a budget that was consistent with my priorities, and I'm prepared to meet with Senator Lott and discuss that and other issues. But I presented the budget that I thought was the best budget to achieve our objectives. . . .
Q. Mr. President, in Chicago the day you gave your acceptance speech at the convention you unveiled a plan where -- in which homeowners would not have to pay virtually any capital gains taxes. We haven't heard much about it since then, and my question is: Is that going to be in your budget, that proposal, and will you go a little further if the Republicans want to do a little more on capital gains?
A. The answer is yes, my homeowner's exemption, capital gains exemption, is in the budget. Everything I talked about at Chicago is in the budget. And the capital gains issue has never been a particularly high priority with me, because I've never seen it demonstrated as a big engine of economic growth over all and because I thought the previous -- and, as you know, this is nothing new -- that the proposal that the Republicans made in their budget I thought was entirely excessive and would really almost squander money by having it be retroactive.
But what I've -- I have tried to practice what I preach here. I want to keep our powder dry, and I want them to keep their powder dry. I will present a budget, but I know what my priorities are. I know what theirs are on the taxes. And that what we need to do is to meet each other in good faith.

HEADLINE: Behind the Scams: Desperate People, Easily Duped

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Jan. 28

 BODY:
As Albanian leaders began blaming one another today for a series of investment swindles that cost people hundreds of millions of dollars, experts said the debacle fit neatly with a pattern that has now bedeviled almost every formerly Communist country in Europe.
The collapse of Albanian pyramid schemes in the last two weeks, igniting riots in Tirana, the capital, and other cities, was almost identical to calamities for tens of thousands of people duped by similar schemes in Russia, Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia and other places. 
 In each case, companies bombarded people with advertisements and other promotions that guaranteed phenomenal returns on their investments -- 30 percent a month, in the case of one Albanian scheme. The schemes have typically had a carnival quality: they were not predicated on investing in a new company or real estate, but rather on the magical allure of making money from nothing.
By Western standards, the schemes are breathtakingly transparent. The guarantees of huge profits were impossible. The promoters offered no explanations for how profits would be made. The advertisements, dwelling on images of fast cars or exotic beach vacations, would raise an immediate red flag in the United States or Western Europe.
Yet hundreds of thousands, if not more, people in the former East Bloc countries have flocked to such schemes. Three years ago, a huge Russian investment scheme called MMM collapsed after attracting about $1 billion with glitzy television ads promising certain profits.
In Serbia, residents of Belgrade, the capital, lost millions by believing in huge monthly interest rates offered by the Dafina Bank in a type of pyramid scheme. In Romania, thousands of customers in the city of Kluj literally went to the local football stadium to hand over fistfuls of cash to promoters of a pyramid scheme called Caritas, or Charity.
And now, in Albania, people have been entrusting their money to at least 10 major pyramid operators, one of whom is a gypsy fortune-teller, complete with a crystal ball, who claimed to know the future -- at least until she declared bankruptcy two weeks ago and was jailed.
Most of the schemes also appear to have been aided by Government officials and prominent executives. One of the biggest boosters of the Caritas scheme in Romania was the Mayor of Kluj, Gheorgh Funar. Though not an executive of the Caritas group, the Mayor managed to have Caritas pay for a series of renovation projects for the city. Even though the scheme collapsed and cost hundreds of people their life savings, Mr. Funar remains Mayor.
Experts who watch Central and Eastern European economies say the wave of swindles in them is symptomatic of their lack of experience in Western-style investment. Popular understanding is limited, regulatory protections are almost nonexistent and many people are willing to grasp at straws because they are in dire economic straits.
"It is a very common phenomenon in post-socialist countries," said Jens Reuter, an analyst at the Sudost Institut, a research organization in Munich, Germany, that specializes in Central European economics. "People have very little experience, so when they hear promises that are impossible, inconceivable, they tend to believe them."
But, Mr. Reuter added, the life cycle of such pyramid schemes may already be drawing to a close as investors learn from their mistakes. "Albania was almost the only country that had not gone through something like this, and it may be the last," he said.
In each case, events have followed a similar pattern. Early customers would reap huge profits, quickly fueling wild excitement and a flood of new investors. But as in all pyramid schemes, the first investors were simply being paid by money from the later investors. As soon as it became impossible to drum up enough new investors to pay off the expanding base of earlier arrivals, the schemes collapsed.
Experts say that more than naivete is responsible for the rise and spectacular collapse of the Central and Eastern European pyramid scandals. In Russia, for example, inflation was so high three years ago that ordinary people were legitimately worried about simply parking their money under a mattress and watching it rapidly lose its value. But investors had few Western-style investment alternatives, creating a huge opportunity for the promoters of the huge swindle known as MMM.
"People are betting on miracles," remarked Anneli Gabanyi, a Romanian-born economist at the Sudost Institut who watched in disbelief as some of her own relatives invested in the Caritas scheme. "But if you had been through what these people have been through, it's not so hard to understand. If you had seen Communism suddenly collapse, without violence, wouldn't you believe in miracles too?"

HEADLINE: NEW YORK SENATE ROUNDLY REJECTS CASINO GAMBLING

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 28

 BODY:
The State Senate overwhelmingly rejected a constitutional amendment to legalize casino gambling today, effectively killing the proposal until at least 1999.
The vote dashed the hopes of resort owners, local officials and gambling enthusiasts from the Catskills to Niagara Falls who had envisioned casinos as a potential wellspring of tax dollars and corporate profits. 
 The 41-to-19 vote ended several years of debate and weeks of intensive lobbying that had pitted a diverse group of opponents, including religious leaders, environmentalists and Donald Trump, against mayors and business leaders from areas where casinos would have been authorized, principally the Catskills, Buffalo, Niagara Falls and the Lake George area.
The measure faced its stiffest opposition in the Republican-controlled Senate, and had it passed there today, the Democratic-controlled Assembly was widely expected to approve it next week. With that, the amendment would have gone to the voters for final approval in a statewide referendum in November.
The Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, a Republican of Rensselaer County, said after today's vote that he would be willing to restart the lengthy process of amending the State Constitution later this year if he detected broad support for a different casino amendment -- probably one that included New York City. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and many Senate Democrats had harshly attacked the current proposal because it would not have allowed casinos in New York City.
But while adding the city to a casino amendment might help its chances of passage in the Senate, Mr. Bruno said, it might hurt the measure in the Assembly because the Democratic Speaker, Sheldon Silver of Manhattan, has adamantly opposed the idea.
Even if a revised version of the amendment were approved by the Legislature this year, it would have to be re-approved by a newly elected Legislature in 1999 before going to voters in a referendum. Mr. Bruno added that if there was not strong support within the Senate for a new amendment, he would not let the Senate consider the current measure again until 1999 at the earliest.
"This is an issue that won't go away forever," Mr. Bruno said in a news conference after the vote. "Not when you have the world's largest casino within an hour and a half drive of New York City." He was referring to the Mashantucket Pequot's Foxwood casino in Ledyard, Conn.
The amendment failed largely because the political force needed to overcome the diverse and aggressive opposition never materialized. Apparently neither Gov. George E. Pataki nor Mr. Bruno -- both of whom supported passage of the amendment in the Legislature -- pressured members to vote yes. Both men said they wanted Senators to vote their consciences on the matter.
In the end, 19 of 35 Republicans voted no, most of them citing concerns about the morality or social costs of gambling. All but three of the 25 Democrats present voted against it, many saying they thought that New York City would gain nothing from it. And Nassau County's five Republicans all voted no, in part because their county chairman, Joseph Mondello, had asked them to. The strongest support for the amendment came from upstate legislators whose communities would most clearly have benefited from the measure.
Anthony M. Masiello, Mayor of Buffalo, called the vote "a significant setback for our city to be able to create jobs, increase revenues for services and revitalize the downtown."
Saying he was disappointed by the vote, Mr. Pataki expressed concerns about the economic future of tourist business in the Catskills and Niagara Falls, which he said had been "dramatically" hurt by casinos in Canada and neighboring states.
And in Yonkers, disappointed officials of Yonkers Raceway said they had been counting on slot machines to turn the track's fortunes around.
"It's something we've been hoping for for years, as we watched casinos crop up in New Jersey or Connecticut and watched the money go south or east,"said Frank Drucker, publicity director for the racetrack.
But opponents of the amendment were jubilant, saying they had been worried that if the amendment went to a statewide referendum, they would have faced an uphill campaign against well-financed casino supporters.
"Ours is a grass-roots operation, and so it's hard to overcome big money," said the Rev. Duane Motley, executive director of New Yorkers for Constitutional Freedoms, an evangelical Christian group based near Rochester.
With today's vote, New York joined what many gambling analysts consider a national trend against the spread of casino gambling.
During the late 1980's and early 90's, the industry experienced swift growth beyond its historic roots in Atlantic City and Nevada. Casinos opened in 24 states, some on boats or on Indian reservations.
But last year, voters in seven out of nine states rejected gambling proposals. Though some industry officials contend that most Americans like gambling and that more expansion is likely, others say the industry cannot endure more growth.
The amendment rejected today would have allowed one casino in each of three parts of the state: Niagara Falls, Buffalo and either Warren or Saratoga County. It would have allowed an unlimited number in a three-county region of the Catskills. And it would have authorized harness racetracks and the thoroughbred track at Saratoga to have slot machines and video poker.
Despite the lopsided result, today's vote was one of the most suspenseful in recent memory, because nearly a third of the Senate's 61 members had insisted as late as this morning that they were still undecided.
It is highly unusual for a proposal to come to the floor of the Senate if passage is in doubt. But Mr. Bruno had insisted that he wanted the Senate to dispose of the issue early this year, whether he had the votes to pass it or not, so it would not interfere with the many other contentious issues the Legislature faces in the coming months, from rent regulations to the state budget and welfare.
But critics of gambling had charged that Mr. Bruno, who supported passage of the amendment in the Legislature, was trying to rush the vote to outflank the opposition.
Prominent among the naysayers has been Mr. Trump, who paid $855,750 to a team of lobbyists to fight the amendment. Along with his wife, Mr. Trump contributed about $400,000 to the state's two major political parties last year.
Mr. Trump, who owns three casinos in Atlantic City, said in an interview today that gambling proposals "are not being approved because when governments go out and do their analysis, they show that gambling is not a positive thing for many areas." He called today's vote "a great victory for New York."
Other casino officials in Atlantic City said they were not surprised by the vote. Nevertheless, they said that if casinos had moved forward in New York, the impact would have been limited, since the sites were hundreds of miles from the seashore gaming mecca.
"Certainly, it could have had an impact, but nothing devastating," said Ralph Berry, vice president of communications for Harrah's Atlantic City casino. "What they had planned was nothing on the scale of Atlantic City."
But news of the vote seemed to have had more of a reassuring effect on New Jersey state officials, who said that developers would have been more hesitant to invest in Atlantic City if they knew New York was building casinos, too. New Jersey's casinos draw an enormous number of visitors from New York each year, they said, and that could have changed if casinos suddenly sprang up in the Catskills.
Today's vote marked a sharp reversal of fortune for the measure, which just a month ago looked likely to pass in both houses. Angered by the turn of events, supporters bitterly lashed out at the opposition.
"We can thank Marty Connor for killing casino gambling, Yonkers Raceway and the Catskills all in one fell swoop," said Sen. Nicholas A. Spano, a Yonkers Republican who contends that Yonkers Raceway will close unless it can install slot machines. He was referring to the Senate minority leader, Martin Connor, Democrat of Brooklyn.
Lester Shulklapper, a lobbyist for several Catskills resort owners, suggested that Mr. Trump and possibly some Indian tribes that run casinos had used religious groups as fronts to oppose the amendment.
"I think everyone saw through the religious angle," Mr. Shulklapper said. "It was for the preservation of a monopoly."

Dollar Up Again vs. the Yen, But Is Pushed Down in Europe

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against the Japanese yen again yesterday, touching its ninth consecutive four-year high, but it ended lower against some other leading currencies.
Renewed strength in the German mark and the Swiss franc, profit taking from the dollar's recent run-up, and remarks by the head of Germany's central bank suggesting that the mark's decline against the dollar was nearly complete all contributed to the dollar's retreat. 
 Nonetheless, traders said they expected to dollar to rise further, particularly against the yen.
"There's still a good feeling we'll push this thing to 125 yen," said Earl I. Johnson, foreign-exchange economist for the Bank of Montreal in Chicago. "This is an unbelievable run we've had, but nobody's going to pick a top and stand in front of this thing at this point."
The dollar touched an intraday high of 122.78 yen, the strongest since February 1993, before settling in New York late yesterday at 122.08 yen, up from 121.15 on Tuesday.
It fetched 1.6434 marks, down from 1.6485 marks. The British pound rose to $1.6210, from $1.6179.
Traders in Asia began the day bidding the dollar higher on the continued absence of a concrete sign that Japan's central bank would intervene to defend the yen, which has fallen more than 4.5 percent against the dollar in the last four weeks.
"There's not much the Japanese can do," said Bob McEntee, a vice president at the foreign-exchange desk at Corestates Bank in Philadelphia. "They can't raise rates. What we'll see is a lot of talk aimed at pushing the dollar down."
The dollar weakened in European trading when the Bundesbank's president, Hans Tietmeyer, said the mark's "normalization process" against the dollar would soon end. He added that the mark would remain a strong currency.
John Hazelton, chief currency trader at Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company in New York, said, "The momentum for the dollar had been slowing down a bit, and certainly Mr. Tietmeyer's comments didn't help the dollar at all."
Because the dollar has appreciated so sharply in recent weeks, Mr. Hazelton said it would probably be "very susceptible to a lot of these comments."

Hush Money?

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
In his "errors were made" press conference, President Clinton became flustered when asked by The Washington Post's John Harris if he had found anything "unusual or suspicious" in large payments by the Lippo Group to Clinton's friend Webster Hubbell just after he was forced out of the Justice Department and before he went to jail.
"I didn't know about it," he insisted. "And I can't imagine who could have ever arranged to do something improper like that and no one around here know about it. It's just not -- we -- we did not know anything about it." Later in his answer he added "before it happened," because his blanket denial was untrue. His closest confidential aide, Bruce Lindsey, had already told the Senate he was aware of the payments to the disgraced Hubbell by Clinton's Asian friends. But the President now claims that the "improper" arrangement was kept secret from him "till I read about it in the press." 
 Consider: The financially desperate Hubbell, who could have sunk the Clintons if he turned against them, received a bundle from the same Asian crew bankrolling Clinton campaigns; he then loyally zipped his lip and spurned leniency from the Independent Counsel. And even though Lindsey -- who sees Clinton every day -- admits knowing at that time about Lippo's pre-jail payments, it was supposedly news to Bill Clinton "till I read about it in the press."
Because logic led me to consider that sequence suspicious, the question of hush money was first raised in this space. Clinton now condemns Hubbell's arrangement with Lippo as "improper," an ethical conclusion I did not have the evidence to reach.
But after charging his felonious friend with impropriety, Clinton whirled around to say that "when somebody makes a charge like that there ought to be some burden on them to come forward with some evidence. . . ."
No. Gathering evidence for presentation in court is neither my burden nor his. Journalists recount sequences that reek with fishiness, cite relevant laws and embarrass officials into producing evidence.
Try another: The question was raised here of a potential breach of security in the top-secret clearance of Lippo's John Huang. He was placed by the Riady family in a sensitive Commerce Department trade-policy job for a year, then assigned to a top fund-raising post at the D.N.C. -- at Clinton's personal direction -- in the infamous Clinton-Riady-Giroir-Huang-Lindsey meeting in the Oval Office on Sept. 13, 1995.
A few days ago, chairman Gerald Solomon of the House Rules Committee asked the F.B.I. to investigate possible economic espionage by China. He noted that (1) Huang was given top-secret clearance five months before becoming the Riadys' man at Commerce; (2) Huang wrote "not applicable" to "relatives or friends in China, if any" on his clearance form; (3) Huang at Commerce, with unprecedented access to the White House and in frequent telephone contact with Lippo operatives, wrote his comments on 15 classified field reports and attended up to 37 C.I.A.-documented intelligence briefings.
Now this: After Clinton sent Huang to the D.N.C. to cash in on favors done at Commerce, Huang kept top-secret clearance for a year even though he was no longer working for the U.S. Why does a Democratic Party fund-raiser need top-secret clearance? Who did Huang talk to in 1996 from his D.N.C. phone, from the booth in the lobby and from his home? What was Huang's connection with the Arkansas-Beijing traveler Charlie Trie and with Wang Jun, the notorious Chinese arms dealer who got an easy visa and made direct contact with Bill Clinton? What has China been learning about our secret trade positions, and how has its Government influenced the Clinton Administration?
F.B.I. Director Louis Freeh informs Representative Solomon that 25 agents were assigned to this last month. They are presumably working with Laura Ingersoll, a Criminal Division line attorney. Maybe they'll turn up evidence about espionage or policy penetration. That's their job. This is mine.
Maryland's Governor was misdescribed here on Monday as a "gutsy Republican"; Parris N. Glendening is a rock-ribbed Democrat.

HEADLINE: Balance the Budget, Once and for All

BYLINE: By Paul Simon; Paul Simon, an Illinois Democrat who retired from the Senate this month, directs the Public Policy Institute at Southern Illinois University.

DATELINE: CARBONDALE, Ill.

 BODY:
This week's announcement by the Congressional Budget Office that Federal deficits will begin rising again starting this year shows the urgency of passing a balanced budget amendment. Yet this suggestion for changing the Constitution -- first proposed by Thomas Jefferson -- continues to receive rough treatment, almost all of it misguided.
Criticisms of the current proposal, which is scheduled for its first committee vote today, fall into three main categories. Some say the plan wouldn't do any good because Congress would regularly take advantage of its biggest loophole: Lawmakers could override the amendment and create deficits if they mustered a 60 percent majority in both houses. On the contrary, others say, the three-fifths majority requirement would paralyze Congress and make it unable to authorize deficit spending during recessions. Other skeptics say that an amendment isn't needed at all because both parties have agreed to balance the budget by the year 2002 and the deficit is now lower than it was four years ago. 
 None of these criticisms are accurate. Yes, there are three-fifths majorities in Congress, but they are rare on matters of great controversy. The public overwhelmingly favors balancing the budget, so getting 60 percent of lawmakers to vote to add to the deficit without a strong reason would be highly unlikely.
Also, Congress can respond to recessions when it has to, as it has demonstrated by extending unemployment compensation in downturns, including those of 1975, 1980, 1982 and 1991 (usually by a three-fifths majority).
But most economists believe that by the time Congress gets around to taking action, the economy is usually rectifying itself. C. Fred Bergsten, an Assistant Treasury Secretary under Jimmy Carter, has suggested a more efficient plan: Congress could pass a separate mandate that each year's Federal budget include a 2 percent or 3 percent surplus that would automatically be used to soften the impact of a recession.
The clincher argument against an amendment -- that both parties have already agreed to balance the budget by 2002 -- has one huge flaw. Under the present plan, the strong medicine is put off until 2000 and 2001. Congress won't take responsibility any more than it did after adopting the Gramm-Rudman balanced budget proposal in 1985. Elected officials like to do popular things, and there is no popular way to balance the Federal budget.
The reality is that we are going to have to face two difficult decisions: to make some modifications of Social Security and to adopt modest tax increases. Politicians will duck both issues unless they have the constraint and cover of a constitutional amendment.
How important is balancing the budget? In the 1996 fiscal year, we spent more than $344 billion in interest to pay off the debt, more than 11 times the Federal education budget and twice our antipoverty spending. The General Accounting Office projected that if we could balance the budget, within 20 years the average per capita income would rise by 26 percent. Every economic forecast suggests that a balanced budget would lift the economy by causing interest rates to drop and trade deficits to narrow.
Unless we act now, however, we are in danger of heading toward what economists call "monetizing" the debt -- continually increasing the money supply -- which seems to solve the problem but in the end creates hyperinflation. This is what Adam Smith described in "Wealth of Nations" when he said that countries pile up debts and then find it politically attractive to debase the currency.
Unless we change course, we will devastate the Social Security trust fund and wipe out Americans' individual savings. This would also precipitate a global economic crisis. By then, it would be too late for politicians' quick fixes. The only reasonable course is a balanced budget amendment now.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Those inflation-indexed bonds are like L'il Abner's schmoos.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
WHILE the inflation-indexed bonds issued yesterday by the Treasury are seen by Wall Street as just another opportunity to make a buck, economists' pulses are racing over other potential uses of the new financial instruments. For like the mythical schmoo in Al Capp's Li'l Abner comics (which tasted like chicken when fried and sirloin when grilled), indexed bonds may work a variety of wonders -- everything from helping the Federal Reserve to detect inflation on the horizon to providing a lower-risk way for states and cities to finance new infrastructure.
Indeed, the newfangled bonds represent something of a triumph for academic economists, who have spent decades promoting indexing. "Milton Friedman and James Tobin don't agree about much, but they both agree about indexed bonds," reminds Lawrence H. Summers, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury and a big fan of indexing. 
 The yield on an ordinary Treasury bond can be broken down into two key components -- the reward for lending money, plus compensation for the expected loss of purchasing power when the bond matures and the principal is returned to the lender. Indexing eliminates the second by linking the Government's liability to inflation: If, for example, the price level has tripled between the issue and redemption dates, investors get back $3,000 for every $1,000 originally lent to Uncle Sam. So the yield, determined by competitive bidding in the market, represents the "real" return to capital.
It doesn't take a Ph.D. in finance to see the significance of the information provided by the bonds. If the yield on ordinary Treasuries is, say, 7 percent, and the yield on indexed bonds of the same maturity is 3 percent, the market must expect that inflation will average 4 percent over the period.
Well, not quite: other factors, notably the relative liquidity of the market for the two types of bonds, not to mention the "risk premium" above and beyond the expected inflation rate needed to induce investors to hold ordinary bonds, should also influence the differential. But Bruce Steinberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch, notes that changes in the difference in yields between the two kinds of securities could prove a useful indicator of inflation expectations. A sudden widening of the gap, for example, would be a more direct -- and probably more accurate -- indicator of expectations than, say, the price of gold or other commodities that are used to predict inflation.
This point has not been lost on the Bank of England, where the market yields on some $57 billion of outstanding indexed Government bonds are used in forecasting. Nor is it likely to be lost on the Fed, which has championed the new securities. "Alan Greenspan has talked about how this will give us a handle on real interest rates," Mr. Steinberg noted.
Indexing may also prove a good way for the Treasury to reduce borrowing costs: Investors, it is assumed, will accept a lower yield in return for what amounts to insurance against unexpectedly high inflation. In a new research paper (to be found on the Internet at www.econ.yale.edu/ shiller) the economists John Y. Campbell of Harvard and Robert Shiller of Yale estimate the potential saving around half a percentage point, which is hardly small change if, say, $200 billion in indexed debt were substituted for ordinary bonds. And while indexing does not eliminate risk -- it merely transfers it from investors to taxpayers, who would have to come up with extra cash if inflation exceeded expected rates -- indexing does allow markets to apportion risk to those most willing to bear it.
In the end, the most important gains from indexed Treasuries may be indirect. For one thing, indexed bonds could be used by "defined benefit" pension plans to hedge against inflation, thereby permitting them to offer indexed benefits -- no small advantage in a world where pensions must routinely support retirees into their 80's. And once the market for indexed Treasuries was well established, it would open the door to other issuers. Indexed municipal bonds backed by revenues from, say, toll bridges or airport landing fees would match inflation risk on the asset and liability sides of the financing equation. By the same token, indexed home mortgages would effectively link financing costs to housing prices, because both would tend to rise and fall with inflation.
The big puzzle is why it took so long for Washington to try indexing. Critics have always been able to summon plausible objections, such as the risk that the indexing of interest will lead to the indexing of wages, which will undermine the public's resistance to inflationary policies. But the real reason, one suspects, is bureaucratic inertia. Government agencies, especially ones like the Treasury that do a pretty good job already, lack the will to innovate because there are no prizes for the innovators and no penalties for being left behind. No one, they used to say, ever gets fired for buying I.B.M.

HEADLINE: Orders Down For Durables In December

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 29

 BODY:
Factory orders for big-ticket goods fell unexpectedly during December, indicating that economic growth could be more restrained than many analysts believe.
The Commerce Department said today that orders for durable goods -- expensive items that are expected to last more than three years -- declined 1.7 percent last month. Analysts had expected an increase of about 1.1 percent. December was the second consecutive month in which orders decreased; November's decline was revised to 1.7 percent from 1.6 percent.
Economists caution against reading too much into the monthly durable-goods data because of the erratic pattern of orders for commercial jetliners and military weaponry. Still, when transportation equipment was excluded, December's orders were down 2.2 percent. Excluding military hardware, orders fell 1.5 percent.
"A funny thing happened on the way to the 'boom' -- the manufacturing sector can't get on a roll," said Robert Dederick, an economic consultant at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago.
Weaker demand for electronics gear, electrical equipment, military aircraft, motor vehicles and auto parts accounted for December's decrease, the Commerce Department said. Orders increased for industrial machinery, primary metals, railroad gear and maritime equipment.
In all of 1996, durables orders rose 5.5 percent, slower than 1995's gain of 7.2 percent and the weakest annual showing since a 5.4 percent increase in 1993.
Anthony Chan, chief economist at the Banc One Investment Advisors Corporation in Columbus, Ohio, said, "Economic momentum going into the current quarter is certainly not on par with what we experienced during the final quarter of 1996." Economists estimate that the economy expanded close to 4 percent in the fourth quarter; the Government will announce its initial growth calculation for the quarter on Friday.
Today's report showed that unfilled orders, a gauge of pent-up demand, showed no change in December from November. Shipments of goods, a gauge of current demand, fell eight-tenths of 1 percent.
Despite the decline in December's orders, the outlook for manufacturing remains positive, with exports running at record levels and the domestic economy continuing to expand.

HEADLINE: Louis E. Martin, 84, Aide To 3 Democratic Presidents

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS 

 BODY:
Louis E. MartinLouis E. Martin, whose work behind the scenes as an adviser to three Democratic Presidents and whose efforts to bring more blacks into government earned him the sobriquet, "the godfather of black politics," died on Monday at a hospital in Orange, Calif. He was 84.
Mr. Martin served as the deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee during the Administrations of President John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, and was widely viewed by both Presidents as a valued counselor and liaison to the black political community. President Jimmy Carter appointed him as a special Presidential assistant. 
 In 1967, as an adviser to Johnson, Mr. Martin was influential in pressing him to name Thurgood Marshall as the first black Justice on the Supreme Court.
In the 1960 Presidential campaign, Mr. Martin helped persuade Kennedy to place a telephone call to Coretta Scott King to express dismay over the jailing of her husband, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The phone call was widely credited with helping Kennedy win a major portion of the black vote in the general election that year.
Mr. Martin was able to wield considerable influence inconspicuously, his friends said.
Eddie Williams, the president of the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a research organization in Washington, said it was surprising that Mr. Martin was largely unknown to the public at large, given his wide-ranging influence in the White House and his role in the development of black political power in the Democratic Party.
"One reason for this is that in Washington, he was the consummate political insider," Mr. Williams said. "He traversed the corridors of power for many years without calling attention to himself and his achievements."
Mr. Williams said that Mr. Martin was first called the "godfather of black politics" by The Washington Post, and that the nickname stuck.
Mr. Martin was born in Shelbyville, Tenn., the son of an American woman and a Cuban-born doctor, but grew up in Savannah, Ga., where he met his wife of 60 years, Gertrude Scott. He attended Fisk University and graduated from the University of Michigan.
He began his professional career as a journalist with The Chicago Defender, a black newspaper, and within a year moved to Detroit to become the editor of another black newspaper, The Michigan Chronicle.
In an interview, his wife recalled that during his time at The Chronicle he became an active Democrat.
Local preachers were Republicans because they had connections with the Ford Motor Company's management "that would allow them to recommend workers to the plant," Mrs. Martin said, noting that the arrangement enhanced their own prestige.
But she said that her husband decided that the Democratic Party was a more appropriate vehicle for advancing the cause of organized labor, and he made it his mission to express that view in his newspaper.
Mr. Martin helped found the National Newspaper Publishers Association, a group of black publishers.
In 1970, he was a founder of the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies to provide technical assistance and support for black officeholders and scholars across the country, and served as its first chairman for eight years.
Mr. Martin first came to Washington after he was recruited by a Kennedy brother-in-law, R. Sargent Shriver, to work in the Kennedy Presidential campaign. After Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963, Mr. Martin made a remarkably easy transition as a Johnson adviser, a transition few other Kennedy aides would make.
Clifford L. Alexander Jr., a White House counsel under Johnson, described Mr. Martin as his mentor and recalled that he and the President enjoyed an easy relationship. "They talked to each other in the shorthand of experienced political pros," Mr. Alexander said.
Recounting an incident that took place shortly after Johnson's landslide victory over Barry Goldwater in 1964, Mr. Alexander said the President summoned him and Mr. Martin to the Oval Office to ask what percentage of the black vote he had won. "Ninety-six percent Mr. President," Mr. Martin replied. Johnson then asked balefully, "What about the other 4 percent?" Mr. Martin knew the President well enough, Mr. Alexander said, and simply laughed.
Among the leading black public figures whom Mr. Martin helped raise to prominence was Vernon E. Jordan, now a close adviser to President Clinton. Mr. Martin helped recruit Mr. Jordan to head the National Urban League.
Besides his wife, Mr. Martin is survived by five daughters, Trudy Hatter of Diamond Bar, Calif., Anita Martin of Rockville, Md., Dr. Toni Martin of Berkeley, Calif., Linda Purkiss of Oakland, Calif., and Lisa Grant of San Francisco. He is also survived by 11 grandchildren and 2 great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: The Berlin Wall and China

 BODY:
Bill Clinton offered a revealing glimpse into his thinking about China when he predicted this week that liberty would eventually triumph there, much as freedom brought down the Berlin wall. The demise of Communism may come someday in China, but it would be a mistake to adopt a passive American policy based on that optimistic prospect, as Mr. Clinton seems to be doing. There is already abundant evidence suggesting that Communism in China is not dying but is instead mutating into a new form that tolerates economic liberties while still suffocating political freedom.
Mr. Clinton's press conference remarks, read closely, were an argument against pushing China hard on human rights and internal political reform. The problem with this analysis is that it indulges Chinese repression and may be taken by Beijing as a sign of American weakness. Likening China to Europe, when it comes to the course of Communism, is a risky approach. 
 America does not face a new cold war with China, and does not need a containment policy to deal with Beijing. But Washington does need to be more assertive about its interests, more demanding in seeking an end to China's human rights abuses and less willing to sacrifice American principles for American commerce in China.
There is a good chance that Mr. Clinton's stewardship of American foreign policy will be judged in substantial measure by his handling of China as it takes its place among the great powers. So too will the leadership of Vice President Al Gore, who plans to play a larger role on China in the months ahead, and that of Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, whose commitment to human rights and democracy faces its severest test in China.
Mr. Clinton's faith in the power of trade and information to liberate China is stirring but unrealistic and his analogy to the Berlin wall oversimplified. The increasing flow of information and the allure of free markets helped undermine authoritarian governments in Eastern Europe, but these regimes did not voluntarily surrender power. Communism in Eastern European states collapsed abruptly because the Soviet Union declined to sustain it any longer with force and economic aid, and most of East Europe's corrupt regimes lacked the means and killer instinct to terrorize their citizens. In the case of the Soviet Union itself, economic stagnation, an explosion of nationalism and political reforms initiated by Mikhail Gorbachev played a decisive role in the demise of Communism.
Chinese conditions are quite different. The country, unlike those behind the Berlin wall, is gaining economic strength, not losing it. Communism is not maintained by an outside power but by the Chinese Government itself, with the assistance of the military. Suppressed ethnic nationalism is not an explosive force. With China's leaders maneuvering for power in anticipation of the death of Deng Xiaoping, there is little likelihood of political liberalization anytime soon.
The economic reforms initiated by Mr. Deng in 1979 have indisputably introduced free markets in China, and prosperity has spread to its major cities, producing the beginnings of a middle class. But even China's economic experimentation has been controlled by a Government determined to maintain its political authority.
There is little sign that China's booming economy has produced concrete political change, or even the intangible spirit of liberty that Mr. Clinton considers inevitable. China has done its best to restrict the flow of information to citizens, even limiting access to financial data and the Internet.
In recent months the Government has rounded up political dissidents and consigned them to long prison terms after carefully managed trials. The State Department reports that by the end of last year, all active dissidents in China had been jailed or exiled, a disheartening record that even the Soviet Union could not match once Stalin was gone.
On the clearest current question of Chinese intentions, the return of Hong Kong to China this summer, Beijing has left little doubt it will strip Hong Kong of its liberties, even if that diminishes the economic benefits of the transfer to China.
It is welcome to hear Mr. Clinton acknowledge that "constructive engagement" with China has yielded disappointing progress on human rights issues. Unhappily, he seems to be under the illusion that future results will be different.

HEADLINE: Tax Credits for Welfare Hires

 BODY:
President Clinton's proposal to give tax credits to companies that hire long-term welfare recipients can modestly boost employment and income of this hard-to-hire group. The positive impact is unlikely to be large, but tax credits are probably the most that Congress is willing to do to protect those who are in harm's way of the new welfare law, which imposes time limits on Federal cash assistance.
Tax credits for employers to hire disadvantaged workers have been used on and off since the 1960's without much success. Indeed, in some cases such programs have hurt the intended beneficiaries -- by stigmatizing the subsidized applicant as a problem hire that employers would be better off avoiding. The Administration is well aware of the mixed record of tax credits and has designed its proposal to avoid the major pitfalls. 
 The plan would give employers a tax cut of 50 percent of the first $10,000 in wages paid to welfare recipients who have been on the rolls for at least 18 months. The credit is larger than that provided by previous programs, giving Mr. Clinton's plan a better chance of enticing employers to participate. He would avoid stigmatizing most former welfare recipients in the marketplace because his plan subsidizes only long-term recipients of welfare. At worst the Clinton proposal will fail to create many new hires, in which case it will not cost Washington much money.
There is, however, a chance the plan will do some good. Prof. Lawrence Katz of Harvard has shown that some tax-subsidy programs during the 1970's and 80's boosted employment of disadvantaged young adults by several percentage points, and raised earnings of adult women by 15 percent and of adult men by 10 percent. Tax subsidies worked better when combined with direct spending on job creation in areas of high unemployment. Mr. Clinton takes heed of this cautiously optimistic reading of the past by proposing to turn over about $3 billion to localities where there is high unemployment and welfare dependency to create private and public work slots. The President is also lobbying churches and nonprofit organizations to create jobs for welfare recipients.
But the plan will be hard pressed to register even the modest gains of the best-run programs from the past. Focusing on job applicants with the poorest skills and employment records will make it hard to score many victories.
The truth is that Mr. Clinton, who signed the bill that will deny cash assistance to long-term welfare recipients, has few other options to soften the blow. A Republican-led Congress is not about to spend enough money on public-sector jobs or any other direct relief to accommodate the number of people who will exhaust cash assistance before they find private-sector work. Mr. Clinton hopes to sell the G.O.P. on a tax cut for employers. For now, that is about all he can do.

New Inflation-Indexed Note Receives a Strong Response

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The Treasury's first auction of inflation-indexed securities went better than expected yesterday, with strong interest from large institutional investors.
The auction took place on a day when Treasury prices rose on unexpected weakness in a durable goods report, and then steadied as the Treasury released the results. 
The price of the 30-year bond rose 8/32, to 94 30/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.90 percent, from 6.92 percent on Tuesday.
Initially it was the uncertainty over investor interest in the new 10-year inflation-indexed note that kept a cap on Treasury prices over all.
The inflation-adjusted yield was expected to start at about 3.50 percent to 3.75 percent, with pension funds, insurance companies, and some mutual funds among those seen bidding at yesterday's sale.
Sold in increments of $1,000, the 10-year notes will pay more principal at maturity if inflation accelerates, and thus protect the value of the investment. At the auction, the notes were sold at a high yield of 3.449 percent, with the median yield at 3.40 percent. By the close of trading the yield was down to 3.39 percent.
Lawrence H. Summers, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, said he was pleased with the market reception, with a lot probably coming from large institutions. "It was a good start to what will be a long process of diverse inflation protection."
Patrick R. Dimick, a Treasury market analyst and a trader at UBS Securities, said there was a lot of confusion in the market about how to handle the indexed-linked bonds."Market participants are very uncomfortable about how to trade and especially hedge these indexed-linked securities," he said, "and that made for volatile trade in the market after the auction results were released. And they really still don't know."
Theodore Ake, government trading manager at Everen Securities Inc., in Chicago, said, "It will take a few months of trading before everyone gets a real handle on these securities,"
Treasury prices received a liftearlier after the Commerce Department reported that durable goods -- expensive items that are expected to last more than three years -- fell 1.7 percent in December.
Maury N. Harris, chief economist at Paine Webber, noted that it was the second consecutive month that durable goods orders fell 1.7 percent and that the latest decline in December was much weaker than the consensus estimate for an increase of 1.1 percent.
The report helped ease concerns that the economy was growing at a fast enough pace that would prompt the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates to head off inflation.
On Tuesday, a report on wage increases in the fourth quarter came in within expectations, helping to ease investors' anxieties on rates.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of new 10-year inflation- indexed notes:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)
 
High Price . . . 99.482
High Yield . . . 3.449%

HEADLINE: U.S. Report on Human Rights Faults China, Nigeria and Cuba

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 29

 BODY:
Despite American efforts, from jawboning to sanctions, human rights performance worsened last year in China, Nigeria, Cuba and Myanmar, according to the Administration's annual report on human rights in 193 countries, which is to be released on Thursday.
According to the document's "overview" and some of the reports, Russia's record is "mixed." Relatively free presidential elections and the withdrawal of Russian troops from Chechnya were offset by discrimination against minorities, hazing of military recruits, uneven legal reforms, little investigation of pressure on journalists and a worsening of already harsh prison conditions. 
 In some other former Soviet states where Washington has pushed democratization, progress has been uneven. In Belarus, the report says, there was "serious backsliding" toward dictatorship, while in Armenia, "progress toward democracy was set back" by "flawed elections."
In Kazakstan and Kyrgyzstan, the report notes a sharp increase of presidential power to the detriment of other branches of government, while Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Tajikistan "lag even further behind in the development of democracy and respect for human rights."
These reports, noted for their objectivity even by critics of Mr. Clinton's human rights policies, take aim at both friends and foes -- criticizing Germany, for instance, for increased discrimination against the Church of Scientology.
In Nigeria, the human rights performance of the military council headed by Gen. Sani Abacha "remains dismal," the report says. The regime nullified March elections and security forces arrested or killed opponents, including legislators, and tortured suspects.
Cuba, a regular target, is called "a totalitarian anachronism, where human rights deteriorated in 1996."
Officials argue that the annual reports are gaining importance in American policy decisions and that human rights is a formal criterion for imposing trade sanctions, providing aid and selling arms.
For example, Washington bans the sale of arms that can be used for crowd-control to Indonesia, which the report calls "strongly authoritarian," for its restrictions on opposition and its stifling of dissent. Congressional critics of Indonesia's record are blocking Mr. Clinton's wish to sell F-16 fighters to that country.
But officials admit that with complex, powerful or resource-rich countries like China, Russia or Saudi Arabia, American interests require that human-rights concerns do not "dominate or distort" a "multi-faceted relationship."
For China, the report measures the failure of Mr. Clinton's policy of "constructive engagement" to improve human rights, as Mr. Clinton admitted at a news conference Tuesday.
China's "economic pragmatism and increasingly robust ties of trade and commerce with the United States and many other countries" have not prevented or ameliorated "widespread and well-documented human rights abuses," the report states.
No dissidents were active at year's end, the report says. "All public dissent against party and Government was effectively silenced by intimidation, exile or the imposition of prison terms, administrative detention or house arrest."
During 1996, the report says, "Hong Kong's civil liberties and political institutions were threatened by restrictive measures taken by the Chinese Government in anticipation of Hong Kong's reversion to Chinese sovereignty" in July.
Charlene Barshefsky, the Administration's top trade official, said today that the United States would block China from entering the World Trade Organization, a key goal for the Chinese leadership this year, if Beijing continues to block the import of American agricultural goods.
Ms. Barshefsky, the country's acting trade representative since last May, made the remark during a Senate confirmation hearing on her nomination to the position.
Although Myanmar formally ended the house arrest of the pro-democracy leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the military regime "stepped up its 'rolling repression' and systematic violation of human rights," the report says.
A law signed by Mr. Clinton mandates a ban on American investment in Myanmar, formerly Burma, if Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi is harmed, significantly harassed or re-arrested. Officials say the White House is close to activating that law, which is sharply opposed by United States companies with interests in Myanmar, like the oil company Unocal.
Washington has already imposed a ban on visas for Burmese leaders, suspended economic aid, blocked arms sales and held up loans to Myanmar from international institutions.

HEADLINE: Mr. Kravis's New Neighborhood;
Financier Leverages Influence for Poor Urban Areas

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
James E. Quinn routinely travels to some of the most rarefied shopping districts in the world for his job as an executive vice president at Tiffany & Company. Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, for example, is typical Tiffany turf. But until this month, Mr. Quinn -- though born and raised in New York -- had never once been to the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, where shopping opportunities for even basic needs are scant if not entirely absent.
Mr. Quinn went there to scout potential retailing sites and examine vacant lots and traffic flow patterns -- not for Tiffany, which has no plans to open soon in Bed-Stuy, but for the financier Henry R. Kravis, who does. 
 Mr. Kravis, best known for multibillion-dollar takeovers and leveraged buyouts as a founding partner in the firm of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, is chairman of a new and still evolving entity, the New York City Investment Fund, which incorporated last fall with the intent of creating jobs in New York, especially in poor and minority neighborhoods.
The fund, with $57 million in assets, is minuscule by KKR standards; Mr. Kravis also has on his desk a new $5.8 billion corporate buyout pool, for instance. The New York fund has yet to invest a dollar and its board of directors will not even have its first meeting until next week.
But business leaders say that as a new entrant on the New York political and economic stage, the Kravis fund will be one to watch -- no quiet issuer of charity checks, but a powerful, if diffuse, organization in its own right, and a new vehicle of influence for Mr. Kravis.
"If you said, 'Who is going to be the Rockefeller of the next 30 to 40 years?' Henry is one of the people you would think of," said Russell L. Carson, a general partner of Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe, a private investment firm that is one of the fund's investors.
The New York fund also seems likely to emerge as a barometer of economic power relationships in New York. The fund's investors include most of the big Wall Street securities firms, which have been intimately tied to KKR and Mr. Kravis through years of hugely profitable deals. As Wall Street has boomed and other old-line New York industries like manufacturing have withered, the securities industry has also played a larger role in the regional economy, and some investors say that a flexing of new muscle helps explain the fund's emergence now.
But the latticework of board members -- from top executives like David H. Komansky of Merrill Lynch to Walter V. Shipley of Chase Manhattan, to lower-level volunteers like Mr. Quinn -- are what makes the fund distinctive. The primary notion, Mr. Kravis said, was to take business executives who mostly focus on the world and turn their focus back to New York.
"We said, 'Don't just give us the money,' " Mr. Kravis said in describing the formation of the fund, which started last fall with $50 million in assets -- $1 million each from 50 investors and institutions, including Tiffany -- and has grown by seven investors and $7 million. "We want the money, but we also want your time, and we want your effort, and we want the effort of your people."
Mr. Carson said he thought the power of the fund would be the cadres of corporate experts who can negotiate deals, pick sites and call on contacts nationwide. "The level of brainpower is all out of proportion to the level of funds," he said.
Goldman, Sachs, for example, in addition to its $1 million investment, has provided access to its investment analysis department. Merrill Lynch offered its experts in retailing. E. M. Warburg, Pincus & Company enlisted executives to search the information technology sector for leads. Tiffany provided Mr. Quinn, among others.
But there is also an inevitable tension in the mixture of capitalism and philanthropy.
The fund intends to invest with the goal of getting its money back and maybe even making a profit. But if an investment makes money without creating jobs, it fails an important test.
The fund, which operates under the New York City Partnership and the Chamber of Commerce, also wants to avoid buying into a company that could go to an ordinary venture capitalist or bank. Charity cases will be avoided because they generally do not grow into giant employers or provide returns that can be reinvested.
The kind of jobs a company would create is also important. Many of the most promising sectors of the New York economy, Mr. Kravis said, involve high technology. But high tech jobs are often high skill jobs that often do not benefit the neighborhoods the fund wants to help.
"Are we doing social good for a community?" Mr. Kravis said. "Are we we taking into consideration issues for the stakeholders other than just making a profit? It has to be both."
Mr. Quinn's trip to Brooklyn with the fund's retailing committee showed some of the strains of Mr. Kravis's new chemistry. The participants, from Merrill Lynch and Citibank and other institutions, were all experts from a world of national brands and chains that has barely touched this part of New York, where commerce remains small scale and intensely local, and when they climbed out of the van with their cellular phones and their gray broadcloth coats, some looked lost.
Some of the tour members were familiar with the mechanisms of economic development, empowerment zones and tax abatements, while others were taking their first steps to learn. Perhaps the only thing they all had in common was Mr. Kravis, and even then the link was tenuous. Mr. Quinn, for example, has yet to be introduced to the fund's chairman.
Certainly, there have been periods in New York when one person did seem able to harness the city's business energy for coherent purpose -- notably the 1960's and 1970's under David Rockefeller.
And Mr. Rockefeller was in fact Mr. Kravis's first $1 million investor. He said in an interview that Mr. Kravis came to see him about 10 years ago to ask for advice about how to contribute something to society.
"When he started making huge sums of money, he had absolutely no background in giving," Mr. Rockefeller said. "He went around and said, 'I haven't any experience in this -- how do you go about it?' "
Mr. Rockefeller said he told Mr. Kravis to get involved personally: don't just be a money man; get out and lead. "I don't think it's necessarily because of my advice, but he has done that," he said.
Economists and investors also say that the fund has benefited from a restructuring of the city's economy in the 1990's. The upheaval in banking, for instance, especially the push into new financial services, has changed perspectives at old-line institutions like the Dime Bancorp, which has diversified from its traditional home mortgage lending business into new areas like brokerage services and business loans.
The new business focus meant that Mr. Kravis's pitch -- to invest in the creation of jobs rather than in more traditional nonprofit work like affordable housing -- found a more receptive audience, said the bank's chairman, James M. Large Jr.
The securities firms in New York have also moved more and more in recent years toward becoming investors themselves. Many became creditors as bank lending dried up in the recession of the early 1990's, and then moved into real estate as prices bottomed out. That makes them think more like entrepreneurs. And with Mr. Kravis's proven record, fund investors say, money follows money.
"You always take Henry's phone call," said Deryck C. Maughan, the chairman and chief executive officer of Salomon Brothers. "But it's being part of New York that makes us commit our time and capital."
A crucial factor of Mr. Kravis's leadership, Mr. Maughan said, is that it is not allied with a particular securities firm or bank. The fees and commissions that spill over from KKR's deals are widely shared.
"Henry's leadership is important, not so much because of the fees, but because he is an independent, he can rally the the banks and the corporations on an equal basis," Mr. Maughan said.
Mr. Kravis said that the power of his firm and his name is perhaps part of what has helped attract investors and raise their expectations. But the larger motivation, he said, is the sense of possibility that he and the other investors feel about New York's future.
The decrease in crime has helped, he said. Just as important is a shift toward the private sector in getting things done -- demonstrated in everything from the business-improvement districts that help clean New York's streets to the declaration by President Clinton that the era of big government is over. Several members of the fund said that Mr. Kravis represented that new sense of assertion.
"We didn't want to be involved in one these massive civic ventures that just spins its wheels and never gets near the goal line," said Mr. Komansky at Merrill Lynch. "Part of the faith in Henry is not only that the goals are verbalized, but that he'll be able to see them through to completion."

HEADLINE: With Defeat of Gambling Initiative, Catskill Winter Turns Gloomier

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

DATELINE: MONTICELLO, N.Y., Jan. 29

 BODY:
Mark Kutsher was going through the motions of running his family's 420-room Catskills resort, inspecting the ski lift, the steamy indoor swimming pool and the darkened Stardust auditorium. But his mind was still focused on the day before, when he sat in the gallery of the State Senate chambers in Albany, watching a dream evaporate.
Kutsher's Country Club and other resorts, businesses and government offices in the sleepy snow-covered hills here were fixated on the prospect that a long decline in tourism might be reversed if the Legislature finally put before New York voters a referendum to legalize gambling. 
 Local officials and business owners, he said, had pushed off and on for 30 years for legalized gambling to compete with Atlantic City and offer tourists a new reason to come to the Catskills instead of flying to Cancun.
Until Tuesday morning, they felt they had the votes. But as Mr. Kutsher and a small Catskills contingent watched the political tussle below, their hopes were buried under a landslide defeat.
Today, all around the Catskills, politicians and citizens were shaking off the shock and scurrying to find a new path to economic renewal. Many people are focusing on the possibility that Monticello Raceway could be transformed into an Indian-run casino. Aides to Gov. George E. Pataki said today that he was willing to allow such a plan, and that officials had been talking with the Oneida Indians about it. And the St. Regis Mohawks, who have also discussed a Monticello casino with the Governor's office, said they planned to renew their effort.
On Mr. Kutsher's desk, the desk of Monticello's Mayor and the desk of the president of the Monticello track here, copies of the local paper, The Times Herald-Record, summarized the news in a two-word headline: "No Dice."
Monticello's Mayor, James F. Kenny, said this village of 6,200 was desperate for the opportunity offered by gambling. He pointed up Broadway, where the sidewalks were once thick with visitors until midnight, but where movie theaters are now vacant, with the words "For Rent" replacing film titles on the marquees.
"In the 1990 Census, Monticello was 63 percent low-income or below," he said. "And it hasn't gotten better. We're going to be another Appalachia up here if nothing changes." With New York State now bordered by casinos in Connecticut, Ontario and New Jersey, people who might otherwise come to the Catskills for recreation and a little luck are now headed elsewhere.
Mr. Kutsher, 49, said the defeat was particularly frustrating because it appeared to have resulted not so much from a consensus about the merits of gambling, but instead from regional battles. Lawmakers from New York City and Long Island had formed a bipartisan bloc against the bill, which would have limited gambling to the Catskills and four other resort areas to the north.
"When your livelihood depends on it and you're sitting there watching, it makes you sick," Mr. Kutsher said. "This is an issue that truly should have gone to the people. You get enough people together and they display an innate intelligence that the Senate doesn't seem to have."
There was at least one place in Monticello where hopes were not dashed -- Monticello Raceway, an ailing 39-year-old harness racing track that has been seeking a casino deal with the St. Regis Mohawks.
With no chance of a referendum on gambling before 1999, the raceway casino project has become the only game in town. Cliff Ehrlich, president of the raceway, answered a stream of phone calls this afternoon as the county's eyes turned toward the track as its last best chance.
The track had once drawn summertime crowds of 40,000 people, but now attracts 500 people on a good day, Mr. Ehrlich said. The defeated bill would have legalized slot machines there and at similar tracks like Yonkers Raceway, but an Indian casino could compete directly with the big casinos in Atlantic City, Connecticut and Ontario, he said.
Edward Smoke, the chief executive of the St. Regis Mohawks, said the tribe planned to renew talks about the raceway casino with Governor Pataki's office now that the Legislature had acted.
Mr. Ehrlich said that if the Federal Bureau of Indian Affairs accepted the casino plan -- the review is under way in Washington -- all that would be needed would be the approval of Governor Pataki.
At Kutsher's, as the staff prepared for an influx of 700 guests on Thursday, Mr. Kutsher said that if casino gambling were not approved, the region would need some state help.
"There are so many assets and such beauty up here, and so many jobs at stake -- 400 jobs at Kutsher's alone," Mr. Kutsher said.
He said there would continue to be a slow decline, although Kutsher's, at least, would find a way to get by. They were always trying something new -- whether mountain bike trails or a summer sports camp for children -- Mr. Kutsher said.
"We're celebrating our 90th anniversary this year," he said. "This resort has survived world wars and depressions. We'll get through this, too."

HEADLINE: Gambling Vote Imperils Yonkers Raceway

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

 BODY:
Yonkers Raceway, the 99-year-old fixture of the harness racing world, may be sold because of the New York State Senate's rejection of a constitutional amendment to legalize casino gambling, which would have let the track put 5,000 slot machines into a renovated grandstand, raceway officials said yesterday.
"This is a tremendous blow to Yonkers," Frank Drucker, the raceway's director of public relations, said of the State Senate's defeat on Tuesday of the proposed amendment. "And it cripples the state's harness industry." 
 Although all-year racing at the track will continue for the time being, the sport's long-term prospects there are bleak.
"This week and next week, we're going to look at the economic aspects of racing while pursuing a purchaser for the property," Bob Galterio, the track's general manager, told The Associated Press.
The track lost $5 million last year. Mr. Drucker said the track owners, the Rooney family, have considered selling before.
"They're disappointed," he said, "not so much that the Senate voted it down but that voters never got a chance to decide."
The Rooneys, who also own the Pittsburgh Steelers, acquired the track in 1973. But like many harness tracks, including five others around the state that would have been able to add slot machines, Yonkers has seen better days. Twenty years ago, it averaged 12,419 spectators a night with parimutuel wagering worth an average of $1.73 million a night. Last year, the track's average nightly attendance was 1,200, and the average nightly handle was $207,000.
The track viewed the slot machines as a new source of revenue, which would maintain current customers and lure people who now have to travel to Atlantic City, Ledyard, Conn., or Uncasville, Conn., for casino gambling.
The additional revenues from the slots would have improved the quality of horses that ran at the track by creating bigger purses, Mr. Drucker said. "We would have been able to offer the best purses in North America," he said.
The amendment, had it been approved by legislators and voters in a referendum, would have let gamblers play slot machines at the track only on race days, from two hours before the first race, to two hours after.
Mr. Drucker said he did not anticipate that any buyer would want the 37-acre site to remain a harness racing track.
The State Senate's 41-to-19 vote against the amendment scuttled its consideration until at least 1999.

HEADLINE: Many Black Men Barred From Voting

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD 

 BODY:
Fourteen percent of black men are currently or permanently barred from voting either because they are in prison or because they have been convicted of a felony, according to a study to be released today.
Of a total voting age population of 10.4 million black men nationwide, an estimated 1.46 million have lost the right to vote because a felony conviction, said the study, by the Sentencing Project in Washington. Of this disenfranchised group, 950,000 are ineligible to vote because they are in prison or on probation or parole, while about 510,000 are permanently barred in 13 states that take away the right to vote for life for most convicted felons, the study found. 
 Felons are prohibited from voting while in prison in 46 states, and 31 of them disenfranchise offenders while they are on probation or parole. Only 4 states -- Maine, Massachusetts, Utah and Vermont -- do not bar prison inmates from voting. The 13 states that permanently deprive virtually all felons of the right to vote are Alabama, Arizona, Delaware, Florida, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, Tennessee, Virginia and Wyoming.
"The cumulative impact of such large numbers of persons being disenfranchised from the electoral process clearly dilutes the political power of the African-American community," said the study, "Intended and Unintended Consequences: State Racial Disparities in Imprisonment."
The study's findings are likely to contribute to the debate in Congress and the states over whether sentencing laws, especially those involving crack cocaine, are discriminatory and whether the nation is relying too heavily on longer prison terms to combat crime.
Barbara Wright, director of the voting rights project at the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said of the study: "These figures are truly shocking. Voting is what makes you a citizen. It's tragic to contemplate the creation of an entire class of native-born non citizens. This seems to be almost an inevitable consequence of the tremendous increases in the incarceration of African-American men."
The study also found that the disparity in incarceration rates between blacks and whites has continued to widen, rising to 7.66 blacks in state and Federal prisons in 1994 for every white incarcerated, up from 6.88 in 1988.
In addition, the study tried to depict the economic and social cost of the racial disparities in incarceration by drawing on recent research by other experts. The study noted, for example, that Richard Freeman, a Harvard economist, has found that people who have served time in prison have a 25 percent reduction in the number of hours they work after being released.
The study also cited work by other scholars indicating that large-scale imprisonment of poor blacks might contribute to the decline of inner cities by increasing unemployment and undermining stable family life.
The Sentencing Project, a nonprofit organization that advocates alternatives to prison, is well regarded for its research. In earlier work, it found that 1 in 3 black men in their 20's were under the control of the criminal justice system on any given day, either in prison or in jail or on probation or parole.
Blacks make up 51 percent of 1.1 million inmates in state and Federal prisons, the study said, though blacks are only 14 percent of the nation's population. Although those numbers show that blacks are disproportionately incarcerated, said David Bositis, a political analyst at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a Washington research group devoted to black issues, it remains difficult to calculate precisely what effect the disenfranchisement of black men has on voting patterns.
For one thing, Mr. Bositis said, 93 percent of the black population is concentrated in 22 states, mainly New York, California and those in the South and the Midwest. In addition, voting has long been linked to social and economic status, he said, and with many blacks at the poorer end of society, "you would expect them to vote less."
Moreover, in the 1996 elections fewer than half the voting age population voted, Mr. Bositis said, "so even if the black males convicted of a felony had the same voting pattern as the general population, the likelihood is that only half of them would have voted."
Nevertheless, he said, the huge number of black men disenfranchised by a felony conviction "clearly diminishes black influence politically" and may contribute to the fact that black voter turnout is 10 to 20 percent lower than white turnout.
Equally important, Mr. Bositis suggested, is the psychological effect on the black population, much of which already believes that the criminal justice system discriminates against blacks.
"You have a prison system where black men are back in servitude, along with an economy where blacks are in the low paying jobs," he said, "so it all ends up in the minds of black Americans that the system is basically rigged to diminish their political power and recreate the plantation system with prisons."
Michael Tonry, a professor of law at the University of Minnesota and a leading expert on racial disparities in prisons, said he believed that because many prison inmates come from the poorest, least educated and most isolated areas in the inner cities, only about 15 percent of the black men who are incarcerated would be likely to vote. That would reduce the practical effect of the disenfranchisement of such a large number of people, Professor Tonry said.
But the disqualification of so many black men is important as a matter of democratic principle, he said, and "further handicaps an already disadvantaged people."
Professor Tonry said that although much of the racial disparity in imprisonment could be attributed to tougher sentences for crack cocaine, favored by black drug users, than for powered cocaine, favored by whites, "there is also this unhappy truth that blacks are arrested disproportionately for violent crimes."

HEADLINE: Safe Food? Not Yet

BYLINE: By Nicols Fox; Nicols Fox, author of the forthcoming "Spoiled: The Dangerous Truth About a Food Chain Gone Haywire," writes for The Economist.

DATELINE: BASS HARBOR, Me.

 BODY:
President Clinton wants to spend $43 million of his 1998 budget on improving food safety. The good news is that $11.5 million of this money would go to an early-warning system to identify causes of foodborne illness. But while this proposal could help us spot oubreaks more quickly, weaknesses in a new Agriculture Department meat inspection plan mean we aren't likely to see fewer such episodes any time soon.
In an age of widespread distribution of mass-produced foods, food poisonings are difficult to trace. Consumers have little idea where their food comes from or how it is processed. Producers cultivate trust with slick packaging, backed up by Government guarantees. Yet food makes millions of Americans sick each year. 
 Most cases are mild and require no medical treatment, but the Agriculture Department says that up to 9,000 people die from foodborne disease each year (as many as 500 of these deaths can be attributed to E. coli O157:H7, usually found in hamburger). Foodborne pathogens have also been linked to ulcers, Guillain-Barre syndrome, meningitis, reactive arthritis and even miscarriages.
The best part of the President's proposal increases the number of food-safety surveillance centers nationwide from five to eight. These operations, which are run by the states under Federal guidelines, are vital. In 1994, for example, the Minnesota Department of Health's center traced widespread salmonella poisoning to a single tainted batch of ice cream, which was quickly recalled. (Trucks carrying the ice cream's pre-mixture had previously hauled raw eggs.) More than 200,000 people around the nation became ill.
In general, when food poisoning occurs producers blame the consumer for failing to cook food thoroughly. Yet some foods have become unacceptably contaminated. An Agriculture Department study of chickens, quoted in the Federal Register, revealed that more than "99 percent of broiler carcasses" had detectable E. coli, evidence of fecal contamination. Another Federal study found that 72 percent of chickens were contaminated with salmonella. Yet meat and poultry companies have agreed among themselves not to make safety a marketing strategy, so Americans do not have the option, as consumers in Sweden do, of buying chickens labeled and guaranteed to be salmonella free.
The Agriculture Department's new "science-based" inspection system, called Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point, which went into effect this week, is neither a quick fix nor a long-term solution. The plan, which Mr. Clinton announced with great fanfare last summer, is a compromise between producers and the Government that will gradually transfer more oversight responsibility to the industry. Such a system has worked well for products like canned foods, which can be sealed and heated before shipping, but its effectiveness is unproved with raw products.
Unlike the old "prod and sniff" approach, the new plan requires that raw meat be sampled for microbes. But meat containing disease-causing microbes (with the exception of E. coli O157:H7) will not be considered adulterated, the legacy of a legal decision holding that microbes are "inherent" in raw meat. The Agriculture Department still will not have the authority to recall contaminated meat or to regulate farms, and chickens contaminated with salmonella will still be sold. Federal officials will eventually shift from inspecting the meat itself to inspecting records of such checks.
Quick fixes in the hands of an industry that has traditionally put profit before safety are not the answer. Mr. Clinton's initiative is a start, but tough regulations from farm to table, even if they result in slightly higher prices, would be preferable to contaminated food.

HEADLINE: Heated Battle Is Expected On Financing Birth Control

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 29

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration is preparing to send Congress a measure to speed up spending on family planning overseas, setting up what abortion opponents describe as the first abortion-related vote in the new Congress.
Family-planning advocates say the measure has nothing to do with abortion, since none of the money can be used for abortions. But anti-abortion forces say the money would be used to further the Administration's "abortion crusade" overseas. And, given the charged political atmosphere in which such matters are always debated on Capitol Hill, both sides recognize that it will be cast in terms of abortion, as it was last year when it nearly derailed the budget. 
 At stake is the distribution of millions of condoms, birth-control pills and IUD's to men and women around the world. Without the devices, the Administration says, there will be a significant increase in unplanned pregnancies, abortions and maternal and infant deaths.
The spending measure is left over from a dispute when anti-abortion forces in the House tried to block money for international population-control groups that counsel on family planning and perform abortions.
Under a highly unusual and complicated compromise on last year's budget, Congress voted to reduce money for international family-planning programs by 35 percent and prevent any further spending until July 1, 1997. But it agreed that if the Administration could prove that family programs were being hurt, it would reconsider the measure in February and allow earlier release of the money.
If the measure passes, it would allow family-planning money, appropriated last year, to be released by March 1; if it fails, the money would be released automatically on July 1.
The amount of money varies, depending on when it is released. Congress appropriated $385 million for the State Department's Agency for International Development for the fiscal year ending on Sept. 30, but put a "metering" system on it, allowing only a certain percentage of it to be spent each month. If it starts flowing in March, family-planning programs would receive $215 million between then and Sept. 30. If it is delayed until July, it would amount to $92 million, meaning family-planning programs worldwide would get $123 million less than if the money started flowing in March.
That four-month delay will hurt the family-planning efforts, say Administration officials, who are to send their findings to Congress on Friday night to meet the Feb. 1 deadline set by the agreement.
The Administration plans to make the case that the loss of $123 million would mean that 50 million condoms, 4.8 million cycles of birth-control pills and 500,000 IUD's would not be distributed worldwide, officials said.
In Russia alone, for example, the two largest organizations that provide family planning would run out of money and contraceptives in that four-month period and may have to shut down. The two programs provide 1.7 million couples with contraceptive devices.
The Administration officials said the delay could also mean a loss of jobs in the United States among manufacturers of contraceptives.
The family-planning money has frequently become locked in a battle among anti-abortion forces in the House, a divided Senate, and abortion-rights forces in the White House, and the stage is set for the same battle to be replayed this year.
Douglas Johnson, chief lobbyist for the National Right to Life Committee, said, "This is the first abortion vote of the new Congress, and if lawmakers who ran as pro-life vote to give the Clinton Administration $123 million for its overseas abortion crusade, many of their constituents will be pretty upset."
He said he expected the vote to be close in both houses, particularly the Senate, where family-planning measures are not always seen in strict abortion terms.
Representative Christopher H. Smith, the New Jersey Republican who has led fights against family-planning money, insisted that the money would be used to promote abortion, even though the Administration has said that A.I.D. money could not and would not be used for this purpose.
"If we're going to give hundreds of millions of foreign aid to the abortion industry under the guise of family planning, it's a ruse I refuse to be a part of," he said.
Victoria Markell, political director for Population Action International, which supports speeding up the spending, said: "The Senate is reasonable, and we will win that vote. If the House leadership honors its agreement to keep this a clean vote and not mix it into the domestic abortion debate, we'll win that too.
But she said there had been discussion that Mr. Smith may be allowed to introduce an alternative measure, which she said would insure that the measure becomes an abortion vote rather than a family-planning vote.

HEADLINE: Whitman Asks $16.4 Billion In New Budget

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 29

 BODY:
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman proposed a $16.4 billion election-year budget today that provides spending increases for public schools, prisons and the environment, and more than a dozen modest initiatives aimed at Democratic and swing voters.
After three years of cutting taxes and reining in government spending, Governor Whitman took a different approach this year. Instead of the deep spending cuts in almost every state agency that she proposed last year, she recommends that spending either remain at current levels or increase for most programs in the coming year. She would pay for much of these increases by relying on $850 million from sources available only once. 
 She also promises to expand low-tax zones in cities, offer health insurance to uninsured children, expand drug treatment programs for women with children, open a second boot camp for juvenile offenders and eliminate the waiting list for disabled people seeking access to group homes and day care centers.
Describing her spending plan as "the people's budget," Mrs. Whitman said in her budget address to the State Legislature what she can be expected to recite on the campaign trail:
"It's about healthy children. It's about fighting drugs and crime. It's about helping businesses create jobs. It's about cleaner air and cleaner water."
The proposed budget, which raises overall spending by $203 million over this year's budget, was also notable for its contrast with the cuts she proposed a year ago. Last year, Governor Whitman sought to reduce subsidies to the prescription program for the elderly; this year, she boasted of her efforts to help preserve the program.
Last year, for the third year in a row, she recommended deep cuts at the State Department of Environmental Protection. But with her potential gubernatorial challengers poised to attack her environmental record, Mrs. Whitman proposed a $2.1 million increase at the department and touted new programs to monitor water pollution and clean up hazardous waste sites.
As expected, Mrs. Whitman's potential Democratic challengers were quick to dismiss her plan.
State Senator James E. McGreevey of Middlesex County, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for governor, said he thought that voters would see the Governor's proposal as a "completely vacuous budget."
Senator McGreevey added, "This is government by theme, not government by accounting." He also complained that the proposal did nothing to provide voters with more property tax relief.
Under the plan, state aid to municipalities would remain flat for the second year in a row, prompting Democratic lawmakers and some local officials to warn that property taxes would rise this year in many cities and towns struggling to keep up with increasing operating expenses.
But Mrs. Whitman said she was confident that property taxes would not increase significantly. She pointed out that her proposal would distribute $5 billion to school districts, including $286 million for the new school financing plan approved by the State Legislature last month.
The plan is part of the Whitman administration's efforts to comply with a State Supreme Court order requiring New Jersey to narrow the spending gap between the richest and poorest districts. About $138 million would go the state's 30 neediest districts.
"We have held budget growth to less than half the rate of inflation, while dramatically increasing our commitment to property tax relief," she said. "In fact, between school funding, county court takeover, transportation aid and other forms of assistance, the state will provide nearly three quarters of a billion dollars more for property tax relief this year than when I took office."
Although Mrs. Whitman sought to emphasize the good news in her proposed budget, the plan angered some constituents.
Her budget proposal recommends a $20 million decline in aid to colleges and universities.
But administration officials said colleges should be able to avoid tuition increases for residents by drawing on their budget reserves and taking advantage of savings from reduced employee health benefit costs.
She also recommended significant increase in tuition for out-of-state students that would cover "the actual cost of their education."
The plan would also reduce the state work force by 3,235 jobs, with 2,000 of those a result of previously announced plans to shut down the Marlboro Psychiatric Hospital and North Princeton Development Center. At the same time, the plan calls for hiring 900 corrections officers for a new 3,200-bed prison, as well as 100 more investigators to curb fraud in the auto insurance industry and in Medicaid programs.
To pay for her proposed new initiatives and balance her spending plan, Mrs. Whitman anticipates $200 million more in new tax revenues and $850 million from one-shot revenues and spending cuts, sources of money that the administration cannot necessarily turn to next year.
The administration is counting on $200 million from the proposed sale of the State Disability Benefits Fund, which distributes about $326 million in payments for up to 26 weeks to New Jersey workers who are temporarily disabled as a result of injury or sickness unrelated to their jobs.
More than 2.4 million employees and employers now pay about $370 million in payroll taxes annually to the fund, which administration officials hope to sell to a private insurance company before June. New Jersey is one of five states that administers temporary disability benefits. Before the administration can move forward with the sale, however, it needs the Legislature's approval.
The administration is also trying to save $623 million during the next 14 months, primarily by reducing the state's contribution to the public employee pension system.
The Whitman administration has proposed selling $3.4 billion in bonds to help pay off the pension system's $4.2 billion unfunded liability account, which covers cost-of-living increases for retirees.
By using the proceeds from the sale and $800 million from the pension system's surplus to pay off the entire unfunded liability account, Brian W. Clymer, the State Treasurer, said that he can avoid much of the state's regular pension contribution this year. In addition, since payments on the bond sale would not begin until next year, the state can avoid paying $113 million this year in debt service.
This is the second time that the Whitman administration has turned to the pension system to help balance the budget, and help pay for the cost of a 30 percent reduction in income tax rates and other tax cuts totaling $2.8 billion since Mrs. Whitman took office.
By making several changes to the pension system, including raising the assumption that the system will earn higher investment returns, the Whitman administration has reduced the state's contribution by $3.5 billion to the pension system since 1994.
But Mrs. Whitman's pension proposal is not likely to win easy approval in the Republican-controlled Legislature.
State Senator Robert E. Littell, a Republican from Franklin who is chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said he did not like the proposal, and that many lawmakers, Republicans and Democrats, said they had similar concerns.
"I think it is a bad idea," Mr. Littell said. "It would be the biggest borrowing by a state in history. It would lock us into debt service payments for 35 years. We would lose a lot of flexibility."
State Senator Bernard F. Kenny Jr., a Democrat from Hudson County, also criticized the Whitman plan, saying that it gets "failing marks for controlling property taxes, making a college education affordable and protecting our environment."

HEADLINE: British-Dutch Firm Asks for Tax Breaks

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
In the latest round of corporate poker, ING Capital, a giant British-Dutch financial services firm, is threatening to abandon New York for a new headquarters in Stamford, Conn., unless New York grants the company a package of tax breaks and other incentives, real estate and city officials said yesterday.
ING Capital has been in New York since 1820, a spokesman said. City officials were told yesterday that there was a difference of nearly $90 million over a 15-year lease between the location ING is considering in Stamford and a new site in Manhattan: 300,000 square feet at Park Avenue Plaza at East 52d Street. 
 The fast-growing company, which bought Barings P.L.C. in 1995 when the company was on the verge of ruin, operates out of 200,000 square feet at 135 East 57th Street and 667 Madison Avenue, near 59th Street.
In the 1990's, dozens of other companies, like Dillon, Read; Travelers Inc.; Prudential Securities, and Morgan Stanley have been granted hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks and other incentives after threatening to leave the city. But in this case, city officialsare apparently reluctant to grant the incentives because they think ING might not be serious about moving, according to real estate executives and public officials familiar with the negotiations.
Many administration officials are said to believe that ING cannot or will not move nearly 1,000 employees, if only because there is little available space elsewhere.
Officials at the Economic Development Corporation declined to comment, and ING officials did not return calls requesting an interview. But Donald A. DiRenzo Sr., vice chairman of Cushman & Wakefield, ING's representative, acknowledged that the company is considering Park Avenue and Stamford. A decision is expected this week.
"They haven't quite made up their mind," Mr. DiRenzo said of ING. "We're still in the midst of negotiating. But it is a poker game with the city. You never know what they're going to say."
The rejection of the company's application for what is known as a corporate retention package would signify not so much a change in municipal policy, experts say, as a calculation that the city's economy and the real estate market in New York have recovered from the recession of the early 1990's. Vacancy rates have come down in midtown Manhattan and in Stamford, where there are few empty office buildings left.
The city has been willing to provide tax breaks for companies moving to lower Manhattan, where vacancy rates remain high, or Times Square, a once seedy entertainment district, but may not be willing to subsidize a move to Park Avenue.
"The city's more sophisticated now," said Bruce E. Mosler, president of the Galbreath real estate company and a frequent critic of the deals. "The city is much less willing to be arbitrary in their approach to giving concessions. In the past, you were able to lever your position with the city, whether you had a real option or not."
ING is hardly the only company casting about for new space and tax breaks. Guardian Insurance, which owns its building on Park Avenue South in Union Square, is looking for 400,000 square feet for a new home in Manhattan or Westchester County.
NatWest is looking for 300,000 square feet in midtown and Connecticut, brokers say, and Reuters is looking for 800,000 square feet and has hired a lawyer who negotiated incentives packages for some of the city's most prestigious corporations. The Giuliani administration has granted 24 corporations a total of $506.8 million in tax breaks, job training and low-cost power since January 1994.
The city says the incentive packages secured 55,791 jobs that might otherwise have left. The tax breaks, the administration says, are a small price to pay for retaining companies that generate $809.12 million a year in tax revenues. A small part of the benefits are tied to job growth.
But some landlords, urban planners and politicians have criticized the retention deals because, they say, it unfairly shifts the city's tax burden from the backs of the largest, most politically connected companies to small and medium-sized companies that have a higher rate of job growth.
Elliott Sclar, a professor of economics and urban policy at Columbia University, said it would be better to cut the tax rate and invest in roads public transportation and schools.
"It would take a very courageous administration to stop this, because it's like disarming," Mr. Sclar said. "But if the city can't do it now then they ought to pack it in. These are the good times."
Companies have not stopped leaving Manhattan, nor have New Jersey and Connecticut stopped offering incentive packages and lower tax rates. Last year, the Zurich Insurance Group announced that it would move its Risk Enterprise Management operation and 500 jobs to New Jersey. And 37 of the 101 firms lured to Connecticut since January 1995, came from New York City, accounting for 2,264 of the jobs captured from other states, state data show.

HEADLINE: U.S. to Put Airline Safety Data on Internet, but Carrier Ranking Is Ruled Out

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 29

 BODY:
Under pressure to release information on airline safety and mishaps, the Federal Aviation Administration said today that it would do so next month on the World Wide Web but that the information would not help rank airlines by safety.
Many of the reports are available now only by filing a request under the Freedom of Information Act. Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, who had called for releasing more information shortly after the crash of a Valujet Airlines DC-9 that killed 110 people on May 11, announced the new policy today and proclaimed, "From now on, aviation secrets are going public." 
 But aviation officials said they had no statistics that could be used to rank airlines by safety, not even information used to decide which airlines need extra inspections.
Barry Bermingham, deputy administrator for system safety, said the F.A.A. would strive to make information that was "valuable in the public's mind" easily available to make them more informed consumers. But, he said, such information would not allow anybody -- not a potential traveler and not even a statistician -- to rank the airlines.
Joining the F.A.A. in this opinion today was the Air Transport Association, which is the trade association of the big airlines.
"Are consumers going to be able to make a judgment? The answer is no, they're not," said David Fuscus, a spokesman. "We're not aware of any way to take that information and come up with a valid way to compare one airline to another."
The F.A.A. did compare safety among airlines last spring, in a report it prepared for the Transportation Secretary Federico F. Pena giving the rates of accidents and incidents per departure for each airline. The report described itself as an effort to prove that low-cost carriers set up under deregulation were just as safe as established carriers. But officials said today that that ranking, which has not been repeated, would not help passengers trying to pick the safest airline.
"Past fatal accidents and nonfatal accidents do not predict safety," said Richard Golaszewski of GRA Inc., a consulting firm hired by the agency to help establish policy on releasing information. "Knowing who had the last accident doesn't tell you a lot about who might have the next one."
"Right now, you really can't make meaningful distinctions among individual carriers," he said.
But the information the F.A.A. plans to make available will allow anyone with access to the World Wide Web to search through nearly 20 years of data, using a software "search engine," to spot incidents of equipment failure, forced landings and other incidents.
Two data bases the agency plans to make available electronically by Feb. 28 are that of the National Transportation Safety Board, on airline accidents and incidents that dates from 1984, and another from the F.A.A. that runs back to 1978. The information will be available on the Web page, www.faa.gov.
The Transportation Department already offers on-line comparative data on lost baggage rates and on-time arrival rates, updated monthly.
Beginning Feb. 1, the F.A.A. will issue press releases on new enforcement actions that seek civil penalties of $50,000 or more, the agency said. Those actions carrying smaller penalties will be announced if the agency thinks the incidents are of particular interest; for example, officials said, if an engine shuts down in flight and the cause is found to be maintenance errors.
In general, the penalty for a single violation on a single flight is $10,000, officials said. The amount collected each year ranges from about $1 million to $1.5 million, officials said.
The acting administrator, Linda Hall Daschle, said in a statement that the F.A.A. would also establish on line "a public education area with narrative materials to help travelers better understand how impressive the U.S. safety record is."

HEADLINE: Blows From Nafta Batter the Caribbean Economy

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: KINGSTON, Jamaica

 BODY:
Three years after the United States, Canada and Mexico agreed to become a single market as part of the North American Free Trade Agreement, their exports to each other are booming. But here in the Caribbean, the economies of America's much smaller neighbors are reeling from the impact of that success and finding it nearly impossible to compete.
From the apparel plants of Jamaica to the sugar-cane fields of Trinidad, Nafta has already resulted in the loss of jobs, markets and income for the vulnerable island nations of the region. The capital and investment projects that are vitally needed for future growth, officials say, are increasingly flowing out of the Caribbean Basin and into Mexico. 
 "The stark reality is that Mexico can now export its products to the United States free of duty, which makes it more profitable for producers to operate from there," Seymour Mullings, Jamaica's Minister of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade, said in an interview here. "Putting it very simply, if that is not stemmed, it could do untold damage to our manufacturing sector and economy as a whole."
Nafta's devastating effect on the Caribbean was widely forecast before the treaty's passage in 1993 and Washington suggested it would cushion the blow by extending similar trade preferences to the island nations.
However, the Clinton Administration's proposals to give the Caribbean "Nafta parity" have twice foundered in Congress in election years and now face an uncertain future in a new Congress that has decidedly mixed feelings about the benefits of free-trade agreements.
The Caribbean now exports more than $12.5 billion worth of goods to the United States annually, one-third of which it could lose to Mexico if the existing trade rules remain in effect, according to a recent World Bank study.
The region's once-flourishing apparel sector has been hard hit, officials say. In the last two years, more than 150 apparel plants closed in the Caribbean and 123,000 jobs have been lost "as a direct result of trade and investment diversion to Mexico," according to the Caribbean Textile and Apparel Institute, which is located here.
Textile manufacturing had been one of the Caribbean's few economic bright spots. Between 1980 and 1995, Jamaica's garment exports, primarily underwear and hosiery, rose from less than $10 million a year to nearly $600 million, an average annual growth rate of 28 percent.
Since Nafta took effect in 1994, Mexican textile exports have grown at a rate three times those of the Caribbean as a whole. In 1996, the Caribbean Textile and Apparel Institute estimates, Jamaica's garment exports fell by 7 percent, with 7,000 jobs eliminated.
Similar or even larger decreases were recorded in Guyana, Belize and tiny St. Lucia.
More than 600 people, about 95 percent of them women, felt the effects of Nafta when the Korean-owned Youngone Garment factory on Marcus Garvey Drive here closed just before Christmas.
The plant had been making T-shirts for export to the United States. But a Mexican factory took the business away with a lower bid, prompting the company to shut down operations in Jamaica and send its employees home. The company then shipped its equipment off to Bangladesh.
"I lost my job back in '95 and haven't been able to find another one since," said Beryl Davidson, 26, a former textile worker and single mother of three small children. "I couldn't pay my rent, and I couldn't feed my kids, so I've had to move back in with my parents to survive."
"But my cousin in Brooklyn tells me there's plenty of work there, so maybe I will join her," she said.
Since Nafta went into effect, the creation of new jobs in this nation of 2.3 million people has stopped altogether and overall unemployment has risen to 16 percent from 9.5 percent, according to the Statistical Institute of Jamaica. Among women in the apparel sector, the unemployment rate is now more than 33 percent.
Worse yet, the loss of jobs and American support occurs as the pro-American Government here, with an election due sometime in the next year, is completing an economic retrenchment that had been strongly urged by Washington. Over the past decade, Jamaica has sold off state companies, reduced the budget deficit and increased foreign reserves, but at a high social cost.
"We have no safety net here, no welfare, no Medicare," said Anthony Gomes, director of a large trading company. "So when people go to the street, it has a serious ripple effect. The way things are going, jobs are very difficult to get, and that is not helping our crime rate."
American officials, however, argue that Jamaica and other Caribbean nations are blaming Nafta for deeper-rooted economic difficulties that will remain even if trade rules are eventually eased. In the case of Jamaica, they maintain, those include a revaluation of the currency that increased its value by 12.5 percent last year, making the country's products more expensive, and a host of regulatory obstacles.
"The main problem here is government bureaucracy," one official said. "It is darn near impossible to collect the licenses and approvals you need to get a business off the ground."
Ironically, Jamaica's initial export surge was the result of another American program, the Caribbean Basin Initiative, which the Reagan Administration put in place 15 years ago. A package of aid, trade and investment incentives aimed at the private sector, the program was intended to introduce the Caribbean to what Mr. Reagan called "the magic of the marketplace," and had Jamaica as its centerpiece.
But that arrangement has also benefited the United States. American exports to the region rose 160 percent in the decade ending in 1995, to more than $15 billion a year. The Caribbean is the only part of the world where Washington recorded a favorable balance of trade every year during that time.
The Caribbean Basin Initiative still exists, but places either duties or quotas on those products in which Caribbean nations enjoy a competitive advantage, such as sugar, textiles and footwear.
"All we are asking is to be put on a level playing field with Mexico," said Paul Robertson, Jamaica's Minister of Industry, Investment and Commerce. "We are not seeking a handout, but only the opportunity not to be prevented from taking full advantage of the North American market."

HEADLINE: Deliberating, Simpson Jury Reveals Little Of Its Intent

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr. 

DATELINE: SANTA MONICA, Calif., Jan. 29

 BODY:
Behind closed doors, with a scattering of the curious and an army of reporters and photographers hanging outside the courthouse, the jury in O. J. Simpson's second trial put in its first full day of deliberations today.
At one point the panel of seven women and five men sent out for a magnifying glass used in closely studying photographs, and for a photograph of a test tube like the one used to store a sample of Mr. Simpson's blood. Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki gave the jurors the magnifying glass but refused to give them the picture, saying they did not need it. 
 Throughout the trial, many photographs were entered as evidence, including those of the crime scene, of spattered blood in Mr. Simpson's home, of his vehicles and of Mr. Simpson, apparently wearing shoes like the ones that left bloody footprints at the slaying scene.
It was not clear from the jury's requests where the jury was headed or how long it might take to get there.
The panel -- which includes a postal worker, a bank employee, a stage manager, an unemployed cement finisher and several homemakers -- was handed the wrongful-death civil suit late on Tuesday. It remained closeted for more than six hours today as it tried to determine whether Mr. Simpson killed Nicole Brown Simpson, his former wife, and Ronald L. Goldman, her friend, and, if he did, how much he should pay the surviving families, the plaintiffs.
The families did not ask for a specific amount in their court papers.
In Mr. Simpson's criminal trial for murder, the jury, after little more than three hours of deliberation in October 1995, found the former football star and entertainment personality not guilty of charges that he fatally slashed Mrs. Simpson and Mr. Goldman outside her condominium on the night of June 12, 1994.
The nation was transfixed by that trial, with its undertones of spousal abuse, unrequited love, police racism and high living in the fast lane. And to isolate it from the intense national focus, the criminal jury was sequestered throughout the nine-months trial. Though national interest in the case remains high, it has somewhat abated, and the civil judge has not sequestered this jury throughout the four-month second trial.
But the civil case is significantly different from the criminal one because it involves only money claims, and not the possibility of a prison sentence.
Much of the legal ground covered in the first trial also was covered in the second, including accusations by the plaintiffs that Mr. Simpson was a cold-blooded, lying murderer and counter-accusations by the defense that he was framed by corrupt police investigators. But the jury in the second case is applying a different, lesser standard of culpability as it determines Mr. Simpson's fate.
In the first trial, conviction required unanimous agreement by the 12 jurors that Mr. Simpson was, beyond a reasonable doubt, the killer. In the second trial, a finding of culpability requires the votes of only 9 of 12 jurors, and they need agree only that, more likely than not, he was the killer and thus should pay.
But on closer inspection, the second case is not so simple.
For one thing, the plaintiffs made clear in their arguments that they are seeking not just money, both for recompense and punishment, but also closure to a horrendous trauma in their lives. They would be happy as a last resort, they indicated, if the jury ignored the money issue and found only that, indeed, Mr. Simpson killed Mrs. Simpson and Mr. Goldman.
Three actions, not one, are involved in the second case, though all were combined into a single action in the interest of judicial efficiency.
In the first two suits, Fred Goldman and Sharon Rufo, the long-divorced parents of Mr. Goldman, each filed wrongful-death claims accusing Mr. Simpson of killing their son and asking that he compensate them for that loss and that he also pay extra as punishment.
In the third suit, Louis and Juditha Brown, Mrs. Simpson's parents, filed a suit on behalf of her estate, known as a survivorship suit, that also demands money from Mr. Simpson for fatally assaulting his wife. If any money is forthcoming, it will by law go not to the Browns but to the Simpson children Sydney and Justin.
The Browns deliberately avoided pushing for a wrongful-death suit because such a pleading would have required that the children become plaintiffs. The grandparents said they did not want to put the youngsters directly in the position of suing their father for murdering their mother.
The first jury was predominately black, a significant factor in a case in which police racism was a major issue. In the second case, in which the court ordered the racism issue played down during the testimony stage, the jury is predominately white.

HEADLINE: Hispanic Households Struggle Amid Broad Decline in Income

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 29

 BODY:
If he dared to tattoo gang symbols on his neck, Myrna Morales warned her strapping 17-year-old son, William, she would burn them off with her iron. Or a frying pan.
Such was the desperation of Mrs. Morales, 41, a naturalized American from Guatemala who has watched three of her United States-born children seduced by the worst of inner-city culture and seen her earnings as a housecleaner shrink in recent years. With her diminishing income, she asked, how can she promise that they will prosper like so many other immigrants' children before them? 
 "I tell them go to school and don't be like me, cleaning bathrooms," said Mrs. Morales, who scrubs and vacuums for $300 a week despite her medical assistant's degree from a local college. Her husband earns as additional $300 a week as a painter, but the Moraleses still feel they are on the edge of a precipice.
To judge by the latest Census Bureau statistics, they are right to be worried. The data show that in 1995, median household income rose for every other American ethnic and racial group except the country's 27 million Hispanic residents, for whom the figure fell 5.1 percent. The downturn, which affects the United States-born as well as the newly arrived across a broad spectrum of socio-economic indicators, has baffled social scientists. And it has prompted some to warn that many Hispanic residents, members of the country's fastest-growing ethnic or racial group, may become entrenched as its working poor.
Census data show that for the first time the poverty rate among Hispanic residents of the United States has surpassed that of blacks. Hispanic residents now constitute nearly 24 percent of the country's poor, up eight percentage points since 1985. Of all Hispanic residents, 30 percent were considered poor in 1995, meaning they earned less than $15,569 for a family of four. That is almost three times the percentage of non-Hispanic whites in poverty. Of the poorest of the poor, those with incomes of $7,500 or less for a family of four, 24 percent were Hispanic.
These are not just statistical blips. Over all, income for Hispanic households has dropped 14 percent since 1989, to under $22,900, from about $26,000, while rising slightly for black ones.
Nor do the data simply reflect the recent influx of illegal Hispanic immigrants.
"As we know from the data in other studies," said Manuel de la Puente, the chief of the Ethnic and Hispanic Statistics Branch at the Census Bureau, "the immigrants tend to be low-educated individuals, hold service-sector jobs and have little or no English, and all these things contribute to income."
But when Census analysts separated out United States-born Hispanic people, Mr. de la Puente said, they found their income levels declining as well. Statistics indicate that the United States' Hispanic population is experiencing an almost across-the-board impoverishment.
"It is the American nightmare, not the American dream," said Arturo Vargas, who heads the National Association of Latino Elected Officials, based in Los Angeles.
Though the Hispanic middle class has been growing, Mr. Vargas said, most Hispanic residents are caught in jobs like gardener, nanny and restaurant worker that will never pay well and from which they will never advance.
 
A Mixed Group Difficult to Stereotype
The declining income among the nation's Hispanic population is little understood and requires more study, researchers say, as do new data showing improved economic well-being among blacks.
Researchers also caution that "Hispanic" is an ethnic term and that the group is an amalgam of people, some of them black, and their descendants, from nearly 24 countries. They range from typically prosperous Cuban Americans of Miami to Puerto Rican Americans, largely concentrated in New York and the nation's poorest ethnic group. Generalizations, then, are often of limited use.
Nonetheless, the growing group of scholars who study the United States' Hispanic residents point to several factors that affect most of that population:
*Structural changes in the economy that have drastically reduced well-paid blue-collar jobs.
*The failures of institutions like schools to retain Hispanic students and provide them with a marketable education, resulting in a widening gap in graduation rates from both high school and college. Hispanic residents have by far the highest high-school dropout rate of any group in the country; 1990 Census figures found that even among United States-born Hispanic people, only 78 percent finished high school compared with 91 percent of whites and 84 percent of blacks.
*Discrimination among employers who see Hispanic immigrants, particularly those who speak poor English, as disposable workers.
Experts acknowledge that the influx of millions of Latin American immigrants over the last 20 years -- two million from 1990 to 1994 alone, the Census reports -- have pulled income numbers down because immigrants tend to be poor.
"Everybody's going up the escalator," said Dowell Myers, a demographer at the University of Southern California who has studied the region's Hispanic population, "but there's a big queue at the bottom, and the queue's getting bigger, so the average number of steps people have gotten up has slipped."
The arrival of so many new workers, many illegal and willing to work for little, has also driven down wages in low-skill professions, Professor Myers said.
A new study by the University of California at Los Angeles, based on Census data, notes that in the blue-collar industries of California in which Mexican immigrants are concentrated -- clothing and furniture manufacture, for example -- real earnings declined more than $6,000 a year from 1970 to 1990.
 
Lack of Education Handicaps Immigrants
Government demographers also note that immigration and birth rates have weighted the country's Hispanic population toward lower-income groups, like Mexican Americans, at the expense of higher-income ones, like Cuban Americans. In addition, Hispanic residents tend to be younger than the population at large and Hispanic women with children are less likely to work.
But for many scholars and community leaders, the main explanation for Hispanic residents' plight is education -- or the lack of it. A 1994 study by Frank D. Bean, a University of Texas demographer, and his colleagues found that in several age groups, Mexican Americans whose families had lived in the United States for three generations or more received slightly less schooling than their parents. And people of Mexican descent account for the biggest portion of the Hispanic population.
Another study, by the Census Bureau in 1995, found that Hispanic residents have been falling further behind non-Hispanic ones in rates of college attendance even as the economy is providing growing rewards to the better educated. In 1994, only 9 percent of Hispanic Americans over age 24 had college degrees, compared with 24 percent of non-Hispanic Americans; Hispanic students were doing proportionally better in 1975, when 5 percent held college degrees compared with 11.6 percent of non-Hispanic ones.
Just getting through high school is a challenge for the many Hispanic children in school systems as overwhelmed and underfinanced as the Los Angeles Unified School District, which is 70 percent Hispanic.
Crowding is so bad that 40,000 schoolchildren out of 670,000 must be bused outside their neighborhoods and most schools run on year-round schedules, said Vickie Castro, a member of the Los Angeles school board. Music, art and sports programs have been cut, Ms. Castro said, and with 1 counselor for every 500 children, little dropout prevention can come from that quarter.
"There's a strong work ethic within Latino families," she said, "and we keep telling them education is the tool to get out of poverty, but their immediate needs overtake it."
Those needs overtook Linda Martinez in Houston, a 23-year-old who dropped out of school to work when she was 15.
Ms. Martinez is now attending community college while working part-time at a community center. She hopes to finish soon and become a teacher, she said, but knows that her education may be interrupted again.
Some Hispanic scholars and community leaders suggest that many problems affecting the nation's Hispanic population stem from the fact that members of the poor, ill-educated immigrant segment tend to settle in crime-ridden, gang-infested inner cities, where a culture of easy money might be difficult to resist.
William, Mrs. Morales's son, for example, has left the Alley Cats 13 gang and reformed, helped by Youth Fair Chance, a training and counseling program that is soon to lose most of its Federal Labor Department financing. But he said he remembered what the world looked like when he dropped out of high school and had gang symbols tattooed on his back.
"I saw friends that didn't graduate from high school robbing and getting money," said William, who works as a peer counselor and is finishing school at Youth Fair Chance in downtown Los Angeles.
He was seduced by the cash and the parties and the girls, he said, but in the end, "I didn't want my mother crying every night."
She already had plenty to cry about. William's twin sister, an unmarried mother of a toddler, is now trying to finish high school while working as a waitress, and his older brother, age 20, has been in jail on a gang-related murder conviction since he was 15.

Low Pay And Little Future
Mrs. Morales, who immigrated illegally in 1973 and received a green card through a family whose disabled son she helped rear, is no quitter. But she is thinking of allowing her husband to take their youngest, a 4-year-old son, back to Guatemala and rear him there, "away from all this."
"I wish I had a better job, lots of money, so I could buy a house outside this neighborhood," Mrs. Morales said of the section of downtown Los Angeles where the family lives. But the clinic where she worked closed and house cleaning pays less than it used to because of the competition from new immigrants, she said.
Because so many businesses have moved to suburbs, "finding their way outward has become harder for many urban-dwelling poor and minorities," Rebecca Morales and Frank Bonilla write in "Latinos in a Changing U.S. Economy" (Sage, 1993).
Even those who do escape, like Joe Aravena, 40, a plant utility engineer who moved his family from the South Bronx to the ethnically mixed Castle Hill section five years ago, say they seem to be working harder to keep a toehold in middle-class life.
Born in the United States of a Chilean father and a Puerto Rican mother, Mr. Aravena has seen his $34,000 salary at the state hospital stagnate for years. These days, he said, he can afford to send his 11-year-old son to Roman Catholic school only by putting in frequent 16-hour shifts.
The general problem of Hispanic poverty, researchers agree, begins with the low education and skill levels with which most Hispanic immigrants arrive in this country. But the most critical barrier to immigrants' success, studies suggest, is language.
"Limited English proficiency is the single most important obstacle to upward mobility among Mexican immigrants," said Wayne Cornelius, the director of the Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies at the University of California at San Diego.
Without a command of English, scholars say, it matters little how industrious a Hispanic person is.

HEADLINE: Giuliani To Propose a Budget To Cut Less and Spend More

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
Taking advantage of a rebounding economy as he begins his re-election campaign, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani plans to announce a preliminary budget today that would include the first overall increase in city spending and the fewest reductions in services that he has recommended since becoming Mayor.
Mr. Giuliani said in an interview last night that the $34 billion spending plan for the 1998 fiscal year would propose $250 million in tax cuts, including the permanent elimination of the city's share of the 8.25 percent sales tax for clothing under $500. Under the Mayor's proposal, the tax would drop to 4.25 percent, with 4 percent going to the state and one-quarter of 1 percent to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. 
 Mr. Giuliani urged the state and the M.T.A. to abolish their portion of the sales tax as well, repeating a position he voiced during the one-week repeal of the tax last week, which proved popular with shoppers.
The Mayor also said that he wanted to abolish or scale back the unincorporated business tax, which mostly affects small businesses, and cut the commercial rent tax.
Under his plan, spending for the fiscal year that begins on July 1 would rise about one-half of 1 percent. "It's a very modest increase," Mr. Giuliani said.
The proposed fiscal blueprint is a striking departure from the austere budgets that were a hallmark of the first three years of the Mayor's tenure. Perhaps nothing is more indicative of the change than this: Mr. Giuliani, who has cut 21,000 city jobs since he took office, is proposing no new reductions in the municipal work force, which is now at slightly more than 200,000 people.
Experts who study the city's finances said the big question confronting Mr. Giuliani is what to do with the extra tax revenue from the economic upturn, particularly whether he should salt it away to help deal with the city's chronic budget troubles.
Administration officials said last night that in general, the Mayor had decided to spend about one-third, use one-third to pay for tax cuts and save the rest to cover future deficits.
By law, the Mayor must present a preliminary budget in January that provides an overview of the city's spending over the next four years. After receiving comments from the City Council and fiscal monitors, he then issues a final budget in May, which the Council then approves, often after amending it. Most tax cuts, however, are subject to approval by the State Legislature.
The Mayor acknowledged last night that he would still call for cuts at city agencies, but he stressed that those reductions would be far less than the ones he made in previous years. Administration officials said they would seek about $550 million in cuts for the 1998 budget, though they will probably end up with closer to $200 million.
In the interview, Mr. Giuliani declined to say which agencies would bear the brunt of the cuts, saying he would announce that when the budget is made public today.
The Mayor must cut services even while proposing an overall increase in spending because of the structure of the budget. Labor and other costscontinue to grow at up to 5 percent a year, so for the Mayor to limit the overall spending increase to only one-half of 1 percent, he needs to cut elsewhere.
As he first promised in his annual address to the City Council this month, the Mayor will propose at least $275 million in added spending for the schools, administration officials said. He would allocate $125 million to provide six hours of additional reading instruction a week to grade-school students and $150 million over the next two years to buy 40,000 personal computers for the schools.
Randy M. Mastro, the Deputy Mayor for Operations, said "several hundred million dollars" would be added to the city's capital budget for school construction to lessen overcrowding.
The Mayor's Democratic opponents have signaled that they believe he is vulnerable on education issues, charging that he has neglected the public school system and deprived it of needed funding.
The city faces a projected budget gap of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion for the 1998 fiscal year, but Mr. Giuliani is presented with a more palatable menu of choices in closing it than he did in the first three years in his term. The local economy, which had been anemic, has strengthened, largely because of robust profits on Wall Street, giving the city more tax dollars.
As a result, the Mayor will have a surplus of nearly $400 million from the current fiscal year that he can roll into the next one. His aides are also projecting that tax revenues will rise for the 1998 budget. "We are going into next year with some room to spare," Mr. Giuliani said.
The budget is not without risks, though. If the stock market sours, tax revenues might plummet, forcing Mr. Giuliani to seek more reductions at a time when he is trying to soften his image as a fiscal hawk.
What's more, the relatively rosy fiscal picture turns darker in 1999 and 2000, when the city must grapple with projected shortfalls of $2 billion to $3 billion annually, largely because expenses are expected to continue to rise faster than revenues.
Asked why he was proposing cutting taxes and services at the same time, Mr. Giuliani said it was important to stimulate the city's economy by lessening the tax burden, which is among the highest in the nation.
"This is really part of a budget philosophy that says that as you are realizing extra revenues, you should do three things," he said. "You should spend some, save some to reduce the gaps, and put the rest back into the private sector. What the city has by and large done in the past is just spend any additional revenues."
He conceded that this less bleak budget might help his re-election. But he insisted that the city would not be in a position to benefit from the new tax revenues if it were still spending at high rate, contending that he had cut $7 billion to $9 billion in projected spending since he took office.
"I understand that some of this is fortuitous," he said, "but in fact we could not take advantage of the good fortune if we hadn't taken the heat for making the budget cuts two and three years ago."

HEADLINE: Real Campaign Reform Will Give Access to All

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "State of the Sleaze" (editorial, Jan. 28): The scary thing about campaign finance reform proposals is that they always seem to leave room for the purchase of influence with huge contributions. President Clinton, for example, suggests a cap of $100,000 for party donations -- as if that will bring access to government equally within the reach of every citizen. 
 Eliminating the clout of the wealthy, corporations and special interest groups with elected officials requires lowering the maximum for contributions to a level anyone can afford. It is true that a cap of, say, $50 for all contributions would be hard for politicians to swallow, as it would probably mean an end to their packaging by expensive spin doctors like Arthur J. Finkelstein and Dick Morris. But would it really be that bad for the country for folks like that to be unemployed?

Brazilians Excel With Shopping Bags

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO 

 BODY:
Canadians may dominate the tourism landscape in New York City in numbers of visitors, and the Japanese may be the fastest-growing market. But the biggest spenders are the Brazilians, according to a Federal survey of passengers taken during arriving flights.
Tourists from Brazil spent an average of $1,296 each per visit, compared with the second and third place Argentina ($1,070) and Japan ($837), the survey shows. While Japanese visitors actually spend more each day than visitors from Brazil, $279 compared with $216, the average stay for a Brazilian tourist in the city was six days compared with three days for the Japanese traveler. 
 The number of Brazilians planning a holiday in New York City is way up as well.
In 1995, the most recent year for which statistics are available, 274,000 people came to New York from Brazil, a 41 percent increase over the previous year. The survey shows that 84 percent of Brazilian tourists stay in a hotel.
All of this did not happen by chance. A few years ago, the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau zeroed in on Brazil as a fertile but untapped market. "We saw an improving economy, and we traveled down there with our wares, meeting with tour operators and travel agents," said Jeanine Moss, spokeswoman for the bureau, a nonprofit organization under contract with New York City to promote tourism.
"There's one other thing that's really great about the Brazilians," Ms. Moss added. "They come in the winter." LISA W. FODERARO

Dollar Falls as Tokyo Official Hints at Intervention, After All

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar fell against leading currencies yesterday after an influential Japanese official suggested that the nation's central bank might sell dollars in the foreign-exchange market if necessary to defend the weakening yen.
Traders were caught off guard by the remarks, from Eisuke Sakakibara, director of the Finance Ministry's international bureau and an architect of Japan's foreign-exchange policy. Other senior finance officials in Japan had been suggesting that the central bank would not intervene. 
 Many traders reacted by selling dollars to lock in profits from a 4.5 percent dollar rise against the yen this month. It was the first drop in the dollar here in nearly a week.
Further strength in the mark also helped undermine the dollar, after a suggestion on Wednesday by the president of the German central bank, Hans Tietmeyer, that the mark's prolonged depreciation against the dollar was nearly over.
Nonetheless, traders said the underlying demand for the dollar remained strong, and many expected it to resume rising. They attributed the selloff after Mr. Sakakibara's comments to a general nervousness over how quickly the dollar had risen in recent weeks.
Late in New York yesterday, the dollar settled at 121.79 yen, down from 122.08 yen on Wednesday. It traded at 1.6368 marks, down from 1.6434. The British pound rose slightly, to $1.6213 from $1.6210.
Mr. Sakakibara's remarks, made during early Asian dealings, overshadowed comments in support of the dollar by other officials. Secretary of the Treasury Robert E. Rubin stressed that the United States' position on the dollar had not changed, and Yasuo Matsushita, governor of Japan's central bank, reiterated that economic recovery there remained mild.
Some traders said the yen's rise might have reflected Japanese investors' conversion of foreign holdings into yen to help cover losses in the stock market at home. The benchmark Nikkei stock index, which has dropped for much of the last month, fell 2.57 percent yesterday.
"The Japanese are pulling money back," said Ron Hudson, vice president for corporate sales at the Royal Bank of Scotland in New York.

HEADLINE: Now Managed Care Cutbacks Mean That All of Us Get to Suffer

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The draconian economics of managed care cuts across class lines, as your Jan. 26 front-page article on the loss of jobs by senior doctors and nurses illustrates.
When the private clinic we use became affiliated with a large, renowned hospital, experienced doctors retired, disheartened by the imposition of unrealistic controls, and computer technicians replaced nurses familiar with patients. 
 Insurance companies require the pharmacist to question physician judgments and confuse patients by offering, for example, a less effective medication. Patients recovering from certain surgeries find their insurance premiums increased from $1,500 to $15,000.
At the hospital, many skilled nurses have been fired, floor nurses fresh from school are hesitant and cheerless, and aides will not perform basic services. The "state of the art" computers and medical equipment are finicky and break down. My records have been lost for a year, and according to the hospital billing service, I am responsible for the fees of an unknown (to me) 8-year-old.
Perhaps now that greater numbers of dedicated professionals and their middle-class patients are suffering the consequences of the dissection of medical care, more people will speak out against the changes.

HEADLINE: Spain's Tangled Labor Scene: Some in Payless Limbo

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: ALCORCON, Spain

 BODY:
Last September, the electrical equipment company where Jose Tabanera has worked for 24 years gave him his last pay envelope.
The company neither dismissed him nor disappeared into bankruptcy. Instead, it consigned Mr. Tabanera and 60 fellow employees, most in their mid-50's, to a peculiarly Spanish kind of limbo where nobody knows for sure how many people are unemployed, but everybody knows it is too many. 
 With either 21.8 percent or 13.8 percent of the labor force unemployed, depending on which set of official figures are used, Spain has more jobless people than any other Western European country.
The conservative minority Government says that strict labor laws that are a legacy of Spain's fascist dictatorship and more than a decade of subsequent Socialist democracy discourage employers from taking on new workers.
Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's Government argues that Spain cannot function in a globally competitive economy or take full advantage of the common European currency planned for 1999 without labor legislation that gives employers and foreign investors more flexibility. It is hoping that talks under way between labor unions and employers will produce suggestions for acceptable change.
"The Government will probably wait two or three months before deciding what to do," said Jordi Pujol, the powerful Catalan regional leader. He said he agreed that change was as necessary as the budget deficit cuts and lower interest rates the Government is encouraging to permit Spain to be part of the common European currency.
American-style layoffs and job-switching do not appear to be in the cards for Spain, said Nicolas Franco, a nephew of the late dictator who is a businessman here. "Longer temporary contracts that gave small, mobile companies more freedom to lay off employees for two years or so would help, and also give young people more security," he said.
In more turbulent times, Gen. Francisco Franco's Government decreed that workers would basically have their jobs for life. After Franco died, democratic Spain, like most of its Continental European counterparts, wrote job security into social legislation.
Mr. Aznar's Socialist predecessor as Prime Minister, Felipe Gonzalez, modified the law to allow companies to bypass the severance pay requirements by hiring younger workers on short-term contracts. The companies do not have to give these workers severance pay when the contracts expire.
One result has been the creation of short-term jobs, about 250,000 of them last year alone. But insecurity about how long they will last adds to the confusion in the labor markets, economists say.
"The official unemployment figures are higher than the real ones," said Prof. Amando de Miguel, a sociologist who does consulting in market research.
One set of Spanish official unemployment figures -- the higher one -- is based on answers to questions by statistical samples of job applicants at Government employment offices.
"People lie," said Carmen Alcaide, an economist for the Banco Bilbao Vizcaya. The Government also reports the number of people actually registered and collecting unemployment benefits -- 2.2 million people in December, or 13.8 percent, a figure not so far out of line with the European Union average of 11 percent, she said.
Offering anecdotal evidence of a lower Spanish unemployment rate, Mr. de Miguel said: "I gave a training course for college-level people last year and accepted 40 students. All of them were officially registered as unemployed, but on the first day of the course only 10 or 12 showed up -- the rest said they didn't realize the course was so time-consuming, and they couldn't take so much time out of their work schedules."
If this is fraud, for the most part the Spanish wink at it rather than get outraged, perhaps because almost everybody these days has a relative who is out of work or looking for it. Jobless students, like Mr. Tabanera's daughter, often live with their parents at home into their late 20's.
"There is a certain optimism that I detect that the economy is going to do better than they thought it was," said Richard N. Gardner, the United States Ambassador to Spain. "Unemployment is coming down, inflation is down, interest rates are low," he said. "There are no beggars on the street. There isn't a crisis atmosphere."
One of Mr. Tabanera's two daughters, Ana Tabanera Mambrilla, said she believed her father's company, Conymon 2000 S.A., was trying to pressure him into quitting so it would not have to make the legally mandatory severance payments.
"Then they could hire younger workers on short-term contracts and pay them less," she said. She is a 23-year-old Madrid University graduate who has not been able to find steady work since obtaining her degree in psychology last June.
Her father and some of his fellow employees turned to their labor union for help in their situation, which is unusual even for Spain. The union has asked a labor court to rule on whether the company has technically dismissed them and has to pay severance anyway.
"If companies can dismiss old people and pay young people nothing, what have we been working for?" complained Mr. Tabanera, a wiry and wizened 55-year-old electrical equipment installer whose take-home pay was $1,000 a month.
Under the Spanish law, a labor court could find that his employer had dismissed him, and force it to pay him up to 45 days' severance pay for every year he worked, or about $48,000, and possibly back pay since September as well.
Until he is declared officially unemployed, Mr. Tabanera cannot collect Government benefits, so he keeps taking the bus to the company's premises in Madrid every day, showing up for the work that is no longer there and hoping to preserve his rights under the law. The company has not told him why it has stopped paying him.
Meanwhile, like families all over Spain, the Tabanera family rallies. Mr. Tabanera's wife makes some money cleaning apartments. Their elder daughter's husband and a neighbor down the hall of their nine-story building here in a working-class suburb of Madrid have given them loans to help them pay off a home improvement loan on the two-bedroom apartment they bought 15 years ago.

One More Time

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
Memo to David Dinkins: It's over.
Like an aging boxer unaware of the degree to which his skills have diminished, Mr. Dinkins is entertaining the idea of climbing into the ring again. He would fight -- and probably win -- a tuneup in the Democratic mayoral primary. He would then go on to be demolished by the current champ. 
 It is hard to believe Mr. Dinkins is serious about this. But there he was yesterday at a crowded midtown press conference, making a campaign-style attack on Rudolph Giuliani and insisting that he -- Mr. Dinkins -- just might make the run. It was clear that the former Mayor was enjoying himself.
A retired politician once told me: "You never get used to being out of the spotlight. When you're on top it's a rush like you wouldn't believe -- adoring crowds, television cameras, your face all over the newspapers. It's incredible. And then you lose, and suddenly it's over. That's very hard to take. It's like a junkie going cold turkey. More than anything, you want to get that rush back."
In New York City there is an additional factor that looms large. Mayors and former mayors, at least in recent years, carry with them at all times a bulging sack of resentments, grudges and fantasies of payback. If you scrapped all the rules and put Ed Koch, David Dinkins and Rudolph Giuliani into a ring together, you would find out what extreme fighting is really like.
Very few people who like and respect Mr. Dinkins think a rerun is a good idea. The former Mayor told The Times's Adam Nagourney that he was being urged by "big fans of mine" to challenge Mr. Giuliani. That's not surprising; it's what big fans do. "You can beat that guy," they say. "He's no match for you. Why don't you take him on?"
It's supposed to make you feel good. If you are David Dinkins at age three score and nine (as he put it yesterday), the correct response to such nonsense is to smile, say thanks and go out and play a few sets of tennis. You're not supposed to be gullible enough to take it seriously.
Now that the story has broken, Mr. Dinkins's biggest fans are asking if he's taken leave of his senses. Not only do they not think he can beat Mr. Giuliani, they think he is unfairly undermining the already slim chance that anybody else can beat him.
"I can't believe this is going anywhere," said a former Dinkins adviser who asked not to be identified. "David hasn't raised any money, he hasn't put a committee together, he had heart surgery a year or two ago, and fairly or unfairly, he is widely perceived to be on the wrong side of the crime issue, which of course is Rudy's great strength. And if he does run, oh boy, Ruth and Freddie and a lot of other Democrats are going to hate him."
Ruth and Freddie are the Manhattan Borough President, Ruth Messinger, and the Bronx Borough President, Fernando Ferrer, who at the moment are the leading Democratic challengers to Mr. Giuliani.
Mr. Dinkins has long felt that he and Mr. Giuliani have been judged by different standards. The former Mayor believes, for example, that he never received the credit he deserved for his "Safe Streets, Safe City" program, which expanded the police force by 6,000 officers and provided funding for beacon schools and other successful youth programs. And he believes that he was unfairly saddled with a reputation for not handling the city's fiscal affairs well.
But that is old business. New Yorkers are benefiting from an improved national economy. Crime statistics have fallen dramatically. And the personal bitterness between Mr. Dinkins and Mr. Giuliani would likely obscure rather than clarify those issues on which Mr. Giuliani should be vulnerable -- education and the delivery of social services, to name two.
At his press conference, Mr. Dinkins described Mr. Giuliani as a "bully" who "rules through fear and intimidation." And he spoke with feeling about Mr. Giuliani's failure to rein in police brutality.
Then the former Mayor hurried off to catch a plane to South Africa.
Mr. Dinkins's friends are already mobilizing, but not for a run for mayor. His closest friends will try, as diplomatically as possible, to talk him out of running. They will try, out of their genuine affection for him, to convince him that it's really over.

HEADLINE: First Lady Re-emerges, With an Aid Plan for Tiny Businesses

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 30

 BODY:
On her own terms and armed with her famously formidable command of policy detail, Hillary Rodham Clinton edged back into the spotlight today -- though the policies seemed smaller than they once did, and the details less liable to send lobbyists to their telephones, or Republicans around the bend.
For the first time in more than two years, Mrs. Clinton met with reporters who cover the White House, answering questions crisply, cheerfully and confidently for half an hour in the Map Room, where Franklin D. Roosevelt monitored the progress of World War II. 
 She was in part reintroducing herself, aides acknowledged, by promoting an embryonic idea with a small-sounding name -- "micro-enterprise" -- that Mrs. Clinton argued would help confront the big issues of poverty and personal growth that she has grappled with for 25 years.
Micro-enterprise "may look like a kind of small issue at first glance," she acknowledged, after describing how tiny loans of a few thousand dollars or even $300 could begin businesses in developing countries, or in the inner cities of the United States.
"But this is a very big idea," Mrs. Clinton continued. "And it's a big idea because it takes governmental catalytic action, that will directly affect some people's lives, but more than that, create a new environment for private economic activity, that could have very long term consequences."
It was not as big an idea, certainly, as changing the entire health care system, an effort that she once commanded for President Clinton, overseeing a staff of 300 economists, health policy experts and Government employees.
But, when asked if her views had changed, Mrs. Clinton, more in amused exasperation than aggravation, declared that she never favored excessive government control.
"I believe in the balance of power," she exclaimed, using a term she has invoked frequently in speeches in recent weeks. "I believe in the balance of power in government, I believe in the balance of power between government and the private sector, I believe in the balance of power between men and women."
She added: "And I think that if you tilt too far one way or the other, you run into trouble."
But while the Hillary Clinton who testified on Capitol Hill about health care was not on display today, neither was the Hillary Clinton of the 1996 Presidential campaign, who shunned reporters and stuck mostly to safe topics and friendly crowds.
Instead, as Mrs. Clinton sat at a long table, which was covered with a white cloth and ringed by about 16 reporters, she spoke easily about transfer payments and capital formation in the inner city and did not hesitate to describe big dreams for a small Federal program to encourage micro-enterprise -- defined as businesses with five employees or fewer.
"What I would hope that would come out of this emphasis on micro-enterprise," she said, "is a greater appreciation in our society at large about the capacities of people at all levels in our country."
The questions clung mostly to Mrs. Clinton's chosen topic, as she intended. But even at the end, when reporters apologetically began to ask her about her role in creating a White House database whose use Congressional Republicans are investigating, her tone remained even and her manner friendly.
With a deliberate absence of fanfare, Mrs. Clinton has been delicately re-emerging as a public promoter of her own ideas and favorite programs since President Clinton was re-elected.
"She's still trying to find her way on what's the best, most comfortable way for her in her public appearances," a senior official said, adding that Mrs. Clinton had had a "historically rough ride" as First Lady.
After meeting with reporters, Mrs. Clinton made her way upstairs to the East Room, to join her husband in presenting the Presidential Awards for Excellence in Micro-enterprise Development. There, Mr. Clinton said: "I'd also like to thank the First Lady for beginning this obsession, almost, that we have with microenterprise."
"Since I became President, we have tried to go national with this micro idea in a very macro way," Mr. Clinton said.
The White House said today that it would seek $125 million from Congress this year for a Treasury Department fund that in part contributes to organizations supporting micro-enterprise. Over five years, Mr. Clinton said, he would ask for $1 billion.
Last year, the White House also sought $125 million for the fund, but Congress appropriated only $45 million.
In the United States, micro-enterprise loans are defined as ones of less than $25,000. Overseas, where the United States extends such credit through the Agency for International Development, the loans run closer to $300. Repayment rates run well over 90 percent, officials said.
Mrs. Clinton said the programs were examples of the Administration's efforts to act as a catalyst. In keeping with her husband's second Inaugural Address, she offered a spirited defense of Government's role -- combining it with a wry disclaimer of her own influence on the subject.
"There will be and continue to be certain functions that I would argue -- speaking only for myself and not anybody else -- that only the Government can do and other functions that only the market can do," she said. "But as with life you will find that much of the rest of it is in this kind of grey middle, and that's where the debate should be."

HEADLINE: Mayors Now and Then;
A Re-election Budget

 BODY:
Running hard for re-election, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has presented a $34 billion spending plan for New York City that eases up on the austerity he has pushed since taking office in 1994. In the next year the Mayor wants to cut taxes, including the sales tax on clothing, and spend more money for schools, police and the environment. This bonanza of crowd-pleasing initiatives is to be financed by increased tax revenues from the city's economic boom and an array of fiscal gimmicks that budget monitors and credit-rating agencies have rightly deplored. Mr. Giuliani's thinking on tax cuts and some spending priorities is sound, though his bookkeeping is not.
Mr. Giuliani followed a familiar pattern for New York City mayors by putting his most painful budget cuts in his early budgets, then offering popular spending and tax programs in an election year. This Mayor enters the campaign, however, blessed with a recovering economy and lower crime and welfare rates. With self-confidence and even humor, he claimed credit for everything favorable that has happened in the city, including this season's 92 percent drop in snowfall. It was a pretty cocky performance, masking the fact that the city's legislative battles in the coming year are likely to be as bruising as they have ever been. 
 A major fight is likely to erupt over his demand that the 8.25 percent city and state sales tax on clothing be eliminated, with Democrats worried about helping the Mayor's re-election drive. If the money is available, however, cutting the sales tax is a good idea. The brief experiment of temporarily dropping the tax earlier this month led to a burst in sales, with some shoppers apparently buying clothes in the city instead of the suburbs, where the tax is lower. The evidence needs to be sifted, but cutting taxes on less expensive clothing is a progressive way of reducing the tax burden and perhaps of creating new retail jobs.
Cutting business and rent taxes for smaller enterprises also makes sense, in theory. But it remains to be seen whether there are enough savings in Mr. Giuliani's proposed budget to justify talk of new tax cuts, including those for clothing. The Mayor's budget, for example, would cut subsidies for municipal hospitals and embrace the Medicaid cuts to hospitals, nursing homes and community health centers proposed by Gov. George Pataki. The Legislature has rejected such cuts in the past and is likely to do so again. Mr. Giuliani also wants the state to increase aid to New York City by advancing revenue-sharing payments from the future into the current fiscal year, the kind of gimmickry that plunged both the city and state into their fiscal crises of two decades ago.
The Mayor's plans call for projecting savings from hundreds of millions of dollars in revenues from dubious sources like sales of assets and rent from the Port Authority for the city's airports. His budget would be balanced further by rolling over the revenue surplus from the current year. Using such one-shot savings to pay for recurring expenses is one of the main reasons the city projects multibillion-dollar deficits into the future, a pattern that this budget fails to break.
Mr. Giuliani's plans are sure to provoke fights in Albany this year over school aid and welfare. In both areas, Governor Pataki's proposed budget punishes the city. Another unfortunate feature of the Mayor's budget is its failure to use the police more efficiently by replacing police officers performing clerical duty with civilians earning lower pay.
Generally, there was too little talk in Mr. Giuliani's budget of demands for more productivity from municipal employees. But of course no mayor likes to stir up city workers at election time. As campaign budgets go, this one was predictably political in places, but also marked with flashes of creativity.

HEADLINE: Salinas Speaks Out, About Plot, Brother and Regrets

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Jan. 30

 BODY:
Former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari broke a long silence this week, detailing his views on the political mayhem and economic chaos that marked the end of his six-year tenure and converted him into one of the most vilified presidents in Mexican history.
Mr. Salinas's statements, apparently an effort to regain some measure of public esteem by vigorously defending his own record, were his most extensive since he left office in December 1994 and went into exile three months later. 
Mr. Salinas, who now lives in Ireland, made his remarks in a lengthy interview in Boston with Ramon Alberto Garza, executive editor of the jointly owned newspapers Reforma of Mexico City and El Norte of Monterrey. The papers published transcripts of Mr. Salinas's statements on Wednesday and today. The final installment is to be published Friday.
In the interview, Mr. Salinas made these points:
*He described a conspiracy by a clique of senior politicians from his governing party in the days after the 1994 assassination of Mexico's leading presidential contender to impose a replacement candidate allied with their interests.
*He acknowledged his failure to supervise his brother Raul, who transferred more than $100 million into foreign accounts, but insisted he has no idea where the money came from.
*He repeated his belief in Raul's innocence on murder charges.
*He said he misses Mexico and intends to return.
Mr. Salinas, whose Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI, has controlled Mexico's authoritarian system since the late 1920's, defended the electoral and free-market reforms he carried out between 1988 and 1994.
Those changes, which led to the North American Free Trade Agreement, hurt many PRI officials, and those whose business and other interests were harmed saw in Luis Donaldo Colosio, Mr. Salinas's choice to succeed him, a champion of further change, he said in the interview. Mr. Colosio was shot to death at a rally in Tijuana on March 23, 1994.
"If until now the investigation has not produced elements to prove there was a plot to assassinate Luis Donaldo, I nevertheless believe there was a plot to impose his replacement," Mr. Salinas said. "And those that promoted it appear to be continuing without rest in their tremendous struggle for power."
Once before, in a public letter released in December 1995, Mr. Salinas referred to a conspiracy he said he had first perceived shortly after Mr. Colosio's killing. In the interview he provided new details, describing how the assassination nearly overwhelmed his Government and rocked the country financially.
"In the dawn, we had to convoke an emergency meeting of the economic cabinet," Mr. Salinas said. "During more than a week we had the highest levels of capital flight in our history."
"And in the middle of this personal and national tragedy and the financial danger, a political struggle broke out to occupy Luis Donaldo's place," he said. "That was probably Mexico's most delicate political crisis in more than 60 years."
Hours after the assassination, Mr. Salinas said, former President Luis Echeverria, whose rule from 1970 to 1976 was devoted to extending state control of the economy, appeared suddenly at the presidential palace and proposed Emilio Gamboa, then the Secretary of Communications and Transport, as a candidate to replace Mr. Colosio.
Other politicians allied with Mr. Echeverria, Mr. Salinas said, carried on an "intense offensive" to promote another PRI candidate he did not name. A third group fought to prevent Mr. Salinas from choosing Ernesto Zedillo, who nonetheless was nominated and elected.
When Mr. Salinas first referred to a conspiracy in December 1995, Mr. Echeverria ridiculed the theory, describing himself as a grandfather incapable of coordinating a conspiracy. "I don't coordinate anybody, not even my children," he said.
In Mexico's political system, presidents have been all-powerful while occupying the executive palace but are expected to fade away quietly when they leave office. These rules have been eroding, however, and Mr. Salinas's latest statements have provided a striking example of that.
Raul Salinas is imprisoned here on charges of financial wrongdoing and accusations that he was the mastermind behind the slaying in 1994 of Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, the PRI's No. 2 official, whom prosecutors have described as a rival to the Salinas brothers. The former President reiterated his belief in Raul's innocence on the murder charges.
In a development unrelated to Mr. Salinas's published interview, Mexican prosecutors questioned Mr. Salinas for 16 hours in Dublin on Monday about the Ruiz Massieu killing, but have released no information about his statements. In November, prosecutors questioned him about the Colosio assassination.
Questioned in the newspaper interview about Raul's vast foreign deposits, Mr. Salinas repeated assertions that he knew nothing about them during his presidency, but moved further toward acknowledging apparent wrongdoing.
"My brother Raul's behavior has profoundly hurt me, my siblings, and my Government," Mr. Salinas said. "Above all, it has hurt the public."
"I can assure you that whatever their origin, those funds have no relation with any action taken in my administration through my direct decisions or instructions," he said.
"I never tried to review his personal finances," he said. "Now I lament that."
After Raul's arrest in February 1995, Mr. Salinas criticized the detention, and when the former President left Mexico days later, presidential aides said Mr. Zedillo had ordered him into exile. But this week an adviser to Mr. Zedillo said that, like any other citizen, Mr. Salinas was free to come and go.
Mr. Salinas said that since he left Mexico he has lived in the United States and Montreal as well as in Ireland, and that last year he and his wife, a former aide, traveled to Cuba for the birth of their child.
"If the daughter of an ex-President of Mexico could not be born in Mexico because of the atmosphere of persecution that has been whipped up against me, she should be born in a country with dignified people who love their sovereignty," he said.
He acknowledged that he misses Mexico. "I'll come back," he said.

HEADLINE: Groundbreaking Near for Trump Project, Despite Upper West Side Objections

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
With several of New York City's long-dormant projects springing to life in Times Square, Columbus Circle and elsewhere, one of its biggest and most contested real estate ventures, Donald J. Trump's plan for a small new city along the Hudson River, is about to take the form of bricks and mortar.
Mr. Trump received a building permit this week to break ground on the first of 16 apartment towers that are to be part of the project, called Riverside South. It would cover 75 acres along the Hudson River between 59th and 72d Streets. Mr. Trump said construction would begin within a week. 
 The first building, a 46-story, 377-unit condominium tower between 69th and 70th Streets, east of the West Side Highway, cleared its biggest hurdle in December, when the Department of Environmental Protection issued a permit for it to be connected to the North River Sewage Treatment Plant, despite protests that it would overburden the plant.
The groundbreaking will be a turning point in what might be New York City's longest development dispute, pitting the fervent political activism of Upper West Side community groups against a series of ambitious developers who have coveted the Hudson River property, now controlled by Mr. Trump, since the 1960's.
Now, with construction set to begin, many West Side residents are resigned to accepting some, but not all, of Mr. Trump's plan. When completed, the Riverside South complex is to include 5,700 apartments.
As is his frequent pattern, Mr. Trump has received financial commitments from outside investors, in this case Asians, for almost all of the project's cost. The project is expected to take at least 10 years to complete, depending on demand for the apartments. But because of the city's improving economy and tight housing market, that timetable might be shortened.
"People on the West Side still do not want to accept this project, but it seems clear that Trump is going to build," said Ronnie M. Eldridge, the City Councilwoman whose district includes Riverside South. She has long opposed Mr. Trump's plan.
The biggest question confronting the project now is over the future of the recently rebuilt section of the West Side Highway that passes on elevated pilings between the Hudson River and the lower floors of the buildings planned by Mr. Trump.
Despite the protests of many on the Upper West Side, a political fight over the highway appeared to be resolved last year when Representative Jerrold L. Nadler succeeded in cutting off Federal funds for environmental studies that might have led to reconstruction of the highway.
The intent was to rebuild it under Riverside Drive, removing the elevated section of pavement, and opening the land beneath it for a park with unimpeded views of the Hudson.
"People will make an effort to revive it, but they will fail," Mr. Nadler said.
Efforts to resurrect the highway project are expected to reach a high point by Feb. 24, the deadline for Congress to submit transportation projects to be considered for Federal funding.
"It is an uphill fight, but I don't know how anyone would want to try to explain to people on the Upper West Side how they got Donald Trump and not a decent park," said Richard Kahan, a Manhattan lawyer who led an unusual coalition -- the Municipal Arts Society, the Parks Council and others -- that worked with Mr. Trump to create the current Riverside South plan, which until last year was to have included the highway reconstruction project.

HEADLINE: A Gentler Budget as Giuliani Faces an Election Year

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
Bucking the trend of state governments around the country that have chosen to bank much of their tax windfalls, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani presented a financial plan yesterday that would spend more than half of next year's surplus on tax cuts and new education programs.
This shift in his budget priorities coincides with the year of his re-election campaign, though he dismissed any suggestion that the two events could be related. 
 Nonetheless, the choices laid out by the Mayor in his four-year plan will have unmistakable political effects at a time when he is under attack from his Democratic challengers for having cut too much in years past. Fiscal monitors disagree on whether he is saving enough now. But there is no dispute that Mr. Giuliani has placed deficit reduction far lower on his agenda than in his first three years in office. In its place, he is now talking about "critically important" areas of new spending.
"In prior years we basically had to spend a great deal of attention on how to straighten out the huge increases in spending that had been built into the financial plan of the city," he said. "And in this financial plan we had a different challenge, which is, how do we deal with the fact that we now have what are substantial surpluses?"
As the Mayor pointed out, 42 percent of the $1.2 billion in new money he now has available will be used to reduce the city's budget gap. The remaining 58 percent will be spent this way: $442 million in new programs for education and law enforcement, and $250 million given back to taxpayers in the form of reduced sales taxes on clothing, commercial rent taxes and unincorporated business taxes -- assuming the Legislature agrees.
That contrasts with the decisions made by many states around the country that have had similar-sized surpluses in recent years due to the rebounding economy. National surveys have shown that while some states have let money trickle back to residents through tax cuts, most are salting away the larger part of the money in the face of uncertain Federal aid and fear that the boom may not last.
"It's a cardinal rule that you don't raise spending or cut taxes with revenues you can't count on year after year," said Raymond B. Horton, president of the Citizens' Budget Committee, a business-financed watchdog group. "But perhaps the Mayor believes we have entered an era when stock markets always go up." With the city having faced bankruptcy in the 1970's, and still showing a $2.5 billion gap in the year 2001, Mr. Horton said, it should not spend money so freely.
Douglas A. Criscitello, director of the city's newly formed Independent Budget Office, warned that if the economy turned sour, the city would suddenly face life with a reduced base of revenues due to the tax cuts.
Yesterday, however, the Mayor was very clearly saying that deficit reduction had its limits. Though he proposed $550 million in new cuts, that number is likely to shrink later in the year, and in any event pales in comparison with the $7 billion in projected spending he had previously cut.
Over the last three years student reading scores have declined and children are increasingly squeezed into overcrowded schools, events that have coincided with $1.2 billion in cuts to projected school spending by Mr. Giuliani. His challengers are trying to link him to deficiencies in the schools. But with his new budget proposal, the Mayor is proposing to spend $500 million on new classroom space, and $125 million on new reading instruction.
At the very least, the Mayor can now face a debating opponent later this year and point to the large new checks he has written, while opponents work to remind voters of previous years of cuts. And the Mayor will also be able to cite compliments he is now receiving from advocacy groups that have in the past been quite critical.
"The city's solvency is still key, but the Mayor has come to recognize how important education is to the quality of life and the future solvency of the city," said Gail B. Nayowith, executive director of the Citizens' Committee for Children of New York. "Whether it's a political choice or a decision he's come to after a lot of soul searching, it doesn't matter, because it has to be done. The schools are in miserable shape, and we've waited entirely too long."
Government largesse, either in the form of spending programs or tax cuts, is commonplace when elections approach, even from elected officials known to be abstemious. Though municipal spending has actually risen during his term, Mr. Giuliani had become so closely identified with budget cuts that he was the subject of charges that city services or children were suffering as a result of his actions.
In that sense, the new financial plan shows just how fortunate the Mayor has been that the economy began to bloom just when he needed it most. Without the new revenues -- $712 million of which come from increased tax collections -- it would be difficult to justify the tax cuts, and the new spending probably would not be so generous. Aides to Mr. Giuliani say they had originally calculated that the economy would accelerate much earlier in his term, which might have made the spending programs seem a bit less political than they do this year.
But a Mayor who would take credit for this year's mild winter -- as Mr. Giuliani joked yesterday -- was not about to concede that good luck had anything to do with the windfall. Without the cuts he had made earlier, he said, the city would never even have noticed the surplus.
"Luck," he said, paraphrasing Branch Rickey, "is very often the residue of design."

HEADLINE: Wall Street Sends the City a Windfall

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY 

 BODY:
The preliminary budget Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani released yesterday not only provides a guide to his spending priorities in fiscal 1998, but it also offers New Yorkers an insight into the city's economy and a quick refresher course on how a banner year on Wall Street produces a windfall for City Hall.
The Mayor's $32.9 billion plan for the fiscal year that begins on July 1 includes more than $450 million in unanticipated tax revenue resulting entirely from the record profits on Wall Street last year. Of that amount, $391 million is already in city coffers, and the city expects to collect at least $60 million more by the end of 1997. 
 New York City's revenue from the personal income tax and the corporate business tax can surge or fall dramatically depending on the kind of year Wall Street has.
Personal income tax revenue is expected to rise to $4.17 billion in the current fiscal year from $3.9 billion in the 1996 fiscal year. City officials attributed most of the $265 million increase to income taxes on the multimillion-dollar bonuses that hundreds of Wall Street executives received at the end of 1996 and to taxes on capital gains.
General corporation tax revenue is expected to increase to $1.36 billion this fiscal year from $1.2 billion in the 1996 fiscal year. Much of that $155 million increase has flowed directly from Wall Street profits.
During his briefing on the preliminary budget yesterday, Mr. Giuliani stressed that while Wall Street's boom created a windfall, the city had been enjoying a steady economic recovery ever since 1992. He said that tourism and retail sales also rose last year and that 24,000 jobs were created in 1996.
"We had a better year last year than we anticipated," he said. "But the growth is also a product of design, because all of those increases would have been absolutely wiped out if the city had remained on the course that was set for the city on the day that my administration took office."
Rosemary Scanlon, the Deputy State Comptroller for New York City, said that despite the strong economy the city enjoyed last year, its job growth lagged behind that in the rest of the country.
The city's unemployment rate was 8.6 percent in 1996, significantly higher than the national rate of 5.4 percent, Ms. Scanlon said.
"That tells us that while the income yield has been very good in the city, primarily because of Wall Street, job growth is still very sluggish and we're still not generating enough jobs to bring down the unemployment rate," she said.
Security industry profits topped $11 billion in 1996, twice what the Giuliani administration forecast a year ago. City Hall aides said the Mayor's plan for fiscal 1998 contains conservative projections for all sources of tax revenue.
Fiscal monitors and economists yesterday applauded the Mayor's estimates, noting that his are more conservative than those of Gov. George E. Pataki.
"We'll be looking at this more closely, but it looks like a very sensible forecast for the outlook on Wall Street," said Ms. Scanlon.
"New York is as heavily dependent on Wall Street as Houston is on oil and Seattle is on Boeing. And over the years we've had plenty of reminders of how highly volatile Wall Street is."

HEADLINE: Greenspan Urges Action to Curb Cost-of-Living Rises in Benefits

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 30

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, urged Congress today to move quickly to limit cost-of-living increases for Social Security and other Federal benefits. In doing so, he waded directly into one of the most politically sensitive issues facing the Government.
Mr. Greenspan said the Labor Department should speed its efforts to fix a range of shortcomings in its main measure of inflation, the Consumer Price Index, that have led, according to estimates by some economists, to overstating increases in the cost of living by about one percentage point. But in the meantime, Mr. Greenspan said, Congress should establish an independent national commission to set more accurate cost-of-living increases. That would avoid payment of what are seen as overly generous benefits to Social Security recipients and others whose annual increases are tied to the inflation index. 
 Over time, putting a brake on cost-of-living increases could save the Government hundreds of billions of dollars and make it easier to balance the budget without cutting other programs. But it would do so by every month giving a little less money than now planned to tens of millions of voters who receive checks from the Federal Government.
"This type of approach would have the benefit of being objective, nonpartisan and sufficiently flexible to take full account of the latest information," Mr. Greenspan told the Senate Finance Committee.
Mr. Greenspan's suggestion for a commission revived an idea he had proposed two years ago, before the issue had any political visibility. It was immediately embraced by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, the committee's ranking Democrat, and aides said it intrigued some Republicans, including the panel's chairman, Senator William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware.
Mr. Greenspan's stature provides some political cover for members of both parties who support revising the price index downward but fear the outcry from the elderly and other benefit recipients. Labor unions and the American Association for Retired Persons have already expressed opposition. Nonetheless, Mr. Greenspan's strong advocacy for the proposal could help its prospects in negotiations between Congress and the White House over how to balance the budget and could also offer a mechanism to extend the long-term solvency of Social Security.
Asked about Mr. Greenspan's call for a commission, the White House press secretary, Michael D. McCurry, said the Federal Reserve chairman would be "an influential voice" in the debate over how to address the issue. The Clinton Administration has said it is open to considering a change in the price index, but only if there is a consensus among economists about how to proceed.
Some Republicans said they were considering introducing a nonbinding "Sense of the Senate" resolution in the next few weeks calling for an improved measure of inflation. They said the vaguely worded resolution would be a first step in gauging how much support could be mustered for a change with which neither party wants to be closely identified.
The Administration also said today that it would propose increasing funds for the Bureau of Labor Statistics by $2 million next year and $7 million to $10 million for each of the succeeding six years for additional research into the price Index. The bureau now spends $40 million a year administering the index.
Katharine G. Abraham, the Commissioner of Labor Statistics, told the Senate Budget Committee that the increased funds, amounting to $55.1 million over seven years, would allow the agency "to speed up the process" of updating and expanding the price index to achieve a better approximation of changes in the cost of living. The bureau has always said that the Consumer Price Index is not a pure measure of inflation and should not be used to set Federal benefit payments. But it has taken on that role anyway, and it also adjusts tax brackets, private employment contracts and other transactions.
Mr. Greenspan has said publicly for years that he believes the Consumer Price Index overstates inflation. Last week he told the Senate Budget Committee that research by the Federal Reserve concluded that the overstatement was around one percentage point a year, roughly the same conclusion reached by a Congressionally appointed panel of economists last month.
That panel, headed by Michael J. Boskin, a Stanford University economist, said the overstatement would cost the Government hundreds of billions of dollars over the next 12 years in more generous benefit payments and smaller tax collections.
The Boskin report said that inflation was being overstated by 1.1 percentage points. Social Security payments for this year are being calculated on a 2.9 percent increase in the cost of living. If that increase was 1.1 percentage points lower, the average monthly payment, now $724, would go to $737 rather than to $745 -- a difference of $96 a year.
In his statements today, Mr. Greenspan appeared to be making his most concerted effort yet to put his reputation as a tough-minded apolitical policy maker behind a revision of the price index.
Urging senators to ignore criticism that tinkering with the price index would be viewed as a "political fix" to a technical problem, Mr. Greenspan argued that failure to address the overstatement of inflation would be a decision to ignore overwhelming evidence that the nation was overpaying benefit recipients.
"There is almost a 100 percent probability that we are overcompensating the average Social Security recipient for increases in the cost of living," Mr. Greenspan said, "and almost a 100 percent probability that we are causing the inflation-adjusted burden of the income tax system to decline more rapidly than I presume Congress intends."
Asked who should serve on an independent commission, Mr. Greenspan said he would "tend to choose academics who clearly have no evident interest in the outcome."
Congressional aides said it was unclear what consideration the Senate and the House might give to the idea of a commission. Mr. Moynihan, one of the leading proponents of revising the price index, said he intended to discuss the idea with Mr. Roth. Republican aides said Mr. Roth was interested in a commission but was concerned that it would take too long to establish.

HEADLINE: GOVERNORS OPPOSE CLINTON PROPOSAL FOR MEDICAID CAP

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 30

 BODY:
The National Governors' Association has decided to oppose President Clinton's plan to set firm limits on Federal Medicaid spending, contending that it would saddle states with more of the cost of providing health care to poor people, state officials said today.
Mr. Clinton says such limits are needed to impose fiscal discipline on the Medicaid program, which finances care for 37 million people. 
 But in a confidential draft of their new policy, the governors say: "Any unilateral Federal cap on the Medicaid program will shift costs to state and local governments that they simply cannot afford. The governors adamantly oppose a cap on Federal Medicaid spending in any form."
The governors' views are significant because state and local governments pay 42 percent of Medicaid costs: $67 billion of $159 billion last year.
The bipartisan opposition to a Federal cap represents a political setback for Mr. Clinton's Medicaid proposal, a major element of his plan to balance the Federal budget by 2002. But Republicans on Capitol Hill said they would seriously consider the proposal because it was one of the few sure ways for the Federal Government to achieve substantial Medicaid savings.
The governors open their winter meeting here on Saturday, and debates over Medicaid and welfare are expected to dominate the four-day session.
Leaders of the association sent a copy of their Medicaid recommendations to the White House today, in the hope of influencing Mr. Clinton's budget, which will be made public next week.
The Medicaid policy was developed by a panel of six governors including Bob Miller of Nevada, a Democrat who is chairman of the National Governors' Association, and George V. Voinovich of Ohio, a Republican who is vice chairman. "It is our expectation that our recommendations will be formally adopted as N.G.A. policy," they said in letters sent today to Mr. Clinton and Congressional leaders.
The governors have drafted a separate policy urging Congress to restore some of the benefits taken away from legal immigrants by the new welfare law. But Republican Congressional leaders have repeatedly said that they do not intend to make major changes in the law this year.
Among the states that would be most severely affected by a cap on Federal Medicaid spending is New York, which has one of the nation's most generous and costly Medicaid programs. It has more cases of AIDS than any other state. The cost of care is higher for them than for other Medicaid recipients and is likely to rise faster than the Federal cap, as AIDS patients seek treatment with expensive new drugs. In addition, New York has many teaching hospitals, which treat patients with complex, costly illnesses.
Mr. Clinton's proposal for a limits on Federal Medicaid spending is opposed not only by the governors, but also by a wide range of consumer groups and advocates, including the AIDS Action Council, the Alzheimer's Association, Catholic Charities USA, the Children's Defense Fund, Consumers Union and Families USA.
Half of Medicaid recipients are children, but more than two-thirds of Medicaid outlays are for people who are elderly or disabled.
Since its creation in 1965, Medicaid has been an open-ended program, providing health insurance to poor people who meet eligibility criteria set by Federal and state laws. While preserving the entitlement, Mr. Clinton would, for the first time, impose a firm limit on Federal Medicaid spending, to guarantee that per-capita Medicaid costs rise no faster than the nation's per-capita economic output.
Mr. Clinton's proposal would limit the financial obligations of the Federal Government, but not the states'. State officials worry that they will have to pick up many costs now covered by the Federal Government. Advocates for children, elderly and the disabled worry that states will cut services, reduce coverage of fast-growing benefits like prescription drugs or use cheap, low-quality nursing homes and health maintenance organizations.
As they arrive in Washington, the governors also bring a new perspective to the debate over Medicare, the Federal health insurance program for people who are elderly or disabled. They express concern that Congress and the Administration will solve Medicare's fiscal problems, too, by shifting costs to the states.
Medicare and Medicaid are usually viewed as separate programs. But the governors point out that the programs are intertwined, so that when the Federal Government cuts Medicare payments to hospitals and health maintenance organizations or increases premiums for Medicare beneficiaries, states incur new costs.
Medicaid fills the gaps in Medicare coverage for elderly people with low incomes. Six million people are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, state Medicaid programs must pay Medicare premiums and the patients' share of medical bills for any Medicare beneficiaries with incomes below the Federal poverty level ($9,491 a year for an elderly couple).
President Clinton says a cap is needed to make sure Medicaid costs never again explode as they did in the late 1980's and early 1990's. But the governors, in the draft of their new policy, say they "have already contributed to significant budgetary savings by controlling Medicaid growth rates."
Federal spending on Medicaid, which increased an average of 15 percent a year from 1985 to 1995, rose only 3.3 percent last year. The Congressional Budget Office has radically reduced its estimate of future Medicaid costs, but says that without any change in Federal law, the program will still grow 7.8 percent a year in the next five years, much faster than the economy or the rest of the Federal budget.
In the draft of their new Medicaid policy, the governors make these points:
*States should be allowed to require Medicaid recipients to get their health care through H.M.O.'s. Under current law, states must seek permission from the Federal Government whenever they want to impose such a requirement.
*Congress should repeal the Federal law that guarantees "reasonable and adequate" payments to hospitals and nursing homes treating Medicaid patients. Health care providers, who have filed many successful lawsuits to enforce this requirement, should not be allowed to sue states in disputes over reimbursement.
*States support President Clinton's efforts to make sure that all children eligible for Medicaid are enrolled. But the Federal Government must not do anything that encourages private employers to provide less health insurance for children.
The governors give several examples of how changes in Medicare may shift costs to the states. If the Federal Government reduces Medicare payments to H.M.O.'s, as President Clinton has proposed, health plans will be less likely to offer prescription drug benefits, and state Medicaid programs must "assume the cost of providing this important benefit," the governors said.

HEADLINE: Claims for Jobless Benefits Rise by 10,000

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 30

 BODY:
First-time claims for jobless benefits increased by 10,000 last week, the second consecutive jump after the steepest drop in six months.
The Labor Department said today that applications for unemployment insurance totaled a seasonally adjusted 351,000, the highest since 366,000 during the week that ended on Jan. 4. 
 New claims rose by 20,000, to 341,000, during the week ended Jan. 18, and many analysts had expected them to decline last week. After reaching 366,000 during the week ended Jan. 4, claims plunged by 45,000 a week later, the biggest drop since July.
Analysts have attributed some of the volatility to year-end problems adjusting the data for seasonal variations.
The four-week moving average of new weekly jobless claims fell by 5,500, to 344,750, last week, the lowest since 343,500 during the period that ended on Dec. 21. Many analysts track the less volatile four-week average.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Budget to Spend Millions On Trailers for Crowded Schools

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani unveiled a preliminary budget for New York City yesterday that includes $500 million to lessen overcrowding in the public schools. Much of the money would be spent on customized trailers and other prefabricated buildings to create places for 40,000 students in the aging and overburdened system.
The proposal comes as the Board of Education is wrestling with sharp growth in enrollment that has forced some schools to hold classes in bathrooms and other makeshift locations. 
 The Mayor's overcrowding plan was part of a budget package that also called for $550 million in cuts at municipal agencies, the largest of which is a $115 million reduction at the Health and Hospitals Corporation, which runs the municipal hospital system.
He would also cut $58 million from social services, $81 million from the Correction Department, $12 million from the Transportation Department and $42 million from the Police Department, although the size of the force is not expected to be affected.
City officials have already allocated almost $4 billion for the repair and construction of schools in the next four years. But with the number of students rising by 20,000 a year in a system that has 1.1 million, they concede that they must pursue stopgap measures until new buildings are finished.
The 40,000-seat increase would represent a significant rise in temporary housing in the system, which until now had only 5,000 such spaces. Still, at the beginning of the school year in September, the school system had 91,000 more students than seats.
The $500 million would also help pay for 20,000 more seats that would be created through renovations, the leasing of buildings and the purchase of air-conditioners so schools can stay open in the summer.
About half of the $500 million is new money the Mayor is adding to the city's capital budget, officials said. The rest is funds that he had planned to spend in 1999 and 2000 but is instead moving up to use in the current year and the 1998 fiscal year, which begins on July 1.
"We have given a substantial priority to the Board of Education," Mr. Giuliani said at a news conference called to present his election-year budget. The Mayor's Democratic rivals have attacked his record on education, saying that he has neglected the public schools.
The preliminary budget is an overview of the city's finances for the next fiscal year, as well as the three years after that. After receiving comments from the public and other officials, the Mayor by law files his formal, or executive, budget in May.
Even as he hopes to increase spending on education and cut taxes, the Mayor is asking for budget cuts in addition to the $115 million he wants to take from the Health and Hospitals Corporation. The Mayor said that though tax revenues had grown steadily in recent months, there was still waste at some city agencies.
If recent history is a guide, Mr. Giuliani will probably not get all of the $550 million in cuts. The release of details about the preliminary budget begins an annual ritual at City Hall: the Republican Mayor calls for reductions, knowing that the Democratic-controlled Council will restore some of them before approving the budget and thereby demonstrate that it had some influence in the budget-making process.
In fact, almost as if by script, a few minutes after Mr. Giuliani finished presenting his spending plan at the news conference, the Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, was denouncing some of the cuts and emphasizing that the Council would play a role in fashioning the budget.
"There is still a lot of pain" in the budget, Mr. Vallone said.
The reductions proposed by the Mayor represent the starkest part of a spending plan that is generally less grim than the budgets he put forth in the first three years of his tenure. Tax revenues have jumped sharply, largely because of the strong performance of Wall Street.
Still, Mr. Giuliani's potential Democratic rivals for the fall election quickly pounced on the preliminary budget, pointing to it as evidence of what they contended was the Mayor's fiscal mismanagement and coldhearted priorities. They focused in particular on his calls for spending to lessen overcrowding and to bolster reading, arts and computer programs in the school system.
Ruth W. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President, said that no matter what the Mayor proposed, his education record was still poor. She asserted that even as the Mayor was trumpeting the money for temporary classrooms, spending to build new schools had been delayed because of mistakes by his administration.
"This Mayor has left a trail of broken promises," Ms. Messinger said.
The Mayor yesterday also fleshed out plans that he had first given details about on Wednesday. He proposed cutting $250 million in taxes, including the city's share of the 8.25 percent sales tax on clothing under $500. Over all, he called for the city to spend about one-half of 1 percent more than it did last year -- the first increase that he has proposed in a preliminary budget since he became Mayor.
The total amount of the budget was $32.9 billion, which should rise to at least $34 billion, because of accounting rules, when he presents the final budget in May, the Mayor said.
Fiscal monitors, who roundly criticized the Mayor's preliminary budget last year, were divided over his new plan, with some contending that he had allocated too much for spending and tax cuts and should have saved more.
But some of the state officials who oversee the city's budget said the Mayor had generally done a competent job of shaping it. Even H. Carl McCall, the State Comptroller and a longtime critic of the Mayor's budget policies, praised him, saying his preliminary budget focused more attention on the city's long-term problems than in the past.
Mr. McCall said, "He clearly recognizes and is attempting to address what I and the other monitors have long said: the city's health demands long-term care and not simply a Band-Aid approach."
But Mr. McCall and other budget experts also cautioned that the city's faced several dangers. It must grapple with projected deficits in 2000 and 2001 that are estimated to range from $2 billion to $3 billion. And if the State Legislature does not approve several bills, the underpinnings of the budget could crumble.
The city, for example, will soon reach the limit on its debt outstanding set by the State Constitution, preventing it from selling bonds to finance its $14 billion capital budget. It has asked the Legislature to approve a bill that will allow it to avoid the limit. If that does not happen, it will have to postpone an array of projects, including the $500 million package intended to lessen school overcrowding.
The Legislature is also considering extending a 12.5 percent surcharge on the city's personal income tax, a bill that both Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Vallone support. The surcharge, which is largely used to finance salaries of police officers, gives the city about $500 million a year.
If the Legislature approves those plans, as the Mayor has been urging, this budget will probably be less rocky than Mr. Giuliani's earlier ones.
"I think that he has made sound choices, given his priorities and given the economic environment," said Robert A. Kurtter, a vice president at Moody's Investors Service. "He has invested resources in strengthening the financial plan and also invested resources in the city. The plan is not without its flaws and weaknesses, but our view at this point is that those risks are manageable."

HEADLINE: Bill on Deficit Clears Panel Buts Hits Snag

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 30

 BODY:
The Senate Judiciary Committee today approved a constitutional amendment that would require a balanced Federal budget, but the eventual prospects for the amendment may have dimmed.
Two Democratic Senators on whose votes the Republican proponents of the amendment had relied for the two-thirds majority needed for Senate approval said at the Judiciary Committee meeting that they might vote against it on the floor without substantial changes. 
 The two, Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware and Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey, voted for an almost identical amendment two years ago, Mr. Biden in the Senate and Mr. Torricelli when he was in the House.
But today they advocated changes including the exclusion of Social Security from deficit calculations and the creation of a separate capital budget to allow borrowing for "physical infrastructure that provides long-term economic benefits."
A Republican staff assistant who has been keeping track of probable votes said it would be difficult if not impossible to reach the 67-vote threshold if Mr. Biden and Mr. Torricelli voted "no." All 55 Republican senators plan to vote for the amendment, which means 12 Democratic votes will be necessary.
Mr. Torricelli said in an interview that he was trying to put pressure on Republicans to open negotiations.
The amendment's chief Republican sponsor, Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, who heads the Judiciary Committee, said the changes suggested by the two Senators would open "big loopholes" he could never accept.
The panel approved the amendment today in a 13-to-5 vote. It would require the budget to be balanced by early in the next century and every year afterward unless the Senate and House voted by three-fifths majorities to waive the requirement.
Mr. Biden and Mr. Torricelli were among those who voted for the amendment. But they said they could vote differently on the floor.
Many Democrats, as long as they are not identified, acknowledge that the issue of excluding Social Security from budget calculations is something of a Trojan horse.
The latest Congressional Budget Office calculations show that without counting Social Security, which now runs a large surplus, the lawmakers would have to find an additional $465 billion in tax increases or spending cuts over the next five years. As a practical matter, that would make it impossible to balance the budget early in the next century.
But politically, few other issues carry so much weight; no politician wants to be seen as jeopardizing Social Security. Proposals like those of Mr. Biden and Mr. Torricelli allow lawmakers to say that they favor a balanced budget amendment but want to make sure Social Security is not at risk. President Clinton, who opposes the amendment, said in a letter to lawmakers on Wednesday that it could put the elderly at risk.
In the House, where a close vote is also expected, a small group of Republicans called a news conference today to advocate excluding Social Security from the calculations.
Democrats held a news conference to advertise a letter signed by more than 1,000 economists warning that an amendment could make recessions worse and restrict necessary Government borrowing.

HEADLINE: Index Funds Are Next Best Thing to Luck

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 "Riding Wall St. on Autopilot: Indexed Funds Draw Investors" (front page, Jan. 28) leaves out a few points about index investing.
The theory behind an index fund, which is a mutual fund designed to mimic the performance of the stock market, is that a stock is worth what the market says it is worth at any given moment. The market takes account of all the information available about it and about the broad economy. Individual stocks seem to move with the market in the absence of information about them (plus some random movement that accounts for inexplicable short-term price variations). 
An individual can only do better than the market by acting on inside information or by luck. Not many individuals can claim either, and that includes the managers of actively managed funds.
The risk from buying an individual stock arises because of variations in its performance. The risk can be reduced by diversification; hence the idea of investing in the market as a whole: an index fund. If market risk is still thought too high, some assets can be invested in Treasury bills, the lowest-risk securities.
The high rate of return from index funds comes from the growth of the economy and of corporate profits.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bonds Rise On Jobs and Factory Data

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Treasury securities traded higher yesterday for the third consecutive session after reports suggested the economy might be slowing enough to keep inflation benign and the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates.
The price of the 30-year bond rose 15/32, to 95 13/32. The yield was 6.86 percent, down from 6.90 percent on Wednesday. 
 Bond prices received an earlier lift when the Labor Department reported that initial claims for unemployment benefits for the week ended Saturday rose 10,000, to 351,000, after a revised increase of 20,000 the week before. Analysts' expectations were for a gain of 8,000. The report eased concerns that recent signs of robust economic growth would prompt the Fed to raise short-term rates.
Speculation that foreign central banks were buying 5- and 10-year notes also bolstered prices, as did a private survey showing that factories in the United States saw a decline in shipments, new orders and production in January. The APIC/ Evans Economics Business Outlook fell to 45.6, from 51.8 in December. Analysts note that a reading below 50 suggests manufacturing is unchanged or declining.
Market participants also took some solace from testimony by Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, before the Senate Finance Committee, because his comments focused on changing the Consumer Price Index rather than on the state of the economy. Fed policy makers will begin a two-day meeting on Tuesday.
Jack Ablin, director of fixed income and senior fund manager at the Private Bank of the Bank of Boston, said Mr. Greenspan did not disclose anything in his testimony.
Dealers and pension funds were in the market yesterday but were trading in low volume, and retail buyers stayed mostly out of the way, some analysts said.
Market participants are now divided into two groups, Mr. Ablin said. One group does not appear to fear inflation and sees economic activity under control. The other includes technical traders who buy and sell on variables like prices, volume and price movement, and who are worried about the relationship of stocks to bonds and foreign participation. The market is oversold in the near term as it waits for the employment report next week, Mr. Ablin said.
The market must contend today with the first real look at fourth-quarter gross domestic product, the Chicago Purchasing Managers survey for January, the University of Michigan's final index of consumer sentiment for January and the report on new home sales for December.
Doug Burtnick, senior fixed-income analyst with Technical Data of Boston, said, "The market seems to be shedding some of the negativism that we have seen lately."
"But the market is far from out of the woods yet," he said. "Friday provides a huge slate of data that will show us how strong the economy was in the end of 1996 and will include the first 1997 data."
At yesterday's Treasury auction of new one-year bills, the average rate was 5.34 percent, up 3 basis points compared with last month's auction.
Following are the results of the auction:

HEADLINE: Now a Tightrope Walker: Bulgaria's Toppled King

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY

DATELINE: MADRID

 BODY:
While the country he briefly ruled writhes in political and economic turmoil, the former King of Bulgaria, Simeon II, sounds these days like a man resigned to an outsider's role, despite his triumphant return visit late last spring.
"I'm turning 60 next June, so I don't give myself too long in maneuvering," he said recently in an interview in his baronial residence here. Rack after rack of deer antlers were mounted outside the back door, which one of his sons opened with an apology for making a visitor wait, because all the household help was off for the afternoon. 
 "I'll do what I can, but I do not have the vocation of a spare wheel," the former King said, his blue eyes flashing. "If things go fine without me, then this is a blessing for Bulgaria and for me."
King Simeon was proclaimed monarch by the Bulgarian Parliament in 1943 after his father, King Boris III, died suddenly after a summons to Hitler's eastern field headquarters in August 1943. The young King's uncle and other regents who ruled in his name were executed in 1945 after Communist-led forces drove out the Germans, and Simeon and his mother fled to Egypt after the monarchy was abolished in 1946. He has lived in Spain for the last 50 years.
The collapse of Communism brought democracy to Bulgaria, but not the end of the Communists, who have been governing again, this time as Socialists. Complaining of mass starvation and national financial ruin, crowds have stormed the Parliament in Sofia in recent weeks, demanding new elections.
From here, King Simeon sent a statement to his supporters urging a "statesmanlike" solution to the crisis. "A strong dose of generosity and patriotism are needed to reach the consensus I have been insisting upon for years," he told them, trying, like any good constitutional monarch, to set himself above the fray. The trouble is, he said himself, there is a new Constitution in Bulgaria that does not include the role of monarch.
"During my trip there last summer, I tried to do my best in telling people that a constitutional monarch is not a dictator," he said in a conversation in his study. "In three or four cities I had the feeling that one word from me would have been enough to start a march on Sofia, but when I started talking about how the country needed all its children to work together, the crowds deflated."
Speaking the fluent if mannered English he learned in boarding schools in England and the United States, he said that his visit had received a flawless reception and that a poll by Gallup International afterward showed that about 12 percent of the people supported a return of the monarchy.
"Not even a clenched fist, sir, if you like," he said. But he decided against a return visit later last year.
"The Socialists were celebrating the 50th anniversary of the downfall of the monarchy," he said. "In December they had the presidential elections, and I didn't feel it right to go then and interfere." Some expatriates abroad had urged him to run for the presidency, but, he said, "The Constitution had some clauses that seemed specifically engineered to keep me out of the race."
Likening his position to that of a tightrope walker, he said: "I don't think it's dignified for me to be an eternal candidate. I don't feel that I'm a pretender to the throne, or a claimant. If people don't feel I could contribute to the stability of Bulgaria, I have many other interests I can pursue."

HEADLINE: Drugs and Technology Reinforce Stock Rally

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

 BODY:
Any jitters the stock market had this month temporarily disappeared as stocks soared yesterday for the second consecutive session, largely on the strength of technology and drug issues.
The Dow Jones industrial average surged 83.12 points, to 6,823.86. Since losing about 3 percent in a late-month downturn, the Dow has gained 168 points in two days and now stands just 60 points away from its high of 6,883.90, which was set on Jan. 21. 
 Stocks were again bolstered by a strengthening bond market and steady interest rates. Bonds have been rising on reports indicating that the economy is slowing and that inflationary pressures are diminishing.
"The stock market continues to move in lock step with the bond market, and economic news of the last couple of days has all been indicative of slower growth," Robert H. Stovall, president of Stovall/21st Advisers, said. "And for that reason, January is finishing on an up note."
Bond prices rose yesterday after the Labor Department reported an unexpected increase in the number of jobless claims filed last week. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 6.86 percent, from 6.90 on Wednesday.
Laszlo Birinyi, a market analyst at Birinyi Associates in Greenwich, Conn., said another significant factor in yesterday's rally was a sharp decline in the price of gold, which some analysts still see as a barometer of inflationary expectations. Gold for February delivery, the most active contract, fell $5.60 yesterday to a three-and-a-half year low of $346.20 an ounce on the Comex division of New York Mercantile Exchange.
"That was the key today," Mr. Birinyi said, noting that cyclical industrial stocks, like General Electric and Du Pont, gained. "What the market is saying is that the economy is going to get better, but gold is saying that it's not going to be inflationary."
Mr. Birinyi, who has long been bullish on the market, added that those signs suggested strong corporate profits in the future but low inflation, the best of all worlds for this stock market. "That's even better than a slow-growth economy," he said.
Drugs, chemicals and consumer products were the backbone of yesterday's rally. Procter & Gamble, Philip Morris and Merck, all of which reported earnings this week that either met or beat analysts' expectations, advanced. P.& G. was up 4 9/64, to 115 3/8, a 52-week high; Philip Morris was up 3 1/2, to 119 7/8, and Merck was up 2 1/8, to 90 3/8.
Du Pont gained 2 3/4, to 110, despite reporting earnings on Wednesday that were below expectations. And G.E. was up 2, to 105 5/8.
Broader market indexes were also strong. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 11.67 points, or 1.5 percent, to 784.17, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 15.85, to 1,371.02.
Technology stocks continued to prosper. Microsoft and Intel once again led the pack, both setting records yesterday. Microsoft reached the century mark for the first time, rising 3 7/8, to 101 1/8, and Intel soared 5 3/8, to 160 1/8, after the semiconductor company said that it was lowering the price on some of its Pentium computer chips less than expected, suggesting that demand was still high.
Several other semiconductor concerns gained on the news. Texas Instruments was up 4 3/4, to 74 1/2; Micron Technology gained 2 3/8, to 35 3/8.
Richard E. Cripps, chief market strategist at Legg Mason, said the market's two-day surge, coming after a five-day decline, was evidence that it was consolidating; that rather than a vertical rise, investors were selecting big-capitalization industries, and that the market was beginning to solidify within a trading range.
"The broader market is needing to consolidate," he said. "On the surface, it's relatively flat, but underneath the water, you're seeing the money rotating. Now we're rotating into the drug and health care industry."
Among drug stocks, Warner-Lambert, which said yesterday that it had won Government approval for the diabetes drug Rezulin, rose 3 1/8, to 78. Others also benefited. Eli Lilly was up 4 7/8, to 86 7/8, and Pfizer was up 4 1/8, to 90 3/4.
"We're beginning to see a shift in leadership into consumer products and drugs," Peter Cardillo, director of research at Westfalia Investments in New York, said.
