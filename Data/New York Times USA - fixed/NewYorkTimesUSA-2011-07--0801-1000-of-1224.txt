HEADLINE: After a Deal, Only More Challenges

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY, ERIC DASH and JULIE CRESWELL

 BODY:
So far so good was the word on Wall Street Thursday as details emerged about Europe's latest broad, sweeping effort to relieve Greece's debt burden.
But, analysts said, it was unclear how the ambitious plan -- which includes Greece changing the terms of its debt -- would affect the markets in the coming days.
The conventional thinking had been that a Greek default would spur contagion in the financial markets, potentially roiling United States banks and mutual funds. But on Thursday, as details emerged of a plan that was characterized as a ''selective default,'' stocks on both sides of the Atlantic rose. The euro climbed to a two-week high against the dollar. And bonds in Spain, Greece and Italy ticked upward, while bets against Greece's debt sunk.
What was behind the muted response, analysts said, was that Europe had avoided the trademarks of traditional sovereign defaults, which more typically involve bondholders and creditors taking sudden, definite losses. Greece's problems are hardly a surprise, having been telegraphed for nearly a year and a half. And many of the losses connected to Greece's debt, it turns out, will be shared by the euro zone and may not affect investors like United States money market funds as much as has been feared. 
''This is the Europeanization of the Greek debt,'' said Perry Mehrling, a senior fellow at the Morin Center for Banking and Financial Law at Boston University. ''Everyone prefers to have Europe as their counterparty rather than Greece.''
But the markets may also be calm because it is simply not clear yet what all the repercussions of the deal will be. Many questions are left unanswered, including whether the credit ratings agencies will consider the deal a default or an action that should affect ratings across the Continent. And in the derivatives market -- where traders have been swapping instruments that allow them to bet against Greek and other sovereign debt -- it is unclear whether the industry association that makes rulings on those contracts will declare that the parties that bet against Greece should be paid, or not.
Also clouding the market is the question of whether Europe's plan for Greece is more of a bailout or a default -- selective default, the term being used to describe the plan, is a term few investors have ever heard before. The ratings agencies declined to discuss their thoughts on the deal after it was announced, but they have said in the past that measures similar to the ones announced, including extensions of the length of the debt, would qualify as a default. And Greece's situation is an anomaly for derivatives traders, who are more used to settling up after defaults of corporations, rather than those of countries.
Details of Europe's deal leaked out all day Thursday, but it was formally described in a four-page memorandum released in the evening. It has options including a bond swap that will relieve Greece's bondholders -- mostly banks in Greece, France and Germany -- of short-term bonds in exchange for new longer-term bonds that will be guaranteed by the euro zone. It includes 109 billion euros ($157 billion) in aid to Greece. The memo says that a pan-European entity will make loans to individual countries so that those countries can work to recapitalize banks there that are hit by losses on the Greek debt.
Analysts said the deal resembled the federal bank bailout that occurred in the United States in 2008, because it included a way to aid institutions that were heavily stung by losses on Greece, much like the United States aided banks that were hard hit by mortgage bonds. Several analysts cheered simply because it was a sign of progress.
''The light at the end of tunnel just got a lot brighter,'' said Chris Orndorff, a Western Asset portfolio manager who oversees more than $39 billion of European corporate and sovereign debt. ''What they are really trying to do here is stop the contagion. It provides a degree of confidence to investors in Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Italy that it is not going to be a downward spiral.''
Others criticized European officials for trying to sugarcoat the plan. ''I'm shocked they would use the term 'selective default.' Any adjective you put in front of the word default still means default,'' said Zane Brown, fixed-income strategist at Lord Abbett.
Dogging all those countries are doubts over their credit ratings, which can drive the costs for them to borrow. To some degree, Europe's backing of Greece may relieve some of the doubts that have driven the ratings agencies to issue warnings about several European countries -- like Italy, Spain, Portugal, Ireland.
It is unclear how long it will take for the agencies to react. Moody Investor Services pointed out in a statement that it was ''not a party to ongoing discussions on the Greek debt rollover,'' and that it was observing developments and rating implications ''in due course.'' A spokesperson for Fitch Ratings said there were no changes to Greece's ratings at that point. Standard & Poor's declined to comment.
Because ratings agencies did not provide much information just after the plan was announced, investors will be awaiting a decision on Friday.
''They've told us in the past that any sort of debt restructuring, such as a significant maturity extension, would be considered a default. Here we're exchanging short-term debt for 30-year debt,'' said Jerry Webman, the chief economist at Oppenheimer Funds. ''Obviously one of the sticking points has been to try to get a lot of the technicalities right so that you don't get a default rating.''
Apart from the ratings agencies, another default ruling will likely come over the next few days from the International Swaps and Derivatives Association. After a well-known market participant requests that the industry association determine whether a default has occurred, a committee of 10 banks and five large asset managers will convene by telephone to opine on the matter. Their decision matters because it will drive large profits and losses for investors, depending on whether they bet for or against Greece, and some analysts have expressed fears that there may be a company that has a concentrated position that it may have trouble paying off.
The committee has never before had to consider a selective default and so traders will watch their voting with interest. The results and votes cast by each firm on the committee will be made public, said Steve Kennedy, a spokesman for ISDA.
Mr. Kennedy said he believed that the derivatives market would sort the matter out ''calmly and according to the process that's been established.''
Closer to home for most Americans are money market funds, which hold billions in European banks' debt, though analysts said the funds should remain safe under the plan. This summer, some estimates said 50 percent of the $1.6 trillion in prime money market fund assets were in the debt of European banks.
Many money markets have been decreasing their exposure to Europe. About a year ago managers overseeing the $110 billion Vanguard Prime Money Market Fund, for instance, decided to reduce the fund's holdings of banks in different countries that had a larger exposure to Greece and other countries in the periphery.
''Money-market funds are at least three steps removed from any Greek debt. Greece would have to take down Spain or Italy in order to become a threat to the French banks which money funds hold the debt of,'' said Peter Crane, president of Crane Data, which tracks such funds.

HEADLINE: After the Space Shuttle: The arguments for bold, and inspiring, missions still hold

 BODY:
The smooth landing of the shuttle Atlantis on Thursday closed an era in America's human space flight program that had triumphs and tragedies over the past three decades but was long overdue to end. The question now is whether the nation can summon the will to push hard for a far more ambitious set of manned voyages.
The outlook for bold ventures is bleak. The United States is not abandoning human activities in space. American astronauts will be performing experiments on the International Space Station at least through 2020, but they will have to get there on Russian space craft. The earliest that American commercial companies could carry astronauts into nearby space might be 2015 or 2016. 
President Obama has proposed more ambitious manned missions -- using technologies yet to be developed -- to an asteroid by 2025 and the orbit of Mars by the mid-2030s. Congress is, so far, unpersuaded.
In tough economic times, it is fair to ask why substantial money should be spent on manned space travel, especially since unmanned probes and space telescopes have produced much richer scientific findings. The answer is that manned missions are still the prime symbol of a nation's prowess in space.
We support President Obama's idea to send astronauts to places never visited before. Even lesser missions would make clear that the United States is not ceding the peaceful exploration of space at a time when others, notably China, are energetically pursuing their own programs.
NASA's $18 billion budget is a tiny part of some $3.7 trillion in annual federal spending. Congress ought to provide enough money to keep the United States at the forefront of both human and robotic space exploration.
The shuttles had two crowning achievements: launching and repairing the Hubble Space Telescope, whose breathtaking images have revolutionized astronomy; and assembling the space station, a prodigious engineering feat. But the shuttles never lived up to their original promise of providing cheap, frequent, safe, reliable, trips to low-Earth orbit. And they turned out to be a lot more fragile than anyone realized; two were lost in catastrophic accidents.
We were pleased when President Obama sought to rejuvenate the space program by calling on NASA to develop ''game-changing'' technologies to provide cheaper and faster travel deep into space. But those plans were reined in when Congress virtually dictated that NASA use existing technologies to build a new heavy-lift rocket and crew capsule needed for such voyages. Many legislators are arguing for returning to the Moon first.
Now House Republicans want to cut NASA's spending for all programs, both manned and unmanned, by 10 percent below the president's request, with especially troubling cuts in some of the most important research areas. The House Appropriations Committee has approved a budget that would make deep cuts in planned spending on new space technologies, scale back NASA's two highest-priority unmanned missions -- to Mars and a moon of Jupiter -- and eliminate NASA's most important new space telescope (a successor to the Hubble), which is behind schedule and overbudget. NASA certainly needs to improve its efficiency. But it makes no sense to eviscerate programs that could yield cutting-edge technologies or important scientific findings.
Americans have long ago grown blase with the shuttle missions. After three decades, we suppose that isn't surprising. We still believe that this country can do exciting things in space that can inspire a new generation.

HEADLINE: The Grand Bargain Lives!

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
Imagine you're a member of Congress. You have your own preferred way to reduce debt. If you're a Democrat, it probably involves protecting Medicare and raising taxes. If you're a Republican, it probably involves cutting spending, reforming Medicare and keeping taxes low.
Your plan is going nowhere. There just aren't the votes. Meanwhile, the debt ceiling is fast approaching and a national catastrophe could be just weeks away. 
At the last minute, two bipartisan approaches heave into view. In the Senate, the ''Gang of Six'' produces one Grand Bargain. Meanwhile, President Obama and John Boehner, the House speaker, have been quietly working on another. They suddenly seem close to a deal.
There's a lot you don't know about these two Grand Bargains. But they probably have the elements that have been part of just about every recent bipartisan debt proposal: some sort of tax reform that lowers overall rates while raising revenue by closing loopholes; cuts in the level of entitlement spending without much fundamental reform; a freeze on domestic discretionary spending. Mostly, there will be vagueness. The specifics of what exactly will be cut and who will be taxed will not be filled in.
You are being asked to support a foggy approach, not a specific plan. You are being asked to do this even though you have no faith in the other party and limited faith in the leadership of your own. You are being asked to risk your political life for an approach that bears little resemblance to what you would ideally prefer.
Do you do this? I think you do.
You do it because all the other options are worse. Doing nothing could lead to default and the end of American economic supremacy. The compromise put together by Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader, and Mitch McConnell, the Republican minority leader, that's been floating around is a ploy to evade responsibility. Punting with some small package would spook the markets and reflect dishonor on yourself.
You do it because even though you are unhappy, you see that people on the other end of the political spectrum are also unhappy. If you're a conservative, you see that some liberals, according to Barbara Mikulski, are ''volcanic'' with rage at Obama. If you're a Democrat, you see the Tea Party-types sniping at Boehner and some Republican presidential candidates completely stonewalling a deal. These signs make you feel better.
You do it because while the Grand Bargains won't solve most of our fiscal problems. They will produce some incremental progress. We won't fundamentally address the debt until we control health care inflation. But there is no agreement on how to do this, and it's unrealistic to hold up an incremental deal just because no permanent one is on offer.
Both Grand Bargains produce real fiscal progress. They aim for $3 trillion or $4 trillion in debt reduction. Boehner and Obama have talked about raising the Medicare eligibility age and reducing Social Security benefit increases. The White House is offering big cuts in exchange for some revenue increases, or small cuts in exchange for few or none. The Gang of Six has a less-compelling blend of cuts, but it would repeal the Class Act, a health care Ponzi scheme. It would force committees across Congress to cut spending, and it would introduce an enforcement mechanism if they don't. Sure there's chicanery, but compared with any recent real-life budget, from Republican or Democratic administrations, these approaches are models of fiscal rectitude.
You do it because both bargains would boost growth. The tax code really is a travesty and a drag on the country's economic dynamism. Any serious effort to simplify the code, strip out tax expenditures and reduce rates would have significant positive effects -- even if it raised some tax revenues along the way.
You do it because you know the political climate will be worse for a deal in 2013. If you're a Republican, you know Obama might win re-election, and even if the G.O.P. swept everything, you know your party wouldn't have the guts to cut entitlements unilaterally (that's why the cut, cap and balance bill didn't mention the specific programs that would face the ax). If you're a Democrat, you know Obama might lose, and, even if he doesn't, the Senate will likely tilt rightward.
Mostly you do it because you want to live in a country than can govern itself. Over the past few weeks, Washington has seemed dysfunctional. Public disgust has risen to epic levels. Yet through all this, serious people -- Barack Obama, John Boehner, the members of the Gang of Six -- have soldiered on. They've been responsible and brave. If you're a Democrat, you hate to see domestic cuts. If you're a Republican, you loathe revenue increases, even little ones.
But this is the next step in the journey toward economic health. Standing still is not an option. Keep your reservations in mind, but let the mission continue.

HEADLINE: The Class Act in the Crosshairs

BYLINE: PAULA SPAN


HIGHLIGHT: The Senate's so-called Gang of Six are pushing for repeal of the first government-run insurance program for long-term care, set to begin next year.

 BODY:
Congressional budget hawks have turned their attention to the Class Act, the nation's first government-run long-term care insurance system. The program's supporters and advocates, including more than 250 organizations representing older adults and people with disabilities, have fretted for some time about its fate, fearing that the Republican-controlled House of Representatives might try to dismantle it before it could take effect next year.
Now comes the Gang of Six, three senators from each party who are proposing ways to shrink the federal deficit. And there on page 3 of their "Bipartisan Plan to Reduce Our Nation's Deficits," released on Tuesday, is the death sentence: Repeal the Class Act. The document didn't explain why the Gang had singled out that program.
"Repeal the Class Act? What's that doing in a deficit-reduction program?" said Barbara Manard, vice president of LeadingAge, an association of non-profits providing services to the elderly and a key Class backer. "The Congressional Budget Office said the Class Act reduced the deficit by $83 billion in the first 10 years." That's partly because the program takes in premiums for five years before it starts paying benefits, partly because of Medicaid savings.
"It's totally bizarre," Dr. Manard went on, citing a Kaiser Family Foundation/Harvard University opinion poll that found broad public support for Class. "It's desperately needed, people like it, and getting rid of it actually increases the deficit. It's a lose-lose-lose proposition."
A little-noticed part of the new health care law, Class would allow employed people, including the self-employed, to join a voluntary government-sponsored insurance program and then receive a cash benefit to use as they wish when they need help with so-called activities of daily living, whether that happens in old age or through a mid-life disability or accident. Though the benefits aren't designed to pay the entire cost of long-term care, they could constitute a significant help for struggling families.
Many details remain to be worked out by the secretary of Health and Human Services, Kathleen Sebelius, who has acknowledged that there's work to do to make Class insurance economically sustainable.
But the idea of scrapping the program altogether has alarmed a considerable number of Washington organizations, and they're visiting members of Congress, writing letters, placing ads and getting ready to mobilize their memberships.
No doubt they're also, once again, mourning the late Senator Edward Kennedy, such an effective legislator that he might have guided his legacy program through this minefield.
Constance Garner, a former staffer in the senator's office who's now executive director of a coalition called AdvanceClass, worked with him for years to craft the program.
"I learned from him that you have to keep at it and keep at it," she told me. So that's what she's doing.

HEADLINE: Is There Hope for the Unemployed?

BYLINE: UWE E. REINHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: As strong emerging economies climb the value chain, more jobs in the United States may be in jeopardy, an economist writes.

 BODY:
Recent reports of the bleak jobs outlook for the United States brought to mind an eye-opening report for the Council on Foreign Relations by Michael Spence, a Nobel laureate, and Sandile Hlatshwayo. I highly recommend that report, at the very least its summary, "Globalization and Unemployment," in the current issue of Foreign Affairs. It clearly explains our current dilemma in the labor market.
The authors break down our economy into those sectors whose output is traded across international borders (the tradable sectors) and is thus subject to competition from foreign producers, and those sectors whose output is not traded across international borders (the nontradable sectors). 
In the tradable category are manufactured goods, farm products, raw materials and financial, consulting, educational, computing and other technical services. Prominent in the nontradable sector are government, health care, retailing, construction, restaurants and, for the most part, legal services.The authors then explore the question of how employment and value added per employee developed in both sectors from 1990 to 2008. The chart below, based on Figure 5 of the report, answers the first of these questions. 
The Tradable SectorJobs in the tradable sector were added primarily in high-value services. They were lost in manufacturing, through outsourcing of the lower value-added components of the value chain to other countries. 
The net effect has been that of the 27.3 million jobs created in the American economy from 1990 to 2008, only 662,000 new jobs were added by the tradable sector. That is only 2.3 percent of total job creation in the economy. 
The concept of the "value chain" is fundamental to understanding the impact of globalization on the American economy. The value chain for a product consists of the entire series of discrete steps from development and design to final sales, including transportation and marketing. 
The value added by a particular step in the chain is created by the capital and the labor that step employs. It is calculated as the value of the output by that step minus the cost of intermediate goods and services used by that step but produced outside that value chain by other producers and minus the cost of raw materials and energy used by the particular step in question. 
The value added produced by all industries in a nation adds up to the nation's gross domestic product. 
In a global economy with very cheap transoceanic transportation, the various steps in the value chain of a final product may be performed by different countries, depending on the value added of the step and the cost or labor used to perform that step. No aircraft or automobile sold by an American manufacturer, for example, has been produced wholly in the United States. 
Until now, the developed countries have tended to retain the steps that create high value added per employee and outsourced the rest to other countries. That practice naturally contributes proportionately more to gross domestic product in the United States than to employment. Furthermore, it tends to yield high incomes to highly educated people and depress the wages of lower-skilled American workers competing with foreign labor in the lower value-added segments of the value chain.
The Apple iPad, for example, was designed and developed by highly educated employees of Apple Inc. and is marketed by that company. But the device is assembled by the Taiwanese company Foxconn in its manufacturing plants in China, with components manufactured in South Korea, Japan and Europe. 
It has been reported that of the retail price of an iPad of $499, Apple spends about $291 on components, typically produced in other countries. It retains a gross profit of about $208 per iPad, or about 42 percent of the retail price. Some of that gross profit covers marketing and administration; with worldwide sales, even those outlays produce jobs both in the United States and abroad.
Thus, the iPad adds proportionately much more to G.D.P. in the United States than to employment there. It supports some high-paying jobs in the United States, but few if any middle-income and lower-middle-income jobs in manufacturing. It shows that technical innovation in the United States is great and can contribute to the growth of G.D.P. per capita, but it may not offer Americans many jobs.
A problem for the United States, noted by the authors of the report, is that the so-called emerging market economies -- notably China, Brazil and India -- appear poised to climb the value chain into the higher value-added segments hitherto kept in the developed economies. 
That will give unaccustomed new competition to even highly educated employees in the United States. We are likely to see this trend, for example, in aircraft manufacturing, medical devices, the pharmaceutical and biotech industries and eventually higher education.
The Nontraded SectorAlthough a few links in the value chains of the nontraded sector may have been produced abroad as well, the bulk of their links tend to be home-produced. 
Thus it is not surprising that, according to the authors of the report, close to 98 percent of the 27.3 million new jobs in the American economy in the last two decades were created in the nontradable sectors, led by government and health care in first and second place. 
These two sectors alone accounted for 40 percent of the total job growth over the last two decades. They were followed by retailing and construction, both of which grew on the back of heavy debt financing and a real-estate bubble.
Whence the Future Job Growth? The American people look to the president and Congress to create jobs -- or, more precisely, to create the economic conditions in which job growth occurs. 
At the same time, the American people now look to the president and Congress to rein in government spending in general and health-care spending in particular, at a time when a sizable deleveraging by consumers and business has sharply put the brakes also on retailing and construction.
So how can these desiderata -- creating jobs and, at the same time, cutting back on government and health care spending -- add up to a rosy future jobs picture? Can any government actually deliver on these conflicting goals?

HEADLINE: Economist Q.&A. on Europe's Debt Accord

BYLINE: ECONOMIX EDITORS


HIGHLIGHT: Simon Johnson, Carmen M. Reinhart and Laura D'Andrea Tyson answer questions on the move to help Greece and save the euro -- and the effects it may have, intended or otherwise.

 BODY:
European leaders reached an accord Thursday to reduce Greece's debt burden and prevent a collapse of confidence that has threatened to engulf some of the region's largest economies. Economix has asked three prominent economists to offer their views on the accord and the effects it may have, intended or otherwise, in Europe and the United States. They are:
Simon Johnson, a professor of entrepreneurship at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund and a Daily Economist here at Economix.
Carmen M. Reinhart, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, an economic historian and the co-author of "This Time Is Different," which chronicles 800 years' worth of debt crises and sovereign defaults.Laura D'Andrea Tyson, a professor of global management at the Haas School of Business, University of California, Berkeley, and national economic adviser in the Clinton administration. She, too, is a recurring contributor to Economix. 
Q. 
A. Simon Johnson: The debt deal will help Greece, but likely not enough. The debt reduction that currently seems likely will be relatively small and the implied budget adjustment will be difficult.
Laura D'Andrea Tyson: The idea that, through backbreaking austerity measures, Greece could pay back its debt on time was a triumph of hope over reality. Greece was caught in a downward debt spiral, heading toward disorderly default and depression that would eventually necessitate its exit from the European Union. Now reality has taken center stage in the new European accord. European leaders have now acknowledged that restructuring must play a role in the resolution of Greece's debt crisis and they have outlined a comprehensive rescue plan that includes both a substantial commitment of additional official resources from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund and "voluntary" contributions from Greece's private creditors, primarily European banks. Private creditors will be offered several options to restructure their holdings of Greek debt and public funds will be available to provide "credit enhancements" to encourage them to do so. This approach is similar to that of the successful Brady plan to restructure Latin American debt in 1989. The rating agencies have warned that the exercise of these options will likely trigger a selective default on some Greek debt.
The plan also calls for a significant infusion of E.U. funds for bailout loans to Greece, slashes interest rates on these loans and doubles their repayment period. The European Financial Stability Facility (E.F.S.F.), established during the first bailout effort in 2010, will be given substantial new powers including the authority to lend to euro zone governments to recapitalize their banks and to help them prevent future crises
Voluntary restructuring of Greek debt by private creditors and generous fiscal transfers from the European Union's core economies in the form of loans with generous repayment terms may resolve Greece's debt crisis but they will not by themselves address Greece's long-term competitiveness problem. The new plan acknowledges this reality and calls for reallocating E.U. structural funds to support a European Marshall Plan for Greece. At least so far, there has been no indication of the amount that would be provided for this purpose, but the amount required is likely to be substantial and politically controversial in the core economies.
The reality is that given its current productivity levels and its current mix of activities, the Greek economy cannot compete at the current value of the euro. And the situation has been getting worse over time as the rise of other emerging market economies has eroded Greece's competitiveness in lower-cost manufacturing while boosting the demand for exports from Germany and other core E.U. countries and driving up the euro's value. If Greece were not part of a common currency area, it would almost certainly follow the successful adjustment path of other developing economies from a deep financial crisis - official assistance from the I.M.F. or another source of public funds; austerity; debt restructuring; and a massive nominal and real depreciation of its currency to boost its competitiveness and growth. But as long as Greece remains part of the euro zone, this option is not available. In lieu of this option, Greece will have to rely on structural policies to enhance its competitiveness, and such policies can take a very long time to produce their desired effects. In the meantime, Greece will continue to suffer from slow growth, high levels of unemployment, stagnant or falling wages and high levels of indebtedness relative to gross domestic product. 
Carmen M. Reinhart: If the historic patterns that Ken Rogoff and I study hold true, the year that a country defaults is a difficult one, associated with uncertainty, confusion and recession. In many ways, the problems that emerge in the three-year period running up to the event show through in force in the year of default. Recessions typically are more severe, with output declines averaging nearly 5 percent, when the government defaults on both domestic and external debt, as Greece just did.
The good news is that these patterns also reveal that recovery (positive G.D.P. growth) begins the year after the default; prior output losses tend to be recovered within three years following the default. Of course, in this vast historical laboratory, nearly all the defaults were accompanied by currency depreciations - if not outright currency meltdowns - that swung the current-account balance from deficit to surplus and thus contributed to the recovery.
Q. 
A. Carmen M. Reinhart: Default or restructuring is "simpler" when the debt is held by a handful of banks or investors. Default episodes typically begin with a "reign of confusion." Essentially, investors fight among themselves and use courts in different jurisdictions to claim the largest piece possible of a shrunken pie.
Events in Greece are unlikely to be any different in that regard. For starters, the list of institutions supporting the Institute of International Finance is far from comprehensive. For example, there is a notable absence of American banks and only a couple of British banks are on the list.
There are many challenges, but maintaining the prior status quo was not a feasible alternative. The fiscal position of Greece was unsustainable and investors have to be part of any viable solution.
Simon Johnson: The short-term market reaction will probably be favorable. But will Europe now show signs of strong growth, particularly for countries with large debt burdens? Or will growth slow at both the European and global level - implying it is harder to grow out of these problems?
Laura D'Andrea Tyson: There are many details of the plan that still need to be worked out and there are still significant disagreements among member states about these details - including the options that private creditors will be allowed to use for debt restructuring or the credit enhancements that will be offered to encourage voluntary restructuring. There is no guarantee that a cooperative voluntary debt restructuring involving many private sector banks with different regulatory authorities will be possible. Parliamentary approval for an expansion of new authorities under the European Financial Stability Facility will be required and is not guaranteed. The plan calls for the participation of the I.M.F. but the terms of its participation have not yet been agreed. 
The plan explicitly states that Greece is in a uniquely grave situation and requires an exceptional solution. Other countries commit their "inflexible determination" to honor fully their sovereign debt - in other words, the plan's provisions for voluntary debt restructuring by private creditors are limited to Greece and do not apply to other heavily indebted periphery countries like Ireland and Portugal. They would have access to E.F.S.F. loans on the same terms as Greece, but they would not have access to E.F.S.F. support to restructure their debt with private creditors. This may prove to be impossible to enforce if the contagion effects from the Greek crisis aggravate the debt crises in these countries. The commitment to treat Greece as an exceptional case may prove to be another triumph of hope over reality. 
The plan does not expand E.F.S.F. resources and these may prove to be inadequate, requiring an additional infusion of funds in the future.
Finally, there may be significant political pushback against the plan both among voters in core countries that will be financing bailout funds and among voters in Greece that will continue to suffer from slow growth, high unemployment and years of fiscal austerity.
Q. 
A. Simon Johnson: The E.C.B. apparently feared consequences for the bond prices of other "peripheral" countries, including Italy. The view now must be that there is enough additional support in place to help any country that comes under market pressure. Let's hope they are right.
Carmen M. Reinhart: At first, the E.C.B. mistook a chronic solvency problem for a temporary liquidity challenge. The denial phase was a long one, but that is typical in the run-up to default. Subsequently, the hope was that fiscal austerity and economic growth alone could do the job of bringing Greek public debt-to-G.D.P. back to sustainable levels. This was another aspect of denial, as the historical experience highlights some form of default or restructuring is an integral part (in addition to fiscal austerity) of the debt-reduction process for highly indebted economies.
Laura D'Andrea Tyson: The European Central Bank opposed restructuring options that might trigger a selective default in part because such a default would erode the value of the sovereign bond holdings the bank had already purchased or had accepted as collateral, in part because such a default would trigger a liquidity crisis in the Greek banking system that the E.C.B. could not address, and in part because such a default would erode the capital base of the European banks, necessitating more support from the E.C.B. It is also likely that the central bank used its opposition as a bargaining chip to keep pressure on the fiscal authorities of the European Union member states to provide more fiscal resources to recapitalize their banks and to fund official loans to Greece and other periphery countries. Both of these responsibilities rest with the fiscal authorities of the European member states, not with the E.C.B. 
The new plan contains several features that address concerns of the central bank. It will be compensated for any losses it suffers on Greek bonds so it can continue to accept them as collateral in loans to Greek banks. The European Financial Stability Facility will provide the necessary compensation. As part of the new deal, the euro zone leaders agreed to provide funds to help recapitalize the Greek banks. Over all, the new plan will provide new fiscal resources and new fiscal authorities to address the Greek debt crisis, easing the pressures on the E.C.B. Finally, the plan reflects the central bank's determination that Greece be treated as "an absolutely exceptional situation," although it remains uncertain whether this will turn out to be the case.
Q. 
A. Carmen M. Reinhart: European banks will, most likely, require further assistance from their respective governments in the recapitalization process. No doubt, it would be most efficient and transparent to deal with the holes created on European bank balance sheets on a unified basis. My expectation, however, is that national leaders do not have the appetite for another pan-European solution to a financial problem. In that case, much of the support from the governments to the banks will be done on a case-by-case basis, as weaknesses at individual institutions are revealed.
However, the "positive" feature of the Greek restructuring is that it did not spring up without warning when leveraged exposure to Greece was at its zenith. Historically, the most severe cases of financial contagion involved the element of surprise. With nearly two years of well-publicized debt difficulties and a string of rating downgrades in the process, this credit event can hardly be called a surprise.
Q. 
A. Simon Johnson: This is a big unknown. The direct links through bank loans and money market mutual funds do not imply big spillover effects. But the credit-default swap market is a big wild card. No one seems to have a good handle on either gross exposures or net exposures to anything that is classified as a "credit event."
Carmen M. Reinhart: As noted, this event was signaled well in advance and appears to be embedded in market prices. However, the same was said of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. This time round, the direct exposure of U.S. banks to the government of Greece appears to be trivial. More worrisome, and much harder to ascertain, is the exposure of U.S. financial institutions, including money market mutual funds, to the European banks affected by the Greek default.
Q. 
A. Laura D'Andrea Tyson: The new plan for Greece has been called a plan to save the euro. But if the new plan is not generous enough or does not take effect quickly enough, Greece may decide that the economic benefits of staying in the euro system are lower than the economic costs of exiting the system. In that case, the new plan will not succeed in saving the euro as it exists today. 
Simon Johnson: The euro zone has bought itself some time. But unless the troubled countries now show strong growth, there is still trouble ahead.
Carmen M. Reinhart: More "selective defaults" or restructurings are likely to follow in the period ahead. Ireland and Portugal, notably, face severe challenges of their own (with or without a Greek restructuring). More broadly for the euro zone, the process of deleveraging, as Vincent Reinhart and I have stressed, is a multiyear process that takes up the better part of a decade in the wake of severe financial crises. As we documented, growth remains subpar and unemployment stubbornly high as deleveraging slowly unfolds. Excess debt affects both the public and private sectors; it is both a domestic and external debt overhang.

BYLINE: JEFF SOMMER


HIGHLIGHT: A look at the latest Weekend Business podcast, and a listen.

 BODY:
Sovereign debt crises continue to simmer on both sides of the Atlantic, but there was some progress, in Europe, at least.In Brussels, European leaders revealed the rough outlines of at least a short-term resolution of the Greek debt crisis, Floyd Norris says in the new Weekend Business podcast. The plan involves a 109 billion euro ($157 billion) rescue package for Greece, and would force many investors in Greek debt to accept some losses on their bonds. But whether it can contain the contagion that has threatened the financial system in Europe and elsewhere is anyone's guess.
In Washington, negotiators face an Aug. 2 deadline for raising the federal debt ceiling. Republicans in Congress have insisted that such action be coupled with spending cuts that would pare the budget deficit. President Obama said that the talks reached an impasse on Friday, but talks were expected to resume over the weekend. In a conversation on the podcast, Robert Shiller, the Yale economist, says that budget cutting is so much in vogue right now that we are in danger of neglecting the millions of people who remain without work, two years after the start of an economic recovery. 
As Mr. Shiller writes in the Economic View column in Sunday Business, fiscal stimulus is an excellent remedy for a weak economy, but it does not appear to be within the realm of political possibility right now. Therefore he recommends balancing spending and taxing, and focusing on programs that will create jobs. The government, he says, need not get larger. It could function as a kind of investment banker, soliciting ideas from the private sector, and providing funding for projects that seem most worthwhile.In the Strategies column in Sunday Business, I discuss the impact of the financial crises on the price and status of gold. While it is still well below its inflation-adjusted peak, set in early 1980, gold crossed the $1,600-an-ounce threshold last week for the first time. And a political movement to restore the gold standard has begun to stir once again - more so, perhaps, than at any time since the days of supply-side economics early in the Reagan administration. In the podcast, I discuss the possibility that this political revival might signal another peak for gold.
And in a separate podcast conversation, David Gillen and Brian Stelter talk about Hulu, the online video site sponsored by major television networks. As Mr. Stelter writes on the cover of Sunday Business, Hulu may be helping to define the future of television.
You can find specific segments of the podcast at these junctures: Floyd Norris (34:00); news summary (24:19); Hulu (21:35); Robert Shiller (14:13); gold (5:24); the week ahead (2:40).

HEADLINE: Confronting Antitrust Issues in a Giant Merger

BYLINE: STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF


HIGHLIGHT: Express Scripts' $29.1 billion planned acquisition of Medco Health Solutions is a good illustration of how parties negotiate when there is significant antitrust risk.

 BODY:
Express Scripts' $29.1 billion planned acquisition of Medco Health Solutions is a good illustration of how parties negotiate when there is significant antitrust risk. 
There are three giants in the prescription drug sector: Express Scripts, CVS Caremark and Medco. A combined Medco-Express Scripts would control at least 30 percent or more of the drug benefit administration market. The next largest competitor would be CVS Caremark, with 17.8 percent of that market, according to data cited by The St. Louis Post-Dispatch. The big three's dominance is particularly acute in the large plan market for prescription drug services, where they reportedly control up to 80 percent of the market. 
The key to this deal's completion will be how the Federal Trade Commission reacts when it reviews the transaction for compliance with federal antitrust laws. 
Medco's and Express Scripts' strategy in dealing with the F.T.C. regulator can be gleaned from the pairs' acquisition agreement filed on Friday.
In every acquisition agreement, the parties address how they will deal with regulatory authorities. When there are particular antitrust problems, the parties will then set out more specifically what the buyer needs to do to obtain antitrust clearance.
A common provision addressing these issues is a "hell or high water clause." This is a provision which obligates a buyer to take all steps to satisfy regulatory authorities, including making divestitures. 
But a pure hell or high water, which requires any amount of divestitures (even the whole company), is rare. Instead, the buyer is typically required to take some measure of pre-defined steps to obtain antitrust approval. However, there is a cap put on those efforts, so that the buyer can place an economic price on its cooperation with antitrust authorities. 
In Express Scripts' case, the parties' acquisition agreement's hell-or-high-water provisions require Express Scripts to take substantial steps to obtain antitrust clearance. The primary requirement is that the newly combined Express Scripts-Medco must undertake the following steps to satisfy the F.T.C. if it legally makes such a request (this is Section 5.8(e) of the merger agreement):
1) The divestiture of one mail-order dispensing facility anywhere except St. Louis, where Express Scripts is based.
2) The divestiture of specialty pharmacy dispensing or infusion facilities having a net book value no more than $30 million outside of Indianapolis.
3) The divestiture of contracts that generated collectively earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, not in excess of $115 million during the last 12 months. The agreements also states that in no event shall Express Scripts be required to divest get more than 35 million individual prescription drug claims. 
The big give here is the third one. The term "contracts" is really a reference to contracts for national prescription plans, a big area of concern given the 80 percent concentration rate of the big three. The disposition of contracts generating $115 million in Ebitda could be significant and constitute assets worth more than than $1 billion. 
The question is whether this will be enough. There is no termination fee on the deal for failure to obtain antitrust clearance. In other words, if the parties fail to obtain antitrust clearance, they each owe each other nothing. However, the provisions above serve as their own hook with which Medco can push Express Scripts to complete this transaction. 
To obtain such clearance, Express Scripts and Medco are likely to argue to the F.T.C. that there is a fourth big competitor in the market: UnitedHealthcare. This means that the prescriptions benefit business is really shrinking from four to three providers, not three to two And the issue of national prescription plans can be dealt with by dispositions according to the acquisition agreement. 
In addition, Express Scripts and Medco will focus their arguments to the public framed by the debate over rising health care costs. The two will argue that the combined company could lower government health care costs, and health care costs generally, by using its size to push down drug prices, particularly for generic drugs. Given the peculiarities of the health care industry and the real need for cost savings, the parties' argument may be a good one. 
No doubt Express Scripts and Medco think that this deal could take a while to close. The transaction has a drop-dead date, which can be extended to Oct. 22, 2012, and I would not be surprised if this transaction takes up to a year to clear, if it does so. A drop-dead date is a date in the merger agreement after which either party can terminate the transaction. 
Finally, a few other points of interest about the transaction.
The merger agreement has a termination fee of $950 million if a competing bidder comes along. This is unlikely because CVS Caremark is the only other real possible bidder, and CVS's acquisition of Caremark is now generally viewed as a failure. CVS almost certainly would not want to get even bigger and double-down on its bad acquisition. In fact, the Express Scripts-Medco deal can be seen as a real loss for CVS because it now means that CVS cannot auction Caremark off to Express Scripts or Medco. The attempt to forestall this auction is another driver of this deal. 
Also, Express Scripts and Medco are required to have their shareholders approve the transaction. If shareholders of one company reject the deal, it will have to reimburse the other company for its expenses up to $225 million.
Express Scripts has obtained a commitment letter for $14 billion in financing for the transaction. This is a significant number and shows that the credit markets remain robust. Further illustrating the strength of the credit markets, Express Scripts did not negotiate a provision in the acquisition agreement to terminate the deal if its financing fails. This is despite a yearlong wait for completion of the transaction. Or maybe it is the financing banks here -- Credit Suisse Group and Citigroup -- who are the optimistic ones this time around, since they also bear the financing risk for that long a period. 
The transaction is also good news for Jim Woolery, JPMorgan Chase's new co-head of North American mergers and acquisitions, who came over from Cravath, Swaine & Moore back in January. He is working on this transaction as well as AT&T's planned acquisition of T-Mobile, the two largest deals of the year.

HEADLINE: News Corp. Sells Russian Unit

BYLINE: ANDREW KRAMER


HIGHLIGHT: The News Corporation, Rupert Murdoch's media conglomerate embroiled in scandal, sold its billboard company in Russia to a consortium of investors led by a Kremlin-controlled bank.

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- The News Corporation, Rupert Murdoch's media conglomerate embroiled in scandal, sold its billboard company in Russia to a consortium of investors led by a Kremlin-controlled bank, the bank announced on Friday.
The sale of News Outdoor Russia had been under negotiation for at least months. The timing was apparently unrelated to the turmoil around the News Corporation in Britain, where Parliament is investigating a tabloid newspaper's practice of hacking into cell phones to obtain information.
Still, the Russian asset had a troubled history of its own. The News Corporation opened the company here in 1999 while maneuvering to gain a foothold in the former Soviet and Eastern European markets to compliment its media holdings in China.
While the News Outdoor Group, which is based in Moscow, operates in the Czech Republic, Romania and Ukraine, Russia has been by far its most lucrative market. News Outdoor Russia billboards are frequently provided for pictures of Vladimir V. Putin, the former president and now prime minister, reportedly on a pro bono basis at times.
Despite these gestures that were reported in the Russian media, the News Corporation had been in discussions to sell the billboard company since the fall of 2008 amid a general worsening of the investment climate in Russia at the time, and apparent inability to win backing from the government.
In a 2008 interview with The Financial Times, Mr. Murdoch expressed concern the billboard company would be "stolen." He added that "better we sell it now."
Mr. Murdoch had initially proposed to sell the Russian asset for $1.6 billion. But as regulators pressed a tax claim and the recession deepened, the price dropped.
The company this week sold its 79 percent stake for $270 million, according to Kommersant, a Russian business newspaper. The Russian bank that organized the buyout consortium, VTB, did not disclose its price in a statement confirming the deal issued on Friday.
News Outdoor Russia is the country's largest outdoor advertising operator, with boards, banners and other advertising surfaces in more than 90 cities, according to the company's Web site.
The Russian asset has been important to the News Corporation. Advertising revenues are mostly flat in developed markets like the United States, where the company operates the Fox television channel. But revenues are growing in emerging markets. In China, the News Corporation operates a satellite television company. In the former Soviet Union, the focus had been largely billboards managed through the Moscow-based company.
In 2008, News Outdoor Russia came under pressure, culminating in a back tax claim that was resolved two years later. Still, that year the company provided pro bono a large banner showing Mr. Putin's face on a central Moscow building near Red Square, the RBK business newspaper reported. 
Company-owned space in St. Petersburg this month carried advertisements for the People's Front, a new political group established by Mr. Putin ahead of Parliamentary elections later this year.
Jason E. Senior, chief operating officer of the News Outdoor Group, wrote in an e-mail that the company would not respond to inquiries about the report of pro bono advertising provided to Mr. Putin in 2008 or the current advertising for the People's Front organization on News Outdoor surfaces in St. Petersburg. He also declined to respond to questions about the sale.

HEADLINE: A Year Later, Dodd-Frank Delays Are Piling Up

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: While government regulators were supposed to complete about 160 regulations by now, 80 percent of them remain unfinished, according to a report by the law firm Davis Polk.

 BODY:
A year after Congress enacted the huge Dodd-Frank financial regulatory overhaul, the law is seriously behind schedule.
The Dodd-Frank Act turned a year old on Thursday, a milestone that was supposed to be Day One of many new rules for Wall Street. Instead, this month the Securities and Exchange Commission and several other financial regulators missed some 100 rule-writing deadlines, according to a new report by the law firm Davis Polk.
The law cracked down on the opaque derivatives market, loose lending standards and other problems that set off the financial crisis. Now it's up to regulators to enforce the law, which mandates more than 300 new rules. 
While the agencies were supposed to complete roughly 160 regulations by now, 80 percent of them remain unfinished, the Davis Polk "Dodd-Frank Progress Report" found. Over all, nearly 90 percent of all rules are incomplete. Regulators also failed to complete seven studies, including review of short selling and foreclosures. 
The S.E.C., which has the largest responsibility under Dodd-Frank, alone has missed 54 deadlines, according to Davis Polk. 
In June, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission decided to formally postpone some derivatives rules for up to six months. The agency did, however, recently sign off on nearly 10 new proposals, including rules that greatly expand the government's ability to police insider trading and other fraud. 
The remaining delays are largely expected, as regulators scramble to finalize new rules on shoestring budgets. The Government Accountability Office estimated that it will cost regulators $1.25 billion to enforce the law over the next two years. 
But as regulators face a budget crunch amid the broadening mandates, Republican lawmakers are threatening to cut regulatory spending even further. In June, a House committee approved a plan to keep the Securities and Exchange Commission budget flat. Some lawmakers want outright cuts. 
"They are trying to stall," Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who was a co-author the Dodd-Frank law, said of the Republicans. Their plan, he said in a recent interview, is to "hope that they will win the 2012 election with the support of the financial people." Once in control of Washington, he said, Republicans would "then undo what we were able to do, and then, yes, the system would be at risk."

HEADLINE: Going to Cuba in Luxury

BYLINE: RACHEL LEE HARRIS


HIGHLIGHT: Abercrombie &#038; Kent is the first elite travel company to offer "people-to-people" tours of Cuba under President Obama's new rules.

 BODY:
Five-star hotels and luxury motor coaches may not be the first things that come to mind when you think of Cuba. But now they can be part of the experience. Abercrombie & Kent, the luxury travel company, is offering trips to Cuba from the United States made possible by President Obama's loosening of travel restrictions earlier this year.
According to the new policies, any United States citizen can now go to Cuba, which is still under an American economic embargo, as long as the travel is done with a group licensed by the Treasury Department. Abercrombie, the first elite travel company to offer this type of tour, has partnered with the Foundation for Caribbean Studies, a nonprofit organization, in order to make the trips possible. The foundation obtained its "people-to-people" license, as the new permits are being called, from the Treasury Department earlier this month and worked with Abercrombie to plan an itinerary that would put visitors in touch with people who could teach them about Cuba's history and culture. Participants will meet with a tobacco farmer, for example, and take a tour of Old Havana guided by a local architect. 
"We've built upon our experience in Cuba, as well as the rest of the world, to ensure our guests will discover Cuba at its most intimate, authentic and in complete comfort," Scott Wiseman, the President of Abercrombie & Kent USA, wrote in a statement. "We have arranged an expedited immigration process on arrival, exclusive accommodations at Cuba's best hotels and a carefully planned itinerary that includes private access to Hemingway's home, Finca Vigia, for an informative discussion with the curator and local staff involved in restoring the home and its lush surroundings."
Robert Kessler, a lawyer and engineer from Denver, was one of the first to sign up for a tour. He and his wife had tried to visit Cuba in 1959, but their plane was diverted to Nassau in the Bahamas after flight attendants announced that Fidel Castro's forces had taken the Havana airport. "I believe they said something like 'the airport is being shot up,' " Mr. Kessler said in a phone interview. Now 79, he is excited to have the opportunity to try again and said he was glad to have guidance of a group like Abercrombie in a place that he called "kind of ticklish."
The 10- and 11-day trips, which start at $4,325 per person for the 11-day version, will take visitors to Trinidad; Matanzas; Old Havana; Las Terrazas, an eco-village that is now a Unesco Biosphere Reserve; and into the countryside, among other destinations. Accommodations include rooms at the Iberostar Grand Hotel Trinidad and Havana's historic Hotel Nacional de Cuba. The first tour leaves Sept. 30, with five additional trips planned throughout the fall and winter.

HEADLINE: Long Story Shortlist: Dispatches From Haiti, Syria and the East Village

BYLINE: THE STAFF


HIGHLIGHT: This week's selection of "long reads" hails from all over the globe, from Second Avenue to Port-au-Prince to Okemos, Mich.

 BODY:
This week's selection of "long reads" hails from all over the globe, from Second Avenue to Port-au-Prince to Okemos, Mich.:
"In the East Village, Waiting for the Wrecking Ball," by Cara Buckley (July 15, 2011)In the beginning, there were two buildings. Eleven Second Avenue was squat, ugly and three stories tall. Its neighbor, 9 Second Avenue, was a five-story tenement. They sat next to each other on the west side of Second Avenue, between Houston and East First Streets. Read more 
"In Scarred Syria City, a Vision of a Life Free From Dictators," by Anthony Shadid (July 19, 2011)HAMA, Syria - In this city that bears the scars of one of the modern Middle East's bloodiest episodes, the revolt against President Bashar al-Assad has begun to help Syrians imagine life after dictatorship as it forges new leaders, organizes its own defense and reckons with a grim past in an uncertain experiment that showcases the forces that could end Mr. Assad's rule. Read more 
"Coming Together to Fight for a Troubled Veteran," by Erica Goode (July 17, 2011)OKEMOS, Mich. - When the standoff began on a humid August night, it seemed destined to become one more case of a returned soldier pulled down by a war he could not leave behind. Read more 
"Law School Economics: Ka-Ching!" by David Segal (July 16. 2011)With apologies to show business, there's no business like the business of law school. The basic rules of a market economy - even golden oldies, like a link between supply and demand - just don't apply. Legal diplomas have such allure that law schools have been able to jack up tuition four times faster than the soaring cost of college.Read more 
"The Would-Be Prince of Port-au-Prince," by Anand Giridharadas (July 15, 2011)Wyclef Jean was in a rare state: nervous. He was trying to stick to his new role of wonky Haitian statesman, but the road kept distracting him. We were driving through Port-au-Prince as dusk fell, and he would interrupt his own discourse on trade rules or egg imports to ask the driver why a fire was burning on the roadside or to complain that our headlights were tempting danger or to mumble that the police escort, which he suspected of working for the opposition, shouldn't sound its sirens. Read more 
"Beloved French Rocker Gets Back to Work After Brush With Death," by Steven Erlanger (July 15, 2011)Johnny Hallyday hasn't left the building, at least not yet. It's not that he hasn't tried - there have been a couple of suicide attempts, and even an effort at retirement. But that didn't last very long, he said in a long and good-natured interview.

HEADLINE: Michigan Lawmakers Call Auto Mileage Proposals 'Overly Aggressive'

BYLINE: JOHN M. BRODER


HIGHLIGHT: A letter conveys the concerns of the domestic automakers, which contend that they are at a disadvantage because Asian and European manufacturers depend less on sales of trucks, crossovers and minivans and can more easily meet the government targets.

 BODY:
Michigan's congressional delegation has warned in a letter to the White House that new automobile fuel economy and emissions standards being drafted by the Obama administration are "not reasonably feasible" given the state of current technology and consumer buying habits.
 Weighing in as negotiations between federal and state officials and the major automakers are nearing a decisive point, Michigan's two senators and 14 of its 15 House members said that the White House's goal of a 56.2 mile-per-gallon fleet average by 2025 would drive up new vehicle costs by thousands of dollars and cost hundreds of thousands of auto workers their jobs.
 The lawmakers said that the White House program, which has not been officially announced and is likely to change somewhat, is "overly aggressive" and would deny consumers the right to buy medium- and heavy-duty pickup trucks. They also expressed concern that the proposed new regulations would set rules 14 years in the future, while previous mileage rule-makings have had only a five-year life span. 
They say that it is impossible to predict the shape of the vehicle market so far in advance and that the new rules should be limited to 2017-2021. Regulations for model years 2012-2016 are already in place, setting an overall fleet average of 35.5 miles per gallon. The letter reflects the concerns of the domestic automakers, which contend that they are at a disadvantage compared with Asian and European manufacturers, which do not depend as much on sales of trucks, crossovers and minivans and which can more easily meet the aggressive government targets. A coalition of automakers is planning a series of radio advertisements in states with significant auto industry employment criticizing the administration's proposed mileage target.
Letter to the President on Fuel Economy
 The letter, signed by Michigan Republicans and Democrats, noted that the state's unemployment rate is currently 10.5 percent and urged the administration to slow down and consider the views of the Detroit-based car companies and the United Autoworkers before proposing a challenging new rule setting a 56.2 m.p.g. standard
 "Such a proposal would push beyond the limits of reasonably feasible technology development and would have significant negative ramifications for U.S. jobs and competitiveness," it stated. "Technology and economics must reasonably support the targets and goals for fuel economy improvement and greenhouse gas emissions reductions, and we are concerned that the administration's current approach is not leading in that direction."
 A White House spokesman, Clark Stevens, said that the administration shared the Michigan delegation's interest in the recovery of the domestic auto industry, and that ambitious new mileage targets would aid, not hinder, the car companies.
"We continue to have constructive engagement with automakers, labor, and other stakeholders, and will continue to consider issues and concerns raised by the delegation and others as we work towards a national program for model years 2017-2025 that will reduce dependence on oil and save families money at the pump while protecting consumer choice, creating jobs, and ensuring that the cars and trucks of the future are built in America," he said in an e-mailed statement.
 The only member of the Michigan delegation not to sign the letter was Representative John Conyers Jr., a Democrat. His office, in a statement, said that Mr. Conyers believed that higher fuel efficiency standards would be good for the industry and good for the country.
 "Mr. Conyers is standing up for higher fuel economy standards which will create jobs, not eliminate them," the statement said. "Mr. Conyers believes that a strict emissions standard will significantly reduce global warming, the thirst for oil and high gas pump costs. The higher standards set forth as a goal by the president could have the effect of reducing our appetite for oil, create jobs and significantly decrease billions of dollars to OPEC and others."
 The United Autoworkers expressed support this week for "strong" and "feasible" fuel efficiency standards, but did not specify what it meant by the terms. The U.A.W. president, Bob King, along with officials of the steelworkers' union and the Sierra Club said that new mileage standards could save consumers money at the gas pumps, create new domestic jobs and reduce the emissions that cause global warming. But the groups did not endorse a specific mileage figure.
 Representative Fred Upton, a Michigan Republican and chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, warned that federal agencies and the White House were embarked on a dangerous path.
 "As these negotiations unfold, the Michigan delegation is not going to stand by and watch the regulators in Washington hand down a set of standards that will destroy jobs, eliminate vehicle options for families and put America at a competitive disadvantage," Mr. Upton said in a statement Friday. "One of the most troubling aspects of these negotiations is the effort to set a standard through 2025, which is more than a decade and several generations of technology into the future. American manufacturers, autoworkers, and the car-buying public will be the ones who pay the price."
 Daniel Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign and a longtime environmental advocate and critic of the car companies, was critical of the lawmakers who have helped the automakers stave off previous efforts to improve vehicle efficiency.
 "Those wonderful folks who fought off attempts to make Detroit innovate are back urging President Obama to join their happy Luddite band," said Mr. Becker. "It is telling that their letter ignores the millions of barrels of oil, billions of tons of carbon dioxide and billions of dollars tough standards would save."

HEADLINE: Five Debt Questions in a Swirl of Uncertainty

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Five questions that remain unanswered as the debt crisis moves into its final two weeks.

 BODY:
One of the most astounding things about the debt fight consuming Washington is how many questions remain unanswered even for the politicians themselves who are racing against the clock to prevent an economic disaster.
Throughout the day on Thursday, Republicans and Democrats reacted explosively, armed with few real facts, as they sought to push a final deal in one direction or the other.
Senate Democrats met for about an hour behind closed doors, lambasting Jack Lew, the administration's budget director, over reports that President Obama was preparing to cut a deal that did not include any new revenues.
The only problem? Mr. Lew did not actually provide details of the plan that had so angered the Democratic lawmakers, and White House officials insisted that the deal the Senators were reacting to was nowhere near finalized -- at least not in the form that made them so angry.
It is "absolutely essential" that any grand bargain include revenue increases, Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, told reporters as the administration sought to extinguish a Democratic firestorm of criticism.
Among Republicans, the knowledge gap remains equally wide. Aides to Speaker John A. Boehner, who was reportedly deep in negotiations with Mr. Obama, would say only that "we are keeping the lines of communication open."
That lack of specificity didn't stop members of the Republican peanut gallery from criticizing, however. More than 85 House Republicans signed a letter opposing what has become known as the McConnell-Reid contingency plan to raise the debt ceiling.
The only problem? No one really seems to know what, exactly, the so-called McConnell-Reid contingency plan is.
"Look, what we know -- whatever it's called -- is that whatever the vehicle is to do this that Congress will act responsibly and ensure that the United States does not for the first time in its history risk default," Mr. Carney said. "What it's called I can't tell you. What the name on the bill will be, I cannot predict at this time."
The uncertainty surrounding basic facts has added to the carnival atmosphere in Washington as the Aug. 2 deadline approaches. The debate on Thursday ricocheted from Capitol Hill to the White House to the studios of cable news networks and back again -- even as most lawmakers appeared to concede that they knew little about the negotiations going on.
In that spirit, The Caucus has come up with five key questions that remain unanswered as the debt crisis moves into its final two weeks.
1. What's Boehner's magic number?
It seems crystal clear now that Mr. Boehner is willing to reach a deal that would pass with a combination of Democrats and Republicans in the House, but without a substantial portion of his caucus.
What remains unknown is how many Republicans Mr. Boehner is willing to sacrifice in the interests of getting a deal. Is it 35? Is it 75? Would he be willing to do a deal if it meant passing with the support of fewer than half of his own members?
The answer is crucial because it determines how far Mr. Obama and the Democrats can push, and how many concessions the president will have to make to win Republican support. If Mr. Boehner is willing to risk losing the support of a majority of his caucus, the final deal could be more appealing to Democrats.
The speaker appears willing to risk the loss of some of his most conservative members in the search for a possibly legacy-creating deal. But the danger for Mr. Boehner is that such a move could be political suicide that provides a clear path to a challenge for the speakership by one of his conservative colleagues. 
Mr. Boehner no doubt has a number in his head. We just don't know what it is.
2. How will Medicare and Social Security change? 
Just as it's clear that Mr. Boehner wants a grand deal, it's all but certain now that most Democrats seem willing to accept some changes to the entitlement programs they love so much. The question now is not will they change. The question is how?
Democrats in charge of electing more Democrats in 2012 are insisting that whatever changes take place allow the president to make the argument that the party has protected the basic nature of the social net programs. 
But that leaves the door open to a series of potential changes that could increase the revenues into the programs and cut down the costs.
For Social Security, that could mean a gradual increase in the retirement age or means testing that would make richer people pay more into the system. For Medicare, it could mean that providers (doctors, hospitals) get squeezed by lower reimbursement rates from the government. Or perhaps the wealthy elderly could pay a bit more.
What remains unclear is which changes might be part of a final package, and whether Democrats who support those changes can still run campaign ads next year that accuse Republicans of wanting to "end Medicare as we know it." 
3. Is timing everything? 
A perennial trick in Washington is to use timing to make anything work. Politicians who craft the federal government's budgets have become masters at tweaking the five- or 10-year projections to make the numbers work the way they need them to.
In the debt debate, it appears that Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner may be relying on similar gimmicks.
Republicans don't want to vote for a tax increase. Democrats insist on one. The solution may be a trick of timing to make both sides think they have gotten what they want.
The details are sketchy, but Mr. Obama might agree to a plan that would include $3 trillion worth of spending cuts and no taxes -- something Republicans could support. But it might also include a promise that Congress will enact tax reform during the next year that would increase revenues by $1 trillion.
Republicans could go home saying they did not vote for tax increases. (Literally, true.) And Democrats could crow that they found a way to insist that the government raise revenue. (Also, true.)
Could that timing work? More complicated tricks of the calendar have been tried -- successfully -- before.
4. How do the Bush tax cuts fit in?
As tough as the current tax fight seems, there's another one looming. President Obama agreed last year to extend the Bush-era tax cuts until the end of 2012, accepting the ire of his most ardent supporters along the way. A reprise of that fight is almost certain.
But snippets of information throughout the week have suggested that the Bush tax cuts could end up as a key part of the bargaining in the current debt fight.
One report suggested that the plan being discussed between Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner could automatically trigger an end to the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy at the end of 2012 if the Congress does not adhere to its promise to raise $1 trillion in new revenue next year.
That would do two things for Mr. Obama and his reluctant Democrats. It would reassure them that tax reform is real by providing a serious incentive for Republicans to deal straight. And it would eliminate the likelihood of a big political fight over increasing those taxes just as he campaigns for re-election.
5. What does life look like after a deal?
Perhaps the hardest question to answer -- and the one on the minds of just about every politician in Washington -- is how a grand bargain between the parties will ripple out, politically, over the next 18 months.
Will a deal benefit Mr. Obama, by proving to independents that he can get things accomplished in a bitterly divided city, as he promised during his 2008 campaign? Or will it demoralize a base that views it as another capitulation with Republicans.
Will a deal ensure Mr. Boehner's legacy as another Tip O'Neill, the famed Democratic House speaker who cut deals with Ronald Reagan? Or will it embolden conservative rivals like Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the majority leader, to try to challenge his leadership?
Will accepting a deal on changes to Medicare rob Democratic candidates of an issue that was working to put Republicans on the defensive? Or will it convince independents that they are serious about the future? 
And most important of all, perhaps: Will a deal that cuts trillions of dollars in spending and raises new revenue finally spark a confidence that turns the economy around by getting people to buy things, companies to hire workers banks to lend money?
That's the question that everyone wants the answer to.

HEADLINE: From Budget Cuts to Dirty Bombs

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. LUONGO and KENNETH C. BRILL. 
Kenneth N. Luongo, president of the Partnership for Global Security, was senior adviser for nonproliferation policy to the secretary of energy from 1994 to 1997. Kenneth C. Brill, president of the Fund for Peace, was the ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency from 2001 to 2004.

 BODY:
Washington
THE House of Representatives has decided that countering the threat of nuclear terrorism no longer deserves America's best efforts. Last week, it passed an energy and water budget bill that slashes the country's defenses against nuclear terrorism -- a threat both parties have long recognized as one of the most serious facing America. The Senate has the opportunity to reverse that mistake. If it does not, over a decade of nuclear security gains could evaporate.
This is the second time in six months that lawmakers have voted to cut funding for programs to prevent nuclear terrorism. Such programs have removed several tons of plutonium and highly enriched uranium from countries that might otherwise be unable to prevent those nuclear materials from falling into the hands of terrorists, made more than 1,000 buildings housing dangerous fissile and radioactive materials across the world more secure and strengthened security at many foreign ports and border crossings. 
The House budget cuts come on top of the unprecedented 14 percent reductions made to those programs in the current federal budget. By comparison, from 2001 through 2010, Congress cut the budget by a cumulative total of slightly less than 1 percent.
The House eliminated a program that seeks to remove and secure 1,900 radioactive sources -- sealed containers holding radioactive material -- throughout the United States. Those radioactive sources are no longer in use, but they remain dangerous.
The most well-known example of death from a radioactive source occurred in Goiania, Brazil, in 1987. Scavengers there found a radiotherapy machine in an abandoned building, dismantled it and accidentally dispersed the highly radioactive material inside the sealed source. Four people died and more than 100,000 others had to be screened for radiation exposure. The incident led to a huge clean-up effort and created widespread panic. And last year, a scrap-metal worker in India died after being exposed to a highly radioactive source, from a university chemistry laboratory, that had been illegally discarded in a scrap yard.
Here in the United States, many radioactive sources are small and portable, and they could easily be used in a ''dirty bomb.'' Some, like those used in many hospital machines, are of an extremely high intensity. For example, a single cesium-137 source in a typical hospital blood irradiator contains over 1,000 curies of radioactivity. If a stolen cesium-137 source were dispersed through an explosion, it could make a surrounding area of several city blocks uninhabitable, with devastating economic consequences. Indeed, around Chernobyl, where a Soviet reactor melted down in 1986, no humans are allowed in areas where the cesium concentration is just 40 curies per square kilometer.
In addition to domestic cuts, the House slashed funds for efforts to convert nuclear reactors across the world that run on bomb-grade, highly enriched uranium so that they use a less dangerous type of fuel. It is generally believed that only 88 to 130 pounds of highly enriched uranium are needed to create a crude nuclear device, and authoritative studies show that a terrorist group could build a bomb if it obtained such an amount. Indeed, Al Qaeda has publicly expressed an interest in building and using a nuclear device against America. The latest cut would delay the conversion of 126 reactors worldwide, many at locations with a record of inadequate security. Two of those reactors are in the United States.
Finally, programs aimed at preventing nuclear smuggling were cut by nearly 30 percent, directly limiting America's ability to expand detection of nuclear materials at key overseas ports.
Some legislators supporting the reductions argue that they are not shortchanging key national security programs, but rather focusing resources on achieving President Obama's goal of securing all vulnerable nuclear materials globally within four years. Indeed, the bill fully finances a number of important security activities in Russia and former Soviet countries. But Mr. Obama's four-year goal is just one among several interrelated nuclear security issues that need sustained attention to prevent nuclear terrorism.
Beltway budget battles always produce a lot of game-playing. But protecting America's security is not a political game. The programs the House has cut are proven, effective and prudent national security investments to prevent nuclear terrorism and its devastating consequences. Slashing America's best defense against nuclear terror will not make us safer or richer. In fact, it could invite the opposite result.
Some House members recognize that cutting this funding risks eroding a 15-year bipartisan legacy of global nuclear security and they successfully opposed a portion of the reduction. The Senate must follow their example by fully financing the nuclear security budget.

HEADLINE: As Recovery Moves Ahead, G.E. Tops Expectations

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
The re-engineering of General Electric -- a strategic overhaul begun in the depths of the financial crisis -- remains on track and shows steady progress.
That, analysts say, is the underlying theme of the company's second-quarter results on Friday, with profits and sales slightly surpassing Wall Street's expectations.
G.E. has been slimming down its huge finance arm, GE Capital, while increasingly relying on its bedrock industrial businesses for long-term growth. The finance business is mending, with operating profits more than doubling in the second quarter from the depressed level of a year ago. 
Indeed, GE Capital accounted for much of the profit improvement in the quarter. But industrial orders for equipment and services grew 24 percent during the quarter, and G.E.'s backlog of industrial orders reached a record $189 billion.
''GE Capital continues to get healthier, and industrial demand is picking up,'' said Steven Winoker, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. ''That is the progression the company needs for the strategy to work.''
The solid second-quarter results from G.E., the nation's largest industrial company, whose products range from jet engines to medical imaging machines, provide evidence of a gradually improving outlook for many industrial companies. Both Honeywell and Caterpillar reported sharply higher sales and profits on Friday and raised their earnings forecasts for the year. United Technologies and Goodrich also delivered strong results in recent days as well.
The strongest industrial growth for G.E., as for other large manufacturers, came in international markets, where revenue rose 23 percent in the quarter. Sales outside the United States account for 59 percent of G.E.'s industrial business.
''At least for companies that make advanced equipment that is often exported, there is a bit of manufacturing renaissance under way in the United States,'' said Richard Tortoriello, an analyst at Standard & Poor's.
Still, investors did not reward the industrial companies on a skittish day in the markets. Honeywell and G.E. shares slipped, with G.E. off 12 cents, to close at $19.04. Caterpillar reported a 44 percent jump in earnings, but that was a few cents below Wall Street estimates, and its shares fell $6.45, to $105.15.
G.E.'s net income for the second quarter rose 21 percent, to $3.76 billion, up from $3.11 billion in the period a year earlier.
The company reported operating earnings per share -- the measure of performance most closely watched by Wall Street analysts -- of 34 cents a share, up 17 percent from 29 cents a share in the period a year earlier.
The average estimate of analysts, as compiled by Thomson Reuters, was 32 cents a share.
G.E. reported revenue of $35.63 billion, down 4 percent from the $36.93 billion it reported in the quarter a year earlier. The falloff was a byproduct of the company's steps to narrow its focus, as it sold a majority stake in NBC Universal, the television network and movie studio, to Comcast. Excluding that from the year-to-year comparison, G.E.'s revenue would have increased 7 percent in this year's second quarter.
The company's revenue for the quarter was nearly $1 billion ahead of analysts' consensus estimate of $34.7 billion.
GE Capital, which has aggressively shed bad debt since the financial crisis hit in the fall of 2008, reported a 1 percent decline in revenue, to $11.63 billion in the second quarter, while operating profits jumped to nearly $1.66 billion, up from $743 million in the period a year earlier.
Some problems remain, mainly in commercial real estate, where it lost $335 million. Still, that was an improvement from a loss of $524 million in the second quarter of last year.
''The turnaround is in place, and it is a smaller, more focused GE Capital today,'' Keith Sherin, G.E.'s chief financial officer, said in an interview.
Despite the costly repair of its finance arm, G.E. has continued to invest aggressively to expand some of its industrial divisions.
In the last nine months, for example, the company has spent more than $7 billion on three acquisitions to bolster its oil and gas equipment business -- Dresser, the John Wood Group and Wellstream Holdings. The companies make specialized equipment for oilfield and offshore production, widening G.E.'s range of offerings in that $10 billion-a-year unit.
In a conference call, Jeffrey R. Immelt, G.E.'s chief executive, suggested that there would be no more sizable acquisitions for a while. In integrating the new businesses, he said, ''We have a lot on our plate already.''
Instead, he said, the company, which is based in Fairfield, Conn., will look to spend its extra cash on increasing the dividend and buying back shares.
G.E. has raised its dividend three times in the last year, to an annual level of 60 cents a share. But that is still less than half the $1.24 a share it had paid in early 2009, when the company had to sharply reduce its annual payout to shareholders to conserve cash. The move in 2009 was G.E.'s first dividend cut since the Depression.
Most of G.E.'s industrial businesses -- aviation, transportation, health care, and oil and gas -- showed solid improvement compared with last year. But profits were down 19 percent in its big energy business for power generation equipment -- gas, steam and wind turbines. G.E. executives described that business as a cyclical laggard, with orders already accumulating, and sales and profits poised to improve later this year.
Over all, Mr. Immelt said, ''We like our portfolio of businesses. We like the G.E. outlook.''
Online Correction: July 22, 2011, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article had an incorrect value for three General Electric acquisitions in its oil-and-gas equipment business. It was $7 billion, not $7 million.

HEADLINE: As Transit Chief Leaves Post, Challenges for Agency Persist

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY; Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo on Friday began a search for a new chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, as rider advocates, union leaders and analysts warned that the next leader of the agency faces a daunting set of financial and operational challenges.
The beleaguered transit agency, which manages subways, buses and commuter rail trains that are used by 8 million riders each day, faces a $9 billion deficit in its capital budget and difficult labor negotiations this fall. The agency is famously difficult to manage, with a $24 billion capital budget and a $12 billion operating budget, 66,000 employees, a vast ridership, and aging equipment. 
Jay H. Walder, who surprised the transit world by announcing Thursday that he plans to resign in October to take a job in Hong Kong, was appointed by Gov. David A. Paterson; with his departure, Mr. Cuomo will have his first opportunity to put his own stamp on the system.
''The governor views this as an opportunity to bring dramatic change and improvement to a system and an agency that millions of New Yorkers, and the entire New York State economy, depend on every day,'' said Josh Vlasto, a spokesman for the governor.
Mr. Walder had an often rocky relationship with the transit agency's unions, and the next chairman will have to oversee contract negotiations with Transport Workers Union Local 100, the powerful organization representing many of the city's subway and bus workers. The union's contract expires in January, and John Samuelson, the local's president, said negotiations were expected to begin in November.
Mr. Samuelson urged the next head of the authority to focus on preserving transit workers' jobs and subway service, before turning to long-term capital projects.
''You don't put an extension on your house when you can't pay the electric bill,'' Mr. Samuelson said. ''I have no intention of just caving in and letting New York City transit workers pay the price for a crisis we didn't create.''
Rider advocates said they were already apprehensive.
''We're looking for a chief who has, quite frankly, backbone,'' said Paul Steely White, executive director of Transportation Alternatives. ''If you look at the history of New York's economy, it has always risen and fallen with the state of the transit system.''
Mr. White said that Mr. Walder faced criticism for presiding over a fare increase and service cuts, but that he won praise for efforts to improve bus service and make the agency more transparent.
Gene Russianoff, a lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, a rider advocacy organization, said Mr. Walder had pledged to avoid raising fares or cutting service in 2012, and he called on Mr. Walder's successor to honor that promise.
''Riders are used to getting things better, not worse,'' Mr. Russianoff said.
Mr. Cuomo's choice as M.T.A. chairman must be approved by the State Senate, and some lawmakers said they would seek to avoid a repeat of the current situation, in which Mr. Walder is leaving just two years into his six-year contract.
''The timing couldn't have been worse,'' said Senator Carl L. Marcellino, a Long Island Republican. ''I think we ought to build in some safeguards for the people. I don't want to see somebody leaving again after a short time.''
Richard Ravitch, a former Metropolitan Transportation Authority chief, said that the agency faced a challenge because the chairman's job was extraordinarily difficult and did not pay as well as some private-sector jobs. Mr. Walder was paid $350,000 -- a high salary by most measures -- but he is expected to make significantly more than that as chief executive of the MTR Corporation in Hong Kong.
''He's 52 years old, and he had the opportunity to do something that provided long-term financial security,'' Mr. Ravitch said. ''It's very hard to get good people to go into government.''

HEADLINE: Survivor of Attack Accelerates Iran's Effort to Produce Nuclear Material

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Eight months after he narrowly survived an assassination attempt on the streets of Tehran, Fereydoon Abbasi, the nuclear physicist whom Iran's mullahs have put in charge of the country's Atomic Energy Organization, is presiding over what intelligence officials in several countries describe as an unexpected quickening of Iran's production of nuclear material.
The selection of Dr. Abbasi earlier this year was itself a clear message to the West. As a university scientist, he was barred from traveling outside Iran by the United Nations Security Council because of evidence that his main focus was on how to build nuclear weapons, rather than power plants. But in recent weeks he has publicly declared that his country is preparing to triple its production of a type of nuclear fuel that moves it far closer to the ability to produce bomb-grade material in a hurry. 
Filtering out the hyperbole surrounding recent proclamations about Iran's tangible progress is always difficult, especially at a time when the country is determined to show that neither the Stuxnet computer worm, which crippled part of its nuclear infrastructure last year, nor Western sanctions have proved to be more than modest setbacks. Dr. Abbasi himself is rarely seen or heard outside of Iran.
But international nuclear inspectors and American officials say that all the evidence points to the imminent installation of centrifuges at an underground nuclear plant on a military base near the city of Qum. Iran revealed the existence of the plant in 2009, after learning that the United States and European powers were about to announce that they had discovered the complex, deep inside the Iranian base.
What concerns inspectors and European and American officials is Iran's announced effort to increase production of uranium enriched to nearly 20 percent purity. Iran insists that it needs that fuel for a medical research reactor. But last week William Hague, the British foreign minister, dismissed that assertion as a cover story.
''When enough 20 percent enriched uranium is accumulated at the underground facility at Qum,'' Mr. Hague said in the British newspaper The Guardian, ''it would take only two or three months of additional work to convert this into weapons-grade material.''
Outside analysts note that during Dr. Abbasi's brief tenure in his new job, Iran's top leaders have focused on showing that they have overcome multiple setbacks, inflicted by what they suspect to have been covert actions by the United States and Israel, and broad economic sanctions.
''The evidence is there that they are accelerating,'' said Mark Fitzpatrick, an Iran expert and the director of the nonproliferation and disarmament program at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. ''They have increased the production of uranium, they have increased the number of centrifuges they have spinning, they are putting in a larger number of second-generation centrifuges.''
Senior Obama administration officials with access to the intelligence say they concur with that assessment, but they do not sound alarmed. They argue that Iran's continued reliance on an older, unreliable centrifuge model shows that it is having trouble making the leap to more sophisticated and efficient models. ''They've talked about moving up the line for years, before Abbasi got the job,'' said one senior official.
The White House's silence is notable because President Obama built much of his Middle East policy, before the recent Arab uprisings, on organizing other countries in the region to halt Iran's nuclear progress. The administration commented on the most recent Iranian announcements only when asked.
''Iran is prohibited from installing or operating any centrifuges as a result of the U.N. sanctions that have been imposed upon it,'' Tommy Vietor, the spokesman for the National Security Council, said when asked about Mr. Abbasi's recent announcements. ''Provocative behavior of this sort reinforces the need for countries to implement fully their international sanctions obligations with respect to Iran.''
Diplomats say that Dr. Abbasi's approach to nuclear diplomacy is a stark contrast with that of his predecessor at the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, Ali Akbar Salehi. Mr. Salehi, a graduate of M.I.T. with a degree in nuclear engineering, is a polished diplomat who speaks fluent English and handles the news media with ease.
Dr. Abbasi is ''not as skillful -- or as comfortable,'' said a diplomat in Vienna who recently saw him in action when he visited Austria for a nuclear safety conference. ''He's very stiff with the press.'' Since Dr. Abbasi has become one of the country's top government officials, he has received periodic exemptions from the United Nations travel ban.
According to Mashreghnews, an Iranian news Web site, Dr. Abbasi holds a doctorate in nuclear physics and has been a member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps since Iran was founded in 1979. The Revolutionary Guards run the country's nuclear weapons research effort and for years has deflected demands from inspectors for details about what are suspected of being experiments that would suggest work on a weapon.
In March 2007, the Security Council put Dr. Abbasi on its sanctions list because of allegations that he had ties to the Iranian nuclear effort, which poses a diplomatic problem: the man insisting that Iran's effort is entirely peaceful is suspected of working on elements of weapons experimentation.
The United Nations described Dr. Abbasi as a senior scientist in the Ministry of Defense who was ''working closely'' with Mohsen Fakhrizadeh -- an officer in the Revolutionary Guards considered by Western intelligence to be a leader in Tehran's effort to acquire nuclear arms.
Mr. Fakhrizadeh has not been seen in public in years. Dr. Abbasi's experience may explain why: driving to work on Nov. 29, 2010, Dr. Abbasi saw a motorcyclist plant a bomb on the door of his car. He escaped, pulling his wife with him, seconds before it detonated. A separate attack that day killed one of his colleagues. Iran variously blamed the Mossad and the United States.
As the leader of Iran's effort to enrich uranium, Dr. Abbasi has overseen the stabilization of the plant at Natanz, in the desert. And, at a hollowed-out mountain near Qum, he is spearheading the expansion of Iran's enrichment program into underground halls.
Diplomats said the mountain site, known as Fordow, was about to receive its first centrifuges -- machines that spin fast to purify uranium. In June, Dr. Abbasi announced that Iran would triple production of its most concentrated form of uranium and shift some production to Fordow from Natanz.
''It's a real policy escalation to triple the production,'' the Viennese diplomat noted. ''It's provocative.''

HEADLINE: In the Hamptons, Where the Ferraris Flock

BYLINE: By SARAH MASLIN NIR; With Anika Chapin, Jed Lipinski and Rachel Nolan.

 BODY:
We were balled up in a fetal position in the tiny back seat of a black Ferrari convertible as it cruised across the Hamptons last Saturday afternoon. As we lost feeling in our legs, we listened while a passenger tried to convince himself it was a ''practical'' family car.
While we don't go out much during the day, the invitation to a ride-along on an all-Ferrari rally -- followed by a polo match and party -- seemed a unique chance to witness ostentation on the scale of Imelda Marcos's shoe collection. 
We slathered on sunscreen, and wedged ourselves into the 2011 California.
The car was one of several owned by Nathaniel Christian, a real estate developer and the event's host. More than 60 Ferraris participated in the ride, fanning out along the back roads of the East End, as photographers furiously snapped along the way. At the rally's start, Mr. Christian pulled out the wrong key. ''This always happens,'' he said. ''Too many Ferrari keys.''
Eli Schwartz, a lawyer, trades in his Ferrari every year for a new model. His other car, he said, is a Hyundai. ''He's only kidding,'' said his wife, Amy. ''Don't print that.''
We didn't understand the joke. ''I was just trying to think of the cheapest car out there,'' Mr. Schwartz said.
The cars ended at a private estate in Water Mill for a polo match, though few watched. The match seemed like a fish tank in a dentist's office -- mostly for ambience.
Ed Westwick, who cruised around in a borrowed Ferrari all weekend, pulled into the party briefly -- at least until the sports car's siren call became too strong to resist any longer, and he peeled away.
Clearly, it's more fun to be behind the wheel than scrunched in the back seat.
'A-List' Invitation
Perhaps it's the hollows under our eyes from endless nights out. Perhaps it's our prominent keyboard-induced hunchbacks. Maybe it's the impressive salaries that people who write for a living make.
Whatever the reason, Nocturnalist and her correspondents sometimes find phone numbers scrawled into their notebooks, or their sea bass filleted.
In short, it seems we sometimes get, um, approached.
But on Tuesday night, at a publicity event for the second season of the gay reality television show ''The A-List: New York,'' held at District 36, a nightclub on West 36th Street in Manhattan, we were courted in a novel way.
The show's newest cast member is Nyasha Zimucha, a straight woman, in a line-up made up mostly of gay men. She runs Embrace Your Hair, a wig company. (Isn't that embracing someone else's hair?)
''All this water and not a drop to drink,'' she said looking around at the sea of stunning gay men at the party, including her cast mate Derek Saathoff, a model who has his own line of bronzer called TanSexual.
Ms. Zimucha fixed her attentions on Nocturnalist's male correspondent with the intensity of the orange glow on Mr. Saathoff's hairless chest.
''Will you please roofie my drink while I'm gone?'' she said, referring to the slang name of Rohypnol, a drug we're familiar with only from ''Law & Order: S.V.U.'' ''Because you're my only hope for tonight.''
We declined.
We adjourned to the dance floor, over which the season premiere was being projected.
Someone was watching us. It was Ms. Zimucha.
A few minutes later, a friend of hers approached us with a message. Ms. Zimucha thinks we're cute. Would we go out with her?
A moment later, Ms. Zimucha appeared on the screen where the season's first episode was being projected; she was screaming and flailing wildly. On screen, the other cast members cowered.
We declined.
Irish Village
The chilly black-box theater and the brogues during the premiere of ''The Parting Glass'' on Thursday night transported us from the scorching West Village outside, to Ireland, where the play is set. Guests like Noel Kilkenny, the Irish consul general, laughed at jokes almost incomprehensible to non-Celtic audience members, though Nocturnalist's correspondent understood enough to tear up at the many sad parts.
The one-man play, by Dermot Bolger, details one man's suffering through the country's economic crisis. The play, which is showing at the Barrow Street Theater and stars Ray Yeates, didn't exactly cast the country in cheery light.
''We're not trying to pretend that we didn't make mistakes,'' Mr. Kilkenny said after the show. ''We're not out rioting in the streets back in Ireland; we're taking our medicine. If literature and drama is already coming out of the crisis, well, good.''
Attendees at the after-party, like Niamh Ni Chonchubhair, the show's producer (the only thing more Irish than her name was her bright red hair) complained about the heat outside the well-air-conditioned theater. Ms. Chonchubhair said she had been ''walking around Manhattan all day leaving Niamh-shaped puddles on the sidewalk.''
Perhaps that's why they stayed until 1 a.m.

HEADLINE: Fair Deals in New York and Connecticut

 BODY:
There are now thousands of workers in New York and Connecticut whose jobs depend on the good sense of their fellow union members.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York and Gov. Dannel Malloy of Connecticut have negotiated fair new contracts with union leaders. The agreements freeze or hold down wage increases and the states' health insurance costs. They also come with promises not to lay off workers -- for four years in Connecticut and two years in most cases in New York. 
Giving up wage increases and paying more for health benefits is never easy. But the alternative is far worse. If those contracts are not approved, the states' budgets will have to be balanced by cutting state jobs and services, hurting workers, residents and the local economy.
In Connecticut, where a majority of union members accepted the offer, the agreement failed because of an arcane voting system that required the equivalent of 80 percent approval. Mr. Malloy's office is getting ready to lay off up to 6,500 workers, and the governor has announced reductions in sports and arts programs in schools and a cutback in services for AIDS patients and for the elderly.
Hoping to avoid the worst, union leaders have enacted new bylaws to make it easier for a majority to approve the package in a second vote. The leaders and the governor agreed late Friday on ''clarifications,'' which should make it easier for union workers to approve the complicated contract.
Governor Cuomo has negotiated five-year contracts with the Public Employees Federation, the state's white-collar union, and with the Civil Service Employees Association. If these and other contracts being negotiated aren't approved, the governor threatened to lay off nearly 9,800 workers. A vote is scheduled for August, and unions are sending out mailings and pitching the contracts to members one on one. They are right not to take chances.
Union members in both states should approve the deals. They are fair and will ensure that 16,300 state workers can keep their jobs and residents will keep fundamental services.

HEADLINE: Labor Peace Within Reach For Two N.F.L. Leaders

BYLINE: By JUDY BATTISTA

 BODY:
After the tumult of Thursday, the N.F.L. went mostly silent Friday. That was in recognition of the mourning for the Patriots owner Robert Kraft's wife, Myra, whose funeral in Boston was attended by other owners, league officials and the players association executive director, DeMaurice Smith.
But it was also a testament to how quickly the volume had been lowered after the dramatic series of events Thursday evening brought the league -- depending on what time you checked -- to the brink of a labor settlement or to open hostility. 
By Friday morning, Smith had calmed players, some of whom earlier had felt rushed by the owners' approval of a settlement players said they had not seen, said a person briefed on Smith's Thursday night conference call.
In Boston, Smith spoke to N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell after the service for Kraft's wife. And players had turned to seeking changes to a couple of settlement terms.
With a settlement seemingly in reach, it is clear that Smith and Goodell will get the credit for herding their constituencies during negotiations that sometimes seemed absurd.
Smith, who had no connection with the N.F.L. before he became the head of the players union, was virtually unknown to many owners and had only a limited relationship with Goodell when negotiations began.
But his bond with Goodell has grown during negotiations -- they have had several previously undisclosed meals together -- even as both wrestled to keep their groups, both of which had hard-liners, on track.
This contract, because it establishes the financial framework for the league for the next decade, is almost certain to be the most important thing both men accomplish during their tenures, and it will define their legacies. As negotiations took on the most difficult issues, the two were in touch regularly, even when the sides were not negotiating directly.
Much of Thursday's owners' meeting was spent hashing out supplemental revenue sharing among owners, another difficult issue Goodell had to shepherd through to make the labor deal palatable to owners across the revenue spectrum. Even during Thursday's twists in the labor deal -- the reconstitution of the union had become a primary problem -- Goodell and Smith spoke on the phone several times, including an extended conversation in the late afternoon just before owners voted. If the timing of the owners' vote caught players off guard, the contents of the agreement certainly could not have.
''I just spoke to DeMaurice probably 20 minutes ago,'' Goodell said after the owners' ratification was announced. ''He's going to go take care of his business.''
On the conference call with players Thursday night, Smith repeatedly reminded player representatives that they had not yet seen the owners' settlement and told them not to make a decision without seeing it. Smith was businesslike throughout, one person on the call said, even though when the call began players were confused about what had just happened with owners. Smith reiterated that they were not on anybody's deadline but their own and that they should not get mad because they felt someone was pressuring them.
As a result, the mood on Friday was hopeful. Players intended to work through the weekend to resolve the final issues, and a vote on the settlement is ''absolutely possible'' over the weekend, said a person briefed on the players' deliberations. There was an increasing sense that players would eventually ratify the agreement, re-form the union and return to football.
Some players want an opt-out between the six- and eight-year mark of the 10-year deal. They want more time to re-form their union and negotiate issues that must be collectively bargained (including drug testing and personal conduct policies) than the three-day window the league set out in its agreement. And San Diego receiver Vincent Jackson is believed to still be seeking either a financial settlement or free agency as a named plaintiff.
''They are by no means deal breakers,'' one person briefed on the players' thinking said of the outstanding issues. ''De and Roger have come too far to have this blow up in their faces.''
Goodell and Smith, along with officials from both sides, are expected to talk over the weekend in hopes of firming up the final details of an agreement.
The N.F.L. can't seem to escape drama, though. It was clear that the celebratory rollout of the owners' ratification in Atlanta contributed to the players' sense that owners were trying to put pressure on them to hurry up and agree to a deal. After the theatrics of Thursday, a new potential legal threat emerged.
On Friday, the California attorney general's office issued subpoenas seeking documents from the N.F.L. and the players association for an investigation into potential antitrust violations that may have resulted from the lockout. The goal: an injunction to stop the lockout, if negotiations do not soon result in a settlement that would restart the game. The attorney general's office contends that California could soon suffer economic harm because the San Diego Chargers play a preseason game at home on Aug. 11, and if that game is canceled because of the lockout, it could jeopardize income and jobs related to the game.
''These are tough times,'' the attorney general, Kamala D. Harris, said in a statement. ''The people who will really be locked out are the stadium workers and small businesses who rely on N.F.L. games for their livelihood.''
The decision to issue the subpoenas came after the N.F.L. canceled the Hall of Fame Game, scheduled for Aug. 7, on Thursday.
''We will cooperate fully,'' the players association spokesman George Atallah said.
The league said it had not yet seen the subpoena.
''The point of yesterday's vote was to try to put in place an agreement that would end the work stoppage and avoid the loss of any games,'' the N.F.L. spokesman Greg Aiello said Friday. ''We are making progress and hope to bring it to a resolution as soon as possible.''

PERSON: Bruce G. Sundlun 

HEADLINE: Bruce Sundlun, 91, Rhode Island Governor With Flair

BYLINE: By MARGALIT FOX

 BODY:
Bruce G. Sundlun, a former Democratic governor of Rhode Island whose tenure was marked by dramatic events both public and private, including a statewide banking crisis on his first day in office and a lawsuit -- happily resolved -- by a Midwestern teenager who said she was his daughter, died on Thursday at his home in Jamestown, R.I. He was 91.
His family announced the death, The Associated Press reported. 
A millionaire who made his fortune in telecommunications, Mr. Sundlun cut a larger-than-life figure that seemed inversely proportional to the size of his state. He was a multiply decorated war hero. He had multiple homes. He had multiple marriages and multiple divorces. His exploits were widely chronicled by the local and national news media.
He was combustible, confrontational and combative. ''One of his printable nicknames was 'Captain Blowhard,' '' The Providence Journal noted in a blog on Thursday.
Mr. Sundlun served two terms as governor from 1991 to 1995, a period of deep economic recession in the region. The public drama began on the first day of his first term.
On Jan. 1, 1991, less than an hour after being sworn in, Mr. Sundlun announced that he was closing 45 of the state's banks and credit unions because their private insurer, the Rhode Island Share and Deposit Indemnity Corporation, had collapsed. (Mostly small, local institutions, they had not been insured through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.)
Both widely praised and widely condemned, the governor's action froze more than $1 billion in the accounts of 300,000 depositors -- nearly a third of the state's population. A year and a half of vitriolic public protests ensued, including one in which Mr. Sundlun was burned in effigy.
The money was eventually returned through a taxpayer-financed bailout plan overseen by Mr. Sundlun.
Bruce George Sundlun was born in Providence, R.I., on Jan. 19, 1920, into a Jewish family that had come from Lithuania. His parents, Walter Irving Sundlun and the former Jan Zelda Colitz, owned a jewelry store in Pawtucket, R.I.
After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Bruce Sundlun enlisted in the Army Air Corps and became a bomber pilot in Europe. In 1943, his B-17 was shot down and he parachuted into occupied Belgium. He made his way to France, where he joined the Maquis, a rural guerrilla arm of the Resistance. With them, he made nighttime raids on German convoys near the Swiss border.
For his wartime service, he was awarded a Purple Heart, a Distinguished Flying Cross and an Air Medal with oak leaf cluster. France named him a chevalier of the Legion of Honor.
After the war, Mr. Sundlun earned a bachelor's degree from Williams College and a law degree from Harvard. He was an assistant United States attorney in Washington before going into business.
In the 1970s, Mr. Sundlun became president and chief executive of the Outlet Company, a Providence-based retail and broadcasting concern founded in the 19th century. Under his stewardship, the company shifted its focus exclusively to broadcasting. Renamed Outlet Communications, it eventually owned more than a dozen radio and television stations.
Mr. Sundlun first ran for governor in 1986 and was defeated in the general election by the Republican candidate, Edward D. DiPrete; Mr. DiPrete defeated him again two years later. In 1990, Mr. Sundlun defeated Mr. DiPrete in a landslide, winning 74 percent of the vote.
In 1993, during his second term in office, Mr. Sundlun, then 73, was sued by Kara Hewes, a 17-year-old Michigan girl he had never met. In the 1970s, Mr. Sundlun, who was single at the time, had had a relationship with her mother, Judith Hewes.
In a paternity suit filed in Michigan, Kara Hewes asserted that Mr. Sundlun was her biological father and sought financial support from him. A week later, Mr. Sundlun and Kara, smiling broadly and holding hands, appeared at a news conference to announce a settlement. Under its terms, he acknowledged Kara as his daughter and agreed to pay her college tuition.
The story had an even happier coda in 2003, when Mr. Sundlun's daughter, by then television newscaster known as Kara Sundlun, was married in Newport, R.I. Her father, who was 83 at the time, walked her down the aisle. Ms. Sundlun is now an anchor at WFSB, a CBS affiliate in Hartford.
In 1994, Mr. Sundlun ran for a third term as governor but was defeated in the Democratic primary. He later taught political science at the University of Rhode Island.
Mr. Sundlun's first four marriages -- to Madeleine Schiffer Eisner, Pamela Soldwedel Barrett, Joyanne Carter and Marjorie Lee -- ended in divorce. Besides his daughter, Kara, his survivors include his fifth wife, Soozie Dittelman; three sons from his first marriage, Tracy, Stuart and Peter; stepchildren; grandchildren; and stepgrandchildren.
For all the bluster of his public persona, Mr. Sundlun was not entirely without self-knowledge.
''Just last week, a guy wrote in The Providence Journal that I was -- and I quote -- 'boorish, aloof, and, at times, inappropriate,' '' he told the newspaper in an interview last year. ''My first reaction was, 'So what?' ''

HEADLINE: The Tax Pledge, and Government's Role

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Read My Lips: No New Taxes'' (Op-Ed, July 22):
Grover G. Norquist's naive ideology holds that government should be restricted. In that worldview, specious comparisons to household budgets and responsibility are frequently made. 
The government is not a single household but many. And while a single family may appear to have stable, manageable expenses, there are as many emergencies in Republican families as there are in Democratic families: repairs, medical problems, college.
Families change and age, incurring numerous unexpected expenses. A government has wars, a growing and aging population. How is it possible to govern a country with a pledge not to raise taxes? Isn't such a pledge one not to cooperate with colleagues? Who among employers hires a prospective employee who pledges to be uncooperative?
Withdrawing the pledge would enable our representatives to work as a body, without being bullied by ignorance, arrogance and selfishness.
DANIEL ROTHMAN Venice, Calif., July 22, 2011
To the Editor:
I find it jaw-dropping that almost all the Republicans in Congress have signed a pledge concocted by a single private citizen, Grover G. Norquist. I thought the purpose of elections is to have those who are elected represent those who voted for them. I assume that Mr. Norquist counts for only one vote.
Beyond that outrage is Mr. Norquist's parsing of what constitutes a ''tax increase.'' Does he think that we're still all in grade school or that what is being discussed is not of utmost importance?
His conclusion that ''runaway spending'' is ''killing the jobs we need'' raises the question, Isn't that spending used to hire people and to buy merchandise from companies that in turn need to hire additional workers? Doesn't sound like job-killing to me.
NEIL STEIN Brooklyn, July 22, 2011
To the Editor:
Grover G. Norquist's tax pledge makes complete sense if the world stopped in 1986. The population did not increase. We did not choose to fight three wars. Best yet, we did not age.
This pledge is a fantasy and does not account for changes forced by circumstances. Granted, the debt is a result of spending not backed by revenue, but the issue is not overspending. Rather, it is insufficiently taxing to pay for our collective needs and desires ourselves.
This simplistic pledge artificially links the function of government to the budget. It completely avoids the harder overall political question, What is the proper role of government in our lives at the federal, state and local levels?
QUENTIN CHIN Pittsfield, Mass., July 22, 2011
To the Editor:
It doesn't matter what line of logic Grover G. Norquist uses to defend his stranglehold on the Republican Party; his ''no tax increases'' mantra is not the panacea for what ails our economy, and his continuing threats of electoral ruin against Congressional Republicans who even consider tax increases have led us to the very precipice of default.
The question for Republicans is, Do you continue to do the bidding of a man whose only interest is starving the government into submission, or do you throw off the shackles and do what is right for the country?

HEADLINE: Players in a Greek Drama: Ratings Agencies Play Starring Role on Global Stage

BYLINE: By JULIE CRESWELL

 BODY:
This summer, David Riley is one of the world's most powerful financial analysts.
Not only does he have the power to effectively put a ''sell'' on Uncle Sam, but on Friday he roiled global markets after he said the Greek rescue package would constitute a limited default on the country's debt.
The analyst, who is based in London, oversees the 30-person government bonds team inside Fitch Ratings, which could soon downgrade the debt of the United States government from its historical, gold-plated, triple-A rating if politicians in Washington cannot agree to raise the debt limit.
And after two days of whirlwind conference calls with colleagues in London and New York to weigh what the Greek restructuring proposals might look like and how Fitch would respond, Mr. Riley and his team stamped a ''restricted default'' on Greece Friday morning. The details of the $157 billion bailout plan were announced Thursday by European leaders. 
The reverberations of a downgrade by Fitch or its competitors, Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service, often send borrowing costs soaring for the affected governments while typically putting equity and debt markets into a tailspin as investors run for cover.
That power and responsibility has made Mr. Riley and his team figures -- and often targets for critics -- in the debt drama sweeping the globe this year.
''People don't know who is selling Italian bonds or who is going short Spanish securities or who is betting on a Greek default,'' Mr. Riley said in an interview. ''But a headline that says 'Greece downgraded' is a simple one to understand and you can point the finger at who did it very easily.''
His team recently received hostile e-mails labeling them ''idiots'' or blaming them for the harsh austerity measures many European countries have adopted. He is on the speed dial of European policy makers and United States Treasury Department officials who are eager to convince him that their belt-tightening plans are sufficient to avoid a negative report. His days are filled with calls from managers of pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies and other asset managers trying to gauge what might spur a downgrade or a default and how that would affect their holdings of that country's bonds.
All the while, Mr. Riley and his staff are running internal ''war games,'' exploring what might happen to money market funds, financial institutions and even individual state finances if the United States were to default on its debt.
Some of the agencies' harshest critics, however, wonder why the rating agencies still wield so much power. Are they acting like disinterested parties in the American debt-ceiling talks or driving the discussions and their own agendas through their demands, they ask. Standard & Poor's, for instance, has said that if any debt-ceiling deal did not include an agreement to reduce the nation's deficit by $4 trillion over the next decade, the United States was still at risk of losing its triple-A rating.
''No nation, agency or organization has the authority to dictate terms to the United States government,'' Representative Dennis J. Kucinich, Democrat of Ohio, said in mid-July after Moody's placed the United States on review for possible downgrade. ''Moody's and its compatriot S.& P. were the direct cause of the near-collapse of the economy of the United States.''
Mr. Kucinich and others place significant blame on the rating agencies and their conflict-ridden business models -- they are paid by the issuers they rate -- for much of the financial crisis around mortgage-related securities. The agencies put gold-standard ratings on mortgage-related securities that held increasingly risky home loans while raking in fees from Wall Street banks. Investors bought those securities on the belief that the triple-A rating made them as safe as United States Treasuries.
Others, however, say the agencies may simply be forcing governments, including the United States, to take some strong medicine.
''They do see their job as looking down the road'' in asking that whatever debt deal is struck that it addresses the huge United States deficit, said Cornelius Hurley, director of the Boston University Center for Finance, Law and Policy.
Mr. Riley, a 45-year-old Briton and father of two, has spent the last decade inside Fitch evaluating governments around the world. He worked as a senior economist at UBS Warburg and, before that was an adviser inside Britain's Treasury department.
To relieve some of the pressure, Mr. Riley says he tries to play with Fitch's soccer team at lunchtime on Tuesdays and that he occasionally plays PlayStation games with his 17-year-old son.
He says he and his team at Fitch have developed thick skins to deal with the pressure.
''We know that we're under considerable scrutiny and we want to make sure we respond and do the best possible job that we can,'' he said. ''We're doing the work and the analysis, double-checking it and making sure we have our numbers right.''
He also doesn't view the jockeying being done by global policy makers as lobbying or overt efforts to influence his decision about a country's ratings.
''It's important if we're trying to provide an informed rating and commentary that we understand what policy makers are trying to achieve and what their plans are,'' Mr. Riley said. He added that he had had to tell global leaders this year that their region's ratings were being downgraded. ''That's something that's never welcomed,'' Mr. Riley said.
This year Fitch downgraded the government creditworthiness of Greece, Portugal and Spain. It has Ireland on a ''negative outlook'' but has reaffirmed France's and Italy's status.
Mr. Riley started to turn more attention to the American debt ceiling after the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, sent a letter to Congress on May 16 alerting members that the country had reached its statutory debt limit and that measures had been taken to provide cash for the summer. The government has until Aug. 2 to raise the $14.3 trillion debt ceiling or risk not being able to make certain payments on its debt.
On June 8, Fitch published a report titled: ''Thinking the Unthinkable -- What if the Debt Ceiling Was Not Increased and the U.S. Defaulted?'' The report said if the cap was not raised in time, Fitch would likely put the United States on ''rating watch negative.'' If a payment were missed on a Treasury security, the rating on that security could tumble from triple A to B+, the agency warned.
Since then, Mr. Riley said he had tried to avoid the ''political theater'' around the debt-ceiling talks. ''We're not calling the contacts that we have inside Washington asking, 'Can you give us the inside track? Did Obama really walk out of that meeting?' '' Mr. Riley said, adding: ''It would be interesting to know, but it's not relevant to us.''
He and his team have held discussions with Treasury officials on the debt-ceiling issue and on the bigger issue of reducing the deficit. ''The very clear message we've heard in our discussions is, 'no ifs, ands or buts, the U.S. will not default on its debt,' '' Mr. Riley said.
''It is not for us to design the deficit-reduction strategy,'' Mr. Riley said. ''We're not saying that the U.S. has to reduce the deficit by some number, but the detail around its plan and the credibility behind how the plan is actually going to be implemented is almost as important as the headline itself.''

HEADLINE: Legal Marijuana in Arizona, but Not for the Sellers

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY

 BODY:
PHOENIX -- Marijuana is known to cause red eyes, gales of laughter and the munchies. In Arizona, add another side effect: utter confusion.
Voters narrowly approved a ballot initiative last November allowing medical marijuana in the state, but the result has been just the opposite of an orderly system of dispensing cannabis to the truly sick. Rather, police raids, surreptitious money transfers and unofficial pot clubs have followed passage of the new law, creating a chaotic situation not far removed from the black-market system that has always existed.
''There's confusion,'' said Ross Taylor, who owns CannaPatient, a newly formed company that helps patients get the medical certification required to receive state-issued medical marijuana cards. ''There are a lot of unsure people, and not just because of what happened to me.''
The police raided Mr. Taylor's home in June, one of several instances in which the authorities in the state have showed signs of resisting carrying out the new law, which took effect at the start of the year. 
Gov. Jan Brewer -- who campaigned against the law, then signed it with reluctance -- said in May that the state, which has issued more than 7,500 cards to medical marijuana patients, would delay issuing licenses to marijuana dispensaries, as the law requires. Instead, she filed suit in federal court seeking a ruling on whether the state's medical marijuana law conflicted with federal prohibitions on marijuana. So the patients have their cards permitting them to buy marijuana in Arizona, but no official place to do so.
Arizona is not just another state when it comes to marijuana. More Mexican-grown marijuana enters this state than any other, according to federal government data. On June 8, the authorities recovered more than 1,200 pounds from an S.U.V. that led them on a 20-mile chase through dirt roads near the border.
The police operation that took place the next day in Gilbert, a community outside Phoenix, netted a considerably smaller haul: about two ounces. In that case, the police executed a search warrant on Mr. Taylor's house after getting a tip from the cable man. The officers, Mr. Taylor said, did not appear interested in his medical marijuana card, which permits him to grow up to a dozen marijuana plants in his home or obtain up to 2.5 ounces from a caregiver or a dispensary.
The police said they were pursuing those taking advantage of the new marijuana law.
The law does not permit the sale of marijuana outside of nonprofit dispensaries. But because the state has yet to approve any such outlets to sell marijuana, other ways of getting the drug are being tried.
Last month, the police raided the offices of a group in Tempe that was growing marijuana and selling it to cardholders. Garry Ferguson, founder of the organization, the Medical Marijuana Advocacy Group, told reporters that he understood the law to allow the sale of marijuana from one cardholder to another.
Unofficial cannabis clubs, not mentioned in the law, are also emerging. They purport to offer free marijuana to cardholders, albeit for a membership fee. For now, they are unregulated.
''In lieu of a regulated industry, we're now creating an environment in which patients are growing their own with limited oversight, and these private clubs of questionable legality are popping up,'' said Joe Yuhas of the Arizona Medical Marijuana Association, which led the medical marijuana campaign.
Ms. Brewer, a Republican, recently lamented ''the dreadful situation'' the state now finds itself in with marijuana legal for some.
Marijuana users consider the uncertainty dreadful as well, with some fearful that applying for cards might lead to police scrutiny. ''I have friends who are afraid to get cards,'' said Brad Scalf, 55, a disabled veteran. ''I figured that when I'm smoking out on the back porch and the neighbors complain, I don't have to worry. It's like a get out of jail free card.''
The state's legal case has been assigned to the same federal judge who found parts of Arizona's immigration law to be unconstitutional. In that dispute, Arizona argued against the idea that the state should be hamstrung by federal immigration law. In this instance, the state seems to be seeking a ruling that federal law ought to prevail.
''The state has been beating the drum on states' rights, but all of a sudden it has taken a 180-degree turn,'' said Ken Frakes, a lawyer for the Rose Law Group, which represents a number of marijuana dispensary applicants.
Ms. Brewer said the decision to go to court was made to protect state employees from prosecution after Dennis K. Burke, the United States attorney for Arizona, sent a letter to state officials warning that the federal government still considered marijuana an illegal drug and would go after those who ran large marijuana production operations. Mr. Burke has subsequently said he had no intention of prosecuting state employees.
Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey held up carrying out his state's medical marijuana law, one of 17 across the country, over similar concerns, but he announced this week that he would allow the program to go ahead.
In Arizona, some of the cannabis clubs are operating surreptitiously to avoid the notice of law enforcement. But not the 2811 Club, named for the provision of the law allowing state-approved marijuana patients to share marijuana among themselves.
Allan Sobol, the club's marketing manager, has invited reporters in and offered instruction on the ins and outs of the new law to a group of Phoenix police officers. Everyone who enters must have a state-issued card, and no smoking is allowed on the premises, to prevent people from driving under the influence.
The dimly lit club offers classes and has computers and books available to research the many plant varieties, and comfortable chairs to enable patients to chat among themselves. It is the marijuana counter, though, that brings people in.
Club members, who pay a $25 application fee, also must pay $75 every time they walk through the door. Once inside, they are entitled to about 3 grams of marijuana, which is grown by other cardholders and donated to the club. Those growers, according to the law, can be compensated only for the cost of their supplies. On a recent afternoon, there were a number of varieties available, including Master Kush, Blue Dream and Granddaddy Purple.
''There's nothing to be ashamed of when you come in,'' said Mr. Sobol, who has emerged as a spokesman for the embattled industry, but says he tried marijuana for the first time last week when he ate a salad made with marijuana dressing. ''We want people to come in with dignity and get this medicine that is now legal.''
Mr. Sobol said he is convinced that the club, which is planning to expand throughout the Phoenix area, is on solid legal ground. But the club does not comply with the strict regulatory requirements for dispensaries, which has prompted state officials to order an inquiry. Mr. Sobol said that given the uncertainty surrounding the program, he would be foolhardy not to look over his shoulder. ''We have to be concerned,'' he said. ''I have lawyers on call. They may arrest me, but if that day comes and they come barging through the front door, I'm convinced they'll never convict me.''

HEADLINE: Caterpillar Profit Rises 44% But Misses Wall St. Estimates

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Continued robust demand for Caterpillar's heavy equipment raised the company's second-quarter profit 44 percent, the company said Friday, but higher costs and cautious comments about China's economy set off a 5.8 percent decline in its share price. 
The company raised its sales outlook for the year, but cost increases, mostly related to its recent acquisition of the mining equipment maker Bucyrus, will prevent rising sales from helping profit more than previously expected.
Caterpillar's quarterly profit fell short of Wall Street estimates for the first time since the recession ended.
Many investors that were very optimistic about Caterpillar appeared to pause and reassess the prospects for months ahead, said Jeff Windau, an analyst at Edward Jones, who thinks Caterpillar still has strong long-term growth potential.
''There's a lot to digest in this quarter,'' Mr. Windau said.
The company said it earned $1.02 billion, or $1.52 a share, up from $707 million, or $1.09 a share, a year earlier.
Excluding costs associated with the Bucyrus acquisition, profit per share would have been $1.72.
Revenue rose 37 percent to $14.2 billion, easily topping Wall Street estimates.
Caterpillar predicts 2011 sales of $56 billion to $58 billion with Bucyrus. Previously, it predicted sales of $52 billion to $54 billion.
Stock in Caterpillar, which is based in Peoria, Ill., fell $6.45 to close at $105.15 a share.

HEADLINE: Earnings Propel Tech, And Subdue Industrials

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
Technology stocks rose while industrial shares were lower on Friday as investors picked through the potential impact of corporate results and government debt deals on the global economy.
The broader market was up more than 2 percent for the week, largely in response to the deal European leaders reached on Greece's debt on Thursday. For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 1.6 percent. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.1 percent, and the Nasdaq composite was 2.4 percent higher.
On Friday alone, the Dow closed down 43.25 points, or 0.34 percent, at 12,681.16. The S.& P. was up 1.22 points to 1,345.02, and the Nasdaq was up 24.40 points, or 0.86 percent, to close at 2,858.83. 
Investors were also warily watching the deficit-reduction talks in Washington, where President Obama and the Republican House speaker, John A. Boehner, were trying to shape a deal and avoid a government default in less than two weeks.
Quarterly corporate earnings moved the markets on Friday. Caterpillar, which reported that second-quarter revenue was up 37 percent, said earnings per share were $1.72, slightly below expectations of $1.75, analysts noted. It also reported softening demand in China.
Caterpillar was trading about 5 percent lower through the day and closed down 5.78 percent at $105.15.
''It's basically cause and effect,'' said Lawrence Creatura, portfolio manager at Federated Investors.
Timothy Hoyle, vice president for research at Haverford Investments, said the results ''disappointed the market.'' But he added: ''I think the market might be overreacting.''
Another major industrial company, General Electric, reported results that slightly surpassed Wall Street's expectations in both profits and sales. G.E. stock fell 0.63 percent to $19.04.
Technology shares did well, helping to bolster the Nasdaq.
SanDisk exceeded expectations in its earnings report late on Thursday. The company said second-quarter revenue was $1.375 billion, up 17 percent from a year ago. It closed up more than 9 percent at $45.57.
Advanced Micro Devices on Thursday reported $1.57 billion revenue and net income of $61 million, or $0.08 a share. It rose more than 19 percent to close at $7.75.
Interest rates were lower. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 14/32, to 101 12/32, and the yield fell to 2.96 percent, from 3.01 percent late Thursday.
''Debt deals in Europe, debt deals in the U.S., debt deals at home,'' said Kevin H. Giddis, the executive managing director and president for fixed-income capital markets at Morgan Keegan & Company, in a research note. ''The potential 'rise and fall' of these is causing investors to take a more conservative approach on the last day of the week before what might or might not happen over the weekend.''
Financial markets in Europe on Friday continued to give a positive reception to the deal reached in Brussels by European leaders that gave Greece more time to deal with its mountain of debt. Bank stocks in particular benefited, and Greek, Irish and Spanish bonds continued to rally.
In Europe, the package of measures approved by euro zone leaders includes a reduction in interest rates for the two other bailed-out countries, Ireland and Portugal.
The Euro Stoxx 50 index of blue chips opened strongly but gave up some of its gains and ended the day up 0.3 percent. Greek 10-year yields dropped below 16 percent for the first time since June 8, sinking 137 basis points to 15.12 percent, according to Bloomberg News. Irish 10-year yields tumbled 52 basis points to 11.83 percent. Spanish 10-year bond yields fell eight basis points to 5.65 percent while yields on Italian debt of the same maturity declined eight basis points to 5.27 percent.
The euro rose against a number of currencies including the Swiss franc and the pound, but fell slightly against the dollar, to $1.4370. Analysts said a report showing German business confidence declined by more than forecast in July and was holding back stronger gains.

HEADLINE: A Trust Surges, Heirs and Taxes in Mind, but Mind the Details

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
JACQUELINE KENNEDY ONASSIS is remembered for many things -- as a first lady, a preservationist, a fashion icon. But her legend stands tall in a far more esoteric realm: her will is revered in the world of trusts and estates, too.
A feature of it that is coming back into vogue is the charitable lead trust. After parceling out specific gifts, Mrs. Onassis put the rest of her estate into one of these trusts. It was set up to last 24 years, distributing money to charity annually. Whatever is left in 2018 goes to her heirs, in this case her grandchildren.
But the resurgent interest in charitable lead trusts is as much for financial advantage as for altruism.
Since the Republicans and President Obama allowed the gift- and estate-tax exemptions to rise to $5 million per person for this year and next, there has been a rush to pass far more money than that on to heirs, free of tax. In the case of charitable lead trusts, record low interest rates are driving the trend further. 
The Internal Revenue Service sets what is called a hurdle or discount rate for these trusts, which is tied to United States Treasury rates. A lower rate means the payment to charity each year can be lower, and if the assets are invested to beat that rate, the amount left over for heirs should be higher.
The confluence of these factors comes as advisers are already bombarding their wealthiest clients with ways to pass money onto heirs, with good reason: the super-rich may be living through the greatest time for avoiding estate and gift taxes in recent memory.
''What's the biggest bang for the buck?'' asked Kirk A. Hoopingarner, a partner at the law firm Quarles & Brady in Chicago. ''Everyone's searching for that now. That's why the charitable lead trust has gotten so much play.''
Banks and lawyers who reap fees from setting up these trusts are not the only ones pushing them. University development departments know the value of a steady annuity payment.
A page on Harvard University's Web site for giving offers a primer on how these trusts benefit the university and the alumni's heirs. Harvard also offers to handle the administration of the trust and invest the assets for the donor.
Here are some of the fundamentals of a trust that helps charities and minimizes taxes.
HOW THEY WORK Over the years, charitable lead trusts have been a way to give money to charity with the possible benefit of passing what was left to children without paying estate taxes.
What has kept people from setting these trusts up in the past -- and is still causing people to hesitate -- is that they are hard for someone who is not a tax lawyer to understand. ''It's too complicated for most people,'' said John D. Dadakis, a partner at Holland & Knight. ''They're sitting there saying, 'I want my life simpler.' ''
The best candidates for these trusts are people who give annually to charity and have an income large enough to take advantage of the charitable tax deduction for the entire amount put into the trust. (The federal deduction for charitable donations is capped at 50 percent of a person's income, though it can be carried forward for five years.)
Gregory D. Singer, a wealth strategist at Bernstein Global Wealth Management in New York, said such trusts could be worthwhile for those able to put at least $1 million into them. ''The downside is that money is tied up and committed,'' he said. ''In normal times, I'd rather remain flexible, but these aren't normal times.''
For the super-rich, one fear is that the charitable gift deduction could go away.
THE NEW TWIST During the last period when charitable lead trusts were talked up, after Mrs. Onassis's death in 1994, many were deemed failures. They either did not have enough money left over for heirs or, in the worst cases, they did not have enough to make all the payments to charity.
Part of the problem was the high hurdle rate -- 8.4 percent in August 1994 compared with 2.2 percent for this August. (The other, of course, was the dot-com bubble burst.) A higher rate meant a larger payout and decreased the chances that there would be anything left over in the end.
''A charitable lead trust is very dependent on the starting interest rate,'' Mr. Singer said. He said the likelihood today that one of these trusts would have money left for heirs was 95 percent. The trusts are written so that the assets appreciate substantially over time, but even if they do not, the designated charity -- often a family foundation -- will still get the money. Michael O. Hartz, a partner at the law firm Katten Muchin Rosenmann in Chicago, calls this approach ''heads I win, tails I don't lose.''
Most charitable lead trusts are set up to give away the entire amount of money put into them. Anything left over because of higher returns than the hurdle rate will be passed on to heirs. But that amount can be increased by reducing the annuity payment, and for many can be done without paying gift tax.
Mr. Hartz calculated that if you put $2 million into a 20-year charitable lead trust assuming the 2.2 percent I.R.S. return rate, it would have to pay out about $125,000 a year to be worth zero at the end. But if the trust earned a steady 7 percent each year, there would be $2.62 million left tax-free to heirs.
Yet, if the trust paid out only $80,000 a year it would, by present-value calculations, have $716,784 remaining at the end of 20 years. If the person still had some of his $5 million gift tax exemption left, he would not pay any tax. At the same 7 percent return, there would be $4.46 million left to heirs.
THE RISKS Of course, these trusts require a lot more planning than just writing a check to charity. And it could end up being wasted or worse.
The trust could fail to pass significant money to heirs if there were another market collapse. The person who set it up would have then wasted money on fees for lawyers, accountants, financial advisers, manager and trustees. (The charity would still get something.)
The bigger risks come from being too aggressive. Dan Schrauth, a wealth adviser at JPMorgan Private Bank, said clients often used these trusts to give money to their family foundation. This runs the risk of being deemed self-dealing if the person who set up the trust names his foundation as the recipient and then parcels out the money himself.
The solution is so simple as to seem like a waste of I.R.S. time: name a child to direct that portion of the foundation's giving.
While this presumes that the parent will have no say over donations, it is not considered to be pushing the limits of I.R.S. tolerance.
A more aggressive move is limiting the annual payment to charity in the early years so that the trust's value will grow and leave more money for heirs.
The most aggressive of these are called ''shark fin'' trusts, for the shape of the payments: they are very small in the early years and balloon at the end of the trust period.
''It's controversial and based on the clause that says the annuity payment can increase each year,'' said Chris Bixby, a senior financial planner at Key Private Bank who is certified to represent taxpayers before the I.R.S. ''It seems like self-dealing to the I.R.S., and it kind of is.''
This is where the tension between giving money to charity, leaving money to heirs and minimizing taxes can be extreme. Not everyone will manage this as gracefully as Mrs. Onassis did.

HEADLINE: For-Profit College Company Settles Whistle-Blower Suit

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
Kaplan Inc., a subsidiary of The Washington Post Company, agreed Friday to pay $1.6 million to bring an end to investigations and charges relating to the surgical technology program at its CHI Institute in Broomall, Pa.
A whistle-blower suit relating to the program was unsealed on Friday by the Federal District Court in Philadelphia. The lawsuit, filed in 2007 by David Goodstein, the former director of education at Kaplan's CHI Institute, charged that Kaplan continued to enroll students in the Broomall surgical technology program even though it did not have enough of the clinical placements the students needed to graduate.
As a result, the lawsuit charged, some students were sent home on ''leaves of absence'' after they finished the classroom portion of the program to wait for a placement that in many cases never materialized. 
Kaplan, in settling the case, admitted no wrongdoing.
The settlement includes nearly $500,000 to be paid on behalf of 43 students who had taken out student loans for the program but were not able to graduate because the school, one of Kaplan's for-profit campuses, had no placement for them.
''The money will go to the banks, to pay off their loans, so the students can get on with their lives,'' said Michael J. Salmanson, the lawyer who handled the case.
One of those whose loans will be paid off is Rebecca Masci, a single mother of five, who took out loans, got her parents to baby-sit and, for three terms, excelled in her classroom work. But she was unable to graduate because the school never provided the necessary hands-on experience in an operating room.
Mr. Salmanson said other students whose loans will be paid off may not have known of the lawsuit -- and may not yet know about the settlement.
Mr. Salmanson and Mr. Goodstein will receive $225,000 of the settlement money.
Ron Iori, a spokesman for Kaplan, said in a statement the settlement resolved not only the whistle-blower case but also a United States attorney's inquiry into the surgical technology program, which stopped enrolling students in early 2004, and a program review by the Education Department.
Mr. Goodstein said he was especially pleased that the settlement would help students who were left with debts and no possibility of a surgery-tech job because of the program's failure to provide a placement.
''I was very concerned that the students in the program, many of whom were economically at risk, were exposed to even greater potential economic risk in an attempt to better themselves,'' he said in a statement Friday
The Broomall litigation was one of several long-pending whistle-blower suits charging that Kaplan had defrauded the federal government in an effort to gain federal student aid money.
Another case, involving Charles Jajdelski, a former employee, was dismissed July 7 by a federal judge in Nevada, who said Mr. Jajdelski had not provided enough specifics to support his claims that Kaplan had filed fraudulent student-aid requests.
Other whistle-blower suits against Kaplan have been consolidated and are pending in multidistrict litigation in Florida. On Thursday, one of the Florida plaintiffs, Ben Wilcox -- the former dean of law and legal studies at Kaplan University -- was sentenced to a year and a day in prison for sending threatening and harassing messages to Kaplan.
Over the last year, Kaplan and the nation's other for-profit colleges have come under increasing scrutiny by both the Department of Education and Congress for their recruiting practices and high loan default rates.
In June, the Department of Education issued final regulations, to go into effect next July, requiring career college programs to better prepare students for ''gainful employment'' or risk losing access to the federal student aid that, on average, provides more than 85 percent of their revenues.
The for-profit colleges lobbied against the rules, which were eased before being issued in their final form.
On Wednesday, the Association of Private-Sector Colleges and Universities, a group representing the for-profit schools, filed suit in Washington to block the enforcement of the regulations, charging that they go beyond the Education Department's regulatory authority and conflict with Congressional intent.
''The department has created a situation whereby institutions will be forced to narrow enrollment policies and deny admission to students who are at risk of failing to meet the department's arbitrary debt-to-income and repayment metrics,'' a statement from the group said.
A spokesman for the Education Department said the regulations ''offer students and taxpayers protection they deserve'' and rest on a sound legal foundation.

HEADLINE: Malawi President Blames Protesters for Violence

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

 BODY:
CAPE TOWN -- Facing international condemnation for his government's use of force against peaceful demonstrators, Malawi's president defiantly blamed protest organizers and political opponents on Friday for the violence that left 18 people dead this week. And he warned them against a return to the streets.
''This time I'll go after you,'' President Bingu wa Mutharika said at a police ceremony in the city of Zomba, according to The Associated Press. ''Even if you hide in holes, I'll smoke you out.'' 
Rather than reassuring Malawians or the foreign donors who have financed close to half the government's budget, Mr. Mutharika's words are likely to stoke fears that his growing intolerance for dissent could jeopardize the progress Malawi has made in combating hunger, disease and destitution. They may also give those donors reason to consider withholding money from the government.
The Millennium Challenge Corporation, a United States government agency that recently announced a pact to give Malawi $350 million for its energy sector, released a statement Friday saying it was ''deeply concerned'' about this week's events and would closely monitor the government's actions. Its words were a warning. The agency in the past has suspended grants to countries that fail to safeguard human rights and political freedoms.
Even influential allies who have backed some of Mr. Mutharika's economic policies -- especially government subsidies for small-scale farmers that have helped make Malawi a bread basket for the region -- said they were alarmed by the violent police response to antigovernment protests.
''It puts at grave risk many of the country's recent accomplishments, notably in agriculture and food security,'' said Jeffrey Sachs, a Columbia University economist who has championed the fertilizer subsidies that have sharply improved corn production. ''This kind of violent repression and conflict could easily push Malawi back to hunger.''
The protests that started Wednesday in Malawi's major cities had been long planned. They were animated by anger over the government's failure to deal with severe shortages of fuel and foreign exchange, as well as fresh restrictions on press and academic freedoms.
But many of the demonstrators, who turned up Wednesday morning dressed in red and ready to march, were angered to learn that a court had forbidden the protests the night before. According to activists and others, as lawyers sought to overturn the court order, the police fired tear gas to disperse the peaceful crowd, provoking angry scenes, with some protesters throwing stones.
The police, in turn, fired on unarmed people, including some looters, according to Undule Mwakasungura, who heads the Human Rights Consultative Committee, which organized the protests.
''The police have no right to kill the people,'' he said. ''Why do they use live bullets?''
Police officials denied that officers killed any peaceful protesters, saying they had used force only against rioters, looters and vandals. ''The Malawian police service, in the exercise of its constitutional mandate of maintaining law and order, was left with no option but to use all necessary means to restore law and order,'' said a police spokesman, William Mwaluka.
After two days of unrest, 130 people had been treated at public hospitals and 18 had died, said Henry Chambali, a Health Ministry spokesman. Mr. Chambali declined to say whether any of the dead -- all of them civilians -- had bullet wounds, saying, ''We need to do a postmortem with the police to establish the causes of death.''
''The bodies we saw were heavily beaten and had lost a lot of blood,'' he said.
Even before the bloody scenes on Wednesday and Thursday, civic groups and Western diplomats had expressed concern in recent months about growing restrictions on press and academic freedoms in Malawi, including a law that empowered the minister of information to shut down newspapers.
Academics in Malawi and abroad were outraged that the police had interrogated a lecturer at Chancellor College, in Zomba, part of the University of Malawi, after he told students in a public policy course that Malawi's government could eventually face an uprising like the ones in Egypt and Tunisia if it did not ease the shortages of fuel.
The lecturer, Blessings Chinsinga, and three colleagues who were also union activists, were fired, and the college, with a student body of about 5,000, was closed for months, only partially reopening last week, said Wiseman Chirwa, a professor of social history there.
''Mutharika is arrogant and unrepentant,'' Professor Chirwa said after listening to the president on Friday. ''He has surrounded himself with opportunistic politicians, mostly from his own ethnic group, and he has a very unprofessional police force.''
Such views about the president are increasingly commonplace. A leaked diplomatic cable, published in a Malawian newspaper, quoted the British ambassador describing Mr. Mutharika as becoming more autocratic and unwilling to brook dissent.
As if to confirm the ambassador's view, the government, angered by the cable, promptly expelled him from the country. But it has proved to be a costly decision. Britain, long one of Malawi's biggest donors, announced on July 14 that it was indefinitely suspending contributions to support Malawi's budget.
It cited Malawi's economic mismanagement, as well as the suppression of demonstrations, intimidation of civil society groups and the passage of a bill that will make it easier to restrict opponents without legal challenge -- all before this week's events. ''Poor people in Malawi and British taxpayers alike have been let down,'' Andrew Mitchell, Britain's secretary of state for international development, said in a statement released at the time.

HEADLINE: Dodgers Ordered to Bargain With M.L.B. on a Loan

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
A federal bankruptcy court judge on Friday rejected the Los Angeles Dodgers' plan to borrow $150 million from a hedge fund and ordered them to negotiate ''cooperatively'' with Major League Baseball for a loan of the same amount on better terms. But the judge, Kevin Gross, said the loan could not lead to control of the team.
''It is clear that baseball needs and wants the Dodgers to succeed,'' Gross wrote, echoing arguments made by Major League Baseball's lawyers at an all-day hearing Wednesday. The judge sided in many ways with baseball, including its insistence that there was no malice toward the Dodgers. 
The Dodgers ''are best served by maintaining baseball's good will and contributing to the important and profitable franchise group under the commissioner's leadership,'' the judge wrote.
Baseball has done its best to distinguish the Dodgers, one of its iconic franchises, from Frank McCourt, who has owned them since 2004. McCourt has insisted in interviews and court papers that Commissioner Bud Selig drove the Dodgers into bankruptcy last month by vetoing loans and a new local cable TV deal with Fox Sports. In its documents, baseball has accused McCourt of gross mismanagement and draining the team of millions of dollars to finance the personal lifestyles enjoyed by him and his estranged wife, Jamie.
McCourt and baseball have squabbled heatedly over who will lend $150 million to the Dodgers.
Baseball's proposed loan, which will probably be modified in the coming days, has a lower interest rate and lower fees than the one offered by the hedge fund, Highbridge Capital. If the team defaults, baseball cannot not seize Dodgers assets as Highbridge's loan had called for -- a critical point in the ruling.
Gross ordered baseball to work out a deal that lacked draconian remedies against the Dodgers if they default on the terms of the loan. ''The baseball loan must be independent of and uncoupled from baseball's oversight and governance of the Dodgers under the Major League Baseball constitution,'' he wrote. He said he will intervene if ''baseball strays from its obligations to act in good faith.''
Bruce Bennett, a Dodgers lawyer, said, in an interview: ''This is a terrific economic result. We're going to get financing at a low cost that will not contain any restrictions on the Dodgers' restructuring strategy. Provided the judge supervises the results as closely as he says he will, there won't be any problems.''
Rob Manfred, an executive vice president of M.L.B., said in a statement that the court ''shares our long-standing view that the proposal put forth by Major League Baseball is the best option'' for the Dodgers. The process ended up working out for the Dodgers despite the judge's criticisms of McCourt for not negotiating the last few weeks on the terms of a loan and for agreeing to pay Highbridge $5.25 million if he did not get initial court approval of the loan from the firm. Baseball cited that as a conflict of interest; Gross said that the potential payment compromised McCourt's judgment and hindered any assessment of the loans of Highbridge's loan as fair compared with baseball.
But McCourt is off the hook for the $5.25 million payment because the judge permitted Highbridge to lend the team $60 million last month in advance of Friday's ruling.
One bankruptcy expert said that baseball might end up with regrets about the loan.
''Baseball might be hoisted on its own petard by providing below-market terms that has no ties to its governance and with no default triggers,'' said Peter S. Kaufman, the president of the Gordian Group, an investment bank that specializes in bankruptcies and restructuring. But, he added, ''If the Dodgers stumble and default, on whatever terms, they won't be happy that baseball is lurking.''
The next step for the Dodgers is an Aug. 16 hearing at which they will seek the court's approval to sell future television rights. The stage for the request was set last month when Selig rejected a 17-year deal between the Dodgers and Fox Sports that would have given McCourt $385 million upfront and a 35 percent stake in Prime Ticket, the regional sports channel that now carries its games.
Bennett said the team would file proposed marketing procedures next week to solicit offers for the television rights. The Prime Ticket channel is expected to bid, as might Time Warner Cable, which recently agreed to start a regional sports network with the Los Angeles Lakers as its marquee team in 2012.
Baseball is expected to oppose the sale of the rights as premature and because of its long-held mistrust of McCourt, positions that are almost certain to reignite mutual hostilities.

HEADLINE: Chief Nuclear Negotiators From North and South Korea Meet for First Time Since 2008

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea -- The chief nuclear negotiators for South and North Korea met Friday for the first time since 2008, raising cautious hopes that after months of recriminations the countries were inching toward broader talks on ending the North's nuclear weapons program.
The negotiators, Wi Sung-lac of South Korea and Ri Yong-ho, a newly appointed North Korean envoy, met on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations regional forum being held in Bali, in Indonesia, officials in Seoul said. 
Nuclear negotiators from the two Koreas last sat together in late 2008, when delegates from six nations met for nuclear talks. Those talks stalled amid tensions over South Korea's harder line toward the North, United Nations sanctions imposed on the North after it launched a long-range rocket and staged its second nuclear test in 2009, and military actions by the North, including the shelling of a South Korean island last November.
The need to check the development of North Korea's nuclear weapons program gained urgency after the North revealed an industrial-scale plant for enriching uranium in November. The plant showed that the North was gaining a new means to make nuclear bombs -- in addition to its existing plutonium program -- and, potentially, to proliferate the technology.
South Korea has insisted that the United States, China, Russia and Japan -- all parties to the six-nation talks -- not give in to what it considers North Korea's tactic of using military provocations and other tension-raising maneuvers to force the other nations to rejoin the nuclear talks under terms that favor the North.
The meeting in Bali satisfies a South Korean precondition for convening the broader talks: that the North sit down with the South first to discuss its nuclear weapons program.
''We have agreed to make efforts to reconvene the six-party talks as soon as possible,'' Mr. Ri told reporters in Bali after his meeting with Mr. Wi. Later. Mr. Wi made a similar remark to South Korean reporters.
Despite such statements, it remained unclear whether the North Korean negotiator had given Mr. Wi a persuasive commitment to denuclearization, another South Korean demand.
Having a North Korean envoy meet with his South Korean counterpart about the North's nuclear weapons program is symbolically important for South Korea, which is trying to increase its leverage over the North and make it respect the South. After months of boycotting the nuclear disarmament talks, North Korea has recently called for their resumption. The North says it is willing to give up its nuclear weapons programs in return for economic rewards, diplomatic recognition, a peace treaty with the United States.
After years of tumultuous talks, suspicions have grown among some South Korean and American officials that North Korea may be using the talks just to extract economic concessions while buying time to perfect its nuclear weapons technology.
But the United States and its allies have been unable to find an effective alternative to dialogue, except for applying sanctions and appealing to China.
Earlier Friday, Foreign Minister Pak Ui-chun of North Korea, speaking with South Korean reporters in Bali, confirmed that Mr. Ri, a longtime North Korean participant in talks with American officials, had been appointed as the North's chief envoy to the six-nation talks.
The meeting Friday may be followed by a higher-level meeting between Mr. Pak and his South Korean counterpart, Kim Sung-hwan, who is also in Bali, officials in Seoul said.

HEADLINE: Acrimony Reigns As Speaker Quits Debt Limit Talks

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES and CARL HULSE; Michael D. Shear and Helene Cooper contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Negotiations over a broad deficit reduction plan collapsed in acrimony on Friday after Speaker John A. Boehner suddenly broke off talks with President Obama, raising the risk of an economy-shaking default.
The latest turn in the summer's epic clash between the White House and Congressional Republicans came little more than a week before the government hits its borrowing ceiling, and set off accusations from both sides about who was to blame.
A visibly angry President Obama, in a hastily scheduled White House news conference, demanded that Congressional leaders come to the White House on Saturday morning. ''I want them here at 11 a.m. tomorrow,'' he said. ''They are going to have to explain to me how it is that we are going to avoid default.''
Mr. Obama said Mr. Boehner had stopped returning his calls when it became clear that rank-and-file House Republicans would not agree to raise revenues on wealthy Americans as part of a debt-reduction deal, despite Mr. Obama's concessions on reducing future spending for Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. Both sides have sought a deficit-reduction agreement as part of the essential vote to raise the government's $14.3 trillion debt limit, which will be reached Aug. 2. 
In a letter to his Republican colleagues on Friday night, Mr. Boehner said, ''A deal was never reached, and was never really close.'' He added: ''In the end, we couldn't connect. Not because of different personalities, but because of different visions for our country.''
The speaker said Mr. Obama wanted to raise taxes too high and would not make ''fundamental changes'' to entitlement benefit programs like Medicare.
But according to a White House official, Mr. Obama had agreed over the coming decade to cut $250 billion from Medicare spending and $310 billion from other domestic entitlement programs, like farm subsidies and education programs. And Mr. Obama was willing to change the formula for Social Security cost-of living adjustments, which many economists say would more accurately reflect inflation, for savings of about $125 billion more.
All of Mr. Obama's concessions on the benefit programs were contingent, however, on Mr. Boehner and Republicans agreeing to higher taxes for wealthy individuals and corporations.
At the news conference, Mr. Obama said Republicans were forfeiting an ''extraordinarily fair deal'' to trim the deficit and raise the debt ceiling. ''I have gone out of my way to make compromises,'' the president added.
''Essentially what we had offered Speaker Boehner was over a trillion dollars in cuts to discretionary spending, both domestic and defense,'' Mr. Obama said. ''We then offered an additional $650 billion in cuts to entitlement programs Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security. We believed that it was possible to shape those in a way that preserved the integrity of the system, made them available for the next generation and did not affect current beneficiaries in an adverse way.''
Republicans, though, said that the White House pushed for more revenue midway through the talks. ''The White House moved the goal posts,'' Mr. Boehner said in a news conference.
The breakdown was the second time this month that Mr. Boehner had walked away from the table with Mr. Obama after word of their private talks was leaked to the news media, provoking protests from Republican lawmakers and antitax conservative groups.
''I've been left at the altar now a couple of times,'' Mr. Obama said. ''And I think that one of the questions that the Republican Party is going to have to ask itself is, Can they say yes to anything?''
This time, however, Mr. Obama had also faced a firestorm from within his party, because of the spending cuts he was considering with Mr. Boehner.
Hours before the tempest, the three top stewards of the nation's financial system -- Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner; Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, and William C. Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York -- had met to discuss how to react to shield the economy from the blow if Congress failed to raise the debt limit. But in a joint statement, they said they remained confident Congress would act.
Mr. Obama, too, said he thought that default could be avoided. ''I am less confident at this point that people are willing to step up to the plate and actually deal with the underlying problem of debt and deficits,'' he said at his news conference.
Mr. Boehner said he would work now with Senate leaders on a plan to raise the debt limit.
Just what form the new legislative proposal will take was uncertain, as lawmakers and their top aides had only opened talks about how to proceed. Some expected it to be built upon an earlier plan by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, who employed an arcane process to allow a debt limit increase to occur over the objections of Congress.
But in a statement, Mr. McConnell noted that the speaker had expressed an interest in trying to find a ''new path forward'' with Senate Democrats, suggesting that he wanted to go in a different direction than the McConnell plan, which had drawn stiff opposition in the House. It could still provide a last-ditch alternative if all else fails.
Even before the day's events, deep pessimism had settled over Washington as the two main alternatives to an Obama-Boehner proposal were either defeated or shelved. First, Mr. McConnell shelved the approach he was working on with Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic majority leader, amid growing resistance in both parties.
And as expected, the Democratic-controlled Senate voted down a measure that House Republicans approved earlier in the week that would force the government to shrink to the smallest level in many decades. Many House Republicans have said they would not approve an increase in the debt limit without the ''cut, cap and balance'' package becoming law, too.
Republican officials said the talks between the administration and the speaker had produced consensus on some major issues.
But they said the negotiations were complicated by this week's release of a separate deficit-cutting plan by a bipartisan Senate group, the so-called Gang of Six, that proposed more tax revenues than agreed upon by Republicans and the White House. The officials, speaking on background, said that this development led Mr. Obama to push for additional revenues as well, and the differences could not be bridged.
Democrats said that, to their chagrin, Mr. Obama pushed for more entitlement savings than even the Gang of Six supported.
Earlier Friday, in a public event at the University of Maryland, in College Park, Mr. Obama for the first time addressed, and ruled out, the idea that in an emergency the Constitution would empower him to raise the debt limit to prevent default and, as he put it, ''basically ignore'' the federal law requiring that the debt ceiling be set by statute.
The argument of ''the constitutional option,'' which President Bill Clinton, like Mr. Obama a former constitutional law instructor, endorsed this week, is based on the Fourteenth Amendment's provision that the validity of the United States debt ''shall not be questioned.'' ''I have talked to my lawyers,'' Mr. Obama said, and ''they are not persuaded that that is a winning argument.''
But with the Aug. 2 deadline now looming, lawmakers were bracing for the worst in what Senator Mark Pryor called a ''cliff-hanger moment.''
''The unthinkable could happen,'' said Mr. Pryor, an Arkansas Democrat. ''The 80 million bills the federal government pays could come to a screeching halt.
''That means millions of seniors may not receive their Social Security checks in the mail. Troops may not receive paychecks.''
''Americans and leaders all over the world are now watching,'' he added. ''The question for Congress remains: Will we rise to the occasion, or will we fail?''

HEADLINE: News Corporation Sells a Billboard Unit in Russia

BYLINE: By ANDREW KRAMER

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- The News Corporation, Rupert Murdoch's media conglomerate embroiled in scandal, sold its billboard company in Russia to a consortium of investors led by a Kremlin-controlled bank, the bank announced on Friday. 
The sale of News Outdoor Russia had been under negotiation for at least months. The timing was apparently unrelated to the turmoil around the News Corporation in Britain, where Parliament is investigating a tabloid newspaper's practice of hacking into cell phones to obtain information.
Still, the Russian asset had a troubled history of its own. The News Corporation opened the company here in 1999 while maneuvering to gain a foothold in the former Soviet and Eastern European markets to compliment its media holdings in China.
While News Outdoor Group, which is based in Moscow, operates in the Czech Republic, Romania and Ukraine, Russia has been by far its most lucrative market. News Outdoor Russia billboards are frequently provided for pictures of Vladimir V. Putin, the former president and now prime minister, reportedly on a pro bono basis at times.
Despite these gestures that were reported in the Russian media, the News Corporation had been in discussions to sell the billboard company since the fall of 2008 amid a general worsening of the investment climate in Russia at the time, and apparent inability to win backing from the government.
In a 2008 interview with The Financial Times, Mr. Murdoch expressed concern the billboard company would be ''stolen.'' He added that ''better we sell it now.''
Mr. Murdoch had initially proposed to sell the Russia asset for $1.6 billion. But as regulators pressed a tax claim and the recession deepened, the price dropped.
The company this week sold its 79 percent stake for $270 million, according to Kommersant, a Russian business newspaper. The Russian bank that organized the buyout consortium, VTB, did not disclose its price in a statement confirming the deal issued on Friday.
News Outdoor Russia is the country's largest outdoor advertising operator with boards, banners and other advertising surfaces in more than 90 cities, according to the company's Web site.
The Russian asset has been important to the News Corporation. Advertising revenues are mostly flat in developed markets like the United States, where the company operates the Fox television channel. But revenues are growing in emerging markets. In China, the News Corporation operates a satellite television company. In the former Soviet Union, the focus had been largely billboards managed through the Moscow-based company.
In 2008, News Outdoor Russia came under pressure, culminating in a back tax claim that was resolved two years later. Still, that year the company provided pro bono a large banner showing Mr. Putin's face on a central Moscow building near Red Square, the RBK business newspaper reported.
Company-owned space in St. Petersburg this month carried advertisements for the People's Front, a new political group established by Mr. Putin ahead of Parliamentary elections later this year.
Jason E. Senior, chief operating officer of News Outdoor Group, wrote in an email that the company would not respond to inquiries about the report of pro bono advertising provided to Mr. Putin in 2008 or the current advertising for the People's Front organization on News Outdoor surfaces in St. Petersburg. He also declined to respond to questions about the sale.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Romney Seeing Smaller Pool For Donations In Second Run

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE; Griff Palmer and Derek Willis contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Dozens of former top donors to Mitt Romney remain on the sidelines as he mounts his second bid for the presidency, hampering his efforts to cement his status as the Republican front-runner and build a fund-raising machine that can compete effectively with President Obama.
Mr. Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts, is not only raising less money than he did four years ago, but so far he has been relying more heavily on a smaller group of donors, asking many of them to write checks now for the maximum donation that they can give during primary season. While that has given Mr. Romney a considerable lead in fund-raising over other Republican candidates -- he raised $18.5 million during the three months ending June 30, four times more than anyone else -- it also means he will have to quickly expand his universe of large donors to maintain that pace. 
Out of 263 state-level finance chairmen and bundlers -- those who raise money on behalf of a candidate -- who appeared in Mr. Romney's campaign filings in 2008, more than half do not appear to have given him any money so far this year, according to an examination of filings with the Federal Election Commission. Those staying on the sidelines include some of the heaviest hitters in national Republican fund-raising, underscoring one of Mr. Romney's central challenges: convincing a skeptical Republican establishment that he is their best bet to make Mr. Obama a one-term president.
''I haven't decided yet. I want to see what the whole field looks like,'' said James B. Francis Jr., a Texas financier who was a national finance co-chairman of Mr. Romney's 2008 campaign but has not signed up for a second tour of duty.
''A presidential campaign is like a child: every one of them is different,'' added Mr. Francis, who headed the network of ''Pioneers'' that helped George W. Bush break fund-raising records in his first run for president. ''They have different dynamics, they act differently.''
Mr. Romney has until now faced only minimal competition for the allegiance of major Republican donors. But that could change quickly: Gov. Rick Perry of Texas -- home to a significant portion of big Republican donors -- is inching ever closer to entering the race. Both men made trips to California this week to court potential donors, with Mr. Perry presenting himself as the party's best alternative to Mr. Romney.
While Mr. Romney's campaign team is already laying plans to go head-to-head with Mr. Perry should he enter the race, Romney advisers said they did not view the fund-raising situation as a sign of weakness. Rather, they emphasized the slow development of the Republican primary: Mr. Romney, like other candidates, entered the race much later this year and has kept a determinedly low profile.
''There is a lot of potential out there that hasn't been motivated to be tapped,'' said Woody Johnson, the owner of the New York Jets and a member of Mr. Romney's national finance team. ''I think that's pretty common for a campaign, especially this early. People aren't as focused. Maybe it's the environment, maybe it's because so many candidates are running.''
Mr. Johnson said that many of the donors he had reached out to in recent weeks were now willing to take a second look at Mr. Romney, in part because other Republican candidates, like former Gov. Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota and former Gov. Jon M. Huntsman Jr. of Utah, have had difficulty gaining traction in national polls.
''It clarifies the argument,'' said Mr. Johnson, who supported Senator John McCain of Arizona in the race for the Republican presidential nomination four years ago. ''Competition makes you better. And I'm confident that Romney will prevail.''
Mr. Romney is not the only candidate fighting to hold on to his biggest donors: Just one-fifth of Mr. Obama's bundlers have so far signed on to the president's re-election campaign, reflecting both burnout and disillusionment. But Mr. Obama has been able to recruit dozens of new bundlers to replace them, while drawing in additional millions of dollars from an enormous network of small donors.
Those who are backing Mr. Romney this time around are bumping up against federal donation limits -- ''maxing out,'' in campaign parlance -- at a faster rate than they did in his last campaign. Over all, about half of Mr. Romney's donors have already given him the maximum contribution for the Republican primary, compared with a third of his donors at the same point in 2007.
By comparison, his rival Mr. McCain raised less money during the same period in 2007, but had maxed out only one-fourth of his donors. The leading Democratic candidates during the last cycle, Mr. Obama and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, had taken in the maximum contribution from an even smaller fraction of their donors, allowing them to ask the same donors to come through with more money as the Democratic primary intensified.
So far, Mr. Romney is running a much leaner campaign than he did four years ago. He has not run a single television advertisement, has been far more sparing in hiring staff members and opening campaign offices, and has spent much less over all. In about two and a half months this year, Mr. Romney's campaign spent $5.7 million. By the same point in 2007, he had been campaigning twice as long, but spent $32.3 million -- more than five times as much.
In part because Mr. Romney started later this year, some of his donors said, they simply had not gotten around to writing a check yet, but planned to.
''I maxed out to him in 2008, and I'll do the same for him this year,'' said Marcus J. Mollmann, a Colorado real estate developer who worked in the Bush administration. ''We're doing everything we can to help him out. I think his chances are better this time than in 2008.''
And others said the poor economy had made it more difficult for every candidate, not just Mr. Romney, to recruit bundlers and donors.
Ron Kaufman, a top fund-raiser and adviser to Mr. Romney, said in a recent interview that even some normally well-heeled donors were feeling pinched.
One Romney donor he called seeking a contribution, Mr. Kaufman said, had told him that he was no less supportive of Mr. Romney this year, but that there was a complication.
''He said, 'One thing has changed,' '' Mr. Kaufman related. '' 'Last time I had a house. This time I don't.' ''

While his fund-raising totals were down in nearly every region, the distribution of where he found his money changed, too. New York residents provided a greater share of the money he did raise, while those in Utah provided less.

HEADLINE: Appeals Court Rejects S.E.C. Rule on Access to Proxy Materials

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A federal appeals court panel on Friday delivered a sharp rebuke to the Securities and Exchange Commission by throwing out a recently approved regulation that would have made it easier for shareholders to oust corporate directors.
The ruling, by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, is at least the third time in six years that the court has thrown out a new S.E.C. rule because the agency failed to adequately assess its economic effects.
The S.E.C. approved the regulation, which has long been sought by unions, pension funds and other institutional investor groups and fiercely opposed by business lobbyists, by a 3-2 vote last year. The rule would have required companies to include in their proxy materials information about shareholder-nominated candidates for election to a corporate board of directors. 
Past efforts by the S.E.C. to guarantee shareholders access to company proxy statements have been challenged over whether the agency had the authority or whether it was primarily a matter of state law. But the Dodd-Frank Act, the regulatory overhaul signed into law last July, gave the S.E.C. explicit authority to write new proxy access rules.
The new regulation was scheduled to become effective in November, but the agency stayed that pending the outcome of a court challenge filed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable, a trade group for corporate executives. The case, No. 10-1305, was argued before the appeals court in April.
Under the rule, groups that owned at least 3 percent of the voting power of a company's stock for at least three years could nominate candidates for a corporate board and have them included in the company's proxy materials, mailed to shareholders at the company's expense.
Currently, outside groups mounting a proxy contest to elect board candidates must pay for their distribution of materials.
The three-judge appeals court panel rebuked the S.E.C. for its failure to satisfy the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, which requires cost-benefit studies to justify a new government regulation, in its adoption of the proposal.
The court ruled that the S.E.C. ''acted arbitrarily and capriciously'' in failing to adequately consider the rule's effect on ''efficiency, competition and capital formation.''
''Here the commission inconsistently and opportunistically framed the costs and benefits of the rule; failed adequately to quantify the certain costs or to explain why those costs could not be quantified; neglected to support its predictive judgments; contradicted itself; and failed to respond to substantial problems raised by commenters,'' the court said, in a unanimous decision written by Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg.
Kevin J. Callahan, an S.E.C. spokesman, said the agency was ''reviewing the decision and considering our options.''
The S.E.C. could seek a rehearing before the panel or the entire appeals court or could appeal the case directly to the Supreme Court. It also could abandon the initiative or restart the rulemaking process with a new proposal, including additional economic analyses and comments from the public.
A second S.E.C. regulation, which allows shareholders to submit proposals for proxy access at their companies, adopted at the same time, is unaffected by the court's decision.
A Chamber of Commerce official called the ruling ''a big win for America's job creators and investors.''
''We applaud the court's decision to prevent special-interest politics from being injected into the boardroom,'' Thomas J. Donohue, president and chief executive of the chamber, said in a statement. ''Companies and directors need to continue to focus on the important work of creating jobs and reviving our economy. Today's decision also sends a strong message that regulators need to meet their statutory requirement to clearly prove that the benefits of regulation outweigh the costs.''
The panel said the commission had not sufficiently supported its conclusion that increasing the potential for shareholder-nominated directors would improve performance and shareholder value.
Roger J. Dennis, dean of the law school at Drexel University in Philadelphia, said the D.C. Circuit has been particularly tough on the S.E.C.'s rulemaking in recent years.
''Cost-benefit analysis is not a science,'' he said. Requiring the commission to have ''excruciating detail'' on the costs and benefits of a proposal ''is a stealth way of telling them that they don't have the right to regulate it.''

HEADLINE: Dodd-Frank Backers Clash With Regulator

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- John Walsh voiced the frustrations of many bankers when he warned in a speech last month that federal regulators were not paying attention to the cumulative impact of new rules and restrictions, jeopardizing the ability of banks to support economic growth.
''I might have titled these remarks, 'Beware of the Pendulum,' '' he said. ''To put it plainly, my view is that we are in danger of trying to squeeze too much risk and complexity out of banking.''
What made the speech unusual was that Mr. Walsh is a federal regulator. In fact, he is responsible for overseeing most of the nation's large banks. And as the text of his remarks ricocheted across the electronic landscape of official Washington, it drew a furious reaction from advocates of increased regulation, who called on the White House to replace him.
The uproar brought into public view the increasingly contentious relationship between the authors and supporters of the Dodd-Frank Act, the law passed last year to overhaul financial regulation, and Mr. Walsh, the acting comptroller of the currency, a crucial player in the work of translating the law into practice. 
His agency is seeking to soften a wide range of provisions, in areas ranging from the bread-and-butter of consumer protection to the esoteric details of how much money banks can borrow. Democrats and consumer advocates are particularly infuriated because Mr. Walsh, who stepped in as acting director in August, could be replaced by the White House at any time.
''The O.C.C. is acting as if there was never a financial crisis,'' said Dennis Kelleher, president of Better Markets, a nonprofit group that advocates for increased regulation of the financial industry. ''It's just an utterly indefensible abdication of its responsibility to the American people.''
Mr. Walsh said in a recent interview that he was bewildered by the anger of his critics. He said that the financial crisis revealed clear problems that his agency was working to fix, but that it wanted to protect at the same time the viability and vigor of the banking industry. The disputes with other parts of the government are not questions of which way to go, but how far.
''I think we're in a moment in time where if you say anything that suggests you see merit in an argument that is supported by bankers, that you're somehow selling out your public office or something,'' Mr. Walsh said. ''And I just don't agree with that.''
Mr. Walsh, who joined the agency in 2005 and served as chief of staff, took over in August when John Dugan, a Bush appointee, completed his five-year term. Almost a year later, his office in Southwest Washington remains lightly decorated; the distinctive feature is a looking glass pointed toward the Capitol.
Last month, the president nominated Thomas J. Curry, a member of the board of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, to head the agency. He will appear Tuesday before the Senate Banking Committee, but there is no assurance that Republicans will permit a vote.
The most visible battle concerns the agency's power to exempt banks chartered by the federal government -- a category that includes most large banks -- from compliance with a hodge-podge of state banking laws.
The Dodd-Frank Act includes language meant to limit this power and to require a review of past exemptions. Earlier this year, however, the agency said the law did not compel any change in its policies. The Treasury Department protested that that ignored the law's plain meaning. But on Wednesday, the comptroller's office said that it stood by all of its previous decisions.
The stand is strongly supported by the banking industry, and by many members of Congress, who argue that the efficiency of a single rulebook is fair and results in lower prices for customers.
Advocates of state regulation, however, are girding for a court battle.
''It's really hard for me to think how much clearer Congress could have been,'' said Arthur E. Wilmarth Jr., a professor of financial law at George Washington University. He said the agency was behaving like Lewis Carroll's Humpty Dumpty, who memorably declared, ''When I use a word it means just what I choose it to mean -- neither more nor less.''
The agency also faces criticism over continuing revelations that banks under its supervision have routinely failed to follow the legalities of the foreclosure process. When it announced that it would require banks to conduct comprehensive reviews, and to pay compensation for any problems that were found, critics questioned its competence and sincerity.
''Banks will face penalties,'' Mr. Walsh said. ''To do this right will take some time. But if the process is going to be credible and people are going to be able to believe that we can deal with it fairly, we're going to have to take the time to do the work right.''
In the meantime, the agency is juggling 85 projects dictated by Dodd-Frank. And its greatest impact is likely to unfold far from public view, in the closed-door meetings and long, dense legal opinions where regulations are built and tuned.
In one typical example, the agency is pressing other regulators to accept an inclusive definition of the word ''customer.'' The Volcker Rule, written into the Dodd-Frank law to limit banks from pursuing their own investments, allows banks to create hedge funds and private equity funds so long as they are quickly marketed and sold to customers. The authors and proponents of the rule want regulators to define the term as narrowly as possible, limiting the opportunity for banks to create products and then identify a willing buyer after the fact. The comptroller's office, however, has suggested using the expansive definition of a customer found in the Patriot Act.
The agency's positions reflect its view that banks should be permitted to engage in a broad range of activities, for their own health and for the benefit of the broader economy. Over the years, the agency gradually eased restrictions to allow the rise of behemoths like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, and now it is defending those expansive boundaries.
Mr. Walsh said his greatest concern was for the unintended consequences of imposing so many new rules so quickly, which he compared to the danger of mixing medications.
''I'm arguing that erring on the side of caution is to be cautious about how far we go,'' he said. ''And for a lot of other people erring on the side of caution is, 'The more armor plate we put on these ships the better, because we never want them to sink again.' ''

HEADLINE: The Travails of Ms. Warren

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA. 
Gail Collins is on book leave.

 BODY:
It's finally live.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I mean. After 10 months of preparation -- hiring staff, creating a management structure, laying out an initial agenda -- the bureau officially hit the starting gate on Thursday, a year to the day after the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill was signed into law by President Obama. And, of course, the person who hired most of that staff, created that management structure and laid out that agenda -- indeed, the person most responsible for the bureau's very existence -- is departing. This coming week will be Elizabeth Warren's last at the bureau. So accustomed are we to our nation's poisoned politics that nobody even thinks this is strange.
''In a world in which the Republicans would have let me have the job, yeah, I would have been glad to have stayed,'' she told me earlier this week when I asked if she was disappointed that President Obama had decided, in the end, to nominate Richard Cordray, the former attorney general of Ohio, to be the bureau's first director. (Cordray was already on the premises; Warren had recruited him to be the bureau's chief enforcement officer.) ''But they made it so clear that was never going to happen.'' 
Led by Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama -- whose descent from respected member of the Senate Banking Committee to partisan political hack has been truly stunning -- Senate Republicans had vowed to block Warren from ever being able to run the agency she brought to life.
Still, she is pleased that the president chose Cordray: ''Rich will be better than good. He's smart, and he's tough. And he probably understands the politics better than I do.''
Naturally, Shelby et al. have now promised to block him as well -- ostensibly because the bureau requires ''structural changes'' to make it more ''transparent.'' In fact, the only thing that's transparent is the absurdity of this fig leaf. What the Republicans are trying to do is cripple the new consumer agency before it ever gets the chance to, you know, help consumers. Bankers are their constituency, not consumers.
What has long been striking to anyone following Warren's travails these past 10 months -- ever since the president asked her to set up the bureau -- is the disparity between what she's actually done versus the Republican demonization of her. It is true that as a Harvard law professor, where she raised hell about the ''tricks and traps'' too often used by the financial services industry to gouge its customers, she used strong, colorful language. It is easy to see why she might make some bankers nervous.
But in setting the new bureau's priorities, she has mostly stressed the importance of clear disclosure and easy-to-read contracts -- so that consumers will be able to understand what they are agreeing to. (It certainly might have helped subprime borrowers avoid a lot of pain had such an agency been in existence during the bubble years.)
''I've never been an ideologue,'' she told me. ''And I thought the best way to deal with that perception was to put our vision out there. The vision is clear. Consumers should be able to tell the price and risk of any credit product before they buy it. We want to mow down the fine print. I thought once that was on the table, and it was clear that we were executing on it, the accusations would go away.''
But they never did go away. In addition to the Senate threats about blocking her nomination, House Republicans regularly brought her before their committees and acted as if this were the second coming of Joe McCarthy. Patrick McHenry, a Republican from North Carolina -- Bank of America's home state -- was particularly obnoxious, calling her a liar in one hearing. Republicans would cut off her answers and speak to her in tones ranging from contempt to condescension. The treatment wasn't just disrespectful. It was ugly. And it never stopped.
''It was like living in an alternate universe,'' said Warren. ''For 14 hours a day, it was all about getting the agency set up. There was this enormous energy and enthusiasm. And then there was this other stuff.''
As she saw it, her job became, in part, to serve as the punching bag. ''I would have all-hands meetings. I would say we're under attack. My job is to worry about that. Your job is to keep building the agency. I couldn't stop them from going after me, but I could stop the impact of their efforts.''
As for the hearings themselves, she found herself feeling more discouraged than angry. ''So much energy was being wasted on a sideshow that had so little to do with families that are suffering,'' she said. ''What Richard Shelby says about me doesn't amount to a hill of beans compared to what people are going through in this country. It was a political sideshow.''
Her last hearing took place a week ago. It was before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which includes McHenry. Its chairman is Darrell Issa, one of the meanest men in Congress. Warren was the only witness.
Though it began with an air of faux civility, its true purpose quickly became clear: to box her around the ears one more time. Issa accused her of ''excessively redacting'' Freedom of Information requests. McHenry claimed, absurdly, that her ''evasive nonanswers'' were contributing to the country's economic woes. Several other Republicans chimed in with accusations of their own: she wanted to abolish payday lending (heaven forbid!); she was hiding how the C.F.P.B. was spending its money; she had ''secretly'' helped the state attorneys general devise a settlement with the big banks over the robo-signing scandal. (The Republicans have found her involvement in the efforts of the attorneys general -- which she did at their request and which was perfectly legal -- particularly infuriating. Shelby, for instance, accused her of being involved in a ''shakedown'' of the banks.)
I happened to watch that hearing on the Web site of the Sunlight Foundation, a nonprofit devoted to openness in government. The foundation had a few bloggers commenting in real time, and lots of financial data scrawling across the screen, much of it culled from Open Secrets, a kindred organization. When Representative McHenry was hectoring Warren, the screen showed that he had received almost $45,000 from Bank of America and another $15,500 from Wells Fargo. Connie Mack, a Florida Republican, had received $68,000 during the last election cycle from the financial services industry. Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase, I discovered later, had given a combined $1,957,522 to Republicans in the last election, nearly twice as much as they gave to Democrats. They've certainly gotten their money's worth.
As for Warren, she is being urged by the Democratic Party to run for Scott Brown's Senate seat in Massachusetts. She's a long way from deciding whether to do so, and, in any case, she has Harvard Law School to return to in the fall.
Earlier this week, though, she met Warren Buffett for the first time. He took her by the hands and said, ''I know a whole lot more bankers than consumers, but they're the ones who need the help.''
His words made her very happy.

HEADLINE: In His Year of Working Furiously, Spielberg Makes a Summer Stop

BYLINE: By MICHAEL CIEPLY

 BODY:
SAN DIEGO -- ''You'll be kids the rest of your lives!'' shouted Steven Spielberg to a crowd of more than 6,000 roaring fantasy fans at the Comic-Con International convention here on Friday. ''I feel the same way!''
With his gray beard, baseball cap and inner child on full display, Mr. Spielberg was flanked by a surprise guest, the director and his sometimes collaborator Peter Jackson. The two had come to promote a movie, ''The Adventures of Tintin,'' their semi-animated, 3-D, performance-capture homage to a teenage journalist invented more than 80 years ago by the Belgian comics artist Georges Remi, known professionally as Herge.
But the appearance by Mr. Spielberg -- who was given Comic-Con's Inkpot Award for lifetime achievement -- also marked an inflection point in what may be the busiest and most frantic year in his long Hollywood career. 
''Tintin,'' which Mr. Spielberg produced and directed, is set for release by Paramount Pictures in the United States on Dec. 23. Five days later DreamWorks and Walt Disney are to release ''War Horse,'' also produced and directed by Mr. Spielberg, a film version of the World War I-era British melodrama that won the Tony Award for best play last month.
Those will cap a year in which Mr. Spielberg will have shared producer credits on six films, including a pair of summer hits, ''Super 8'' and ''Transformers: Dark of the Moon,'' and a pair of action-adventure pictures, ''Cowboys & Aliens'' and ''Real Steel,'' that have yet to open. The movies are matched by four new Spielberg-produced television series: ''Terra Nova'' for Fox; ''Falling Skies'' for TNT; ''The River'' for ABC; and ''Smash,'' a midseason replacement that might not show up on NBC until next year.
''It's actually been a benefit to me, not a deterrent,'' Mr. Spielberg said of a juggling act that has found him working, by his own estimation, on five or six different tracks at once. The frenzied productivity follows a frustrating interlude during which he and other DreamWorks executives disengaged from a failed corporate alliance with Paramount and cobbled together financing for a new, independent DreamWorks that found its footing only in the last year.
''Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,'' Mr. Spielberg's last film as a director, was released by Paramount in 2008. Now 64, he appeared genuinely excited and initially almost nervous as he discussed ''Tintin,'' which is likely to be followed by a historical drama about Abraham Lincoln and perhaps another fantasy, called ''Robopocalypse.''
Mr. Jackson, looking scruffy and relaxed, said he was enjoying a brief interlude in his own hectic enterprise; he told the crowd he had finished the first 60 shooting days of ''The Hobbit'' for Warner Brothers' New Line Cinema unit, and had another 200 to go. During an extended conversation here with Mr. Spielberg, he noted that the filmmakers' collaboration on ''Tintin'' -- Mr. Jackson is a producer of the current film and is to direct a second one, if the first is well received -- had brought the pair full circle. The intricate computer-generated visual effects of Mr. Jackson's Weta Digital company, he explained, were born of an early obsession with what were then the sophisticated special effects Mr. Spielberg used in 1993's ''Jurassic Park.''
Mr. Spielberg's presence at Comic-Con, his first appearance there, had the grandeur of a state visit, but with 3-D glasses. He was attended by an entourage of at least three dozen, including Rob Moore, the Paramount vice chairman, and Jeff Blake, the vice chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment (which is distributing ''Tintin'' abroad), along with an array of publicists who kept the rest of the entourage on track.
Seen on the big screen with 3-D glasses, ''Tintin'' -- or the few minutes that were on display -- turned into a thrill ride considerably more vibrant than the trailers that have nested for weeks on the Internet.
Tintin, the ginger-haired boy reporter played by Jamie Bell, dodged bullets and tumbled through a cavalcade of planes, boats and speeding automobiles, while his faithful dog, Snowy, yelped and did the same. Lost in the netherworld of performance-capture technology -- is it real? is it animated? -- you could almost forget that Mr. Bell, now 25, was a closer match for the 15-ish Tintin when he starred in ''Billy Elliot,'' more than a decade ago.
Nobody in the giant hall asked Mr. Spielberg or Mr. Jackson about the less savory side of Remi, Tintin's creator, who worked for a pro-German publication, Le Soir, during the Nazi occupation of Belgium. In a period of later repentance, Remi cleaned up ''Tintin'' panels that were tainted by racist portrayals of black Africans and anti-Semitic allusions to Jews. The closest brush came when Mr. Jackson noted that ''serious'' themes and issues were embedded in some of the comics, though he did not elaborate.
Mr. Spielberg, who examined the Holocaust in ''Schindler's List,'' and probed slavery and black American culture in ''Amistad'' and ''The Color Purple,'' was focused this time on the medium more than on the message. He described the movie as ''art to art'' -- that is, the closest approximation of the comic books.
If nothing else at this year's Comic-Con, the annual convention for fans of comic books and related TV shows and movies, quite matches the excitement of Mr. Spielberg's visit, it wasn't for lack of trying. On Thursday The San Diego Union-Tribune provided a rundown of some of the spending that has turned this city's Gaslamp Quarter and adjacent bay-side district into a four-day, open-air party.
To drape one of the larger hotels with a movie promotion -- as Universal did last year for ''Scott Pilgrim vs. the World'' and this year for ''Cowboys & Aliens'' -- can cost $70,000, the paper reported. The SyFy cable channel will pay $350,000 for a Saturday night party and other expenses. The lift to the local economy is estimated at $163 million.
While some fans were out shopping for T-shirts (''Totally Shatisfying,'' reads one -- William Shatner is here for a show on Epix), another grizzled graybeard, the director Ridley Scott, showed up late on Thursday in a video feed from Iceland, where he stood on the edge of a steaming waterfall, bundled in a parka, looking like a relic of a Shackleton expedition.
Dropping a profanity or two -- there was a lot of it onstage on Thursday, showing a drift from the family-friendly tilt of Comic-Con's film presentations -- Mr. Scott rasped about ''Prometheus,'' a science-fiction epic he is preparing for release by 20th Century Fox next year. The film has connections to the ''Aliens'' series and features Charlize Theron, Guy Pearce, Michael Fassbender and Noomi Rapace, who became famous as ''The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo,'' in lead roles; a sniffling Ms. Rapace stood shivering beside Mr. Scott in the chilly north.
Mr. Scott said he had shot scenes that would allow ''Prometheus'' to be rated either R or PG-13, pending a decision he and executives at Fox would share.
The most surprising thing about Mr. Scott's Comic-Con moment was a declaration about 3-D, which he is using on ''Prometheus.'' ''I'll never work without 3-D again, even the smaller dialogue scenes,'' he said.
Hollywood and Wall Street may be sorting out the format's prospects this summer: like James Cameron, the director of ''Avatar,'' Mr. Scott is on board.
At their news conference, Mr. Jackson and Mr. Spielberg spoke more cautiously of 3-D as a medium that is wonderful in its place -- and would be even more so if tickets cost less. Consumers, said Mr. Jackson, are justifiably peeved when they pay an extra $5 to see a movie in 3-D, only to find out ''it's as bad as the one you saw in 2-D.''

HIGHLIGHT: Monetary edition.

 BODY:
Matt Yglesias notes the odd failure of reasonably sensible Republican macroeconomists to confront their party's descent into hard-money madness. He analyzes it as follows:
But these guys and other longtime GOP economic hands have largely been doing the usual Beltway wonk dance of speaking up for Republican positions when they agree with them, and staying quiet when they don't. You don't even need to see this as a particularly cynical way of behaving. In Washington, it's ultimately a question of all power to the politicians. A wonk who insists on picking fights with prominent party leaders just finds himself marginalized. Next thing you know and you're Bruce Bartlett. It's arguably more useful to just keep your head down and make sure that if your team takes over they have some sensible people to turn to. 
That's a fairly charitable interpretation; but to some extent it's worse than that. Early in the crisis, both Greg Mankiw and Ken Rogoff actually came out in favor of a period of relatively high inflation. That's what their models (and mine) suggested we should be doing. But they faced a firestorm of angry responses from the right -- and went silent.
Maybe this is, as Yglesias says, a deeper game. But is every respectable GOP economist positioning himself to be Mitt Romney's adviser? Are there no voices on that side willing to speak up for what they really believe, never mind the impact on their own careers?
I think we know the answer.

HIGHLIGHT: On the talk shows, questions about whether party leaders can reach a compromise before the government defaults on its debt.

 BODY:
With time running out for a deficit reduction compromise to avert a federal government default, all eyes are on President Obama and Congressional leadership. The Sunday talk shows are no exception.
Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner and White House Chief of Staff William M. Daley will launch a media blitz on Sunday, appearing on five shows in total. Mr. Geithner will weigh in on the rising debt crisis on ABC's "This Week," CNN's "State of the Union" and "Fox News Sunday," while Mr. Daley will be featured on CBS's "Face the Nation" and NBC's "Meet the Press."
New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg will also appear on ABC to talk about the debt ceiling negotiations, as will two former Senate majority leaders, Republican Trent Lott and Democrat Tom Daschle.
And as New York becomes the sixth state to allow same-sex marriage on Sunday, Mr. Bloomberg will be joined by a couple whose marriage he will officiate to talk about the new law.
Meanwhile, on CNN, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, will discuss her bill to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act. Along with Rep. Raul M. Grijalva, Democrat of Arizona, she'll also talk about the ongoing debt disagreement.
Then, CNN will catch up with Tim Pawlenty to ask him about his weak poll numbers in the 2012 presidential race.
In addition to Mr. Geithner, Fox will feature Rep. Joe Walsh, Republican of Illinois, and Rep. Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin. The Tea Party favorites are against raising the debt ceiling - unless it includes passing the House's "cut, cap and balance" bill.
CBS will ask key players about the struggles of coming to an agreement on reducing the deficit. Along with Mr. Daley, Senate Majority Whip Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, and Senate Minority Whip Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona, will discuss the dilemma. CBS will also feature two of the Gang of Six, tasked with crafting a bipartisan budget agreement: Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, and Senator Saxby Chambliss, Republican of Georgia.
NBC will have another Gang of Six member, Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, as well as a panel that includes former Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska; Rep. Adam Kinzinger, Republican of Illinois; and Newark Mayor Cory Booker, a Democrat.
Rep. John B. Larson, Democrat of Connecticut, will be on C-Span's "Newsmakers" to talk about the impact of the debt ceiling negotiations on entitlement programs and future legislative efforts, and Bloomberg's "Political Capital" will feature Rep. Dave Camp, Republican of Michigan and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.
Senator Charles E. Schumer will be on Univision's "Al Punto" to talk about the debt as well as immigration reform. And Oscar Alvarez, the minister of public security in Honduras, will discusse the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms' controversial "Fast and Furious" operation and a similar operation that introduced thousands of guns into Latin American countries, including Honduras.

The New Math of Law School
To the Editor:
The premise of ''Law School Economics: Ka-Ching!'' (July 17), is belied by reality: Reform can come from within.
In my 11 years at New York Law School, which was highlighted in the article, the first-time bar exam passage rate improved to as high as 93 percent. We have built an acclaimed student-centered facility and have instituted a practice-based curriculum, specialized research centers and an intensive first-year skills program.
Of 10 private metro New York City law schools, our tuition is lower than all but four. We have a flat-rate tuition and guarantee that the price won't go up while a student is enrolled. 
In its rankings of law schools, U.S. News and World Report publishes median salaries for graduates, but those figures are nearly two years old. We give our students current, detailed job and salary information.
Our large enrollment in 2009 was neither planned nor required to satisfy our bond raters. We actually accepted 150 fewer students than we did in 2008, but 170 more chose to enroll.
We can't dramatically change the cost structure of law schools without regulatory reform. We can't control vicissitudes of the economy. We can and have created a dynamic model that gives graduates the skills to challenge the marketplace, spread the rule of law and make our country a more just place.

To the Editor:
Your look at law school practices was laudable, but here is another question: What can society and the legal profession do with the seeming oversupply of well-trained, unemployed law grads, while also addressing the great maldistribution of civil legal access to the working poor?
Pro bono legal services have not come close to meeting the needs of these Americans. The problem has worsened as the economy continues to falter, foreclosures rise and more people are unemployed.
The talent and the need are present, but funds are required to connect the two. A pilot program is needed to provide an attorney minimum wage in place of a pure pro bono system -- a move that would increase the employment of lawyers and representation of the poor. Funds could come from several sources, including the addition of fees to high-ticket corporate litigation and punitive awards. And why not require wealthy law schools that have made disproportionate profits over the years to contribute, too?

To the Editor:
I suggest a follow-up article about the failure of huge university endowment funds to help law students deal with the high cost of their education. Many of these funds could radically lower law-school tuition by redirecting some of their gains for that purpose.
Donors to universities seem content to write big checks, take the tax deduction and ignore what happens to the funds later. This may please their tax advisers, but it submerges students in towering debt.
Remedial steps are possible. For example, universities should tell their students how much of their endowment funds are used for tuition relief. And tax deductions could be allowed only for contributions designated solely for student aid.

To the Editor:
Yes, the legal profession is under pressure and is undergoing a major structural change, with ''Big Law'' no longer a reliable source of highly paid jobs for new law school graduates (''Law School Economics: Ka-Ching!'' July 17). But this presents a powerful opportunity for the legal academy to redefine its goals, hopes and services for its students.
A law degree remains a desirable credential for access to interesting career paths, many of which serve the public interest, engage the global marketplace or help those on society's margins. If you think we have too many lawyers, ask a Hispanic-American who is stopped by law enforcement because he looks ''illegal,'' or a mayor struggling to provide basic services in a time of economic stress, or a C.E.O. trying to expand her business into emerging markets.
As history tells us, a highly bureaucratized democratic society needs lawyers -- in ''Big Law'' and little law -- to speak truth to power, to navigate complex regulatory structures and to offer some assurance that our complex system of laws is interpreted as fairly and justly as possible.

HEADLINE: The Essential T.A.

BYLINE: By ANN CARRNS

 BODY:
Jason G. Ball was thrilled when he was accepted two years ago at the University of California, Los Angeles, and could pursue a Ph.D. in political science. He was so thrilled, he enrolled without any assurance of a teaching assistantship or other financial support.
Instead, he has had to compete for available assistantships, succeeding in getting one for just one academic quarter last year. Typically, students like Mr. Ball could expect to get a position fairly easily. ''Now that's not necessarily the case,'' says Jeffrey Lewis, the new chairman of the department. With money tight, the program has admitted fewer Ph.D. candidates in the past two years, and while it has managed to fully finance nearly all of them, the few who have come without a guarantee have found teaching assistantships harder to come by.
Mr. Ball, 27, fretted all spring about how he would pay for his third year of studies. A son, grandson and great-grandson of oil workers, he labored summers as a roustabout at the Port of Long Beach and attended community college before earning his bachelor's degree. For the coming year, he had resigned himself to taking on about $28,000 in debt to cover tuition and expenses after he was turned down for a teaching assistantship. 
Then, just as he was losing hope, he was notified that he had been awarded a spot helping teach a freshman class on ''Work, Labor and Social Justice in the U.S.,'' his area of interest.
''I'm ecstatic and relieved,'' he says.
This fall, to accommodate an unexpectedly large incoming class, U.C.L.A. is expanding its lower-level courses, where T.A.'s are needed most.
The past two years have been particularly anxious ones for many graduate students. A quarter of all doctoral students and 5 percent of all master's students receive a teaching assistantship, according to an analysis of the latest federal statistics by Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of the college financing Web site finaid.org. About the same proportion receive a research assistantship. The numbers have remained relatively steady, but that data is from 2007-8 -- before the economic crisis.
''We are seeing colleges have to contract the amount of aid, in any form, they give to students, as their budgets are being crunched,'' says Rosemary G. Feal, executive director of the Modern Language Association. This is especially the case in English, foreign language and history, she says, where students rely most heavily on teaching assistantships to finance their studies. Science and engineering students are less affected because they often get research assistantships that are externally financed.
To have to scramble for money while trying to do research is burdensome. To recruit top students, selective programs prefer to admit only as many applicants as they can fully support, with fellowships, tuition waivers and assistantships. So bowing to budget realities, some programs have been shrinking. While the situation varies campus to campus, and even program to program within a campus, ''cutbacks and hardships are continuing everywhere, from what I can tell,'' Ms. Feal says.
Columbia University's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences reduced its admission of Ph.D. candidates by about 10 percent in 2009 -- in response to the economy as well as a lackluster academic job market for graduates -- and the numbers aren't likely to rebound in the foreseeable future, says Carlos J. Alonso, the school's dean. The school is instead offering more support to the Ph.D.'s it does admit. ''Our calculation is that it is better for everyone to have fewer students,'' he says, ''but much better-funded students.''
Many big public universities that have maintained their graduate admissions levels are struggling to meet the goal of offering full financing, Ms. Feal says. The schools are providing financial support to even fewer master's degree students, and may assure some doctoral students just one year as a T.A. instead of the usual two, or offer partial instead of full-tuition waivers.
With faculty positions going unfilled, many universities have opted to hire more adjunct professors, who don't require costly tuition waivers. ''What I've seen many departments do is beef up adjuncts, as opposed to T.A.'s,'' says James C. Wimbush, dean of the graduate school at Indiana University Bloomington and a board member of the Council of Graduate Schools.
At U.C.L.A., because of California's budget crisis, the number of T.A.'s in the College of Letters and Science dropped by about 2 percent in 2009-10, to 1,595, says Judith L. Smith, dean and vice provost for undergraduate education at the college.
For this fall,/// however, U.C.L.A. is making big adjustments. With 1,200 more freshmen than anticipated, an increase of 26 percent, lecture courses must be expanded and staff members brought in. An additional $10 million is being earmarked for lecturers and visiting faculty members, and $6 million for T.A.'s -- enough for roughly 400 new half-time assistantships campuswide, in courses critical to entering students like composition, math and foreign language.
Some grad students are skeptical that the extra positions will make their jobs easier. Elise Youn, 34, who just completed her third year of a Ph.D. in urban planning at U.C.L.A., has been a T.A. for two years, for an urbanization class with 60 students (about double the size of previous years, she says). Ms. Youn attends the main lecture, holds office hours, answers e-mails from students, and reads all papers and exams, commenting on them and recommending a grade. She's to work 10 hours a week, which rarely happens.
T.A.'s, she says, ''work harder for the same pay as in the past.'' (Nationally, T.A.'s are paid on average $12,000, and research assistants $14,000 -- before taxes. Unlike fellowships or scholarships, these stipends are given in exchange for work.)
T.A.'s at U.C.L.A. are unionized, and there's a formal grievance process in place if they feel overworked. But Ms. Youn says students are often reluctant to complain, for fear of jeopardizing recommendations for future grants or jobs. Still, many T.A.'s report finding the experience rewarding. Ms. Youn says she has a good relationship with her professor and believes the assistantship will set her apart in a competitive academic marketplace when she completes her degree.
T.A.'s are crucial to the mission of research universities. They provide energetic, relatively inexpensive labor, but their true value lies in their scholarship because they ultimately are the next generation of faculty members. ''The system needs them to function effectively,'' says Debra W. Stewart, president of the Council of Graduate Schools.
Lisa Neher's voice rises with enthusiasm as she reflects on her T.A. experience at the University of Kansas. ''It was exciting,'' she says. ''But I felt the burden of doing a good job for these students. I felt how much of a responsibility it was.''
Ms. Neher, 25, received full financing for her two-year master's degree in music composition, scoring an assistantship for the second year that came with a tuition waiver (value: about $15,000) and a stipend of $900 a month -- enough to scrape by, if she rode her bike around Lawrence instead of buying a car. Her day began with a 6 a.m. ride to campus and didn't end until she fell into bed at midnight.
She worked about 20 hours a week as a T.A., teaching a section of a music theory class that had 18 undergraduates. Although she met weekly with a professor and other T.A.'s to coordinate what would be taught, she was the sole instructor for her section.
She felt a close bond with her students. She always hurried to respond to their e-mails, and to answer questions when they stopped by the tiny office she shared with five other T.A.'s and a piano, before turning to her own thesis: a 22-minute ''chamber opera'' to be performed by two singers. Her composition, ''White Horizon,'' follows the story of a real-life expedition to the North Pole gone wrong.
Ms. Neher dreams of the opera. She was accepted into that program for the fall, for a second master's. But she has decided not to attend, for now: she wasn't offered a T.A. spot.

HEADLINE: Rise of Consumer Credit in Chile and Brazil Leads to Big Debts and Lender Abuses

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO; Pascale Bonnefoy and Aaron Nelsen contributed reporting.

 BODY:
SANTIAGO, Chile -- For Ana Maria Silva, what began as purchases of perfume and two pairs of shoes spiraled into a credit card nightmare, as her debt multiplied tenfold in five years -- and not all because of her spending.
Ms. Silva was among 418,000 clients in Chile who fell behind on their payments and had their debts repackaged by the retailer La Polar, which raised interest rates and extended loan terms without their knowledge. In early June, it came to light that executives at La Polar had been unilaterally renegotiating clients' debts for more than six years. The news stunned Chileans and has become one of the biggest financial scandals of Chile's 20-year economic boom.
''I share blame in this, but this company should have been more honorable and transparent,'' said Ms. Silva, 30. ''They were targeting people with more modest means. This became a vicious cycle that was never going to end.'' 
The scandal has underscored how South American countries -- including Chile and Brazil, two of the region's healthiest economies -- are going through growing pains as the use of credit grows. The credit-fueled spending has driven extensive economic growth. But it has also opened the door to abuses, as credit issuers have used predatory techniques to lure customers, particularly young and less affluent ones, in countries where regulation is scant, annual interest charges can top 220 percent and consumers cannot seek bankruptcy protection, economists and consumer defense groups say.
''They are learning every trick that was learned in the United States to make credit cards the most valuable part of the banking business,'' said Lewis Mandell, a professor emeritus at the State University of New York at Buffalo, who wrote a book on the history of the credit card industry. ''And unfortunately, the problems this caused in the United States are likely to repeat themselves in Latin America.''
As La Polar was dealing with the fallout over the disclosure of its lending practices in Chile, the federal prosecutor's office in Rio de Janeiro filed suit this month against three of Brazil's biggest banks, accusing them of imposing more than $300 million in illegal bank charges on clients from 2008 to 2010.
The cases reveal troubling undercurrents in the South American economic boom: indiscriminate lending, lax regulation and ballooning over-indebtedness of large parts of the population, especially those with lower incomes.
The widespread proliferation of credit has been both rapid and relatively recent, developing over the past decade and spurring a consumer revolution across South America. Retail chains like La Polar in Chile and Casas Bahia in Brazil, which sell electronics and housewares, have thrived by offering relatively low-priced goods and extending easy credit terms to entire classes of people who had never had access to it.
The household debt-to-income levels in Brazil and Chile still trail that in the United States, where it has hovered around 140 percent, largely because of high mortgage balances. But they are rising fast. In Brazil, it reached a record high of 40 percent in April, up from 22 percent in 2006, according to LCA Consultores, an economic consulting firm. In Chile, where consumer debt rose by 254 percent, to roughly $34 million, between 2001 and 2008, the debt-to-income level topped 70 percent at the end of 2010, according to the Central Bank.
''We have turned ourselves into modern slaves,'' said Osvaldo Oyarce, a filmmaker who is trying to make a movie about Chilean consumerism. National economic success, he said, has come at a cost: ''A population that is highly indebted, with high levels of depression and frustration.''
A bank superintendent closely monitors bank-issued credit cards, but cards issued for in-store use by retailers like La Polar are subject to ''much lighter'' regulation, said Kevin Cowan, a director in the financial policy division of Chile's Central Bank. Last year, the bank began to include a chapter focused on household indebtedness in its risk reports. ''We recognize that ultimately household debt could become a serious source of financial risk,'' he said.
In Brazil, where credit card interest rates above 220 percent are among the highest in the world, the Central Bank has been trying for months to rein in household consumption, which grew by 10.4 percent in the last quarter of 2010. To better evaluate the risks of the credit expansion, the Central Bank will begin monitoring credit operations of as little as 1,000 reals, or roughly $640.
In both the La Polar and Brazilian bank overcharging cases, the creditors were reluctant to compensate consumers fully.
In Brazil, the prosecutor's office opted to file its lawsuit, seeking double the amount it said the banks improperly charged customers, only after the three banks -- Santander, Itau-Unibanco and HSBC -- ignored its appeals to fully compensate consumers, it said.
Brazil's Central Bank had also told the banks that the fees they were charging were illegal and that they must stop the practice.
HSBC and Santander declined to comment on the case. Itau stopped charging clients a commission in late 2008 after the warning, and it agreed to pay enough restitution to satisfy the Central Bank, said Claudia Politanski, executive legal director at the bank. She added that Itau considered the restitution demands as ''not having backing in jurisprudence.''
Last year, Sernac, the Chilean government's consumer defense agency, received hundreds of complaints from La Polar customers who had been getting threatening letters from collection agencies. Sernac said it tried quietly to negotiate a solution with La Polar, but the company would not stop. Sernac filed a class-action suit last month on behalf of about 2,000 people who said La Polar had defrauded them. The number has since grown to 20,000.
La Polar's top executives have since resigned, and the company has fired 11 managers involved in the lending practices. The company, in a statement, said it was pursing criminal action against several former employees and against its auditing firm, Pricewaterhouse Coopers. A state regulatory agency filed related charges this month. With no personal bankruptcy law in Chile, when people fall behind or default, they face the prospect of being listed as a debtors or high-risk consumers in the Dicom, a private, unregulated credit-rating agency owned by Equifax. A bad Dicom credit score usually means being blacklisted for jobs, mortgages or political office.
''If you are in Dicom, if you are not in hell, you are on the way there,'' said Stefan Larenas, president of the Organization of Consumers and Users of Chile, a consumer rights group. ''It is a true social stigma here.''
Mr. Larenas said he has seen more cases of insolvency in his office. ''Some people come here and cry; some say they want to kill themselves,'' he said. ''Some leave the country or escape to the south and live in an almost clandestine way for five years, waiting for their debts to clear.''
The customer abuses in the La Polar case doomed tens of thousands to Dicom purgatory after the repackaging of their debts geometrically increased what they owed through so-called acceleration clauses for late payers.
Manuel Cespedes said he received his La Polar card in 2007 when he was 19. He used it in the pharmacy and to buy a $1,000 laptop on a payment plan of $60 a month over 24 months. But in 2008, when he lost his job as a technical illustrator, he fell behind on the payments.
He said he later discovered that the retailer was repackaging his debt every three months. By the end of 2008, the roughly $430 he owed had tripled. By this March, it had topped $4,000.
''I couldn't understand what was happening,'' said Mr. Cespedes, now 23.
His poor Dicom rating has kept him from getting college loans and has made it hard to get a job to help pay his debt, he said.
Ms. Silva, a schoolteacher who stopped working when she had her first child in 2006, said she had been blacklisted with employers because of her credit problems stemming from her debt to La Polar, and she and her husband had been denied a mortgage.
''I don't think everybody understands how these cards work,'' she said. ''It's a temptation, and we all want a little more in our lives. I think the stores are counting on that.''

HEADLINE: Developers Bank on Young Singles

BYLINE: By LISA PREVOST

 BODY:
DEVELOPERS are zeroing in on downtown revitalization efforts in Hartford and Bridgeport, where new rentals have proved popular with young singles. In both cities, the market is hot for studios and one-bedrooms -- partly, developers say, because this generation of 20-somethings does not like to share.
''Our notion when we started was a lot of people would want to share apartments and share costs,'' said Philip Kuchma, the developer of an 84-unit apartment building in downtown Bridgeport. Since the building opened last year, however, the two-bedrooms have been slower to lease, while names are accruing on a waiting list for one-bedrooms. 
Mr. Kuchma ascribes the pattern to the fact that graduates today are likely to have spent time living with their parents after college, so that when they're finally ready to move out, ''they've decided they want a place of their own,'' he said.
The preference is stronger in Connecticut than in larger urban markets, said Mike Martin, a senior vice president of Winn Residential, a Boston-based property management firm that oversees several rental buildings in downtown Hartford.
''In Boston and New York City,'' Mr. Martin said, ''people are used to living with roommates. But Hartford is a market where people want their own space.''
Hartford and Bridgeport have spent the last decade trying to revitalize their stagnant downtowns by creating enticing living spaces. Mr. Kuchma's building, which anchors a commercial development known as Bijou Square, was the first new residential construction in downtown Bridgeport in two decades.
Rents for its 22 one-bedroom apartments start at $950, which makes living alone more affordable than in cities closer to New York, like Stamford, Mr. Kuchma said. More than a dozen of his tenants commute by train to Manhattan.
The bulk of Bridgeport's new apartments were created through a partnership of Urban Green Builders of New York City and Ginsburg Development Companies of Valhalla, N.Y. The developers converted three historic downtown properties -- the Arcade, the Citytrust bank building and 144 Golden Hill -- into roughly 175 apartments with ground-floor retail.
Another office building conversion, 333 State, is scheduled to open this fall with 64 more rentals.
The number of people living in downtown Bridgeport, a small area of about 8 by 12 blocks, has doubled over the last five years, and is expected to reach 1,500 by the end of the year, according to Donald Eversley, the director of the city's Office of Planning and Economic Development.
Developers are well aware of the unmet demand for smaller rentals. Plans are under way for the conversion of the upper floors of buildings on the south side of McLevy Green, at the corner of State and Main Streets. And a couple of acres of city-owned property will be available soon for more mixed-use projects.
''The reason we're putting it on the market is because developers have been bugging us about it,'' Mr. Eversley said. ''The market demand has been proven.''
One sure sign of confidence in the downtown's appeal to young people: plans for a new brew pub. Christian Burns, owner of the Cask Republic, a restaurant in New Haven, has secured a lease to open a pub and restaurant on the ground floor of the Citytrust building. It is to be modeled after a German beer hall, with long communal tables, a wide selection of beers on draft, and homemade sausage.
''There just seemed to be an opportunity in Bridgeport, getting in on the ground and watching it build up,'' said Mr. Burns, who also owns restaurants in Greenwich and Norwalk. ''There is a definite attractiveness to being involved with that.''
A long-awaited food market is also on the way. Clyde Ripka, the owner of the Bull's Head Markets in Norwalk and Stamford, has a lease to open a similar market in the Arcade.
Downtown Hartford landed a grocery store in March, on the ground floor of the high-rise apartment building Hartford 21. Run by Ryan and Kelleanne Jones, the owners of the Mill at 2T restaurant in Simsbury, the market caters to busy professionals with a variety of prepared foods, as well as a full selection of groceries.
''Between 5 and 7 p.m.,'' Mr. Jones said, ''most of the people coming in are looking for meal replacements -- something they can pick up, take home and heat up.'' The ''huge'' favorite, at $5 to $8 a serving, is the noodle bar.
Brian Lemire, a senior property manager for Winn Residential, handles leasing at several downtown properties, including the Lofts at Main and Temple, with 78 apartments priced at the higher end of the market, and the Hollander Foundation Center, most of whose 70 apartments are priced below market rate for renters whose incomes qualify. Studios and one-bedrooms have always been the most desirable at both ends of the market, he said, adding that most buildings had waiting lists.
In hopes of tapping into that demand, two New York City developers, Wonder Works Construction and Girona Ventures, recently bought Hartford's long-vacant Clarion Hotel for conversion to rentals. The reconfigured building will cater to young people with 193 small apartments and amenities like a media room and a health club, said Jeff Ravetz, Girona's president.
''Clearly there's an inordinate demand for one-bedrooms and studios,'' said Martin Kenny, the developer of Trumbull on the Park, a 100-unit apartment building in downtown Hartford, ''and it's really that demographic of 25 to 34. I have four kids in that demographic, and they just don't like to live with other people.''
Most of the downtown residential development in Hartford over the past decade catered to professionals looking for high-quality apartments in prime locations, Mr. Kenny said. He is now looking into developing lower-priced options for what he sees as an overlooked market segment: workers who don't earn as much -- a credit bureau employee, perhaps, or a waiter at a high-end restaurant.
''If you're able to deliver product that's smaller, say 450 square feet for $900 a month,'' he said, ''that's where they want to be.''

THE IDEA OF AMERICA
Reflections on the Birth of the United States
By Gordon S. Wood
385 pp. The Penguin Press. $29.95.
Gordon S. Wood is more than an American historian. He is almost an American institution. Of all the many teachers and writers of history in this Republic, few are held in such high esteem. Part of his reputation rises from his productivity -- a stream of books, monographs, articles, lectures and commentary. Now he has added ''The Idea of America'' (along with a new edition of John Adams's Revolutionary writings in two volumes for the Library of America series). 
More important than his productivity is the quality of his work, and its broad appeal to readers of the right, left and center -- a rare and happy combination. Specially striking is Wood's rapport with the young. In the film ''Good Will Hunting,'' Matt Damon and Ben Affleck centered a lively scene at a student hangout on an impassioned discussion of Wood's work. The television sitcom ''It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia'' made ''Gordon Wood'' into an adjective, and used it as a synonym for serious scholarship in general. ''Wicked awesome,'' one character said, ''all that Gordon Wood business!'' Through it all, the man himself preserves a quiet modesty, and even a humility that is central to his work. He is respected not only for what he does but for who he is.
Wood's latest book is a collection of 11 essays, along with an introduction and conclusion, that encompass his entire career. It reveals more of the author than any of his other work and creates the opportunity for an overall assessment of his achievement. Wood introduces himself with a familiar line from the poet Archilochus: ''The fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing.'' He celebrates the foxes who flourish in his field, and adds in his modest way, ''By contrast, as a historian I fear I am a simple hedgehog. . . . Nearly all of my publications have dealt with the American Revolution and its consequences.''
That one subject has occupied Wood for half a century -- a concentration span that few can match. And after many years of labor in that field, he has transformed it. Scholars before Wood had offered many interpretations of the Revolution, but none seemed quite right to him. He concentrated his work on the years from 1776 to 1828, an unusual choice. When he began, Wood remembers, this period had ''a reputation for dreariness and insignificance,'' as ''the most boring part of American history to study and teach.'' Historians of early America tended to think of the Revolution as a colonial insurgency and lost interest after 1776. Scholars of the ''middle period'' believed that the real revolution happened in the Age of Jackson, and thought of the preceding years merely as prologue.
Progressives like Charles Beard and Carl Becker had tried to bring life to the history of the early Republic by writing about a transition from aristocracy to democracy, but Wood did not share what he called ''their preoccupation with economic and other underlying interests.'' He also disliked ''the partiality that plagued their histories, a partiality that was prompted by the need to find antecedents for the divisions of their own time.''
Even less satisfactory to Wood was the scholarship of the mid-1950s. It was a time when liberals followed Tocqueville's idea that America was born free without having to become so. Conservatives took up the argument of Edmund Burke (and John Quincy Adams) that the purpose of the American Revolution was not to promote social change, but to prevent it. Radicals compared the Revolution with the French and Russian Revolutions, and proclaimed that it was not a genuine revolution at all.
Wood rejected all of these approaches. He went deep into primary materials and made an open-minded effort to understand the language and thought of 18th-century Americans in their own terms. After 10 years of research he reported his results, first in a short essay reprinted in this collection, then in the 1969 book ''The Creation of the American Republic, 1776-1787.'' Leading his readers into the /sources, Wood demonstrated that Americans in those years invented ''not simply new forms of government, but an entirely new conception of politics.'' They rejected ancient and medieval ideas of a polity as a set of orders or estates. In their place they created a model of a state that existed to represent individual interests, and to protect individual rights. To those ends, Americans invented radically new ideas of representation, and new models for the ''parceling of power.''
Wood also made another discovery: This revolutionary way of thinking did not derive from small elites or large treatises. He wrote that it was ''not delineated in a single book; it was peculiarly the product of a democratic society.'' In newspapers and pamphlets he found evidence that Americans of all conditions joined this great debate -- men like William Findley, a weaver and farmer in Pennsylvania, and William Thompson, a tavern keeper in South Carolina.
To all this, Wood added a third finding. From the start, this new way of thinking was consciously conceived as an open process. Wood quoted Samuel Williams, a country clergyman in Vermont, who observed in 1794 that the American system ''contains within itself the means of its own improvement.'' It created a process of permanent reform that proved more durable than Trotsky's permanent revolution.
''The Creation of the American Republic, 1776-1787'' was much admired for its craftsmanship and for its substantive contribution. It won both the Bancroft and John H. Dunning Prizes. But Wood did not rest on his laurels. In 1969 he also published a small book on the founders' complex and highly creative thinking about political representation -- a pivotal problem in the American Revolution. Other short pieces followed, and many appear together for the first time in this new volume. One essay included here, originally presented as a lecture in 1974 on democracy and voting in the new Republic, reversed the customary wisdom on that subject. Wood found that ''it is not suffrage that gives life to democracy; it is our democratic society that gives life to suffrage.'' That theme has important implications in our own world. Other essays in this book take up problems on constitutions and constitutionalism, democracies and republics, political power and human rights, always in Wood's careful and very creative way.
In 1992 these small essays led to another big book, ''The Radicalism of the American Revolution.'' Here Wood enlarged his earlier idea of a political thought-/revolution, circa 1776-87, into a model of a sweeping social revolution from 1760 to 1825. He argued that this transformation ''was as radical and social as any revolution in history, but it was radical and social in a very special 18th-century sense.'' Wood wrote that ''one class did not overthrow another; the poor did not supplant the rich. But social relationships -- the way people were connected one to another -- were changed, and decisively so.'' The book altered the way historians thought about their field. It won a Pulitzer Prize for history.
In the 1990s, Wood followed it with another wave of small studies on the large figures who dominate our memory of the Revolution. Several of these essays appear in this volume. A piece on Thomas Jefferson and Tom Paine rescues them from ''some very brutal and often deserved bashing'' by exploring an idea of humanity that these very different men shared. Another empathetic essay studies Alexander Hamilton and George Washington on the problem of monarchy in the new Republic.
Wood published many other articles on the founders in 2006, in a lively collection called ''Revolutionary Characters.'' He added a separate volume on Benjamin Franklin, the most complicated founder of them all. Always, Wood's purpose was not to celebrate or condemn these leaders, but to understand them. His results lead us beyond the hagiographers who celebrate the founders as demigods, and iconoclasts who revile them as racists and sexists, an approach Wood believes to be inaccurate and anachronistic.
Wood expanded the scale of his inquiries yet again in 2009 in another big book, ''Empire of Liberty: A History of the Early Republic, 1789-1815,'' a volume in the excellent Oxford History of the United States. Here he links his earlier themes to an even larger transformation of an entire culture in its deepest values and purposes. This year he was awarded the National Humanities Medal. Altogether, Wood has done more than anyone to make the era of the Revolution and early Republic into one of the liveliest periods in American history.
His work has made a difference in one more way. It reinforced the center when it was under heavy attack from both extremes. In a gentle reproof to scholars on the left, Wood has offered evidence that ''what is extraordinary about the American Revolution is not . . . the continual deprivation and repression of the mass of ordinary people, but rather their release and liberation.'' To conservatives on the right he makes very clear that the Constitution and Bill of Rights were conceived by their framers in dynamic terms, and were intended to grow.
In all of this work, the strength of Wood's scholarship derives from qualities of caution, balance and restraint that are uniquely his own. He avoids questions that cannot be answered by research, even questions of causation that engage most of his colleagues. Wood writes that ''it is difficult, if not impossible, to apply the physical notion of 'cause' to human action.'' He is mistaken here; other causal ideas go far beyond that physical model. But Wood's approach is fundamental to his success. As a historian he asks not why people do things, but what they think they are doing, and how their thoughts have changed through time. Ideas are studied not as underlying motives for action, but in another way. Wood believes that ''ideas and language give meaning to our actions, and there is almost nothing that we humans do to which we do not attribute meaning.''
And on the ''lessons of the past,'' Wood is even more restrained. In his new book he observes: ''If the study of history teaches anything, it teaches us the limitations of life. It ought to produce prudence and humility.'' Gordon Wood teaches that lesson by the strength of his own example.

HEADLINE: Jeff Moss

BYLINE: By KATE MURPHY

 BODY:
Kate Murphy is a journalist in Houston who writes frequently for The New York Times.
We asked Jeff Moss, a k a Dark Tangent, how he is spending his free time these days. He's an Internet security expert and geek hero because of his founding of the Black Hat and Def Con hacker and security conferences. 
He is also a member of the president's Homeland Security Advisory Council, and as of April, chief security officer at the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or Icann.
READING I recently read ''The Undercover Economist'' by Tim Harford. It starts at the beginning and walks you through the dynamics of economics.
He uses the example of a coffee shop near an Underground station in London so you learn why things happen the way they do. I love books that pull back the curtain. It's like taking a college course but more enjoyable.
I have also always enjoyed Japanese Manga, and in high school discovered the translated ''Appleseed'' series by Masamune Shirow.
The blending of tech, society design, combat and intrigue was much more complex than any American comic books.
FOLLOWING I have an aversion to news nuggets, so I find myself looking for sites that offer more analysis. I like cfr.org, which is the site for the Council on Foreign Relations. And I like stratfor.com. It has a lot of geopolitical strategic forecasting. For generic tech news, I look at slashdot.org. I also read Bruce Schneier's blog (schneier.com). He's a prolific writer on tech security, and he's very logical.
WATCHING ''A Nero Wolfe Mystery.'' I have the DVD set of the television series that ran from 2001 to 2002 on A&E. It takes place in 1940s New York and the private detective, Nero Wolfe, never leaves the house. He sends out his assistant, Archie Goodwin, to gather all the facts, and Wolfe, through his pure mental abilities, figures everything out.
PLAYING My wife and I play LittleBigPlanet on PlayStation 3, smiling the whole time even when we're getting blown up. It was developed as a children's game, and it has sock puppet creatures called poppets that collaboratively solve puzzles to get a prize.
TOTING I am really enjoying my Samsung Galaxy Tab. Smaller than an iPad, I can slip it in my suit pocket or the back pocket of my jeans. It is a tablet, a phone, a movie player and all that. But I find myself using paper and pencil to keep my calendar straight. Too many conflicting calendars in my life, Google calendar, BlackBerry, this phone, that phone. So I do it the old-fashioned way. Also, it is more secure.
CONSUMINGMr. Bean. It's a franchise that serves fresh-pressed soy milk and tofu in Singapore, where my wife is from. Warm with a little sugar, it's really yummy.

HEADLINE: R.O.I.

BYLINE: By CECILIA CAPUZZI SIMON. 
Cecilia Capuzzi Simon covers education from Washington, D.C., and teaches writing at American University.

 BODY:
Graduate school has long been a recession hideout, a place to add new skills and credentials that, presumably, increase job opportunities and salary in a market recovered by graduation. A year after 2008's economic meltdown, applications to graduate school rose more than 8 percent. Last year, as the country hobbled toward recovery (or not), 27 percent of college seniors said they planned to attend immediately after graduation, up from 21 percent in 2007, according to the National Association of Colleges and Employers.
Students will invest, typically, two or more years in advanced study and thousands of dollars in tuition and expenses. A little more than half of students working toward a master's will borrow an average $31,000, on top of any undergraduate debt they may already have.
So as a strictly financial calculation, does the investment pay off? 
Some academics balk at the return-on-investment question. ''Universities don't sit around and say, 'We will only have graduate schools in which the starting salary is higher than the tuition,' '' says Nicholas Lemann, dean of Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism. Journalists, like others who are pursuing a passion, he says, ''do not think of their lives in pure R.O.I. terms.''
Indeed, when it comes to gauging the value of education, considering only payback is seldom sound, especially for programs steeped in traditions of ''knowledge for knowledge's sake.'' But if schools of applied learning aren't asking the tough questions about the financials of a degree, potential students should, says Anthony P. Carnevale, director of Georgetown University's Center on Education and the Workforce. ''No one's telling them what it's worth. Certainly the colleges aren't.''
Looking at the big picture, the case for grad school seems indisputable: in 2009, the median salary of master's recipients was nearly 25 percent more than that of colleagues with only a bachelor's, according to a report released in May by Dr. Carnevale that analyzed never-before-gathered Census Bureau data on compensation by major and degree level.
Dr. Carnevale concludes that grad school is ''the best place to ride out a recession'' for those who can afford it and are young enough (under 35) to reap the long-term benefit, or who are in fields like health or social work where a master's or certification is critical to advance. For new college graduates, he says, entering the current job market with a diminished starting salary and job description could compromise a lifelong career and earnings trajectory.
Think of grad school as a 40-year investment, Dr. Carnevale says. Over time, it can move you out of the rank and file into elite positions. The key is determining where the jobs and compensation are. Consider, in your calculation, these variables: institutional quality, tuition costs, debt incurred, and the economic outlook over all and for particular specialties. So-called opportunity costs -- lost wages and possible career advancement had you stayed in the job market -- also change the cost-benefit picture.
''Field matters,'' Dr. Carnevale and others caution. As the Census study shows, in some fields the bump from an advanced degree is minuscule (meteorology), or relatively small because it's coming off an already low salary (counseling psychology).
But over all, in every major, more education results in more money, and in some (engineering) the increase can be significant.
Engineers are in such demand that those fresh out of undergraduate programs land well-paying positions, and it's a field that values skills learned on the job.
Still, a graduate degree can identify candidates in the workplace for higher-paying management positions or jobs that require specialized knowledge, says Jeff Strohl, an economist who worked on the Georgetown report. In that report, engineers with master's degrees in 2009 earned a median salary of $99,000 -- $24,000 more than those with only a bachelor's. With research grants covering tuition for many students, a master's degree in engineering can provide a great return on investment.
That is not usually the case for doctorates, however, unless they move into high-tech fields or supervisory roles. K. Mani Chandy, chairman of the engineering school at the California Institute of Technology, makes clear to Ph.D. candidates at the outset that they will give up significant income and five years of marketplace experience -- perhaps the bigger sacrifice, he says, in the fast-changing world of engineering and information technology.
''The R.O.I. for them,'' he adds, ''is intellectual happiness and not money.''
Which brings us back to journalism students' labors of love. Hopefuls can spend between $18,680 (in-state for Kansas State University's two-year program) and $50,000 (for Columbia's one-year degree) for a master's that, according to an annual survey by the University of Georgia, adds about $9,000 to starting salary. That's on average $39,000 for those lucky enough to find a job in the worst employment market for journalists in 25 years. (By graduation, 31 percent of Columbia's class of 2011 had full-time job offers; half had lined up paid internships, which Mr. Lemann insists often lead to jobs.)
If a degree in journalism seems risky, the financial benefit of an M.B.A., while taking a hit during the recession, is clear. The average expected starting salary of an M.B.A. in 2011 is $91,000, according to the Graduate Management Admission Council.
The institution attended can influence R.O.I. as well. Using data from GMAC and other sources, two business-school professors set out to calculate the financial impact of an M.B.A. In 2007, the 50 top-ranked M.B.A. schools averaged a 17 percent return on investment -- that's starting salary compared to tuition costs, according to the two professors, Brooks C. Holtom at Georgetown and Edward J. Inderrieden at Marquette University.
The top-10 M.B.A. schools, with their higher tuition ($102,000 at Harvard; $108,000 for Wharton), scored a lower R.O.I. of 12 percent. But with corresponding raises and bonuses and institutional cachet, the net value of the investment in an M.B.A. from an elite institution is greater over time, according to Dr. Holtom and Dr. Inderrieden.
Business is on Dr. Carnevale's ''you're-crazy-if-you-don't'' list, along with life sciences, physical sciences and social work.
The master's in social work has become ''absolutely essential'' to advance in the profession, says Jacqueline B. Mondros, dean of Hunter College's School of Social Work, of the City University of New York. Ninety percent of the members of the National Association of Social Workers, the field's largest professional organization, have an M.S.W. But the return on investment won't tempt. For social workers with the advanced degree, the median salary in 2009 was $55,000, according to the group's research. Social workers with a B.A. earned $15,000 less, while Ph.D.'s added $17,000 to their median pay.
And the investment? Students seeking an M.S.W. borrow an average $35,500; a degree can cost about $20,000 at Hunter or $80,000 at Columbia. By comparison, their M.B.A. counterparts borrow on average $32,000, and more M.S.W. candidates borrow (three-quarters of them; half of M.B.A. students borrow).
The rule of thumb for borrowing, says Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of finaid.org, is that debt should never exceed starting salary. Ideally, he adds, it should be half that.
''I'd be the last person to say not to pursue a dream,'' Mr. Kantrowitz says. ''But do it with your eyes open.''
It's easy to see how students can get into financial trouble, and how the economics of postsecondary school can affect choices, and so the professions themselves.
That's what's happening in veterinary medicine. Vet students pay tuition comparable to medical students. They also take on comparable debt. At Cornell University's highly regarded program, tuition for three years totals $85,200 ($128,250 for nonresidents) at 2010 rates, and students incurred a mean debt of $92,700. Last year, half of Cornell graduates went on to jobs with an average starting salary of $75,000. Counting the half that went on to low-paying internships brings the average to $68,000.
The field, dominated by small businesses, was hit hard in the recession as practices cut back on staff vets. To pay off debt, most graduates are choosing more lucrative urban ''companion animal'' practices over rural, large-animal practices. This has caused a shortage that will worsen as practitioners retire, and applications have stagnated.
''The debt-to-salary ratio is something we worry about,'' says Michael I. Kotlikoff, dean of the Cornell veterinary medicine program. ''It's not like philosophy or literature,'' fields notorious for turning out unemployable Ph.D.'s. ''But at some point you start to wonder whether that investment is financially sound.''
Meanwhile, many law school graduates are taking what work they can get. Last year, while law schools continued to overpopulate the market with J.D.'s (43,000 in 2009, or 11 percent more than a decade ago), 17,000 jobs were cut from the field, and there were 33 percent fewer summer associate offers.
Those who graduate from the top schools have the best opportunities for the high-paying jobs out there. But many newly minted lawyers are picking up hourly work, or taking staff jobs that typically pay $65,000 a year.
That happens to be the ''break-even salary'' that makes the investment in law school worthwhile, according to research from Northwestern University School of Law. (Many believe that figure to be low.)
A law degree can run $100,000 at low-tier schools, and upward of $140,000 at top ones. According to the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study, 89 percent of law students borrow an average $80,000. You don't need a master's degree in finance to see what kind of investment that might turn out to be.

CORRECTION-DATE: August 7, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article in the special Education Life section on July 24 about a degree's return on investment misstated the program cost for a master's of social work at Hunter College. It is $20,440, not $34,000. The article also misstated the cost of Cornell's veterinary medicine program. At the 2010 rate of $27,700 a year ($41,700 for nonresidents), the four-year program would cost $110,800 ($166,800 for nonresidents), not $85,000 ($128,250 for nonresidents).

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: The Postgraduate Population: The number of adults with advanced degrees in the United States, age 25 to 64, has soared since 1990, from about 10 million to more than 17 million in 2009. As a proportion of the population, the growth among women has been particularly striking, although they still lag behind men at the highest levels.
INTERNATIONAL GRADUATE STUDENTS: The number of foreign graduate students has risen sharply in recent years. In some fields, almost half the students are nonresident aliens.
Occupations: Men with advanced degrees are more likely to work in management, while women are clustered in teaching professions, which are lower paying. In 2009, women with a master's made 72 cents for every dollar made by a man
with a doctorate, 76 cents (both, a penny more than in 1990)
and with a professional degree, 64 cents (13 cents more than in 1990). (Sources: Census Bureau, Minnesota Population Center

HEADLINE: Where Do Dwarf-Eating Carp Come From?

BYLINE: By JONAH WEINER

 BODY:
Tarn Adams was in the carpeted spare bedroom that serves as his work space, trying to avert an apocalyptic outbreak of vampire dwarves. ''If they just run wild biting people, half the dwarves in the colony will be infected in no time,'' he said, shaking his head. ''That would be no fun.'' He was silent for a moment. ''Maybe they have to bite you three times before you're infected?''
Seated nearby was Tarn's older brother, Zach, squinting thoughtfully and jotting ideas into a notepad. It was a chilly afternoon in Silverdale, Wash., a town about 20 miles west of Seattle, and Tarn was wearing one of his favorite sweatshirts, a beige hoodie decorated with rows of strutting cats. The brothers -- both heavyset, with close-cropped brown hair and sweetly sheepish demeanors -- were conversing, as they do every day, about Dwarf Fortress, the computer game they began devising in 2002. 
Dwarf Fortress is barely a blip on the mainstream radar, but it's an object of intense cult adoration. Its various versions have been downloaded in the neighborhood of a million times, although the number of players who have persisted past an initial attempt is doubtless much smaller. As with popular simulation games like the Sims series, in which players control households, or the Facebook fad FarmVille, where they tend crops, players in Dwarf Fortress are responsible for the cultivation and management of a virtual ecosystem -- in this case, a colony of dwarves trying to build a thriving fortress in a randomly generated world. Unlike those games, though, Dwarf Fortress unfolds as a series of staggeringly elaborate challenges and devastating setbacks that lead, no matter how well one plays, to eventual ruin. The goal, in the game's main mode, is to build as much and as imaginatively as possible before some calamity -- stampeding elephants, famine, vampire dwarves -- wipes you out for good.
Though its medieval milieu of besieged castles and mutant enemies may be familiar, Dwarf Fortress appeals mainly to a substratum of hard-core gamers. The game's unofficial slogan, recited on message boards, is ''Losing is fun!'' Dwarf Fortress's unique difficulty begins with its most striking feature: The way it looks. In an industry obsessed with pushing the frontiers of visual awe, Dwarf Fortress is a defiant throwback, its interface a dense tapestry of letters, numbers and crude glyphs you might have seen in a computer game around 1980. A normal person looks at <7>dg and sees gibberish, but the Dwarf Fortress initiate sees a tense tableau: a dog leashed to a tree, about to be mauled by a goblin.
This bare-bones aesthetic allows Tarn to focus resources not on graphics but on mechanics, which he values much more. Many simulation games offer players a bag of building blocks, but few dangle a bag as deep, or blocks as small and intricately interlocking, as Dwarf Fortress. Beneath the game's rudimentary facade is a dizzying array of moving parts, algorithms that model everything from dwarves' personalities (some are depressive; many appreciate art) to the climate and economic patterns of the simulated world. The story of a fortress's rise and fall isn't scripted beforehand -- in most games narratives progress along an essentially set path -- but, rather, generated on the fly by a multitude of variables. The brothers themselves are often startled by what their game spits out. ''We didn't know that carp were going to eat dwarves,'' Zach says. ''But we'd written them as carnivorous and roughly the same size as dwarves, so that just happened, and it was great.''
Dwarf Fortress may not look real, but once you're hooked, it feels vast, enveloping, alive. To control your world, you toggle between multiple menus of text commands; seemingly simple acts like planting crops and forging weapons require involved choices about soil and season and smelting and ores. A micromanager's dream, the game gleefully blurs the distinction between painstaking labor and creative thrill.
''Playing Dwarf Fortress is like taking the controls of a plane right as it's taking off,'' says Chris Dahlen, editor in chief of the gaming magazine Kill Screen. And, he added, ''flying a jet is a lot more interesting than just riding in a jet.''
Dwarf Fortress is too willfully noncommercial to have any discernible influence on gaming at large, but it is widely admired by game designers. Programmers behind The Sims 3 reportedly played Dwarf Fortress when they were making their game, and several homages to Dwarf Fortress appear in the blockbuster fantasy game World of Warcraft. Richard Garfield, who created the hit card game Magic: The Gathering, once attended a Dwarf Fortress fan meet in Seattle to introduce himself to Tarn. ''I told him there's nothing out there quite like it,'' Garfield recalled. He suggested ways of broadening the game's appeal, but ''that stuff didn't matter to Tarn. The charm of it is that he's making exactly the game he wants to make.''
After nine years of development, Dwarf Fortress is, from the perspective of game play, perhaps the most complex video game ever made. And yet it is still only in ''alpha'' -- the most recent release is version 0.31. By version 1.0, Tarn says, the game will include military campaigns and magic, along with scores of other additions. He showed me a four-inch stack of index cards, color-coded and arranged into umbrella categories, to keep track of his goals. ''I like being able to hold the game in my hands,'' he says.
I asked Tarn when he thought he and Zach would reach version 1.0. ''Twenty years from now,'' he replied. ''That's the number we talk about.'' He chuckled at the prospect, adding that even when that milestone arrived, Dwarf Fortress would keep growing. ''This is going to be my life's work.''
Tarn, 33, lives in an apartment complex abutting one of the many shopping plazas that make up Silverdale, a town he calls ''a strip mall.'' His place has two bedrooms, the larger of which he uses for programming and which is nearly empty except for his computer desk, a framed picture of his part Manx, part Maine Coon cat, Scamps, and a fuzzy cat tree. In the living room are two gray folding tables for playing board games like Arkham Horror and Descent, and a box of Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 games. Tarn said he seldom touches these because ''most of them suck.'' The only furniture in the small dining room is Scamps's litter box.
If much of Tarn's apartment suggests a tenant who never fully moved in, his bedroom suggests a tenant who never sets a sock outdoors. When I peeked inside, rumpled underwear, discarded boxes and books lay scattered across the carpet. A sheet of plywood, edged with black foam rubber, was wedged into the window frame and affixed there by metal clamps. Tarn wakes up around 3 p.m. every day, codes through the night and goes to bed around 6 a.m. The plywood keeps slumber-disturbing daylight out of the room, making it a chamber fit for a vampire dwarf -- or at least for a computer programmer.
Tarn and Zach's parents live on several wooded acres in nearby Bremerton, and Zach, who is 35 and between jobs, has lived with them since 2002. Zach brought over a drinking glass from the house in case I got thirsty, because Tarn owns only a couple of dishes. In the fridge were three sodas and a jug of water and nothing else. Tarn said I was welcome to anything, although the jug technically belonged to Scamps -- the tap water has something in it that makes the cat refuse to drink it. Tarn consumed ''maybe one glass'' of water in the last three months, hydrating with soft drinks instead. ''Water's not doing it for me these days,'' he said. ''I know it's bad, but the sugar goes right into programming the game. If I don't drink soda now, I get a headache and can't do any work.''
Near midnight one evening, after a chat with Zach about incorporating sewers into the game, Tarn settled into his coding routine, opening his C++ software and firing up a Pandora playlist of upbeat soul. (Zach, less adept at programming, contributes to the game by brainstorming ideas.) Tarn surveyed the code, arrayed before him in tiny type, and began rocking in his swivel chair so vigorously that its joints squawked. The rocking had nothing to do with the music. ''It's a tic,'' he explained later. ''Sometimes I don't even notice I'm doing it. During tests at college, people would yell at me to knock it off.''
As Tarn got into the zone, his muttered profanities and grumbles about ''x distances'' took on a mantralike quality. Conjuring sewers, he would type out lines of code, let the software effect his changes, frown at the results, then tweak. Initially, the sewers appeared as an illogical tangle of blue gashes, but line by line, Tarn worked them into coherence.
At about 1:30 a.m., a family of hippos, represented by light gray H's, swam into the tunnels from a nearby river. Their arrival was an unintended development born entirely of the game's internal logic. Tarn was pleased. ''The hippos like the sewers!'' he said. He took a celebratory swig of Dr. Pepper and rocked back and forth.
Despite the modesty of Tarn's setup, he has a lot riding on Dwarf Fortress. For much of his adult life, he was headed in a very different direction. He'd enrolled at the University of Washington, where he became a star math student. He wasn't much interested in the social atmosphere of dorms and spent his freshman year splitting a Seattle apartment with Zach, who was a senior majoring in ancient history at the university. When Zach graduated, Tarn moved into a string of ''dingy one-bedrooms'' with ''bad moisture problems'' -- in one, he discovered a shelf fungus growing behind his couch. Tarn didn't take notes in class, such was his facility with the material, and he still ''4.0'd almost everything.'' In his final year, the faculty named him best math major.
Tarn applied to 17 Ph.D. programs, got into 15 and, wavering briefly between M.I.T. and Stanford, chose the latter. He earned his doctorate in 2005 with a dissertation called ''Flat Chains in Banach Spaces,'' a rumination on concepts in advanced geometry that he describes as ''not that interesting to that many people, but a nice little paper.'' He published a version of it in The Journal of Geometric Analysis and, landing a postdoc at Texas A&M, seemed destined for the academic career he envisioned since his undergraduate days.
But Tarn wasn't entirely happy. He'd had doubts about pursuing a career in math since the ''pressure cooker'' of his first year at Stanford, when he failed his qualifying exams (students get two chances; he passed the second time). Faced with the school's highly competitive and professionalized environment, he came to regard himself as a ''second-rate mathematician.'' The issue wasn't aptitude so much as passion. He wanted to do math but also to make video games, a juggling act he managed as an undergraduate. This had become impossible. ''They wanted 60 hours a week from you, giving you problems that would take 20 hours to solve,'' he said. He grew depressed and, in his only encounter with drugs, snorted meth.
For Tarn, making games ''scratches all the same itches'' as math: ''At the end of a math problem, you have a paper and maybe you publish it, and the paper can be a building block for the edifice of mathematics, but to me that's not so important. But working on a problem and having a game when you're done? That's pretty damn cool.''
In the summer of 2006, after a year at Texas A&M, Tarn went to his department head and, breaking into tears, quit. ''It wasn't easy,'' Tarn recalls. ''Being a mathematician was part of what I'd been doing for years. But it was easy in another sense, because I was so sick of it.'' His plan, if it counts as one, was to move home and devote himself fully to Dwarf Fortress, which he'd been developing as a hobby. He figured he'd burn through his $15,000 savings and sort things out from there. To Tarn's relief, Texas A&M offered to keep him on another year, paying him a $50,000 salary. ''I woke up the morning after I gave notice, like, I can actually make this work.''
Tarn has been programming computers for as long as he can remember. ''My earliest real memory is when my dad taught me how to use a 'FOR loop' in BASIC when I was 6, to make something go across the screen,'' he says. His father, Dan, worked in wastewater treatment, writing software to crunch data and run sewage plants, and he furnished the house with the latest computers. Tarn coded little animations and, in fifth grade, wrote his first fantasy game with Zach.
Tarn's grandmother, Elinor Ringland, who lives a short drive from Silverdale, says he was a restlessly curious child. ''I remember Tarn taking my hair dryer and burning a hole into a chair cushion,'' she told me. ''It wasn't mischievous; he was just inquisitive. We had to make sure he wouldn't go into the medicine cabinet and start mixing potions.'' (The brothers' parents declined to be interviewed; ''Calling them private is an understatement,'' Zach explained.)
Despite Tarn's adventurousness at home, he was withdrawn at school. ''Occasionally I'd have a friend, and we'd talk or joke around or whatever, but I didn't play sports or talk to people or have that experience,'' he says. ''I was a get-home-from-school, get-on-the-computer kind of kid.'' In high school he made one close friend, Alan Ames, who still corresponds sporadically with Tarn. ''We'd spend weekends making video games, or these silly 'Star Trek' parodies with his dad's video camera,'' Ames, who is now an aerospace engineer, recalled. ''He never cared about socializing.'' He had to be pushed to join the math club.
Growing up, Tarn was enamored of Dungeons & Dragons and J.R.R. Tolkien, but he has never been a lockstep member of the geek culture so much as a wanderer on the fringes. He didn't read superhero comics as a kid, and later, he never became obsessed with the ''Game of Thrones'' books, say, or with ''Lost.'' He graduated from D&D to the more obscure pen-and-paper game Cyberpunk 2020, and he and Zach would download indie computer games from early bulletin boards. They adored 1985's Hack 1.0.3, which, with its randomly generated levels, elaborate mechanics and primitive graphics, helped to popularize a microgenre of fantasy games known as roguelikes, which in turn influenced Dwarf Fortress. ''We liked that you could choke to death on your food or fall down a stairway and fall on something poisonous you were carrying and poison yourself,'' Tarn said.
Tarn calls Zach his best friend. The brothers' closeness is largely a function of frequent moves the family made for Dan Adams's work: by the time Tarn was 18, the family had been uprooted from Washington to California to New Hampshire and back to Washington. The brothers were the only constants in each other's lives besides their parents. ''There's been a couple times when I've gone off and done my own thing,'' Zach says, ''but I always come back to Tarn.''
In 2007, when Tarn left Texas and moved back to Washington, he lived at home before moving to Silverdale. ''I wanted to be close to Zach,'' he says, to collaborate more easily on the game and because Zach, who worked after graduation in an Amazon.com warehouse and as a stevedore, was ''going through some stuff.'' Zach, who alluded to past problems with alcohol (he no longer drinks), told me his marriage of two years had collapsed; neither brother wished to comment further. Zach's background in ancient history often helps in devising the imagery that gives Dwarf Fortress its atmosphere. For example, goblins hang the skin of conquered foes from towers, a gnarly detail the brothers got from a book on the Assyrians that Zach recommended.
When the weather permits, the brothers take walks along a trail that wends over marshland past plastic picnic tables near State Route 3. They watch crime procedurals at their parents' house and follow a one-meal-a-day rule (most local restaurants are open for just a few hours after Tarn wakes up), which can mean Quiznos, a turkey sandwich from the supermarket or root-beer popsicles and handfuls of dry Crispix (Tarn is lactose intolerant).
Tarn has been single since graduate school, when he dated a Cisco systems administrator for a short time. I asked him whether he wanted children. ''I don't mind the idea of never having kids,'' he said. ''I want to stay focused on the game, and if I had kids, I'd wind up paying attention to them instead.''
He expressed similar ambivalence about finding a romantic partner. ''If I were in the supermarket one day and someone came on really strong and it was a mutual thing, I'd probably get pushed along, but it's not something I'm anticipating,'' he said. His interest has dwindled. ''It's easier not to care about that stuff when you're in your 30s.''
Dwarf Fortress began life as ''a simple mining game, like Dig Dug,'' Tarn says. The brothers worked for about four years on an adventure title, rendered in 3-D graphics, called Slaves to Armok: God of Blood. Between battles, ''you could zoom in on your character, and it'd tell you how curly his leg hairs were, and the melting and flash points of various materials,'' Tarn said. ''It was insane.''
The brothers started a company called Bay 12, nicknaming themselves Toady One (Tarn) and ThreeToe (Zach), posting games that could be downloaded free and building a fan base of about 300 people. Tarn found 3-D graphics agonizingly time-consuming to program, and Dwarf Fortress was conceived as an undemanding side project: its full title is Slaves to Armok: God of Blood Chapter II: Dwarf Fortress. Soon enough, Armok was scrapped and Dwarf Fortress took over, inheriting its predecessor's fetish for complexity but none of its looks. It's like a jalopy with a V-12 under the hood. ''The processing power that Dwarf Fortress uses is on the same scale as modern engineering software for designing aerospace hardware,'' says Ames, the engineer. ''You have more complicated simulations in Dwarf Fortress than when you model the aerodynamics of a wing.''
Though it may seem ungainly at first, the game's interface -- rendered in what are known as extended ASCII characters -- has a sparse elegance. As seasons change, trees, represented by various symbols, shift from green to yellow. Goblins' eyes appear as red quotation marks; if you shoot out an eye with an arrow, the symbol becomes an apostrophe. On a message board, one fan likened the ASCII experience in Dwarf Fortress to the immersive pleasures of reading a book: ''You can let your imagination fill in the gaps.''
The community that has arisen around Dwarf Fortress is remarkable. Fans maintain an extensive wiki, which remains the game's best (and, effectively, only) instruction manual, and which even Tarn and Zach admit to consulting. There are fan-organized podcasts, and meet-ups where players converge on bars in homemade Dwarf Fortress shirts. On the Bay 12 forums, fans make suggestions for the game, and Tarn has implemented some of these. Last spring, a player calling himself Jong89 logged on with brain-bending news. Using ''672 pumps, 2,000 logs, 8,500 mechanisms and thousands of other assorted bits and knobs like doors and rock blocks,'' he'd built a crude but functioning computer within Dwarf Fortress.
Perhaps most fascinating are the stories that fans share online, recounting their dwarven travails in detailed and sometimes illustrated narratives. In a 2006 saga, called Boatmurdered, fans passed around a single fortress -- one player would save a game, send the file to another player and so on, relay-race style -- while documenting its colorful descent into oblivion. (After a vicious elephant attack: ''A single untrained marksdwarf stands ready to defend the crossing, but I doubt he'll be enough.'') Boatmurdered spread across gaming sites and made the front page of MetaFilter, a popular blog. ''That did a lot to make people aware we existed,'' Tarn says.
Shared projects like Boatmurdered mark the extent to which Tarn accommodates multiplayer participation. Massive multiplayer online games have been a lucrative industry trend for years, but Tarn disdains M.M.O.'s. To him, they replace the deep pleasures of imaginative game design with the novelty of community and are invariably oriented toward mass, lowest-common-denominator appeal. ''Half the people I met were 12-year-olds yelling homophobic slurs,'' he says.
At bottom, Dwarf Fortress mounts an argument about play. Many video games mimic the look and structure of films: there's a story line, more or less fixed, that progresses/ only when you complete required tasks. This can make for gripping fun, but also the constrictive sense that you are a mouse in a tricked-out maze, chasing chunks of cheese. Tarn envisions Dwarf Fortress, by contrast, as an open-ended ''story generator.'' He and Zach grew up playing computer games with notebooks in hand, drawing their own renditions of the randomly generated creatures they encountered and logging their journeys in detail. Dwarf Fortress, which never unfolds the same way twice, takes that spirit of supple, fully engaged play to the extreme.
Tarn sees his work in stridently ethical terms. He calls games like Angry Birds or Bejeweled, which ensnare players in addictive loops of frustration and gratification under the pretense that skill is required to win, ''abusive'' -- a common diagnosis among those who get hooked on the games, but a surprising one from a game designer, ostensibly charged with doing the hooking. ''Many popular games tap into something in a person that is compulsive, like hoarding,'' he said, ''the need to make progress with points or collect things. You sit there saying yeah-yeah-yeah and then you wake up and say, What the hell was I doing? You can call that kind of game fun, but only if you call compulsive gambling fun.'' He added: ''I used to value the ability to turn the user into your slave. I don't anymore.''
Tarn's scruples have certainly cost him fans, but he says he's doing fine. He has no plans to charge for the game; he subsists entirely on PayPal donations from players. ''I like that it's free, and if you care about it, you pay,'' he says. In 2010, he earned $50,000. (He calls that year, in which he released a major update after a long delay, anomalous, and expects to make $30,000 in 2011.) His expenses are low -- $860 a month in rent, $750 a month to Zach for his help and a few hundred dollars for utilities and food -- and as long as Dwarf Fortress is self-sustaining, he's happy. He has refused a programming job at a major developer (he asked that I keep its name off the record) and turned down a $300,000 offer from another company to license the Dwarf Fortress name, fearing that the proposed sum wouldn't sufficiently offset the long-term donations drop that would likely result.
But the game's profile is slowly growing on Tarn's own terms. This week, the Museum of Modern Art will include Dwarf Fortress in a major design exhibition called ''Talk to Me,'' which Paola Antonelli, senior curator of architecture and design at MoMA, describes as being about the ''communication between people and objects.'' Antonelli selected several simulation games for display in the show but was struck by the combination of ''beautiful aesthetics'' and ''mind-boggling'' complexity in Dwarf Fortress. ''When you are playing Dwarf Fortress, you are God, and the world is talking back to you,'' Antonelli said. Then she added, with a laugh, ''And you are a very anal god.''
Meanwhile, the smash success of the world-building game Minecraft, which is in many ways a more user-friendly version of Dwarf Fortress (and which has earned its Dwarf Fortress-loving creator millions of dollars), has only been good for Tarn, driving curious new players his way. Still, in the only moment I heard him speak with anything like bitterness, Tarn called Minecraft a ''depressing distillation of our own stuff.'' He paused, adding more magnanimously that the game ''has its own things going for it.'' The problem, he concluded, ''isn't with Minecraft so much as it's with society.''
On a bright spring day in Silverdale, Tarn and Zach spread heavy-stock paper across Tarn's living-room tables and opened a box of crayons. When players donate to Dwarf Fortress, they're offered a story written by Zach or a piece of crayon art drawn by Zach and colored by Tarn. These gifts contribute to an appealing sense of the game as handcrafted and personal. The brothers usually make the drawings at their grandmother's house, a monthly ritual in which she plays appraiser, deciding what a $5 donor will get and what a $100 donor will get.
They had 14 pending crayon requests, which ranged from carte blanche to comically precise. ''One guy wants a picture of seven dwarves being chased by four zombie badger boars,'' Tarn said, grinning. Hunched over the table with his tongue out, Zach would make a pencil outline, then Tarn would add color. ''Is this the goblin's shears or his armor?'' Tarn asked at one point.
Tarn and Zach reached the last drawing: two dwarves standing beside a massive tower under a starry sky. The scene had been rendered and colored, and all that was left to do was for Tarn to write a caption, conceived by the donor, along the bottom. ''Time for my chicken-scratch,'' Tarn said. Using a black Uni-Ball, he carefully lettered the caption, which read, ''We shall build a tower so tall, we can mine the very stars themselves!''
Tarn offered the pen to Zach. ''Do you want to sign it?''

HOW THE GAME IS PLAYED: Players run colonies of dwarves who build thriving fortresses where they trade, make crafts and fend off invading hordes -- goblins, vampire elephants, trolls and frogmen, to name a few -- for as long as possible. Defeat is inevitable, but the game fully engages players by asking them to imagine this world using simple ASCII characters instead of 3-D graphics. (MM18)

HEADLINE: Norway Attacks Put Spotlight on Rise of Right-Wing Sentiment in Europe

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS KULISH; Reporting was contributed by Steven Erlanger from Oslo, Katrin Bennhold from Paris, Stefan Pauly from Berlin, and Scott Shane from Washington.

 BODY:
BERLIN -- The attacks in Oslo on Friday have riveted new attention on right-wing extremists not just in Norway but across Europe, where opposition to Muslim immigrants, globalization, the power of the European Union and the drive toward multiculturalism has proven a potent political force and, in a few cases, a spur to violence.
The success of populist parties appealing to a sense of lost national identity has brought criticism of minorities, immigrants and in particular Muslims out of the beer halls and Internet chat rooms and into mainstream politics. While the parties themselves generally do not condone violence, some experts say a climate of hatred in the political discourse has encouraged violent individuals.
''I'm not surprised when things like the bombing in Norway happen, because you will always find people who feel more radical means are necessary,'' said Joerg Forbrig, an analyst at the German Marshall Fund in Berlin who has studied far-right issues in Europe. ''It literally is something that can happen in a number of places and there are broader problems behind it.'' 
Last November a Swedish man was arrested in the southern city of Malmo in connection with more than a dozen unsolved shootings of immigrants, including one fatality. The shootings, nine of which took place between June and October 2010, appeared to be the work of an isolated individual. More broadly in Sweden, though, the far-right Sweden Democrats experienced new success at the polls. The party entered Parliament for the first time after winning 5.7 percent of the vote in the general election last September.
The bombing and shootings in Oslo also have served as a wake-up call for security services in Europe and the United States that in recent years have become so focused on Islamic terrorists that they may have underestimated the threat of domestic radicals, including those upset by what they see as the influence of Islam.
In the United States the deadly attacks have reawakened memories of the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, where a right-wing extremist, Timothy J. McVeigh, used a fertilizer bomb to blow up a federal government building, killing 168 people. That deadly act had long since been overshadowed by the events of Sept. 11, 2001.
According to Mr. Forbrig, isolated right-wing groups in Europe would rise up and then quickly disappear from the '60s into the '90s. But in recent years far-right statements have appeared to lose much of their post-World War II taboo even among some prominent political parties.
A combination of increased migration from abroad and largely unrestricted movement of people within an enlarged European Union, such as the persecuted Roma minority, helped lay the groundwork for a nationalist, at times starkly chauvinist, revival.
Groups are gaining traction from Hungary to Italy, but it is particularly apparent in northern European countries that long have had liberal immigration policies. The rapid arrival of refugees, asylum seekers and economic migrants, many of them Muslims, led to a significant backlash in places like Denmark, where the Danish People's Party has 25 out of 179 seats in Parliament, and the Netherlands, where Geert Wilders's Party for Freedom won 15.5 percent of the vote in the 2010 general election.
Mr. Wilders famously compared the Koran, the holy book of Islam, to Adolf Hitler's ''Mein Kampf.'' Both the Danish and Dutch right-wing parties are backing precarious minority governments while not directly participating by having ministers, and inching toward mainstream acceptance in the process.
Friday's attacks were swiftly condemned by leaders from across the political spectrum in Europe. Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel was particularly sharp in speaking out against what she called an ''appalling crime.'' The sort of hatred that could fuel such an action, she said, went against ''freedom, respect and the belief in peaceful coexistence.''
Yet some of the primary motivations cited by the suspect in Norway, Anders Behring Breivik, are now mainstream issues. Mrs. Merkel, President Nicolas Sarkozy of France and Prime Minister David Cameron in Britain all recently declared an end to multiculturalism. Multiculturalism ''has failed, utterly failed,'' Mrs. Merkel told fellow Christian Democrats last October, though stressing that immigrants were welcome in Germany.
Perhaps the most surprising about-turn came in Britain, a country that has long considered itself among the most immigrant-friendly in Europe until a series of coordinated bomb attacks in London six years ago. In one of his most noticed speeches, Mr. Cameron told the Munich security conference in February that the country's decades-old policy of multiculturalism had encouraged ''segregated communities'' where Islamic extremism can thrive.
France, a fiercely secularist state where all religion is banned from the public sphere, was long isolated and berated for its staunch opposition to the laissez-faire of multiculturalism. Girls who show up in public schools there with the Muslim headscarf are suspended, as are teachers or any other employees in the public sector.
If Mr. Sarkozy appeared to soften his understanding of official secularism, or ''laicite'' earlier in his political career, even toying with the idea of affirmative action, he has recently scrambled to backtrack. He held a nationwide debate on ''national identity'' last year and earlier this year banned Muslim full-face veils like niqab, as well as the burqa.
That hasn't stopped the far-right National Front, now led by Marine Le Pen, the daughter of its founder, to surge in opinion polls, with some surveys predicting that she might make it into next year's presidential runoff. She compared Muslims praying in the streets outside overcrowded mosques to the Nazi occupation, and decries the European Union and the euro.
Earlier this month the daily newspaper Berliner Zeitung reported that neo-Nazis were attacking the offices of the far-left Left Party with increasing frequency. In the former East German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, statistics showed that there were 30 such attacks in the first half of 2011 compared to 44 attacks in all of 2010.
Due to its Nazi past, Germany keeps a watchful eye on right-wing extremists, and the parties of the far right have a hard time gaining traction, with no representatives in Parliament. In Finland, the True Finns, a populist nationalist party founded in 1995, became the third largest party represented in the Finnish Parliament after winning 19 percent of the vote in April. And Norway's Progress Party, a right-wing populist party, is the second largest in the country, winning 23 percent of the vote in the last parliamentary election in September 2009.
''The Norwegian right-wing groups have always been disorganized, haven't had charismatic leaders or the kind of well-organized groups with financial support that you see in Sweden,'' said Kari Helene Partapuoli, director of the Norwegian Center against Racism. ''But in the last two or three years our organization and other antifascist networks have warned of an increased temperature of debate and that violent groups had been established.''
But neither does Norway exist in a vacuum. Its right-wing scene is connected to the rest of Europe through the Internet forums where hate speech proliferates and through right-wing demonstrations that draw an international mix of participants.
''This may be the act of a lone, mad, paranoid individual,'' said Hajo Funke, a political scientist at the Free University in Berlin who studies rightist extremism, referring to the right-wing fundamentalist Christian charged in connection with the killings, ''but the far-right milieu creates an atmosphere that can lead such people down that path of violence.''

HEADLINE: Rebecca Longworth, Jason Korb

 BODY:
Rebecca Brittany Longworth and Jason Bryan Patricof Korb were married Saturday afternoon at Point Lookout Resort and Conference Center in Northport, Me. Dr. John R. Schreiber, who became a Universal Life minister for the occasion, officiated and led an ecumenical ceremony with Jewish cultural roots. 
The bride, 27, is taking her husband's name. She is the director of resource development at the Excel Academy Charter School in Boston. She graduated magna cum laude from Colby College in Waterville, Me.
She is a daughter of Dr. Ann J. Hritz and Dr. David L. Longworth of Wilbraham, Mass. The bride's father, an infectious disease specialist, is the chairman of the Medicine Institute at the Cleveland Clinic. Her mother, a general internist, is retired from the Cleveland Clinic.
The bridegroom, 34, is the founder of Capstone Communities, a real estate development company in Cambridge, Mass., that focuses on urban revitalization and historic rehabilitation. Mr. Korb is a director of Caritas Communities, a nonprofit group that builds housing for working poor people. He is also on the board of Preservation Massachusetts, a nonprofit organization that promotes the preservation of historic buildings and landscapes. He graduated with high honors from the University of Michigan and earned a master's from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
He is the son of Jaclyn Patricof Korb of Chestnut Hill, Mass., and the late Kenneth A. Korb. The bridegroom's mother retired as a kindergarten teacher from the Driscoll School, an elementary school in Brookline, Mass. His father was a senior partner at the Boston law firm Perkins Smith & Cohen.

HEADLINE: Looking at the Mix For a Child-Friendly City

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH LESLY STEVENS. 
estevens@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
Elizabeth Lesly Stevens writes a column for The Bay Citizen.
For Leslie Kossoff, an artist who lived in San Francisco for nearly two decades, her decision to leave the city was sealed last summer, as she helped her daughter, Sophie, now 6, dress for a ballet recital at public middle school in Noe Valley.
''The place stank of urine,'' Ms. Kossoff recalls. The restroom ''ceiling was caked with old toilet paper'' that had long ago been sodden and flung upward. ''It was like a women's prison.'' 
Meanwhile, in her mid-Market neighborhood, three pot clubs opened and a drug market flourished.
Ms. Kossoff, her partner and Sophie soon moved to Portland, Ore.
Her family joined an exodus that has solidified San Francisco's dubious distinction of being the American metropolis with the fewest children per capita. Census data from 2010 revealed that even though the city's population grew by 4 percent in the last decade, the city lost 5 percent of its children, leaving it with just 116,000, or 14 percent of the total population. By comparison, 15 percent of Manhattanites are younger than 18.
The decline came despite a 2006 decree by then-Mayor Gavin Newsom that made it an official mission of the city's Department of Children, Youth & Their Families (DCYF) to increase the number of children in the city.
DCYF finances many admirable programs, like after-school care and tutoring for aspiring writers at Dave Eggers's 826 Valencia organization. The department focuses on serving low-income families, and because it has seen a surge in demand in recent years, officials thought the city's population of families was stable, if not growing.
The census data indicating otherwise was ''so surprising to us,'' said Maria Su, who heads DCYF. ''It's sad. There is this key component to what we believe to be the energy of the city missing. Every strong community has children.''
Even Mr. Newsom decamped last month for a sylvan corner of Marin, taking his wife, toddler and infant with him.
The factors that prompt middle-class families like Ms. Kossoff's to leave are many, and perhaps not within the power of any city department to fix.
Consider the case of Shelley Esson, a Vancouver native who has lived in San Francisco for 12 years and seemingly a prime candidate for middle-class flight.
Ms. Esson came close to moving to the wine country with her young son and her husband, a bartender who grew up poor in Mexico. Last year, Crushpad, the make-your-own-wine outfit, moved her job from the city to Napa, and Ms. Esson declined to follow, though it meant she was jobless for several months.
Her decision to stay put came at considerable personal sacrifice. Ms. Esson works two jobs to make ends meet, and raises chickens and much of the family's food in her Richmond yard.
What keeps her here? The random, lucky break of her 7-year-old son's being assigned a decent school, and Ms. Esson's fear that he would fare poorly in a community that lacked San Francisco's Latino professional class.
In the wine country, she said, ''the perception would be that his dad picks grapes or is a gardener. Here, there is the possibility for him to see the best of what there is to achieve, with Latino politicians, doctors, lawyers. There's a lot less separation of the two cultures.''
So for Ms. Esson, the city's vibrant urban culture -- often viewed as a treasure trove for the hip and moneyed but one that offers little for many families -- is actually what is keeping her here.
The question, for San Francisco, is how to reconcile the dominant adult population that may not give a fig about how many children live here with the needs of parents and their children.
The answer may lie not in special child-focused efforts but rather in broader public policy changes and better management of key city services.
Well-kept, well-designed playgrounds and parks, a transit system that is clean and reliable, and a diverse local job market are obvious starting points. Reform of Proposition 13 that allows communities to set and spend taxes locally would give families a greater sense of self-determination.
Giving parents the power to chose where their children attend school would also be a huge step.
Supporters of the byzantine lottery system that has long governed school placement argue that the system ensures economic and racial diversity throughout schools. But if middle-class families continue to flee (and if wealthy ones opt for private schools), then there isn't much diversity left to preserve -- and even hardy souls like Ms. Esson might no longer be proud to call San Francisco home.

HEADLINE: What's On Sunday

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE RUSSELL

 BODY:
NOON (Fox Movie) NIAGARA (1953) Marilyn Monroe and Niagara Falls are both shining stars of this dramatic thriller. Honeymooners Polly (Jean Peters) and Ray Cutler (Casey Adams) arrive at their cottage by the falls to find that Rose (Monroe) and George Loomis (Joseph Cotten, above with Monroe) have not yet checked out. The Cutlers take temporary accommodations, and the two couples' lives quickly become intertwined, making secrets harder to keep. Polly soon discovers that Rose is cheating on her husband and that his jealous rage is likely justified, although he does seem a bit unstable. 
And George's uneven personality is caused by Rose's openly lascivious behavior around other men, which is part of her plan. You see, Rose's lover, Patrick (Richard Allan), is to murder George, and it will appear to be the unsurprising suicide or disappearance of a temperamental man. Murder plots rarely go according to plan, however. At 1:30 is the whodunit film noir ''I Wake Up Screaming,'' (1941) starring Betty Grable, Victor Mature and Carole Landis. Frankie (Mature), a promoter, has been accused of murdering Vicky (Landis), a model and aspiring actress. Frankie and Vicky's sister, Jill (Grable), are interrogated for hours and their answers turned into flashbacks reveal the plot. A very eager cop played by Laird Cregar torments and pressures Frankie, and circumstantial evidence against the suspect starts to pile up.

HEADLINE: Julia Levy, Ari Edelson

BYLINE: By ROSALIE R. RADOMSKY

 BODY:
Julia Claire Levy and Ari Jon Edelson are to be married Sunday evening at Stage 6 at Steiner Studios in Brooklyn. Rabbi Robert N. Levine is to lead the ceremony. 
Ms. Levy, 31, will be keeping her name. She works for the Council on Foreign Relations in Manhattan, where she is the project director of the independent task force on United States education reform and national security. Until 2009, she was the director of communications for the New York City Department of Education. She graduated cum laude from Dartmouth and received an M.B.A. from Columbia.
She is a daughter of Elizabeth C. Levy and Mickey D. Levy of Manhattan. The bride's father is the chief economist of Bank of America and works in Manhattan. He is on the governance board of the Research Alliance for New York City Schools, a nonprofit group that does research on education policy. Her mother is a ceramic artist.
Mr. Edelson, 34, is the artistic director of the Exchange, a theater company in Manhattan. In May, he directed ''Little Black Dress,'' a play by Ronan Noone, at the Theater of St. Clements in Manhattan. He graduated from Yale and received a master's in dramatic arts from the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama.
He is a son of Ruth Cheris Edelson and Dr. Richard L. Edelson of Westport, Conn. The bridegroom's mother retired as the director of special projects at Johnson & Johnson in New Brunswick, N.J. She is now a jewelry designer. His father, a dermatologist, is the chairman of the department of dermatology at the Yale School of Medicine and the president of the Dermatology Foundation, which supports research. Until 2009, he was the director of the Yale Cancer Center.
Mr. Edelson fed into Ms. Levy's passion for sweets and baking when he proposed in September 2010, a year and a half after he initially wooed her with a box of his favorite cookies, from the Levain Bakery on the Upper West Side, which he had sent to her office.
He took her to the bakery, which stayed opened a half-hour later than usual for the occasion. She said she recalled that he seemed ''kind of nervous'' and that there were more cookies than usual in the display case. Then she noticed the cards atop the cookies.
Together they read, ''Julia, will you please marry me?''
Her favorite, chocolate-chip walnut, had a ''yes'' sign in all capital letters, and her least favorite, oatmeal raisin, intentionally overdone and smaller than the rest, read ''no.''
''It was so overwhelming,'' she said.
She chose the chocolate-chip walnut.

HEADLINE: Republicans, Zealots and Our Security

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
IF China or Iran threatened our national credit rating and tried to drive up our interest rates, or if they sought to damage our education system, we would erupt in outrage.
Well, wake up to the national security threat. Only it's not coming from abroad, but from our own domestic extremists.
We tend to think of national security narrowly as the risk of a military or terrorist attack. But national security is about protecting our people and our national strength -- and the blunt truth is that the biggest threat to America's national security this summer doesn't come from China, Iran or any other foreign power. It comes from budget machinations, and budget maniacs, at home. 
House Republicans start from a legitimate concern about rising long-term debt. Politicians are usually focused only on short-term issues, so it would be commendable to see the Tea Party wing of the Republican Party seriously focused on containing long-term debt. But on this issue, many House Republicans aren't serious, they're just obsessive in a destructive way. The upshot is that in their effort to protect the American economy from debt, some of them are willing to drag it over the cliff of default.
It is not exactly true that this would be our first default. We defaulted in 1790. By some definitions, we defaulted on certain gold obligations in 1933. And in 1979, the United States had trouble managing payouts to some individual investors on time (partly because of a failure of word processing equipment) and thus was in technical default.
Yet even that brief lapse in 1979 raised interest payments in the United States. Terry L. Zivney, a finance professor at Ball State University and co-author of a scholarly paper about the episode, says the 1979 default increased American government borrowing costs by 0.6 of a percentage point indefinitely.
Any deliberate and sustained interruption this year could have a greater impact. We would see higher interest rates on mortgages, car loans, business loans and credit cards.
American government borrowing would also become more expensive. In February, the Congressional Budget Office noted that a 1 percentage point rise in interest rates could add more than $1 trillion to borrowing costs over a decade.
In other words, Republican zeal to lower debts could result in increased interest expenses and higher debts. Their mania to save taxpayers could cost taxpayers. That suggests not governance so much as fanaticism.
More broadly, a default would leave America a global laughingstock. Our ''soft power,'' our promotion of democracy around the world, and our influence would all take a hit. The spectacle of paralysis in the world's largest economy is already bewildering to many countries. If there is awe for our military prowess and delight in our movies and music, there is scorn for our political/economic management.
While one danger to national security comes from the risk of default, another comes from overzealous budget cuts -- especially in education, at the local, state and national levels. When we cut to the education bone, we're not preserving our future but undermining it.
It should be a national disgrace that the United States government has eliminated spending for major literacy programs in the last few months, with scarcely a murmur of dissent.
Consider Reading Is Fundamental, a 45-year-old nonprofit program that has cost the federal government only $25 million annually. It's a public-private partnership with 400,000 volunteers, and it puts books in the hands of low-income children. The program helped four million American children improve their reading skills last year. Now it has lost all federal support.
''They have made a real difference for millions of kids,'' Kyle Zimmer, founder of First Book, another literacy program that I've admired, said of Reading Is Fundamental. ''It is a tremendous loss that their federal support has been cut. We are going to pay for these cuts in education for generations.''
Education programs like these aren't quick fixes, and the relation between spending and outcomes is uncertain and complex. Nurturing reading skills is a slog rather than a sprint -- but without universal literacy we have no hope of spreading opportunity, fighting crime or chipping away at poverty.
''The attack on literacy programs reflects a broader assault on education programs,'' said Rosa DeLauro, a Democratic member of Congress from Connecticut. She notes that Republicans want to cut everything from early childhood programs to Pell grants for college students. Republican proposals have singled out some 43 education programs for elimination, but it's not seen as equally essential to end tax loopholes on hedge fund managers.
So let's remember not only the national security risks posed by Iran and Al Qaeda. Let's also focus on the risks, however unintentional, from domestic zealots.

HEADLINE: Default Seen Unlikely, But Markets Prepare

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM and ERIC DASH; Binyamin Appelbaum reported from Washington, and Eric Dash from New York. Louise Story contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- World markets have behaved until now as if it were inevitable that Congress would raise the debt ceiling, the maximum amount the federal government can borrow, before the Treasury Department exhausts its ability to pay all of its bills in early August. The breakdown of negotiations Friday has jolted that sense of equanimity, wrenching the worst-case scenario from unthinkable to merely unlikely.
Some debt traders said they were looking for evidence of progress toward a deal before markets open on Monday. 
''This press conference was a pretty significant moment,'' said Ajay Rajadhyaksha, head of United States fixed-income strategy at Barclays Capital, referring to President Obama's announcement after markets had closed for the week that talks had broken down. ''I would be pretty surprised if investors did not exhibit a greater degree of worry when we walk in Monday morning than they have shown so far.''
Aware of the pressure of Monday's market opening, Speaker John A. Boehner said Saturday that Congressional leaders were working on a new deficit-reduction plan that would resolve the impasse and allow the debt ceiling to be raised. He said he hoped the plan could be announced within the next 24 hours.
Even if a deal is reached, investors have become increasingly worried that the rating agency Standard & Poor's may reconsider its certification of government securities as an ultrasafe investment. The company has said there is a 50 percent chance it will downgrade the rating in the next three months, depending on whether the federal government adopts a long-term plan to pay down its debts. Such a move could send interest rates higher for a broad range of government and consumer loans.
Some of the options still on the table to raise the debt ceiling, involving smaller packages of spending cuts, might not be sufficient to satisfy S.& P. or Moody's and Fitch, two other rating agencies that have expressed concern over the debt negotiations.
''I think the market still has confidence that the debt ceiling will be raised in time,'' said Terry Belton, head of fixed-income strategy at JPMorgan Chase. ''The focus is on downgrade risk.''
A downgrade would raise the government's borrowing costs, exacerbating its financial problems, because investors generally demand higher interest rates to hold riskier debt. Consumers and businesses also would face higher borrowing costs because the rates on Treasuries are widely used as a benchmark to set the rates on other kinds of loans.
The government cannot borrow more than $14.3 trillion, the current debt ceiling, a limit that it reached in May. Since then, however, Treasury has continued to repay securities as they come due and issue new debt in their place, a process known as rolling over debt. Officials are concerned that it will become harder to find investors willing to participate in the weekly auctions, and that the remaining buyers will begin to demand higher interest rates.
Over the last few weeks staff members in the Office of Debt Management, a part of the Treasury, have been phoning the desks of the 20 major Wall Street dealers for Treasury bonds to assess investor demand for coming debt auctions, and to seek assurances that the dealers themselves will buy any surplus.
About $87 billion in federal debt comes due on Aug. 4, and roughly $410 billion comes due throughout the rest of August. If interest rates climbed even a tenth of a percentage point, the added cost to roll over the debt would be an extra $500 million a year.
Wall Street is also worried about the effect that a ratings downgrade would have on various assets that are implicitly backed by the federal government, including agency mortgages or municipal bonds.
The heightened uncertainty is prompting financial firms and other companies to stockpile cash. Walter Todd of Greenwood Capital, a wealth management firm in Greenwood, S.C., said that so far he had advised his own worried customers not to do the same, operating under the assumption that a deal would be reached. But after the talks fell apart on Friday, Mr. Todd said he and his partners began to discuss a more pessimistic possibility.
''If nothing changes, if the headline out of the weekend is that the talks have broken down, I think you'll start to see assets reacting to that,'' Mr. Todd said. ''It blows my mind that it's come to this. It's incredibly irresponsible what's happening, on the part of both sides.''
Other investors said they did not view the opening of markets on Monday as a critical deadline, as they still expected a deal, but that each passing day would put a little more stress on the markets. Bond prices fluctuated last week on the news from Washington, falling Thursday after S.& P.'s latest warning, then rising on Friday amid renewed talk that a deal was imminent.
''Every day without an agreement increases the risk of default,'' said Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist at Jefferies & Company. ''Congress likes to go to the edge of the precipice with the debt ceiling, and we are headed toward the edge again.''

HEADLINE: Bad Food? Tax It

BYLINE: By MARK BITTMAN

 BODY:
Mark Bittman writes about food for the opinion section.
WHAT will it take to get Americans to change our eating habits? The need is indisputable, since heart disease, diabetes and cancer are all in large part caused by the Standard American Diet. (Yes, it's SAD.)
Though experts increasingly recommend a diet high in plants and low in animal products and processed foods, ours is quite the opposite, and there's little disagreement that changing it could improve our health and save tens of millions of lives.
And -- not inconsequential during the current struggle over deficits and spending -- a sane diet could save tens if not hundreds of billions of dollars in health care costs.
Yet the food industry appears incapable of marketing healthier foods. And whether its leaders are confused or just stalling doesn't matter, because the fixes are not really their problem. Their mission is not public health but profit, so they'll continue to sell the health-damaging food that's most profitable, until the market or another force skews things otherwise. That ''other force'' should be the federal government, fulfilling its role as an agent of the public good and establishing a bold national fix. 
Rather than subsidizing the production of unhealthful foods, we should turn the tables and tax things like soda, French fries, doughnuts and hyperprocessed snacks. The resulting income should be earmarked for a program that encourages a sound diet for Americans by making healthy food more affordable and widely available.
The average American consumes 44.7 gallons of soft drinks annually. (Although that includes diet sodas, it does not include noncarbonated sweetened beverages, which add up to at least 17 gallons a person per year.) Sweetened drinks could be taxed at 2 cents per ounce, so a six-pack of Pepsi would cost $1.44 more than it does now. An equivalent tax on fries might be 50 cents per serving; a quarter extra for a doughnut. (We have experts who can figure out how ''bad'' a food should be to qualify, and what the rate should be; right now they're busy calculating ethanol subsidies. Diet sodas would not be taxed.)
Simply put: taxes would reduce consumption of unhealthful foods and generate billions of dollars annually. That money could be used to subsidize the purchase of staple foods like seasonal greens, vegetables, whole grains, dried legumes and fruit.
We could sell those staples cheap -- let's say for 50 cents a pound -- and almost everywhere: drugstores, street corners, convenience stores, bodegas, supermarkets, liquor stores, even schools, libraries and other community centers.
This program would, of course, upset the processed food industry. Oh well. It would also bug those who might resent paying more for soda and chips and argue that their right to eat whatever they wanted was being breached. But public health is the role of the government, and our diet is right up there with any other public responsibility you can name, from water treatment to mass transit.
Some advocates for the poor say taxes like these are unfair because low-income people pay a higher percentage of their income for food and would find it more difficult to buy soda or junk. But since poor people suffer disproportionately from the cost of high-quality, fresh foods, subsidizing those foods would be particularly beneficial to them.
Right now it's harder for many people to buy fruit than Froot Loops; chips and Coke are a common breakfast. And since the rate of diabetes continues to soar -- one-third of all Americans either have diabetes or are pre-diabetic, most with Type 2 diabetes, the kind associated with bad eating habits -- and because our health care bills are on the verge of becoming truly insurmountable, this is urgent for economic sanity as well as national health.
Justifying a Tax
At least 30 cities and states have considered taxes on soda or all sugar-sweetened beverages, and they're a logical target: of the 278 additional calories Americans on average consumed per day between 1977 and 2001, more than 40 percent came from soda, ''fruit'' drinks, mixes like Kool-Aid and Crystal Light, and beverages like Red Bull, Gatorade and dubious offerings like Vitamin Water, which contains half as much sugar as Coke.
Some states already have taxes on soda -- mostly low, ineffective sales taxes paid at the register. The current talk is of excise taxes, levied before purchase.
''Excise taxes have the benefit of being incorporated into the shelf price, and that's where consumers make their purchasing decisions,'' says Lisa Powell, a senior research scientist at the Institute for Health Research and Policy at the University of Illinois at Chicago. ''And, as per-unit taxes, they avoid volume discounts and are ultimately more effective in raising prices, so they have greater impact.''
Much of the research on beverage taxes comes from the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale. Its projections indicate that taxes become significant at the equivalent of about a penny an ounce, a level at which three very good things should begin to happen: the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages should decrease, as should the incidence of disease and therefore public health costs; and money could be raised for other uses.
Even in the current antitax climate, we'll probably see new, significant soda taxes soon, somewhere; Philadelphia, New York (city and state) and San Francisco all considered them last year, and the scenario for such a tax spreading could be similar to that of legalized gambling: once the income stream becomes apparent, it will seem irresistible to cash-strapped governments.
Currently, instead of taxing sodas and other unhealthful food, we subsidize them (with, I might note, tax dollars!). Direct subsidies to farmers for crops like corn (used, for example, to make now-ubiquitous high-fructose corn syrup) and soybeans (vegetable oil) keep the prices of many unhealthful foods and beverages artificially low. There are indirect subsidies as well, because prices of junk foods don't reflect the costs of repairing our health and the environment.
Other countries are considering or have already started programs to tax foods with negative effects on health. Denmark's saturated-fat tax is going into effect Oct. 1, and Romania passed (and then un-passed) something similar; earlier this month, a French minister raised the idea of tripling the value added tax on soda. Meanwhile, Hungary is proposing a new tax on foods with ''too much'' sugar, salt or fat, while increasing taxes on liquor and soft drinks, all to pay for state-financed health care; and Brazil's Fome Zero (Zero Hunger) program features subsidized produce markets and state-sponsored low-cost restaurants.
Putting all of those elements together could create a national program that would make progress on a half-dozen problems at once -- disease, budget, health care, environment, food access and more -- while paying for itself. The benefits are staggering, and though it would take a level of political will that's rarely seen, it's hardly a moonshot.
The need is dire: efforts to shift the national diet have failed, because education alone is no match for marketing dollars that push the very foods that are the worst for us. (The fast-food industry alone spent more than $4 billion on marketing in 2009; the Department of Agriculture's Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion is asking for about a third of a percent of that in 2012: $13 million.) As a result, the percentage of obese adults has more than doubled over the last 30 years; the percentage of obese children has tripled. We eat nearly 10 percent more animal products than we did a generation or two ago, and though there may be value in eating at least some animal products, we could perhaps live with reduced consumption of triple bacon cheeseburgers.
Government and Public Health
Health-related obesity costs are projected to reach $344 billion by 2018 -- with roughly 60 percent of that cost borne by the federal government. For a precedent in attacking this problem, look at the action government took in the case of tobacco.
The historic 1998 tobacco settlement, in which the states settled health-related lawsuits against tobacco companies, and the companies agreed to curtail marketing and finance antismoking efforts, was far from perfect, but consider the results. More than half of all Americans who once smoked have quit and smoking rates are about half of what they were in the 1960s.
It's true that you don't need to smoke and you do need to eat. But you don't need sugary beverages (or the associated fries), which have been linked not only to Type 2 diabetes and increased obesity but also to cardiovascular diseases and decreased intake of valuable nutrients like calcium. It also appears that liquid calories provide less feeling of fullness; in other words, when you drink a soda it's probably in addition to your other calorie intake, not instead of it.
To counter arguments about their nutritional worthlessness, expect to see ''fortified'' sodas -- a la Red Bull, whose vitamins allegedly ''support mental and physical performance'' -- and ''improved'' junk foods (Less Sugar! Higher Fiber!). Indeed, there may be reasons to make nutritionally worthless foods less so, but it's better to decrease their consumption.
Forcing sales of junk food down through taxes isn't ideal. First off, we'll have to listen to nanny-state arguments, which can be countered by the acceptance of the anti-tobacco movement as well as a dozen other successful public health measures. Then there are the predictions of job loss at soda distributorships, but the same predictions were made about the tobacco industry, and those were wrong. (For that matter, the same predictions were made around the nickel deposit on bottles, which most shoppers don't even notice.) Ultimately, however, both consumers and government will be more than reimbursed in the form of cheaper healthy staples, lowered health care costs and better health. And that's a big deal.
The Resulting Benefits
A study by Y. Claire Wang, an assistant professor at Columbia's Mailman School of Public Health, predicted that a penny tax per ounce on sugar-sweetened beverages in New York State would save $3 billion in health care costs over the course of a decade, prevent something like 37,000 cases of diabetes and bring in $1 billion annually. Another study shows that a two-cent tax per ounce in Illinois would reduce obesity in youth by 18 percent, save nearly $350 million and bring in over $800 million taxes annually.
Scaled nationally, as it should be, the projected benefits are even more impressive; one study suggests that a national penny-per-ounce tax on sugar-sweetened beverages would generate at least $13 billion a year in income while cutting consumption by 24 percent. And those numbers would swell dramatically if the tax were extended to more kinds of junk or doubled to two cents an ounce. (The Rudd Center has a nifty revenue calculator online that lets you play with the numbers yourself.)
A 20 percent increase in the price of sugary drinks nationally could result in about a 20 percent decrease in consumption, which in the next decade could prevent 1.5 million Americans from becoming obese and 400,000 cases of diabetes, saving about $30 billion.
It's fun -- inspiring, even -- to think about implementing a program like this. First off, though the reduced costs of healthy foods obviously benefit the poor most, lower prices across the board keep things simpler and all of us, especially children whose habits are just developing, could use help in eating differently. The program would also bring much needed encouragement to farmers, including subsidies, if necessary, to grow staples instead of commodity crops.
Other ideas: We could convert refrigerated soda machines to vending machines that dispense grapes and carrots, as has already been done in Japan and Iowa. We could provide recipes, cooking lessons, even cookware for those who can't afford it. Television public-service announcements could promote healthier eating. (Currently, 86 percent of food ads now seen by children are for foods high in sugar, fat or sodium.)
Money could be returned to communities for local spending on gyms, pools, jogging and bike trails; and for other activities at food distribution centers; for Meals on Wheels in those towns with a large elderly population, or for Head Start for those with more children; for supermarkets and farmers' markets where needed. And more.
By profiting as a society from the foods that are making us sick and using those funds to make us healthy, the United States would gain the same kind of prestige that we did by attacking smoking. We could institute a national, comprehensive program that would make us a world leader in preventing chronic or ''lifestyle'' diseases, which for the first time in history kill more people than communicable ones. By doing so, we'd not only repair some of the damage we have caused by first inventing and then exporting the Standard American Diet, we'd also set a new standard for the rest of the world to follow.

HEADLINE: A Regulator Scorned

 BODY:
I first met Sheila Bair when she worked for Senator Bob Dole on his Senate finance committee staff; Joe Nocera's article demonstrates what an outstanding public servant she has been as the former head of the F.D.I.C. She will probably hate me for saying this, but President Obama need look no further than Sheila as the successor to Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner. 
FREDERICK H. GRAEFE, Washington
When a moderate (meaning ''anachronistic'') Republican proves to be a more tough-minded regulator than Democrats, it serves as yet another proof of how far the county has moved to the right. Bair, in a long ''exit interview'' with Nocera, says a number of things that would have been regarded as commonsensical and obvious in the 1980s, yet have a whiff of radicalism about them in our era of finance uber alles. For instance: Bear Stearns should have been allowed to fail; too-big-to-fail banks are a menace (well, she doesn't say that, but makes it clear she regards them as repugnant); bank bondholders should take their lumps. . . .
Bair managed to make herself an irritant and an impediment to members of the administration who were all too keen to give the banks everything they wanted. Had she been more powerfully positioned, she might have been able to do more good. But impeding bad courses of action, even though it seldom leads to the best headlines, is precisely what a regulator should do.
YVES SMITH, 3:35 a.m., July 10, nakedcapitalism.com
Having watched the subprime-loan bubble burst and spiral into a regulator's nightmare in 2008 and 2009, I kept wondering why the government was so lukewarm to savvy, prophetic regulators who foresaw the crisis. It confirms that big government is in bed with big finance. The courageous women regulators, like Brooksley Born and Sheila Bair, who tried to sound the alarms, have been sidelined. Bair became a thorn in the side of Treasury, which ganged up with the Fed to try to sidetrack her.
In hindsight, both Bair and Born had important critiques to offer that might have prevented the current economic disaster from damaging the lives of so many homeowners and weakened the banks' own capacity to roll over their short-term debt. It's time our government began to listen to women regulators in positions of power.
JEAN DAVISON, Harborside, Me.
Why did we do the bailouts? Sheila Bair answers: ''They did not want to impose losses on bondholders, and we did. We kept saying: 'There is no insurance premium on bondholders,' you know? For the little guy on Main Street who has bank deposits, we charge the banks a premium for that, and it gets passed on to the customer. We don't have the same thing for bondholders. They're supposed to take losses.''
As someone less than literate in systemic financial matters, I wish the author was more explicit in who the bondholders are. My sense is ''follow the money'' and tell us why the accountability has not been forthcoming. We don't have the resources to suffer through this economic mess again.

HEADLINE: Q&A

BYLINE: By RACHEL LEE HARRIS

 BODY:
Learn Spanish and Do Some Good
My husband and I are interested in taking our rudimentary textbook Spanish to another level by living and volunteering (or working) in a Spanish-speaking country for a year. Can you suggest a safe, beautiful area that allows Americans to live for up to a year where we would have access to language classes, meaningful activities (I am a psychologist; he is a lawyer) and interesting people? (Mountainous hiking opportunities would be a plus.) Dr. Valerie Salwen, Scarsdale, N.Y. 
While many language schools in Mexico and other Latin American countries offer Spanish immersion programs, finding one that will relocate you for a year is an ambitious project. Luckily, Michelle Higgins, our Practical Traveler columnist, suggested some great resources in her recent column for would-be volunteer travelers like you. (See some readers' comments below.) For long-term options, Ms. Higgins pointed to Cross-Cultural Solutions (crossculturalsolutions.org), which allows you to work side by side with locals in both rural and urban areas of Brazil, Costa Rica, Peru (above) and Guatemala. Advisers can help you plan a ''Gap Year'' program to suit your interests; that can mean working in one specific area, like the favelas (slums) of Salvador, Brazil or moving to several different countries throughout the year. Either way, it can be a great way to hone a second language while a reputable group provides guidance and support.
To find other options, Ms. Higgins recommended looking at FlyforGood.com (flyforgood.com), a Web site that connects travelers with humanitarian nonprofit organizations. Though its primary goal is to find discounted airfare for volunteers, the site's search options are also excellent for sorting out a job to match your needs. Search by your skill set (teaching, health, conservation), by faith-based organizations or by your desired destination. An added benefit is that Fly for Good partners with nonprofits that are vetted by watchdog associations, which can provide some safety reassurances.
A quick search by location -- South America -- turned up several jobs with WorldTeach (worldteach.org), an organization that pairs volunteers with rural primary schools in places like Chile and Argentina. Geo Visions (geovisions.org), an international education and exchange organization, listed similar jobs in Spain that allowed participants to take classes at local universities for free. A second search by theme -- work with wildlife -- found a 20-week internship studying terrestrial and marine conservation in Costa Rica with Global Vision International (gvi.co.uk), which manages community-based projects in over 40 different countries.
A word of caution: be sure to clarify whether these programs pay for expenses or whether you will need to budget for your airfare, food and housing. Most require a financial commitment of between $1,000 and $5,000.
(For more language-immersive volunteer options in other parts of the world, see the In Transit report, Page 2.) RACHEL LEE HARRIS
Readers respond to a July 17 Practical Traveler column about volunteering on vacation:
There's an organization that does special projects for the economically disadvantaged indigenous people of Bolivia. They install wells so the young children no longer need to haul water for animals and crops. They establish medical clinics. They teach them methods to raise llamas (left) and trout for commerce and food. They also help them build greenhouses for crops. It was a travel experience like no other travel experience and cheap! TravelingProfessor, Garden City, N.Y.
I'd recommend WWOOFing (World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms (wwoof.org) as a budget excursion possibility. A few years ago, I spent a few days on a small farm outside Portland, Ore. The wife sold produce at a farmers' market. It didn't bring in enough income, so she worked retail part-time and her husband held a full-time job off the farm. I helped tend their vegetable gardens and animals. In exchange, I received lodging and food. It was a wonderful break from the city. M. L., Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y.
I was in the Bahamas earlier this year for a conference and stayed a few extra days in Nassau. I spent one day volunteering with the Red Cross. It was great to get out of the hotel and interact with real Bahamians and learn about what the Red Cross is doing. The Bahamas isn't the typical ''volunteer'' location but once you leave the beaches and the resorts, it's still an island struggling with poverty and in need of volunteers. I worked with an organization called Bahamas United and they organized all of my transportation and lunch and scheduling etc. It was fun and I learned a lot. J. D., N.Y.

HEADLINE: Looking Ahead Behind the Ivy

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

 BODY:
The pace of change in business is quickening, and business schools are scrambling to keep up. A number of prominent B-schools, the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard Business School among them, have rethought their programs and are making changes to reflect the increasingly global scope of business and to improve students' leadership and teamwork skills. Some schools are asking students to wrestle with questions about the ethical lapses that contributed to the financial crisis. Nitin Nohria, new dean of Harvard Business School and co-author of ''Paths to Power: How Insiders and Outsiders Shaped American Business Leadership,'' discussed the new courses, and the goals and thinking behind them.
You've added some new components to the Harvard Business School curriculum. Can you describe them?
We decided there were three issues in particular that we need to focus more on in our curriculum. One is leadership, in particular to develop emotional intelligence and to investigate more deeply the purpose of leadership. A second theme is globalization, and the need to educate the next generation of business leaders to be far more savvy about what is going on around the world. And a third theme is that we need our students to be better at integrating everything they are learning, particularly to develop an entrepreneurial imagination. 
So we have introduced to our first-year curriculum a course that will encourage students to work on a series of tasks in teams of six or eight people. They'll focus on the basics of leadership, of what it means to be effective in the context of a small team, and to really cultivate their emotional intelligence and learn how others perceive them. All of our students will go abroad, too, to some emerging market and think about a new product or service that a company can introduce in that emerging market. And we're going to ask them to create, very quickly, a small startup to test an idea that they have.
On your point about emotional intelligence -- being smart about your own emotions and the emotions of others -- some people might argue that you either have it or you don't.
You can't transform a person to become a leader by the end of two years. Our goal is to give students a concentrated opportunity to think about the challenges of leadership in a wide variety of ways. We hope to give people a starter kit for thinking about decision-making and the complexity of decision-making, and that students will learn a lot about what makes an effective team and how other people relate to them.
You've also said that you were hoping to provide a greater focus on things like ethics and even issues of character. Can you mold character?
One of the greatest myths is that character is like a trait -- you're either a person of good character or you're a person of bad character, and there's little opportunity for the development of character over the course of one's life. In fact, research demonstrates that character is something one has to work at forming and developing over the course of our lives, just as we focus on developing our judgment.
Some people are able to measure up to new responsibilities and challenges and pressures, and some people are not. And this is not so much because they were good or bad people, but because the pressure they were under either brought out their best selves or brought out their worst selves, and we all have both those selves in us.
So what we are trying to do is to allow our students to develop moral humility. We can expose them to the wide variety of pressures that they will face over the course of their careers. We give them 30 cases to show them the wide variety of ways in which good people were led astray because of the pressures that came from their cultures or from bosses, or how they themselves have used incentives in ways to sometimes promote, unwittingly, wrongdoing either by themselves or others.
And just being a good person doesn't assure you of the fact that you'll always make morally sound decisions. We saw that in the economic crisis.
When you have a system in which it feels like the pressures for short-term returns are extraordinary and the gains from doing things in the short run are amazing, then sometimes people can act in ways that they look back and say: ''Boy, we took on unnecessary risks. We acted in ways that we're not that proud of. Some of us may have even been tempted into doing bad things.''
We're going to hopefully show students that when they're put under pressure and they have to work with small teams, they may behave in ways that they don't feel proud of or good about. They could be short with other people. They may cut corners. They begin to recognize that as confident as they feel about their character coming in, it's something that's still a work in progress, and they will have to focus on investing and developing it throughout their lives.
Part of what we're now trying to do in our curriculum is to make sure that this is a very explicit conversation that we have with our students.
These teams are a rare setting in which the consequences of giving feedback to each other is not quite the same as the consequences they will experience when they go to work, where people are much more reticent about giving honest feedback for fear of what it might mean.
Can I ask, on the topic of leadership, about you in your new role as dean? What are some of the things you've learned or that surprised you?
It's interesting you should mention that. Mike Porter, Jay Lorsch and I wrote a Harvard Business Review article titled ''Seven Surprises for New C.E.O.'s.'' The three of us also have been teaching a workshop for many years, with Bill George, for new C.E.O.'s.
It was one thing to write about these surprises based upon the experience of others, and to understand them intellectually, but it was another thing to experience them myself. It's very difficult, for example, to now be the person where you feel like you are the one who has to make decisions. In fact, the more decisions you make personally, the less effective you are. You really have to create conditions in which other people can make effective decisions. The demands that are placed upon your time are incessant. I've had to develop the capacity to switch every halfhour or 45 minutes to a completely different topic. The need for that extraordinary mental discipline has stunned me, and I still keep learning how to do that better.
What else has surprised you about your new role?
The sense that anything I say is much more important than anything I said in the past. It's like my I.Q. has gone up 20 points and I speak with a megaphone even when I whisper. That's something I'm still getting used to.
This interview was edited and condensed.

HEADLINE: With Some Rich Car Fans, Formula One Could Work

BYLINE: By JASON COHEN. 
jcohen@texasmonthly.com

 BODY:
Sebastian Vettel of Germany is dominating Formula One again this season, building on his 2010 championship with six wins in nine races. But that's nothing compared with the underdog triumph that Formula One itself just pulled: getting money from the state of Texas.
A group of promoters that includes Red McCombs, the former owner of the San Antonio Spurs, and Tavo Hellmund, a former racer and Austin native, is due to receive $25 million from the state's Major Events Trust Fund, the first of 10 annual subsidies that is meant to pay taxpayers back in the form of jobs, tourism and other economic benefits. 
How did this happen on the heels of a 2011 legislative session that doled out enormous budget cuts to everything from education to the Texas film incentive fund? It didn't. The bill that made Formula One eligible for the events fund, which was created in 2004 to help attract events like the Super Bowl and Final Four, passed in 2009. Ground broke on the Circuit of the Americas, a 3.4-mile track southeast of Austin, on Dec. 30, 2010.
''I think it's a one-of-a-kind thing for our state,'' said Mr. McCombs, who admitted to having little interest in the sport itself. ''I enjoy seeing world-class events made possible. It's the biggest thing in every country when it runs, except here, and we've never really given it a full course of its own. To me it's a Super Bowl every year.'' (Mr. McCombs is a major donor to The Texas Tribune.)
Glamorous, expensive and high-tech, Formula One combines the well-heeled vibe of the Kentucky Derby with the international popularity of soccer. It's an odd fit for a state that prefers Nascar and college football -- but perhaps not for the state of J. R. Ewing and Exxon Mobil. Bernie Ecclestone, the chief executive of Formula One Management, with his silver shag, designer glasses and Alan Rickman-in-''Die Hard'' demeanor, is -- there's no other word for it -- Eurotrash. This British billionaire makes Jerry Jones look like Lady Bird Johnson. Can a Dodge/Ford/Chevy fan base get behind the circuit of McLaren Mercedes, Ferrari and Renault, where one racer's car has a Hugo Boss logo on the seat belt and everyone spells ''tire'' with a ''y''? Or will we kick it to the kerb?
It almost doesn't matter. Unlike, say, a hockey rink in Laredo, Formula One is not supposed to be reliant on local dollars to succeed. Organizers say that at least 60 percent of the crowd will come from elsewhere, including a wealthy contingent from Mexico and South America. And as far as F1 is concerned, ''a racetrack is just a big television studio,'' said Dave Kallmann, who covers racing for The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. They want an American race to sell to advertisers, sponsors and world broadcasters. (Formula One's only other North American track is in Montreal, which might as well be Europe.)
Just as nonfans manage to care about women's soccer once every four years for the World Cup or the IndyCar Series once a year for its namesake race, Texans would surely pay attention to a United States Grand Prix if it was held in Texas. The biggest difference between Formula One and the kind of racing the state's fans are used to ''is that the cars turn right,'' said Matt Hardigree, the Houston-based news editor of the Gawker Media automobile blog Jalopnik. Unlike Nascar's oval, Formula One tracks have turns and elevation changes, but less passing and less crashing. Like Indy, Formula One is open-wheel racing, not the more popular stock-car action. But Formula One is a Mac compared with Indycar's PC -- more proprietary technology, more speed, more money.
''The great thing about Formula One that I think Texans will love is that it is really fast, really loud racing,'' Mr. Hardigree said. What they might not like, he added, is the fact that Americans stink at it. (Phil Hill, in the 1960s, and Mario Andretti, in the 1970s, are the only American drivers to win Formula One championships.)
If all goes well, the first United States Grand Prix is scheduled for June 17, 2012. The Austin American-Statesman has speculated that existing hotel capacity will -- and may already be -- booked all the way down to San Antonio. It's a spectacle that wouldn't have made sense in the Austin of ''Slacker'' or remembering the Armadillo but may in the Austin of the W Hotel and the Austin City Limits Music Festival. Mr. Hardigree predicted that race weekend would take over the city much as A.C.L. or SXSW does, with locals renting out their houses at inflated rates and Bentley-driving race fans fighting to get reservations at Uchi. ''It's a race that appeals to more affluent car enthusiasts, and Texas has a ton of affluent car enthusiasts,'' he said.
Critics warn that if it doesn't work, the only one who wins is Mr. Ecclestone. ''Bernie always gets his money. Always,'' Dutch Mandel of AutoWeek wrote in an ''open letter'' to Austin, which also included the advice ''Run away.'' And Mr. Kallmann of The Journal Sentinel guessed that the chance of long-term success was still 50-50. ''It's not without its challenges,'' Mr. McCombs said.
Big cars, big bucks, big risk. Nothing foreign about that.

HEADLINE: 10,000 Buildings Get the Word

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY

 BODY:
IT was the sight of apartment buildings in New York City belching plumes of black smoke into the sky that spurred Diane Nardone into action.
As board president of the Brevoort, a 1955 co-op tower in Greenwich Village, Ms. Nardone started her campaign to turn the building green about three years ago.
Since then, the building has spent nearly $6 million. The projects ranged from the prosaic, like new windows and light bulbs, to the ambitious, like green roofs, converting from heating oil to natural gas, and installing a $3.2 million cogeneration plant capable of powering the 20-story building in a citywide blackout.
The extent of the work and the amount spent in such a short time are unusual. But board members say the building is now a model of energy efficiency and proudly note that other co-op boards have come to see what it has done. 
The Brevoort's timing was good.
In April, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced new heating oil regulations for thousands of buildings across the city. Now those buildings -- most of them apartment houses -- are reviewing their heating systems.
The new rules require that by 2015, about 10,000 buildings switch from No. 6 heating oil, the cheapest but also the dirtiest fuel available, to No. 4 heating oil. Some buildings need to make the change as early as next July. But since buildings will be required to use either No. 2 oil or natural gas by 2030, many building owners are contemplating making the larger change now to avoid two separate conversions. Natural gas currently costs about 30 percent less than fuel oil.
City officials say that the soot pollution created by the 10,000 buildings that use No. 6 oil exceeds the amount created by all the cars and trucks in the city. At a seminar given by the Real Estate Board of New York earlier this month, a representative from the mayor's office said that while converting to natural gas can be expensive, switching from No. 6 to No. 4 oil could cost a building as little as $7,000. But contractors and consultants in the audience challenged that figure, saying it represented a best-case scenario -- a building whose equipment needed only minimal upgrading.
David Kuperberg, the chief executive of Cooper Square Realty, which manages about 450 buildings in New York City, described the extent of the work and the amount invested at the Brevoort as ''the exception by a long shot.''
He said his company had urged the owners of its buildings to make similar changes, ''but there is a great deal of skepticism and people just don't believe the savings are there.'' Most co-op and condo boards, he said, would rather make incremental changes and take on one project at a time.
About 100 of Cooper Square's 450 buildings use No. 6 oil. ''We're in front of all our boards now,'' offering advice and information on what needs to be done, Mr. Kuperberg said. Wherever possible, Cooper Square encourages gas conversion. But ''the initial cost scares off a lot of buildings,'' even though ''we could prove the economics.'' He pointed out that the savings from gas conversion could pay for the upfront costs in a few years.
The changes at the Brevoort did not come without pain.
Vigorous efforts were made to unseat board members in the last two elections, with some unhappy residents likening members to harsh and unyielding prison wardens.
But opposition candidates came shy of the votes they needed in both elections, and Ms. Nardone was re-elected this spring to her sixth term.
The switch from No. 6 oil to natural gas cost the Brevoort $225,000. It involved replacing the burner on the boiler, removing two 20,000-gallon oil tanks, and installing equipment to draw gas from the available Consolidated Edison pipeline. The board expects to save as much as $70,000 a year in fuel costs.
Ms. Nardone said that when she started exploring the conversion a few years ago, she knew the city was contemplating the regulation. ''We realized that if we waited until it was required,'' she said, ''everybody would be knocking on Con Ed's door at the same time and there would probably also be a shortage of contractors and a spike in prices.''
Property managers and environmental experts say that gaining access to gas pipelines maintained by a utility like Con Ed or National Grid could be a huge hurdle for some buildings. As Isabelle Silverman, a lawyer with the Environmental Defense Fund, put it, ''The infrastructure to bring gas lines to the buildings definitely has to be built out, and we don't know how long that would take.''
City officials say that is why the imminent rule change is for No. 4 oil and the natural gas requirement does not kick in for 20 years.
Most buildings are already hooked up for cooking gas. But long stretches of pavement may need to be ripped up to connect a building to the pipelines for heating gas, which are larger in diameter. ''When you can get it and how much it will cost depends on where your building is relative to the gas line,'' Ms. Silverman said.
Of the roughly 100 residential buildings managed by Rose Associates, 6 are in the process of converting to natural gas. J. Brian Peters, a senior managing director at Rose, said that ''the due diligence on this really pans out, and there is a track record that shows the savings and benefits are real.''
Getting permits and physically converting the equipment takes four to six months, he said, but how quickly Con Ed can hook up a building is less certain.
For the 15-story co-op at 910 Park Avenue, converting the burner to accept either No. 2 fuel or gas took less than six months and cost $73,000. The work was done in October, but the building burned No. 2 oil all winter, while it waited six months for Con Ed to connect its gas line.
Jerry Cohen, a board member, said he had started considering the conversion after learning that No. 910 Park was on the Environmental Defense Fund's ''Dirty Building'' list. ''I was appalled,'' he said. ''So I ran a spreadsheet and it showed that in three years, the savings would give us payback on the cost of the conversion.'' The board approved the plan unanimously.
Con Ed waived the $23,000 cost of connecting Mr. Cohen's building to a pipeline that runs along Park Avenue because the building committed to using Con Ed's gas exclusively.
Mr. Cohen's building was lucky. He said that a friend at a building on Madison Avenue had recently learned that connecting to a pipeline would cost $1 million.
Joseph McGowan, the manager for gas sales at Con Ed, said that Con Ed would install up to 100 feet of pipe free to a building with five or more apartments, and could waive the fee for more, depending on the utility's anticipated revenues from the building.
Hypothetically, he said, the cost to connect a building at, say, Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street, to the appropriate pipeline along First Avenue could be as high as $3 million. ''Just think about having to trench along 42nd Street for that many blocks,'' he said.
But if Con Ed found that seven additional large buildings along that route also wanted to convert to gas, ''the revenue from all those buildings could take care of the cost.''
It has taken the co-op board at 12 East 97th Street about a year to weigh the benefits and figure out the cost of gas conversion. John Slattery, the vice president of the board, said the building was now close to signing contracts and expected a bill of $100,000 to $200,000. ''All of this goes agonizingly slow,'' he said, ''because like most boards, we only meet once a month.''
Mr. Slattery says the building is trying to decide whether to go with a gas-only contract or to spring for the option of using both oil and gas. ''It seems like most major property holders are doing dual fuel,'' he said. ''Maybe they're just belts-and-suspenders people, but in today's world, who knows what's going to happen with the price of gas or oil?''
Myriad calculations and unknowns complicate the decision making. ''The real problem is there are a lot of variables out there,'' said Paul Gottsegen, the president of Halstead Management, which manages about 200 apartment buildings. ''At this point, people are scrambling for the best ideas and the cheapest and greenest options.
''Who isn't for cleaner air?'' Mr. Gottsegen added. ''But I'm afraid there are going to be a lot of buildings making hasty or expensive decisions and not actually choosing the best options, because we don't really know what the best options are right now.''
To encourage gas conversion, utility companies are creating incentive programs and the state this year provided $6.5 million in grants to about 240 buildings. Francis J. Murray Jr., the president of the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, said applications poured in and the money was spoken for shortly after the fund was announced in April.
''The demand clearly exceeded what was available,'' Mr. Murray said. The agency is seeking other funding sources and hopes to offer more grants next year.
The state agency also provides grants for cogeneration plants, which burn gas to produce both heat and electricity, and this year distributed $20 million to 19 projects across the state, including three residential buildings managed by Rose Associates. Mr. Peters of Rose said that for certain buildings, it made sense to put in cogeneration at the same time as a gas conversion.
''It depends on the scale and the unique character of the property,'' Mr. Peters said, adding that one of Rose's rental properties, London Terrace Gardens, installed cogeneration about six years ago and saves about 15 percent on electricity annually.
At the Brevoort, while most residents approved of gas conversion, many felt the cogeneration system was unnecessary, even though the building received a $500,000 state grant for the work. Marietta Poerio, a former board member who ran again unsuccessfully last year but received the support of about one-third of the building, said: ''The technology is still very new, so why should we be guinea pigs? Plus, we had to borrow excessive amounts of money for something that none of us is sure we needed.''
Fred Keller, a former board president who ran unsuccessfully in the last two elections and who also had about a third of the building's vote, said he, too, remained unconvinced that cogeneration made financial sense. ''A lot of people were concerned when our debt went from about $3.5 million to $11 million,'' he said. ''Maybe we should have gone slower.''
The building this year issued a $2 million assessment, which works out to about $10,000 for the owner of a two-bedroom apartment. Ms. Poerio said the assessment can be a burden for homeowners, especially those on fixed incomes.
Ms. Nardone, who is now the vice president of the board, said that doing all the projects at once made sense since the building had been able to refinance and borrow at a relatively low rate for most of the cost. She said all 11 members ''believed in these projects and there was no dissension on the green initiatives.'' There was some dissent on the gym, which was not part of the $6 million package but was built at the same time.
Convincing the residents of the 262-unit building, of course, was another matter. ''I worked every day to convert people to understanding what we did and why we did it,'' she said, ''but there's no way you can get 100 percent affirmation. But like any other corporation, you need strong leadership, and if you need to have people like you, you should not be board president.''

LENGTH: 1538 words

HEADLINE: Wearing the Green, in More Ways Than One

BYLINE: By C. J. HUGHES

 BODY:
WOODLAWN'S name is a pretty good example of truth in advertising: forested parks, lots of trees, thickets of greenery around the low stoops of century-old houses. Yet in this quiet corner of the Bronx along the Westchester border, the landscape feature that truly stands out is the bluestone in the sidewalks.
Slightly mottled, like the color of a stormy sky, these slabs are attractive and plentiful. Some line Van Cortlandt Park East, offering a contemplative place to stroll under boughs of London plane trees. Others, fringed with grass, front Kepler Avenue near East 237th Street. And pieces that have buckled because they sit atop ancient roots add charm to busy East 233rd Street (though be careful not to trip).
This ''blue gold of the Catskills,'' as it used to be called, adorned many New York sidewalks until concrete rendered it obsolete, but Woodlawn may always have had more than most, historians say, because of Woodlawn Cemetery, which opened in 1863 along its southern border. 
Bluestone is a significant element of the many artful mausoleums in Woodlawn's parklike expanse, according to Susan Olsen, the cemetery's historian, who lives nearby in a one-bedroom apartment. And because so much was stockpiled in local stone yards, along with marble and granite, it was deployed for residential uses. ''The supply was right across the street,'' she said.
In the early 1840s, Irish immigrants showed up to dig the Old Croton Aqueduct, which sliced beneath what is now Van Cortlandt Park. Twenty years later, Ms. Olsen said, Irish laborers built the roads that wind through the cemetery, establishing a village outside its gates.
Ever since, there has been a substantial Irish presence in the neighborhood; today it is at a peak, with 44 percent of its 7,500 people claiming Irish descent, according to the American Community Survey, conducted by the United States Census Bureau from 2005 to 2009.
The data also reveal that of the area's foreign-born residents, about half are from Ireland -- a trend that has intensified as the collapse of the Irish economy led to a diaspora in search of overseas work, according to the Emerald Isle Immigration Center, an outreach agency. According to its research, the number of Irish immigrants in Woodlawn is up by 25 percent since 2009.
By many measures, thriving Katonah Avenue could also be called ''Little Ireland.'' Brogues are heard; green trim and shamrock motifs adorn the bars; and jars of pickled beetroot, a staple back home, are found on the shelves of specialty food shops. The avenue is also home to the headquarters of Local 147 of the Laborers' International Union of North America, a local for miners, many of Irish ancestry, whose work on a decades-long water tunnel replacement project earned them the nickname ''sandhogs.''
One sandhog who for years commuted to work 50 stories under Van Cortlandt Park is Chick Donohue, who in 1977 traded a two-bedroom apartment on the Grand Concourse for a three-bedroom rental in a two-family house in Woodlawn. Two years later he bought the whole house, a detached brick Victorian with stone foundations, for $55,000. Real estate deals in Woodlawn, often occurring between family members and without the help of brokers, can seem like a game of musical chairs. Indeed, in 2005, Mr. Donohue sold his property for $400,000 to a daughter, Audra O'Donovan, though she later relocated to a larger property down the block and now rents out the first house.
Today Mr. Donohue, 70, spends most weekends in the Catskills. But during the week, he works on Dyer Avenue in Manhattan running a ''hog house,'' where miners clean up after their shifts. At night, he stays in Woodlawn, in a bedroom in the basement of his daughter's home, which helps him stay connected.
''Where else can you go to the corner deli and get a loaf of bread from Dublin?'' Mr. Donohue asked. ''And I can go into a pub and have rashers,'' he said, referring to Irish bacon, ''with my Guinness.''
WHAT YOU'LL FIND
Originally named Woodlawn Heights, to differentiate it from the graveyard next door, the neighborhood is squeezed into a quarter of a square mile of land shaped something like a shoe. It has about 3,800 apartments and houses, according to census figures. Most are wood-frame buildings dating from 1900 to 1920, often with a stacked pair of front porches.
Many homes are detached, though often the space between them is barely wide enough to drag trash cans through, which means that private parking is cherished, said Margaret Fogarty, a former officer of the Woodlawn Heights Taxpayers and Community Association, a 500-member civic group. But with the community generally sweeping its own streets, she added, drivers are not obliged to observe the city's alternate-side-of-the-street parking rules. Ms. Fogarty is an Irish emigre whose three-bedroom home with a two-car garage cost about $100,000 in 1984 but -- ''oh, my gosh,'' she said -- would be worth about four times that today.
There is also a supply of six-story red-brick apartment buildings, some of them co-ops. A notable high-rise is the hulking 4260 Katonah Avenue, an income-restricted Mitchell-Lama building that originally sought veterans as tenants but that today has a long and varied waiting list. Newer and attached multifamily homes, with simple facades and garages tucked in basements, can be seen on East 233rd Street.
Condominiums, so far, are nonexistent.
WHAT YOU'LL PAY
The insider market in the neighborhood can make it appear as if nothing much was selling, brokers say. Indeed, just six houses were on the market in Woodlawn in mid-July, according to the Empire Access Multiple Listing Service, which serves the area, and they were all roughly similar in style, age and price point.
The cheapest, a flat-fronted three-bedroom built in 1901, was listed for $235,000, and the priciest, a detached brick five-bedroom from 1925, for $539,000, according to the listing service.
Among non-insider transactions in 2010, five single-family homes sold, for an average of $388,000, while five two-families sold, for an average of $466,000, according to the listing service. Also, 16 co-ops sold, for an average of $138,000.
In contrast, in 2007, at the market's peak, 24 single-families sold, for an average of $423,000, and 15 two-families sold, for an average of $517,000. There were 37 co-op sales, averaging $154,000.
The fact that single-family homes were down in value by less than 10 percent, in a city where they might be off by twice that amount in other neighborhoods, does not surprise Elizabeth Brosnan, a sales agent with Century 21 Brand who lives in Woodlawn. ''The market is very, very vibrant,'' said Ms. Brosnan, adding that one reason was the property taxes, which are low compared with those across the county line in Yonkers.
WHAT TO DO
On a recent weekday afternoon, members of New Horizons, a social club affiliated with St. Barnabas Church, a mainstay, were boarding a bus for the Belmont Park racetrack in Long Island.
In Van Cortlandt Park, a wood-chip-covered trail follows the Old Croton Aqueduct, and a nearby Gaelic football field is a popular spot. Woodlawn Cemetery, whose 400 acres were accorded landmark status in June, stages concerts and readings in locales like the Woolworth Chapel.
THE SCHOOLS
On Katonah Avenue, Public School 19, also known as the Judith K. Weiss School, covers kindergarten through eighth grade. Enrollment last year was 525. On state exams in 2010, 52 percent of fourth graders met standards in math, 41 percent in English. Citywide, those percentages were 34 and 41.
The nearest high school is DeWitt Clinton. SAT averages there were 440 in math, 425 in reading and 417 in writing, versus 516, 501 and 492 statewide.
Parochial schools are well attended. One of them, St. Barnabas, offers prekindergarten through 12th grade for boys and girls, as well as a 230-student girls' high school.
THE COMMUTE
One way to reach Midtown Manhattan is via Metro-North Railroad, from the Woodlawn stop on the Harlem line. Five trains depart each morning from 6 to 8, arriving at Grand Central Terminal 22 to 33 minutes later. Monthly tickets are $178.
There are 67 parking spaces at the station, 52 of which require permits costing $358.30 a year. The waiting list for a spot has 90 names on it. But the station is about a 10-minute walk from most points in the neighborhood.
THE HISTORY
The cemetery figured in one of the 20th century's highest-profile crimes, the kidnapping of the aviator Charles Lindbergh's baby in 1932.
John Condon, a retired school principal, volunteered to act as a go-between and deliver ransom money to Bruno Richard Hauptmann, the man eventually convicted of the kidnapping, who named a meeting spot at the Jerome Avenue gate of the cemetery. However, the actual exchange of money, $50,000, took place a few nights later, at St. Raymond's Cemetery, in the Throgs Neck section of the Bronx.

HEADLINE: As Horrors Emerge, Norway Charges Christian Extremist

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER and SCOTT SHANE; Steven Erlanger reported from Oslo, and Scott Shane from Washington. Reporting was contributed by Elisa Mala, Michael Schwirtz and Matthew Saltmarsh from Oslo, David Jolly from Paris, Nicholas Kulish from Berlin and Christina Anderson from Stockholm .

 BODY:
OSLO -- The Norwegian man charged Saturday with a pair of attacks in Oslo that killed at least 92 people left behind a detailed manifesto outlining his preparations and calling for a Christian war to defend Europe against the threat of Muslim domination, according to Norwegian and American officials familiar with the investigation.
As stunned Norwegians grappled with the deadliest attack in the country since World War II, a portrait began to emerge of the suspect, Anders Behring Breivik, 32. The police identified him as a right-wing fundamentalist Christian, while acquaintances described him as a gun-loving Norwegian obsessed with what he saw as the threats of multiculturalism and Muslim immigration.
''We are not sure whether he was alone or had help,'' a police official, Roger Andresen, said at a televised news conference. ''What we know is that he is right wing and a Christian fundamentalist.'' 
In the 1,500-page manifesto, posted on the Web hours before the attacks, Mr. Breivik recorded a day-by-day diary of months of planning for the attacks, and claimed to be part of a small group that intended to ''seize political and military control of Western European countries and implement a cultural conservative political agenda.''
He predicted a conflagration that would kill or injure more than a million people, adding, ''The time for dialogue is over. We gave peace a chance. The time for armed resistance has come.''
The manifesto was signed Andrew Berwick, an Anglicized version of his name. A former American government official briefed on the case said investigators believed the manifesto was Mr. Breivik's work.
The manifesto, entitled ''2083: A European Declaration of Independence,'' equates liberalism and multiculturalism with ''cultural Marxism,'' which the document says is destroying European Christian civilization.
The document also describes a secret meeting in London in April 2002 to reconstitute the Knights Templar, a Crusader military order. It says the meeting was attended by nine representatives of eight European countries, evidently including Mr. Breivik, with an additional three members unable to attend, including a ''European-American.''
The document does not name the attendees or say whether they were aware of Mr. Breivik's planned attacks, though investigators presumably will now try to determine if the people exist and what their connection is to Mr. Breivik.
Thomas Hegghammer, a terrorism specialist at the Norwegian Defense Research Establishment, said the manifesto bears an eerie resemblance to those of Osama bin Laden and other Al Qaeda leaders, though from a Christian rather than a Muslim point of view. Like Mr. Breivik's manuscript, the major Qaeda declarations have detailed accounts of the Crusades, a pronounced sense of historical grievance and calls for apocalyptic warfare to defeat the religious and cultural enemy.
''It seems to be an attempt to mirror Al Qaeda, exactly in reverse,'' Mr. Hegghammer said.
Mr. Breivik was also believed to have posted a video on Friday summarizing his arguments. In its closing moments, the video depicts Mr. Breivik in military uniform, holding assault weapons. Rarely has a mass murder suspect left so detailed an account of his activities. The manifesto describes in detail his purchase of chemicals, his sometimes ham-handed experiments making explosives and his first successful test detonation of a bomb in a remote location on June 13.
He intersperses the account of bomb-making with details of his television-watching, including the Eurovision music contest and the American police drama ''The Shield.''
The manifesto ends with a chilling signoff: ''I believe this will be my last entry. It is now Fri July 22nd, 12.51.''
Indeed, the operation appeared to have been extremely well planned.
According to the police, Mr. Breivik first drew security services to central Oslo when he exploded a car bomb outside a 17-story government office building, killing at least seven people.
Then he took a public ferry to Utoya Island, where he carried out a remarkably meticulous attack on Norway's current and future political elite. Dressed as a police officer, he announced that he had come to check on the security of the young people who were attending a political summer camp there, many of them the children of members of the governing Labor Party.
He gathered the campers together and for some 90 hellish minutes he coolly and methodically shot them, hunting down those who fled. At least 85 people, some as young as 16, were killed.
The police said Saturday evening that they expected the death toll to climb. There were still bodies in the bombed government buildings in Oslo, and at least four people missing on Utoya.
The police also said that unexploded munitions were still in some downtown Oslo buildings, and they had not ruled out the possibility that Mr. Breivik had accomplices.
He was equipped, the police said, with an automatic rifle and a handgun; when the police finally got to the island -- about 40 minutes after they were called, the police said -- Mr. Breivik surrendered.
The police also said he had registered a farm in Rena, in eastern Norway, which allowed him to order a large quantity of ammonium nitrate fertilizer, an ingredient that can be used to make explosives. The authorities were investigating whether the chemical had been used in the bombing.
Besides the manifesto, Mr. Breivik left other hints of his motives.
A Facebook page and Twitter account were set up under his name days before the rampage. The Facebook page cites philosophers like Machiavelli, Kant and John Stuart Mill.
His lone Twitter post, while not calling for violence, paraphrased Mill -- ''One person with a belief is equal to the force of 100,000 who have only interests'' -- suggesting what he saw as his ability to act.
Those postings, along with what was previously known about Mr. Breivik publicly, aligned with but hardly predicted the bloody rampage he would undertake on Friday.
Before then, he had been a member of the right-wing Progress Party, which began as an antitax protest and has been stridently anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim.
Joran Kallmyr, a member of the party who is now Oslo's vice mayor for transportation, said he met Mr. Breivik several times in 2002 and 2003 at local party meetings. ''He was very quiet, almost a little bit shy,'' Mr. Kallmyr said. ''But he was a normal person with good behavior. He never shared any extreme thoughts or speech with us. There was absolutely no reason to expect that he could do something like this. We're very shocked.''
Mr. Breivik quit the party in 2006, apparently disappointed by the party's move toward the center.
''He didn't like our politics, I guess, and moved on,'' Mr. Kallmyr said.
His Internet posts also indicated contempt for the Conservative Party, which he accused of having given up the battle against multiculturalism.
But on Friday he directed his firepower at the center-left Labor Party, which leads the coalition government.
''Breivik feels that multiculturalism is destroying the society and that the enforcing authority is the prime minister and the Labor Party, the lead party of contemporary Norwegian politics,'' said Anders Romarheim, a fellow at the Norwegian Institute for Defense Studies.
But the attacks, along with what appear to have been years of preparation for them, raised questions about whether the Norwegian security authorities, concentrating on threats of Islamic terrorism, had overlooked the threat from the anti-Islamic right.
''This is the Norwegian equivalent to Timothy McVeigh,'' the right-wing American who bombed a federal building in Oklahoma City in 1995, said Marcus Buck, a political scientist at the University of Tromso in northern Norway. ''This is right-wing domestic terrorism, and the big question is to what extent Norwegian agencies have diverted their attention from what they knew decades ago was the biggest threat'' to focus instead on Islamic militants.
The unclassified versions of the last three Norwegian Police Security Service reports assessing national threats all played down any threat by right-wing and nationalist extremists. Instead, the reports emphasized the dangers posed by radical Islam, groups opposed to Norway's military involvement in Afghanistan and Libya, and others.
The 2011 report, released early this year, concluded that ''the far-right and far-left extremist communities will not represent a serious threat to Norwegian society.''
Even after the attacks, that appeared to be the official position.
''Compared to other countries I wouldn't say we have a big problem with right-wing extremists in Norway,'' Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg told reporters at a news conference on Saturday. ''But we have had some groups, we have followed them before, and our police is aware that there are some right-wing groups.''
Even if the authorities had focused on right-wing groups, it was unlikely that they would have noticed Mr. Breivik.
Kari Helene Partapuoli, director of the Norwegian Center Against Racism, said Mr. Breivik did not belong to any violent neo-Nazi groups that she was aware of, and his Internet postings, before those of last week, did not espouse violence.
''The distance between the words spoken and the acts that he carried out is gigantic, because what he did is in a different league of what the debates have to do about,'' she said.
Arild Groven, secretary general of the Norwegian Shooting Association, a sports group, confirmed that Mr. Breivik had belonged to Oslo Pistolklubb, one of the 520 clubs in the association.
''We all read and watch the news about the shootings in the United States,'' Mr. Groven said. ''But it doesn't happen here.''
Mr. Romarheim said in some ways the homegrown nature of the attack made it harder for Norwegians to accept. ''With 9/11 in America, people could ask, 'Who are they?' and could pour their rage out on someone else,'' he said. ''But we can't disavow this person, he's one of us.''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, an article on Sunday about the attacks in Norway misattributed, in some editions, a quotation from a security expert about the difficulty the nation had coming to grips with the fact that the suspect was Norwegian. It was Anders Romarheim, a fellow at the Norwegian Institute for Defense Studies -- not Kristian Ulrichsen, a researcher at the London School of Economics -- who said: ''With 9/11 in America, people could ask, 'Who are they?' and could pour their rage out on someone else. But we can't disavow this person, he's one of us.''

HEADLINE: Don't Ask, Do Tell?

BYLINE: By ARIEL KAMINER

 BODY:
A woman I was sleeping with, in an explicitly nonexclusive, ''don't ask, don't tell'' relationship, found a pimple and panicked that she had a sexually transmitted disease. I encouraged her to let a doctor assuage her fears, which he did the next morning, but first she insisted I tell her if I'd slept with anyone else. I had. (Safe sex.) But I worried a ''yes'' might end the relationship; saying nothing would have been the same as saying yes. So I lied. Was I ethically obligated to respond honestly? NAME WITHHELD, NEW YORK
You slept around. You lied about it. Did you behave ethically? It's possible. 
Many ethical dilemmas boil down to one simple solution: tell the truth. This is an exception, because you both mutually agreed not to tell the truth -- not to tell anything, in fact, and not to ask it either. You did so to protect each other's feelings. That is an obligation not lightly to be discarded.
If you could be certain that your friend's fear was misplaced (a big if) and that by the next morning she would again prefer not to know about your extracurricular activities (another big if), then you were right to hold true to your end of the nondisclosure pact even when she abandoned hers. But only for the moment.
Arrangements like yours can't be ethical if they are no longer truly consensual. If, when her momentary panic subsides, she really does want more transparency, you would have no grounds to deny her that -- not by arguing the technicalities of a bygone agreement and certainly not by lying, which was never part of the bargain. In any case your experience points up the difficulty of sustaining ''don't ask, don't tell'' policies, which is only one reason they seem to be going out of style.
In a recent online discussion, readers debated the ethics of moving a family to Bahrain for a better job and higher standard of living while the government is quashing democratic protests.
Some said that it depends on whether the job in question serves the regime's agenda. Unfortunately, it's never that simple; even companies that oppose government policies can bolster the economy and thereby enrich those in power. Other readers argued that no country is entirely morally pure. (Claudio Buchwald was more specific. ''Your government supports the regime in Bahrain,'' he wrote. ''Living in the U.S. does not absolve you of responsibility, it just obscures it.'')
The most intriguing arguments said that -- job title aside -- bearing witness to Bahrainis' struggles could be a deeply ethical choice.
Would the person be working on his own time to help the causes he believed in -- in what Dave Mills called ''a kind of ethical offset''? Or just enjoying the affordable servants and private schools? The query, alas, suggested the latter.
If so, Joel DeWitt wrote, ''I am inclined to believe that he is demonstrating to his kids that selling out is O.K. as long as you personally get ahead.'' Or as Vtdad so eloquently concluded, ''You owe your family your integrity as much as you owe them anything material.''

HEADLINE: Make Way for the Radical Center

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
DID I mention that I've signed a pledge -- just like those Republican congressmen who have signed written promises to different political enforcers not to raise taxes or permit same-sex marriage? My pledge is to never vote for anyone stupid enough to sign a pledge -- thereby abdicating their governing responsibilities in a period of incredibly rapid change and financial stress. Sorry, I've signed it. Nothing more I can do.
If this kind of idiocy by elected officials sends you into a hair-pulling rage and leaves you wishing that we had more options today than our two-party system is putting forward -- for instance, a party that would have offered a grand bargain on the deficit two years ago, not on the eve of a Treasury default -- not only are you not alone, but help may be on the way. 
Thanks to a quiet political start-up that is now ready to show its hand, a viable, centrist, third presidential ticket, elected by an Internet convention, is going to emerge in 2012. I know it sounds gimmicky -- an Internet convention -- but an impressive group of frustrated Democrats, Republicans and independents, called Americans Elect, is really serious, and they have thought out this process well. In a few days, Americans Elect will formally submit the 1.6 million signatures it has gathered to get on the presidential ballot in California as part of its unfolding national effort to get on the ballots of all 50 states for 2012.
The goal of Americans Elect is to take a presidential nominating process now monopolized by the Republican and Democratic parties, which are beholden to their special interests, and blow it wide open -- guaranteeing that a credible third choice, nominated independently, will not only be on the ballot in every state but be able to take part in every presidential debate and challenge both parties from the middle with the best ideas on how deal with the debt, education and jobs.
''Our goal is to open up what has been an anticompetitive process to people in the middle who are unsatisfied with the choices of the two parties,'' said Kahlil Byrd, the C.E.O. of Americans Elect, speaking from its swank offices, financed with some serious hedge-fund money, a stone's throw from the White House.
As the group explains on its Web site, www.americanselect.org: ''Americans Elect is the first-ever open nominating process. We're using the Internet to give every single voter -- Democrat, Republican or independent -- the power to nominate a presidential ticket in 2012. The people will choose the issues. The people will choose the candidates. And in a secure, online convention next June, the people will make history by putting their choice on the ballot in every state.''
Here is how it will work, explains Elliot Ackerman, an Iraq war veteran with a Silver Star, who serves as the chief operating officer of Americans Elect, and whose father, Peter, a successful investor, has been a prime engine behind the group. First, anyone interested in becoming a delegate goes to the Americans Elect Web site and registers. As part of that process, you will be asked to fill in a questionnaire about your political priorities: education, foreign policy, the economy, etc. This enables Americans Elect to put you in contact with others who share your views so you can discuss them and organize together. Then you will be invited to draft a candidate or support one who has already been drafted and to contribute to the list of questions that anyone running on the Americans Elect platform will have to answer on the site.
''The questions, the priorities, the nominations and the rules will all come from the community, not from two entrenched parties,'' said Ackerman.
Any presidential nominee must conform to all the Constitutional requirements, as well as be considered someone of similar stature to our previous presidents. That means no Lady Gaga allowed. Every candidate will have to post in words or video his or her answers to the platform questions produced by the Americans Elect delegates. In April 2012, the candidate pool will be reduced to six through three rounds of voting. The six, assuming they all want to run, will then have to name their running mates. The only rule is that a Democrat must run with a Republican or independent, and a Republican with a Democrat or independent.
''Each presidential candidate has to pick a running mate outside of their party and reaching across the divide of politics,'' said Ackerman. In June 2012, the online convention will choose who among the six will run as the Americans Elect candidate -- automatically on the ballot in all 50 states. If President Obama wants to run with John Boehner on the Americans Elect platform that would be fine -- provided they go through the process. (President Obama should dump the Democrats and run as an independent, which he is, at heart, anyway.)
Write it down: Americans Elect. What Amazon.com did to books, what the blogosphere did to newspapers, what the iPod did to music, what drugstore.com did to pharmacies, Americans Elect plans to do to the two-party duopoly that has dominated American political life -- remove the barriers to real competition, flatten the incumbents and let the people in. Watch out.

HEADLINE: Sorting Through Lending Costs

BYLINE: By MARYANN HAGGERTY

 BODY:
PLENTY of people have ideas about what you should be told when you're shopping for a mortgage, but for now, that may not be much help.
Even before it officially opened for business on July 21, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the federal agency created to oversee mortgage lending, started looking at loan shopping. The bureau is legally required to propose by July 2012 a way to streamline mortgage disclosure. It is exploring avenues for combining the two forms that borrowers get now -- the three-page Good Faith Estimate and the two-page Truth in Lending Act form.
These forms tell would-be borrowers the terms of their loan -- for instance, how payments on an adjustable-rate mortgage change. They also lay out fees. 
Although interest rates grab attention, fees can make a big difference, said Eileen Anderson, senior vice president of the Community Development Corporation of Long Island, which provides home buyer education. The easiest way to compare loans, she said, remains the Annual Percentage Rate, or A.P.R. That calculation rolls in fees as well as the stated interest rate. Because lenders are required to follow the same formula, useful comparisons can be made. ''That's the best way to shop for a loan, whether it's 10 years ago, or now,'' she said.
In May, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau solicited reactions to two versions of a form that combines the current forms onto one double-sided sheet. It received more than 13,000 comments. According to a bureau summary, people praised the effort, but had specific suggestions on layout and phrasing.
On June 27 the bureau posted two more revised versions. The comment period on them closed July 5; among those responding was the Mortgage Bankers Association, which said in a three-page letter that the proposals didn't mesh with current laws, and also criticized the mechanics and design. The bureau says forms are evolving.
All this comes less than two years after the Department of Housing and Urban Development overhauled the Good Faith Estimate -- an effort that involved years of soliciting comments and was mightily resisted by some in the lending industry. That form not only changed the way information was presented, but also required brokers and lenders to commit to many parts of their estimates -- a big change, as previous estimates sometimes had little relationship to actual closing costs.
But the forms themselves are longer and, for some borrowers, more confusing than the previous ones, Ms. Anderson said.
The form is still ''horrible, just horrible,'' said Mark Yecies, an owner of SunQuest Funding, a lender in Cranford, N.J. ''The G.F.E. doesn't actually itemize the closing costs in such a way that makes it easy for a borrower to understand what they are.''
Still, he advises people to get the form from every lender they approach. ''If you receive approximate closing costs in an e-mail or a form that is not the G.F.E.,'' he said, ''it doesn't mean squat.''
He added that some lenders had become adept at manipulating the estimates, by providing interest-rate quotations that expire almost instantaneously, or by low-balling fees in instances where they have legal flexibility. ''If you get two or three different G.F.E.'s and there's several thousand dollars' difference,'' he said, ''you know someone is playing games.''
But David Flores, a financial counselor with GreenPath Debt Solutions in New York, which provides home buyer education, says game playing is not as big a problem as it used to be. ''We're removed from the day when it was a 3 percent interest rate with a big asterisk,'' with the asterisk leading to fine print about teaser rates, he said.
Borrowers seem to have learned a lot from the attention paid to shaky loans in the last few years, he said. ''More people are asking the right questions when it comes to these adjustable rates and exotic loan types. More people are wise to them.''

HEADLINE: Ready to Wed? No, Mom.

BYLINE: By TIM MURPHY

 BODY:
FOR the last year, Aaron Breslow, 23, an H.I.V. project coordinator, has been dating Dan Scudellari, 26, an advertising executive. They have spent holidays with each other's families, and enjoy searing scallops and making kale salads in their apartments in Brooklyn.
They were mildly interested when New York lawmakers voted to allow same-sex marriage. Then his stepmother called. ''She congratulated me on gay marriage passing and said, 'This is a great opportunity for you,' '' Mr. Breslow said.
But there's a problem: Mr. Breslow, who calls himself queer rather than gay, philosophically opposes marriage. ''I don't understand the concept of legalized monogamy and normalcy,'' said Mr. Breslow, who has a brother, Jacob, also gay. ''My brother and I both studied queer theory.''
His stepmother, Lorraine Gray, won't take no for an answer. ''I don't have any girls,'' said Ms. Gray, 52, a psychotherapist in Oakland, Calif. Never mind that she also has two other sons, 18 and 22, who are straight. ''My gay kids are more fun than my straight ones,'' she said. 
Being gay has downsides: social bias, discrimination and homophobia, to name but three. But one blessing gay people have had was not having to endure pushy moms (and some dads) pestering them about when they are going to settle down and marry. With same-sex marriage now legal in New York, some gay sons and daughters are starting to feel the same heat from parents as do their straight siblings.
''I've been tracking it on our site's chat boards,'' said Carley Roney, editor in chief of the wedding site the Knot, which has had a gay wedding section since 1998. ''Now that more states are legalizing gay marriage, parents are saying, 'Oh, good, so you told me this was serious and I've been supporting you, but now you can make it official.' ''
In a sense, it's no different from what drives overbearing parents everywhere.
''Parents come to me with an existential anxiety to know that their children are going to be O.K. and taken care of when they're gone,'' said Naomi Bernstein, a clinical psychologist in Great Neck and Rockville Centre, N.Y.
But gay weddings have special meaning for some parents, especially if they struggled to accept their child's sexual orientation.
''Parents with gay kids initially might think they're not going to have a quote-unquote normal life,'' Dr. Bernstein said. ''But once they get over that, they say: 'O.K., great. You're gay, fine. But now nail someone down who can take care of you.' ''
JUST as important, a civic wedding offers social validation, not just before the state, but in the eyes of relatives and friends of the parents.
''The parents have been supportive, but now they want the payoff,'' Ms. Roney said.
One parent seeking that official stamp is Vicki Robinson, 58, a physics professor at the National Technical Institute for the Deaf in Rochester. Ever since Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo signed the same-sex marriage bill on June 24, Ms. Robinson has been nudging her 27-year-old daughter, Stephanie Pollanen, to marry her girlfriend of six years, Lindsay Hall.
''I'm a Bible-thumping Lutheran who just got my church to put rainbow stickers on their door,'' said Ms. Robinson, who is divorced and uses her maiden name. ''If they were married, I would feel more like I could write Lindsay's name in the family Bible in ink.''
But her daughter has refused to share her thoughts on marriage, so Ms. Robinson has taken to following her daughter's Twitter feed for signs of matrimonial chatter.
''I intercepted a Twitter tweet of my daughter's one day to a friend indicating that perhaps a wedding was on the horizon,'' she said. ''So I took my daughter and her girlfriend out to dinner and bought several rounds of martinis, and her partner happened to spill that they had discussed plans for a fall wedding.''
Nothing has been set, but that has not stopped Ms. Robinson from planning the big day in her head.
''Lindsay is small and adorable, so I see her in a flapper thing in ivory silk with an overlapping handkerchief hem and a cloche,'' she said. ''My daughter is larger than Lindsay and very curvy, so I see her in an old-fashioned off-the-shoulder wedding dress with a big skirt.''
Table settings and menus have also been considered.
''I also see lots of flowers and a string quartet with a band for dancing after,'' Ms. Robinson added. ''The food would be fabulous and exotic, maybe something sort of Moroccan-Middle Eastern.''
For the record, Ms. Pollanen said that she and her partner would not marry for at least a year because of school and finances. Ms. Pollanen, a bookstore supervisor in Troy, N.Y., plans to go to graduate school to study organizational development; her girlfriend, a receptionist, will study massage therapy this fall.
But when the time comes, Ms. Pollanen intends to include her mother in the wedding planning. ''If I want her to keep speaking to me, that is,'' she said.
Some mothers take their meddling to a professional level. Gretchen Hamm of Dallas became so involved in her daughter's 1999 commitment ceremony in Maryland that she started a site, GayWeddings.com, to fill what she saw as a void.
''I couldn't find a two-brides wedding-day memory book for Kathryn and her partner,'' Ms. Hamm said. ''I even became a virtual mom to some couples whose own parents wouldn't accept them.''
The flip side today are parents who take acceptance too far and push for marriage way before the couple feels ready.
''As soon as the New York marriage bill passed, my very loving, overprotective mom called me and asked, 'Are you thinking about this?,' '' said Eliot Glazer, 28, a television editor who lives in Ditmas Park, Brooklyn. He has been dating Neil Price, 28, a film sales executive in Chelsea, for nine months and just met Mr. Price's parents. ''I was like, 'No, um, I mean, maybe?' ''
His mother, Sandi Glazer, an office manager who lives in St. James, N.Y., is unapologetic.
''If Eliot thinks I'm pushy, I know other moms who are worse,'' she said.
OF course, when parents push too hard on the marital front, tension can arise. Jean Malpas, a gay psychotherapist in New York who works with many gay couples, advises patients with pushy parents to tell them, gently and repeatedly, ''I'm so glad you're supportive and excited, but we want to make this decision ourselves.''
Dr. Bernstein added that parents should examine their motives.
''If your child is happily coupled and everything's great, why is this so important to you?'' she said. ''Instead of constantly asking your child, 'When are you getting married?' get to the heart of your feelings, which might be, 'I want to feel that you're going to be taken care of.' ''
The new law has also created a wedge between some same-sex partners. Now that marriage is an option, happily cohabiting couples are having to navigate new questions about commitment, monogamy, finances and legal obligations that did not exist before.
These issues have dogged gay couples in Massachusetts, where same-sex marriage was legalized in 2004.
''I had a male couple who'd been together for 15 years, but when marriage became an option and one of them wanted to marry, the other said, 'No way,' '' said Edouard Fontenot, a psychologist in Boston with many gay clients. ''We had a four-year therapy process where the resistant partner ultimately realized that marriage, in addition to its economic benefits, wouldn't change their day-to-day life.'' The couple eventually married.
Others weren't so lucky, including a woman in her late 40s, and her partner, who was in her early 30s.
''The younger woman thought, 'Isn't this opportunity wonderful: we're moving from the outside to the inside,' '' Dr. Fontenot said. ''The older woman just couldn't see any value in the traditional institution of marriage. She said, 'This is something that's been used to beat us down.' It wasn't the only thing they broke up over, but it was a big point of conflict.''
Partners who ultimately accepted marriage were able to redefine it, Dr. Fontenot said, from ''something monolithic'' to ''something you shape to your own needs and desires.'' Same-sex couples, he added, ''have an opportunity to construct their marriages self-consciously in a way straight people have been denied.''
As for Mr. Breslow and his marriage-or-bust stepmother, there might be some wiggle room after all. To appease her, Mr. Breslow is willing to entertain the notion of a wedding-like celebration, which he sees as a party to celebrate his relationship.
''But I don't want a proper wedding,'' he added. ''I want it to be really queer and outrageous and angry, with a punk-rock drag queen playing hardcore music and people being naked.''
Ms. Gray has a slightly different vision: ''It would be very sophisticated and urban. And I would do the food, which would be very foodie California: maybe a mix of Jewish, which we are, and Dominican, which Dan is. Everything would be lovely and sophisticated and not tacky.''
The couple would wear tuxedos, she added, and she would wear Prada or Jil Sander.
On second thought, the couple might want to consider eloping.

HEADLINE: When the Math Says Go Ahead and Buy

BYLINE: By JOYCE COHEN. 
E-mail: thehunt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
ZACH LINDER, who had always shared an apartment, had every intention of renting a place of his own. Envisioning a small one-bedroom in a residential Brooklyn neighborhood, he drew up a budget: ''$1,400 was my soft ceiling and $1,500 was my hard ceiling,'' he said. ''I thought I was being pretty reasonable and not tremendously overly neurotic and picky.''
He was, however, shocked at how little he found to his liking. The only places he could afford were studios. They all seemed the same: one room with a kitchen along the wall.
''They were loaded with charm,'' Mr. Linder said, recalling lovely brownstone buildings with ''tin ceilings and beautiful floors and faux fireplaces.'' But attractive as they were, he said, ''they were not practical. I needed a closet and a place to put things.'' Those fireplaces consumed valuable wall space. In the kitchens, he said, ''you barely had room to put the bag of takeout.'' In one case, the tenant had used a board to turn the sink into a part-time counter. 
Last fall, Mr. Linder found the exception -- a lovely one-bedroom with a den on the top floor of a Prospect Heights brownstone. Even though it cost more than $1,600 a month, he decided it was worth the price. But by the time he assembled his paperwork one day later, someone else had rented the apartment. ''My heart sank,'' he said. ''I was, like, I am never going to find an apartment. What am I going to do?''
Mr. Linder, 26, a graduate of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, had planned on buying a place at some unspecified future date. But, frustrated by his fruitless search for a rental and inspired by a friend who had taken the leap and become the owner of an apartment, he decided that there was no need to wait.
According to online mortgage calculators, a studio would cost him only a small additional monthly outlay. And studios for purchase tended to be nicer than those for rent.
So this past winter, Mr. Linder began hunting for a place to buy. His budget for a co-op was no more than $300,000. The monthly maintenance charges of the places he saw were in the $600s or low $700s.
In a lovely brownstone on a picturesque block on Park Slope, several studios were for sale in the $200,000s, but their kitchens consumed too much of the living areas. Mr. Linder abandoned his idea of buying in a brownstone. ''It was a hard concept for me to accept at first,'' he said, ''but there's something quintessentially New York about grand apartment buildings.''
A studio at the former Hotel St. George on Hicks Street in Brooklyn Heights had a separate kitchen and built-in shelving. It was listed at $235,000. The view of the Brooklyn Bridge and the Manhattan skyline was spectacular.
''I imagined myself waking up in that apartment and seeing that view,'' Mr. Linder said. But he realized that the character-free interior would bother him. As he reported to his mother, Luise Linder, ''I feel like it's 1:30 and I have to go to my economics class.'' (Both she and Mr. Linder's father, Jeff, visited all of the places in which he was interested.) That apartment later sold for $227,500.
Another possibility was in Turner Towers on Eastern Parkway, an Art Deco building with a large and lovely lobby. The apartment had a great layout, with a large foyer. But it was dark, and both kitchen and bathroom needed renovations. At $255,000, it seemed pricey for its condition.
''I wanted to love the apartment,'' Mr. Linder said. ''I sort of tricked myself into liking the apartment more than I did.'' That one remains on the market for $220,000.
He didn't want to get his hopes up for an apartment nearby on Plaza Street East. The building also had a beautiful lobby, but he knew that didn't mean the apartment would measure up.
It did. At 520 square feet, this one was larger than other studios -- and it was empty. It had been difficult for Mr. Linder to imagine himself living in inhabited apartments, but this one was a blank canvas.
Off the foyer were two pretty archways, which reminded him of his childhood house in Great Neck, N.Y. The price was $227,000, with maintenance in the high $600s.
''There were things you could do with the apartment,'' said the listing agent, Rezwan Sharif of Prudential Douglas Elliman's Park Slope office. ''I think Zach was able to visualize the potential.''
A similar unit a few flights up, with a renovated kitchen, had sold a year before for $276,000, Mr. Sharif said.
Mr. Linder's offer of $223,000 was quickly accepted. He was surprised to receive no counteroffer.
A few days later, Mr. Sharif said, another buyer made a cash offer of a few thousand dollars more. ''I started freaking out that the seller was going to go with that,'' Mr. Linder said, ''but he stuck with me and I am grateful.''
He arrived this spring. His outlay for his mortgage and the maintenance fee is $1,531 a month.
The apartment did, however, require some work. Mr. Linder had the floors refinished and cable installed.
An electrician informed him that his circuit breaker was obsolete and a fire hazard, so he had it replaced, which required opening a wall.
The shower turned out to be a problem, too. ''It was like a 'Seinfeld' episode, where the shower pressure was really bad,'' his mother said. After repairs, it dripped. Pipes and knobs needed replacement, which meant the tile shower wall needed to be opened and resealed. Ms. Linder was glad to find that the co-op paid for that work. ''That is what maintenance is,'' she said.
The co-op did not, however, pay to reglaze the bathtub, Mr. Linder's biggest challenge. He asked neighbors for recommendations, but few veterans of the procedure responded. Prices ranged from $250 to $900. ''How could a single task range in scale so much?'' Mr. Linder wondered. He chose one of the less expensive contractors, who did perfectly fine work.
These days, he is looking for a job in the field of digital marketing, and having fun furnishing his place in a midcentury modern style. ''I got a cool vintage phone,'' he said. ''I like the idea of owning your own home and customizing it to what works for you. I've started reading home renovation blogs.''
His neighbors are mostly older people. ''I kind of like that,'' he said. ''I've always kind of been like the grandpa among my peers. I sort of have that personality, so I feel at home and comfortable in a building like this.''

HEADLINE: Collaborate and Compete

BYLINE: By BILL KOENIGSBERG. 
As told to Patricia R. Olsen.

 BODY:
I STARTED playing tennis at the age of 5, and at 8 I was playing competitively in tournaments. As I grew older, playing doubles taught me about collaboration, and playing one-on-one taught me how to outthink and outsmart an opponent. I was also a television buff, especially when it came to commercials.
My first job, at 14, was managing private tennis courts and giving lessons. Someone often double-booked the courts, so several people would show up simultaneously for the same court. I quickly learned conflict management. I'd apologize profusely and offer the court free at another time, or offer a free lesson. 
That job was also my first foray into advertising. There was a restaurant nearby, and I got the idea to let the owners advertise at our tennis center in return for lunch every day.
I played a lot of competitive tennis while at the University of Miami and became friends with some of the other athletes. The school always had the football players stay in a hotel off campus the night before a game. One night, I was hanging out with them at a hotel. Some of the players decided to have some fun and threw some furniture from their room into the pool. After a while, they figured that they'd better replace it and decided to break into the room next door to get the substitute furniture. A couple of the players decided that because I was smaller, I'd have the easiest time climbing in the window and unlocking the door from inside.
We were on the 10th floor. They lifted me onto the outside ledge, and I shimmied along the wall and climbed into the room. Looking back, I realize that, had I fallen, I might have died. The lesson I learned was to be careful of the company you keep.
I graduated in 1977 with a business degree. At the time, jobs were hard to come by, and it took me six months to find one. It was with Ed Libov Associates, a media buying service. Some companies wouldn't give me the time of day, but a few would spend time with me whether or not they had a job to offer. I've never forgotten that. I try to be accessible and an open listener.
In 1984, I moved to Media General and opened a New York office for it. In 1989, the company successfully fought a hostile takeover attempt, but the investors decided to diversify and to sell the media division I was managing. I convinced the company to lend me the money to buy the division. I borrowed $13 million. I was taking a huge risk, but they agreed and I formed Horizon Media. Today we have more than 600 employees, four offices and $3 billion in annual media investments. Our clients include Geico, Capital One and Arts & Entertainment Television Networks.
Clients used to have one agency -- the agency of record -- that handled everything for them: media buying, creative campaigns and public relations. But that has changed over the years. As communications have grown more complex, agencies have become more specialized. Companies now often work with more than one agency simultaneously. These days, it's all about being an agency of collaboration.
Advertising has gone through other significant changes as well. Privacy issues are at the forefront of digital communications, especially regarding ways in which consumers are going to be tracked for advertising purposes. Regulation is coming. Whether the industry monitors itself or the government steps in, we need a solution so that consumers are comfortable with being tracked.
We're in a self-service media economy. People have the option of tuning in or tuning out when it comes to advertising. Understanding how to navigate the media landscape gives you the keys of the kingdom.

HEADLINE: China to Wall St.: The Side-Door Shuffle

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA and AZAM AHMED; David Barboza reported from Dalian, China, and Azam Ahmed from New York. Xu Yan contributed research in Shanghai.

 BODY:
Dalian, China
IT was the hot new thing on Wall Street -- one of those exotic investments that seem to promise untold riches for the lucky few.
And, like so many hot new things, it went cold fast.
Such was the fabulous stock-market flameout of a company called Rino International, an untested enterprise that, until recently, would have raised nary an eyebrow in the United States.
But over the last few years, Rino International and scores of other young Chinese companies slipped into the United States stock market through the back door. Rino's American stockholders later lost hundreds of millions of dollars when accusations surfaced that the company had fudged its books. All told, investors' losses on these Chinese ventures have stretched into the billions.
How companies like Rino wormed their way into the temples of American capitalism is a story for these financial times. Even amid the wreckage of the 2007-8 financial collapse, an ecosystem of Wall Street enablers -- bankers, lawyers, entrepreneurs, auditors -- spirited Chinese companies to the United States. With some deft financial maneuvers, these businesses essentially went public while sidestepping the usual rules. Before long, many were trading on the Nasdaq stock market, alongside the likes of Google. 
It was all perfectly legal. With bankers' help, the Chinese companies executed what are known as reverse mergers. They bought American companies that were merely shells and assumed those companies' stock tickers -- sort of the Wall Street equivalent of ''Invasion of the Body Snatchers.'' The strategy let them avoid reviews with state and federal regulators that are normally required for initial public stock offerings.
At issue now is who should bear responsibility for the bursting of yet another Wall Street bubble. Should it be the Chinese executives and their bankers, who engineered the deals and celebrated these companies? Or should it be the investors, who bought these stocks when, in hindsight, the risks seemed clear enough? The lawsuits are flying.
Next to Bernard L. Madoff and the sins of the subprime era, the supposed shenanigans of a few Chinese companies might seem like small beer. But the developments underscore fundamental questions that came to the fore in the financial crisis: What do the people who create and sell investments owe to those who buy the investments? And where, if anywhere, are the regulators?
Dozens of Chinese companies that, like Rino, entered the United States market via reverse mergers have since been accused of fraud or shoddy accounting. The shares of at least 19 of them have been suspended or delisted by Nasdaq, wiping out billions of dollars in stock market value. Shares of Rino, which were flying high at $35 in 2009, have been removed from the exchange.
Laurence M. Rosen, whose law firm has filed a class-action suit against Rino International, says Rino's bankers failed investors. Wall Street didn't do its homework, he says.
''This is egregious,'' Mr. Rosen says. ''They said they did due diligence but were fooled -- but they weren't doing any solid due diligence.''
Rino has been accused of creating phony business contracts and wildly inflating its sales, among other things. Executives at Rino International, which is based here in Dalian and makes industrial pollution control systems, declined to comment, beyond saying that it is conducting business as usual.
THERE is not much to see outside the headquarters of Rino International here. The company resides in a bland corporate park that is home to a number of other Chinese businesses. A guard stands watch at the gated entrance. Inside, workers load steel beams onto trucks. The bang and hum of factory work rises from workshops.
Dalian, a seaport city in northeastern China with a population of about six million, in recent years has developed into a fast-growing hub of machine manufacturing, petrochemicals, oil refining and electronics. Driving this growth have been companies like Rino, whose name means ''green promise'' in Chinese.
For international investors, Rino was an alluring equation: ''China'' plus ''environment'' equals profit. Like many other Chinese companies, Rino faced obstacles in borrowing money from the state-owned banks that dominate the country's economic life. It also confronted hurdles in going public on stock markets in Shanghai or Shenzhen, where share prices have gyrated wildly.
And so the entrepreneurs behind Rino -- Zou Dejun and his wife, Qiu Jianping -- turned to Wall Street.
The matchmaker in this transcontinental deal was an American, Chris Bickel, who earned handsome finder's fees for bringing Chinese companies to the attention of investment bankers and lawyers back in New York. Working from China with a small New York financial advisory firm, Douglas Financial, Mr. Bickel helped package Rino International for its Wall Street debut.
''We determined at the time that this was a significant market and they had the technology,'' Mr. Bickel recalls, adding that any possible improprieties arose later.
As part of the plan, Rino got new handlers in New York: a law firm, an investor relations firm, a new auditor. To complete the package, the company named as its chief financial officer Bruce Richardson, an American businessman who had spent more than a decade in Shanghai. Mr. Richardson declined to comment.
To gain entry to an American stock market without an I.P.O., Rino needed to find an American shell. Enter Glenn A. Little, a Texas entrepreneur who specialized in buying up defunct companies and selling them in reverse mergers.
In 2002, Mr. Little paid about $100,000 to buy Jade Mountain, a failed medical devices company that had once been publicly traded. Jade Mountain, based in Nevada, had no business operations, no debt, no liabilities. What it had was a current stock registration.
Mr. Little himself was so enamored with Rino that rather than take payment in cash, he asked for shares in Rino. The bankers' pitch seemed irresistible, he recalls, all the more because several big institutions, including Bank of America, were investing in Rino, too.
''They gave me a book and it had the two most exciting words you could hear: 'China' and 'pollution,' '' Mr. Little says. ''They had audited financials, big-name lawyers and Bank of America.''
In October 2007, soon after Rino acquired Jade Mountain, Bank of America and about a dozen other investors, including Alder Capital, a hedge fund, bought Rino shares in what is known as a private placement. That sale raised $25 million. Before long, Rino stock was trading on the over-the-counter market for about $4.50 a share.
Over the next several years, Rino reported ever-higher quarterly profits. It expanded its business and its product line. Word spread on Wall Street: Rino was a company to watch.
David N. Feldman, a New York lawyer and the author of ''Reverse Mergers and Other Alternatives to Traditional I.P.O.'s,'' says that such reverse mergers reflected a confluence of two powerful forces. One the one hand, Chinese companies were desperate to raise capital. On the other, American investors were desperate to tap into China's fast-growing economy. ''A lot of this is about access to capital,'' Mr. Feldman says.
ALAN GREENSPAN and Diana Ross were headliners at a September 2009 investment conference held by an investment bank that is little known outside financial circles: Rodman & Renshaw.
Founded in 2002, Rodman has carved a niche for itself as the Goldman Sachs of private placements -- sales of new stocks or bonds that circumvent the public markets. The hurdles for these private sales are lower than for public offerings, the theory being that the buyers -- large, supposedly sophisticated investors -- can do their own homework.
Like many investors, Rodman smelled opportunity in China, and in 2009, when Rino wanted to raise more money in the United States, the bank gave the Chinese company a prominent place at its gala. The presentation served as Rino's splashy debut before thousands of investors.
A few months later, Rodman helped Rino raise $100 million in a deal that valued the Chinese company at nearly $1 billion. From there, however, Rino's stock price began to decline. In November 2010, it fell off a cliff.
That month, Muddy Waters Research, a firm that has grabbed Wall Street attention by digging up dirt on Chinese companies, released a scathing report on Rino. It said Rino had vastly overstated its revenue, fabricated contracts and diverted tens of millions of dollars to its own executives.
Rino later owned up to some of the findings and cautioned that its financial statements from 2008, 2009 and early 2010 ''should no longer be relied upon.'' Eventually, the S.E.C. suspended trading in its stock.
Representatives of Rodman & Renshaw, which itself went public by assuming the ticker of a defunct company, declined to comment.
WHEN it comes to China, the question on many investors' minds is how fast its economy can keep growing. Beijing has been trying to head off a new surge in inflation.
Back in the United States, there has been an explosion of class-action lawsuits, many of which are aimed at auditors and investment banks that brought Chinese companies to American markets. Everyone is pointing fingers at everyone else: lawyers are blaming the bankers, and the bankers are blaming the auditors, and the auditors are blaming executives in China.
Fanning the flames is an army of private investigators, bloggers and Wall Street short-sellers that hope to profit from the stock-market implosions, like Muddy Waters. In the aftermath of the China meltdown, reverse mergers have slowed sharply, and the Securities and Exchange Commission has warned investors of risks associated with such deals. S.E.C. officials met Chinese regulators two weeks ago in Beijing to discuss auditing rules for such companies.
Chinese regulators are worried. ''I hate these scandals; everybody hates them,'' Liu Qingsong, deputy director of the research center of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, said this month at a conference in Singapore, as reported by Reuters. ''The scandals are very damaging to the reputation of all Chinese companies in the U.S.'' Yet, for many, China seems irresistible, with money to be made and, invariably, lost. Since 1990, the benchmark stock index on the Shanghai exchange has soared 27-fold, despite a crash in 2008 and a lot of ups and downs in between.
One question that won't go away is whether investors can really trust the numbers in China. Even investors like John A. Paulson, the hedge fund manager who made a killing on the subprime collapse, have lost big in China.
Michael Licosati, a founder of Alder Capital, bought shares in Rino. Today, convinced that fraud is rampant in China, he is betting against such stocks.
''You cannot compare the capitalist system in the U.S. with the capitalist system in China,'' he says. Bank of America, another early Rino investor, declined to comment.
In Dalian, Ms. Qiu, Rino's chairwoman and the wife of its C.E.O., says only that it is business as usual at the company. ''What I can tell you is that our company is doing well and the operation has been very normal,'' she says.
Inside the gated compound, workers in tarred jerseys and goggles weld and drive screws. Back in New York, Rino's shares are frozen at 40 cents.

HEADLINE: A Fashionable Getaway, Saugatuck Battles Change

BYLINE: By KARI LYDERSEN. 
klydersen@chicagonewscoop.org

 BODY:
In the 1800s and early 1900s, Saugatuck's harbor was where ships were loaded with tons of lumber, peaches and other goods from Michigan's forests and fields and sent down Lake Michigan to Chicago. Chicago artists and architects flocked to the town, 140 miles northeast of Chicago, founding Oxbow, the century-old painting school now affiliated with the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. 
In recent decades, Saugatuck has become a vacation destination for Chicago's gay community and a magnet for other Chicagoans and second-home owners.
Now residents, including many current and former Chicagoans, are pitted against one another in a years-long battle over a luxury marina development proposed by Aubrey McClendon, the billionaire chief executive of the Chesapeake Energy Corporation.
On Friday night, the Saugatuck township board voted to accept the settlement of a federal lawsuit filed by Mr. McClendon, which will allow the development to go forward. Opponents said they will still pursue legal action.
It is the latest round in a controversy that has included multiple lawsuits and, according to the township attorney, Ron Bultje, has nearly bankrupted the township, forcing it to raise taxes to cover costs.
Mr. McClendon's lawsuit claims that the township deliberately changed the zoning to sabotage his plans to build a marina, hotel, golf course and houses and condominiums on about 300 acres of dunes just north of the town. The zoning was made more restrictive shortly before he bought the land for $39 million in 2006. Critics of Mr. McClendon see the proposed settlement with the township as a white flag of surrender, essentially granting him a waiver from zoning restrictions and allowing him to build a 66-slip marina, 9-story hotel, golf course and up to 100 residential units.
Supporters of the development say it would be the economic salvation of the town, which has suffered in the recession. Opponents say it would damage the delicate dunes ecosystem and destroy the tranquillity that attracts people to Saugatuck.
Among the opponents is Tracey Shafroth, an Evanston resident and ecological outreach worker at the Field Museum, who said Mr. McClendon should have to comply with the zoning restrictions. ''What message does this send, that the laws don't apply to you if you have money?'' Ms. Shafroth said.
R. J. Peterson, a former Chicagoan and now a local marina owner, backs the development, arguing that it would attract more wealthy Chicagoans and bolster tax revenues.
A land conservancy, the township and the City of Saugatuck had tried to buy the acres Mr. McClendon now owns to keep them open space, adjacent to Saugatuck Dunes State Park to the north.
Mr. Peterson said the area already had enough parkland.
''Look at New York. You have Central Park and then you have Manhattan to support it,'' he said. ''We need a financial base. Why shoot Santa Claus and call the guy a monster when he wants to spend his money here?''

HEADLINE: How the Deficit Got This Big

BYLINE: By TERESA TRITCH

 BODY:
With President Obama and Republican leaders calling for cutting the budget by trillions over the next 10 years, it is worth asking how we got here -- from healthy surpluses at the end of the Clinton era, and the promise of future surpluses, to nine straight years of deficits, including the $1.3 trillion shortfall in 2010. The answer is largely the Bush-era tax cuts, war spending in Iraq and Afghanistan, and recessions. 
Despite what antigovernment conservatives say, non- defense discretionary spending on areas like foreign aid, education and food safety was not a driving factor in creating the deficits. In fact, such spending, accounting for only 15 percent of the budget, has been basically flat as a share of the economy for decades. Cutting it simply will not fill the deficit hole.
The first graph shows the difference between budget projections and budget reality. In 2001, President George W. Bush inherited a surplus, with projections by the Congressional Budget Office for ever-increasing surpluses, assuming continuation of the good economy and President Bill Clinton's policies. But every year starting in 2002, the budget fell into deficit. In January 2009, just before President Obama took office, the budget office projected a $1.2 trillion deficit for 2009 and deficits in subsequent years, based on continuing Mr. Bush's policies and the effects of recession. Mr. Obama's policies in 2009 and 2010, including the stimulus package, added to the deficits in those years but are largely temporary.
The second graph shows that under Mr. Bush, tax cuts and war spending were the biggest policy drivers of the swing from projected surpluses to deficits from 2002 to 2009. Budget estimates that didn't foresee the recessions in 2001 and in 2008 and 2009 also contributed to deficits. Mr. Obama's policies, taken out to 2017, add to deficits, but not by nearly as much.
A few lessons can be drawn from the numbers. First, the Bush tax cuts have had a huge damaging effect. If all of them expired as scheduled at the end of 2012, future deficits would be cut by about half, to sustainable levels. Second, a healthy budget requires a healthy economy; recessions wreak havoc by reducing tax revenue. Government has to spur demand and create jobs in a deep downturn, even though doing so worsens the deficit in the short run. Third, spending cuts alone will not close the gap. The chronic revenue shortfalls from serial tax cuts are simply too deep to fill with spending cuts alone. Taxes have to go up.
In future decades, when rising health costs with an aging population hit the budget in full force, deficits are projected to be far deeper than they are now. Effective health care reform, and a willingness to pay more taxes, will be the biggest factors in controlling those deficits.

HEADLINE: The City Payroll May Include a Few Too Many Bosses

BYLINE: By DAN MIHALOPOULOS. 
dmihalopoulos@chicago newscoop.org

 BODY:
In City Hall's Department of Family and Support Services, the relatively small band of employees receive supervision from no less than one commissioner, 14 deputy commissioners, 4 assistant commissioners, 6 assistants to the commissioner and 17 others with the word ''director'' in their titles.
Budget consultants hired by city-employee unions calculate that the department has more than 200 employees in various supervisory roles and 334 ''front line'' workers, for a ratio of about 1.6 staff members per manager.
After weeks of remaining mostly quiet during a public relations barrage from Mayor Rahm Emanuel, labor leaders are preparing to respond with cost-saving alternatives to Mr. Emanuel's decision to lay off as many as 625 city workers. Union officials will urge him to reduce the number of managers in Family and Support Services as well as other top-heavy departments instead of laying off their members, according to a section of the consultants' draft report obtained last week by the Chicago News Cooperative. 
''Fewer workers are actually doing the work and an excessive number of supervisors and managers are overseeing the work,'' the consultants contend in the report. ''We don't need to be firing any more of the people actually doing the work -- we need to get rid of the excessive number of people watching them do it.''
Leaders of the Chicago Federation of Labor, the umbrella union group that hired the budget consultants, declined to comment Friday. But the excerpt from the draft report indicates that a main thrust of the union's counteroffensive will be a call for ''eliminating unneeded midlevel management and political appointees.''
Mr. Emanuel has used similar rhetoric, although he has not made clear what he envisions as the future size of the city work force. During his campaign for mayor in February, he promised to ''streamline the bureaucracy'' of city government, partly by doing away with ''unnecessary layers of management.'' On May 17, the day after he took the oath of office, he announced plans to cut total salaries for ''senior management'' by 10 percent in every City Hall department, including his office.
''His responsibility is to protect the city's taxpayers, not the city's payroll,'' a mayoral spokeswoman said Friday. ''No part of that payroll is immune, including management.''
Labor activists, many City Council members and other budget watchdogs have long asserted that the administration of former Mayor Richard M. Daley, who retired this year, had too many bosses making too much money. While the total number of City Hall employees dropped during his 22 years in office, the ranks of officials with the fanciest job titles grew steadily for most of his tenure, city budget records show.
There was financing for the salaries of one commissioner, two deputy commissioners and one assistant commissioner in the Buildings Department in 1990, the first year that Mr. Daley proposed a budget. By 2008, the list of Buildings Department honchos with such titles had swelled from 4 to 14. Only the following year, after the recession began to dry up city revenue streams, did Mr. Daley move to eliminate some positions for high-level managers in the Buildings Department and other branches of his administration.
Labor officials and some elected leaders say Mr. Daley's successor should cut much deeper.
''City government has bloat in its middle-management layers,'' Alderman Brendan Reilly (42nd Ward), the vice chairman of the Council's budget committee, said last week. ''Correcting the management-employee ratio will be critical to getting our fiscal house in order.''
The Chicago Federation of Labor's consultants, Public Works LLC of West Chester, Pa., did not conduct a comprehensive review of the structure of the entire 35,000-member city work force. But in their draft report they say that the Emanuel administration should closely examine the overall proportion of workers to managers, and they point to the organizational structure of three departments, including Family and Support Services, as examples of the problem.
The report notes that the payroll for the city's Department of Information Technology includes 11 deputy chief information officers, as well as a chief and a managing deputy chief, among 103 full-time department employees. (In his mayoral run, Mr. Emanuel said he would consider folding that department into the city's budget office.)
The consultants also found that 55 managers are included in the 477 filled positions in the General Services Department, about 7.6 workers for each administrator.
The consultants argue that such ratios are too low and that Chicago should follow the lead of other city and state governments across the country that have achieved great savings by reducing layers of management. A slight increase in the number of workers per manager could save the city tens of millions of dollars, the consultants say.
Similarly, the Civic Federation, a tax watchdog group financed by business leaders, recently analyzed the management structure in city government's largest department, the police force.
''The Chicago Police Department has more layers of management at the top of the department than police departments of other major cities,'' according to a Civic Federation report on the city's budget released last month.
The authors of that report said the police force had two more layers of supervisors than the Los Angeles and Houston police and one layer more than the New York Police Department. Chicago has four classes of officialdom above the department's seven deputy chiefs of patrol.
Many upper-echelon city officials command high salaries, including 41 managers who are paid at least $100,000 a year each in the Aviation Department, an agency that Laurence Msall, the Civic Federation president, also criticized for its many layers of bureaucracy.
But Alderman Reilly and Mr. Msall said thinning the flock of city bureaucrats was not a cure-all for a budget deficit that could reach $700 million next year. With 80 percent of city spending devoted to personnel costs and 90 percent of workers in unions, closing the shortfall will also require eliminating many lower-level jobs, according to Mr. Msall.
''They need to reduce at all levels, including management,'' he said.
Mr. Emanuel's most recent public statements have focused on workers represented by organized labor. He called on employee unions to agree to changes in contractually guaranteed work rules, like overtime policies, to help balance the budget. When labor leaders did not quickly agree to those proposals, the mayor carried out his threat to issue layoff notices and announced plans to outsource janitorial work at airports and libraries as well as the administration of employee benefits and the water-bill call center.
Union leaders said Mark Angelson, the deputy mayor, began a closed-door meeting with them Monday by saying, ''There's a new sheriff in town.''
While Mr. Emanuel has promised to scale back overall payroll spending on managers, some of his newly hired aides are being paid more than their predecessors in Mr. Daley's administration, city records show. They include Matt Hynes, the chief lobbyist; Alexandra Holt, the budget director; Lois Scott, the chief financial officer; Transportation Commissioner Gabriel Klein; and Evelyn Diaz, the new head of Family and Support Services.
The new mayor will not lack for public relations aides to help him frame the debate with unions. Payroll records show that at least 45 management-level officials are engaged in promoting the mayor's agenda in the news media. The payroll includes dozens of public relations officials in departments across City Hall in addition to the press secretary, deputy press secretary, five assistant press secretaries, two ''press aides'' and one photographer in the mayor's press office.

HEADLINE: Hildy Johnson Would Have Happily Hacked

BYLINE: By JAMES WARREN. 
jwarren@chicagonewscoop.org

 BODY:
James Warren writes a column for the Chicago News Cooperative.
If P. J. Powers mulls news-media ethics these days, he unavoidably focuses on reporters who see journalism as sport, with moral compasses buried as they lie, steal, cheat and bribe the police for information.
Alas, Mr. Powers, artistic director of the TimeLine Theatre, is thinking about 1920s Chicago journalism, not phone hacking by British reporters 90 years later. But it's a difference in degree, not kind. 
''When I read what was going on with Rupert Murdoch, I thought, 'Some things don't change,' '' Mr. Powers said. ''If you think this has come out of the blue, you've been asleep at the switch.''
TimeLine recently produced a wonderful revival of ''The Front Page,'' the 1928 Ben Hecht-Charles MacArthur classic set in a chaotic press room in the Criminal Courts Building adjacent to Cook County Jail. Mr. Powers played the charismatic and deceitful protagonist, the reporter Hildy Johnson, six years after portraying a corrupt journalist in TimeLine's production of ''Pravda,'' a David Hare-Howard Brenton satire inspired by Mr. Murdoch that starred Sir Anthony Hopkins when it opened in 1985 in London.
Mr. Hecht started out as a ''picture chaser'' for The Chicago Daily Journal. That meant stealing photos from people's homes for often scandalous articles, said Martha Briggs, a curator at the Newberry Library, where Mr. Hecht's papers reside.
''When nobody was home, you'd run in and grab something and leave,'' she said.
Mr. Hecht's experiences inspired Hildy -- played by Jack Lemmon, among others, in Hollywood knockoffs -- who spends the $260 meant for his wedding and honeymoon to bribe the assistant jail warden for details of a convicted criminal's escape. When Hildy stumbles into the miscreant, he locks him inside a desk rather than call the police as he plots with his editor on how to maximize scoops.
Mr. Powers was especially attuned to Mr. Murdoch's moral sinkhole after playing Andrew May, an initially idealistic reporter-editor in ''Pravda'' who morphs into an ethically wayward pawn of Lambert Le Roux, a Murdoch-inspired press baron first brought to life onstage by Mr. Hopkins.
There is a history of deception in the American news media, including prominent examples of reporters fabricating articles, stealing information, shilling for political and corporate interests, and impersonating everyone from police officers to mental patients.
In 1998, for instance, Michael Gallagher, a Cincinnati Enquirer reporter, pleaded guilty to hacking into voice mails at Chiquita Brands as part of an investigation alleging multiple company misdeeds at Central American plantations. But, as egregious as such cases are, it was not a reflection of systemic skulduggery.
For sure, deception can be justified if an overriding public interest is served and the deceit is the sole means to discern wrongdoing, said Robert Steele, a journalism ethics expert at DePauw University and the Poynter Institute who is consulting with National Public Radio as it re-examines its ethical standards in light of the recent, politically charged brouhahas there.
Historically, America's mostly college-educated journalist class is of relatively recent vintage. More unruly and colorful working-class reporters and editors were the norm until codes of ethics, a greater sense of professionalism and journalism schools arose or flourished.
But even when I got to The Chicago Sun-Times in the late 1970s, there was at least one reporter proficient in claiming to be a police officer to get information over the phone. The same reporter, now dead, also had an exterminating business with city contracts.
His sort might really feel emboldened in a blogger-infested culture that is mostly free of editors and ethical norms. As Mr. Steele noted, new technologies and economic instability lead many organizations to work in less professional ways. Mr. Powers said he heard from reporters attending TimeLine's revival about the pressure to have something, anything, online before competitors.
Throw in a popular culture, including cable television news, that often rewards being provocative, rather than being right, and one has an unavoidably growing risk of error and overstepping just as Mr. Hecht's feverish, corner-cutting press room is now an unavoidable 24/7 online reality.
And a key constituency may be getting a big pass amid the hand-wringing: consumers. Their cravings link Mr. Hecht's era to the TV- and Internet-dominated marketplace of Mr. Murdoch, the Rolls-Royce populist with a Gulfstream G550 jet.
If he had spied riches in owning The New York Review of Books or C-Span, he would have tried to buy them. He struck gold by discerning huge audiences who craved relentlessly embarrassing tales of the rich, powerful and famous -- and clearly didn't care about the tactics used.
Hildy Johnson, who left his fiancee stranded at a train station, would feel so much at home.

ABUSIVE LENDING PRACTICES
SNARE CHILE AND BRAZIL
Credit-fueled spending in two of South America's strongest economies has driven extensive economic growth, but it has also opened the door to abusive lending. In countries where regulation is scant, annual interest charges can top 220 percent and consumers cannot seek bankruptcy protection. PAGE 6
FEARS OVER MUBARAK TRIAL
Former President Hosni Mubarak is officially scheduled to go to trial in 10 days on charges that could carry the death penalty. After five months of mounting demonstrations calling for swift justice against the former Egyptian leader, some warn of an explosion of rage if his trial is postponed, as many believe it will be.

HEADLINE: Debt Limit Talks Held in Congress And White House

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE and JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Despite growing fears that world markets might react negatively to a breakdown in the federal budget negotiations, Congressional leaders clashed Saturday night as they tried to reach a new deficit-reduction agreement that Speaker John A. Boehner told colleagues could cut $3 trillion to $4 trillion in spending over 10 years.
''We are working, and I'm confident there will be resolution,'' Mr. Boehner told fellow House Republicans on an afternoon conference call, according to participants. ''There has to be.'' 
Yet an hourlong Saturday meeting in Mr. Boehner's Capitol suite was followed by pessimistic assessments of the state of negotiations from the two top Congressional Democrats, Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, and Representative Nancy Pelosi, the minority leader. They accused Republicans of refusing to give ground on how the federal debt limit would be raised.
''Their unwillingness to compromise is pushing us to the brink of a default on the full faith and credit of the United States,'' Mr. Reid said of Mr. Boehner and Senator Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader who also attended the session. ''We have run out of time for politics. Now is the time for cooperation.''
The impasse over major elements of the agreement came even as lawmakers said they were determined to make a new compromise public on Sunday afternoon before the opening of financial markets in Asia to reassure investors there.
President Obama began a morning meeting with Congressional leaders at the White House by noting that global markets could react adversely to Friday's collapse of his and Mr. Boehner's negotiations as early as Sunday, before trading begins in Asia. His Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, reinforced the point at the meeting's end.
The tense series of high-powered meetings on Saturday was reflective of the sense of urgency among lawmakers with little more than a week before the federal government risks defaulting on its debts, a fate that could be avoided if Congress agrees to increase the $14.3 trillion debt ceiling. Congressional Republicans, Democrats and Mr. Obama have seized on the debt fight as a way to win approval of a debt-reduction package but have disagreed sharply over what it should include.
The speaker, who abruptly broke off budget talks with Mr. Obama on Friday evening, said that he hoped the plan could be finished within 24 hours and indicated on the conference call with House members that the savings would most likely be achieved in two stages. As described by knowledgeable Congressional aides, the agreement under discussion would enact a first round of cuts of just under $1 trillion, an amount they said was sufficient to clear the way for a debt limit increase through 2011. A second increase would follow after a newly created legislative commission considered a broader range of spending cuts, program overhauls and potential revenue increases.
Democrats, who have dug in against anything they see as a short-term extension that would require multiple votes on the debt increase before the end of next year, said they accepted the two-stage plan but wanted the full increase in the debt limit now.
''I will not support any short-term agreement, and neither will President Obama nor Leader Pelosi,'' Mr. Reid said in a written statement earlier on Saturday. ''We seek an extension of the debt ceiling through at least the end of 2012. We will not send a message of uncertainty to the world.''
Following Mr. Reid's criticism, Republican officials said they have for months stuck to a consistent position demanding that each dollar increase in the debt ceiling be offset with a dollar in savings. They did not appear ready to abandon that position, with a spokesman for Mr. Boehner saying a two-step process was ''inevitable.''
Still, the spokesman, Michael Steel, said that ''we continue to believe that defaulting on the full faith and credit of the United States is not an option.'' An aide to Mr. McConnell said the negotiations aimed at preventing a default would continue.
Mr. Reid and the other leaders met at the White House on Saturday morning at the request of Mr. Obama. The meeting broke up without resolution just before noon, after about an hour of discussion.
In a statement after the White House session, Mr. McConnell indicated that he and his leadership counterparts were intent on devising a fallback measure to assure the borrowing ceiling was raised in time.
''The president wanted to know that there was a plan for preventing national default. The bipartisan leadership in Congress is committed to working on new legislation that will prevent default while substantially reducing Washington spending,'' Mr. McConnell said.
The White House, in its own statement, said that Mr. Obama reiterated his opposition to a short-term extension of the ceiling because it would hurt the economy, prompt rating agencies to downgrade the nation's credit rating and drive up interest rates for all Americans.
''As the current situation makes clear, it would be irresponsible to put our country and economy at risk again in just a few short months with another battle over raising the debt ceiling,'' the White House statement said.
The rancorous ending to the debt discussions on Friday means that leaders of the House and Senate now have only days to find a debt limit solution that has eluded them for months, gaming out ways to get a debt increase through a Republican-controlled House packed with conservatives demanding deep cuts and no new revenues.
Republicans were taking pains to show that the new plan was different from an earlier proposal by Mr. McConnell that would allow Congress to clear a debt increase through a procedural maneuver.
Under that approach, Congress could vote to disapprove the debt increase but allow Mr. Obama to veto the plan and get a rise in the ceiling if the House or Senate failed to override the veto, a very likely outcome. Aides said, however, that the developing proposal was likely to be modeled in some part on the McConnell approach, which had run into resistance in the House and from conservative activists.
In weeks of negotiations, House and Senate members have identified more than $1 trillion in savings that they could agree on, including cuts in federal agency budgets, farm subsidies, federal pension benefits and Medicaid.
If the new talks collapse, House Republicans could ultimately devise an extension based on cuts they identify and send it to the Senate, daring lawmakers to reject it or the president to veto it.

HEADLINE: In a Gold Lovefest, Shades of 1980

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
THE worse things get, the better it looks for gold. That's been the pattern this summer.
Worried about Greece, the future of the euro, the debt ceiling in the United States, or maybe even about the entire global economy? Buy gold bullion.
Plenty of investors, at least, have been thinking that way, driving the price of gold to nominal, if not inflation-adjusted, highs. 
Last week, as separate teams of high-level negotiators sought solutions to the Greek debt crisis and to the debt-ceiling morass in Washington, gold crossed $1,600 an ounce for the first time ever.
While the price fell on signs of progress on these nettlesome issues, gold ended the week at $1,602.60. (That's well below its 1980 inflation-adjusted peak of $2,516, said Edward Yardeni, an independent economist.) Gold hasn't been flying this high since the halcyon days of supply-side economics early in the Reagan administration.
Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, is hardly a gold bug, but he has taken notice. In response to brisk questioning by Representative Ron Paul -- the Texas Republican who is running for president for the third time, and has advocated a return to the gold standard -- Mr. Bernanke acknowledged that he is paying attention to gold prices.
''I think the reason people hold gold is as protection against what we call 'tail risk' -- really, really bad outcomes,'' Mr. Bernanke said at a Congressional hearing this month. ''To the extent that the last few years have made people more worried about the potential of a major crisis, then they have gold as a protection.''
In a recent column, I noted that some experts don't consider gold an appropriate asset in a typical diversified investment portfolio, partly because it generates no earnings, yet holding it entails cost. Gold is, however, certainly a financial asset, held by many central banks and prized by many private investors around the world.
Jeffrey Sica, for example, president of SICA Wealth Management in Morristown, N.J., is bullish about gold and other commodities -- and bearish about nearly every other asset class.
''Right now, I think gold looks better than ever,'' he said. His reasoning mirrors Mr. Bernanke's, at least in this way: Mr. Sica say that he sees a painfully high probability of unfortunate events occurring in the months ahead, and that he believes gold will provide some shelter.
He departs sharply from the central banker's views, though, in saying that the Fed's expansionary policy known as quantitative easing ''just hasn't worked.'' Furthermore, he expects the economy to weaken further, and the European sovereign debt crisis ''to be with us for some time, regardless of whatever is arranged short term, and it will end up hurting many banks.''
While there may be what he calls a ''relief rally'' if the immediate crises seem to be resolved, he says that there has been a ''general loss of confidence in the ability of central banks and governments to manage the economy.''
''That will continue to give gold and other precious metals a boost,'' he adds.
Even at central banks, gold's standing has risen in some respects lately. In June, UBS held a gathering of managers of central bank reserves, multilateral institutions and sovereign wealth funds, and found that a plurality believed gold would be the best-performing asset class through the end of 2011.
WHAT'S more, said Larry Hatheway, chief economist for UBS Investment Bank, a majority said they expected that the dollar would no longer be the most important reserve currency in the world in 25 years. Instead, they expected that ''a portfolio of currencies'' would replace it. Less than 10 percent envisioned gold ascending to that role.
Still, the World Gold Council, which tracks gold stocks, says the world's central banks already hold roughly 29,000 tons of gold. Only about 166,000 tons have been mined throughout world history, the council says, so the central banks hold a significant portion of it.
Why? Most of it is a legacy of the time when major currencies were pegged to gold -- in the days before Aug. 15, 1971, when President Richard M. Nixon took the United States off the gold standard. With more than 8,000 tons, the United States has more official gold stocks than any other country, the council says.
The United States ought to use that hoard to return the dollar to a gold standard, says Jeffrey Bell, who is trying to make this an issue in the 2012 presidential campaign. Mr. Bell has advocated the gold standard for years -- and did so as the Republican senatorial candidate in New Jersey in 1978.
He was defeated by Bill Bradley, sometimes known as Dollar Bill because of his solid performance as a basketball player for the New York Knicks.
Mr. Bell recalls ruefully: ''I used to hold up a dollar bill at campaign rallies and say, there's nothing behind this now, we have to put something solid behind it. History shows that I lost.''
Lewis E. Lehrman, a friend and ally of Mr. Bell's, says a gold standard would require the government to balance its budget and its current account. He says that, among other things, it would have made it impossible to accumulate the enormous private-sector debt load that led to the financial crisis of 2007.
Mr. Lehrman, once the president of the Rite Aid Corporation and now a philanthropist and historian, ran for governor of New York in 1982 but was defeated in the general election by Mario Cuomo. In a telephone interview last week, Mr. Lehrman said, ''The debts in the American banking system that were amassed simply would not have been feasible if you had direct convertibility of currency into gold.''
He acknowledges that returning to a gold standard won't happen overnight. But, he says, it will happen, ''because the failure of all of the other approaches will become evident to the American people.''
The last apex of the back-to-gold movement was perhaps in 1980. It may have been a signal that the price of gold was about to peak. Could we be approaching a turning point now? ''You could make that argument,'' Mr. Bell says. ''The big question is whether the government and the Federal Reserve will be able to get the economy under control without a return to gold.''

HEADLINE: After Devastating Floods, Debate Over Mission Of the Missouri Rolls On

BYLINE: By A. G. SULZBERGER

 BODY:
KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- The meandering path of the Missouri River, charted by Lewis and Clark, once served as the main travel artery across the Great Plains, carrying people and goods between the comforts of St. Louis and the wilds of the Montana territory.
But as railroads and highways replaced the river as the preferred shipping routes, barge traffic dried up so much that some ports have gone years without seeing a single one. And now the river is dividing the region that it had stitched together with each of its oxbow bends.
The record flooding this summer along the Missouri River has overwhelmed dams and levees, swamped small communities and forced large cities into emergency measures to hold the water back. And so the pressing matter of how to manage flooding on the Missouri has added a new urgency to the contentious question that has long nagged this region: What precisely is this river for?
In a normal year, the water that is used to keep the river level high enough for barges comes from releases from the dam system built to control river flow. But the states north of the dams, including North and South Dakota, have argued that the river is no longer needed for navigation and that more water should be kept in the reservoirs for recreation, to help the region's economy. 
The summer-long flood brought promises of renewed cooperation after years of legal and legislative battles. Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, said a recent meeting of a group of senators to examine how the waterway was managed represented ''a high point, pardon the expression, for cooperation for states along the Missouri River.''
But these leaders have not yet breached the underlying concerns about how the federal government manages the water.
Earlier this year, the Missouri Congressional delegation succeeded in stripping financing, after more than $7 million had been spent, from a study of the priorities for river management that was supported by upriver states, arguing that it was redundant and amounted to an attack on navigation.
Even as Ms. McCaskill praised the collaboration in fighting flooding, she noted that she and other leaders from both parties in Missouri remained committed to supporting shipping interests on the river. ''While navigation is much more important than recreation, we should not let the fight between navigation and recreation get in the way of flood control,'' Ms. McCaskill said.
Her colleagues north of the dams have a different view.
''Frankly, navigation never developed as anticipated,'' said Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota, who called for a revision of how the river was operated. ''The basic operational assumptions from the management of the river are really no longer valid.''
Asked about the continued emphasis on navigation despite the sparse traffic, Jody Farhat, the chief of water management for the Missouri River Basin for the Army Corps of Engineers, said: ''The primary reason is it's because it's the law. The Corps of Engineers does what Congress tells us to do.''
Once wide, shallow and unusually winding, the Missouri River has been drastically reshaped over the last century, at a cost of more than $650 million, to create a channel friendly to modern vessels, according to federal estimates. The result is a narrower, deeper, straighter river, which the government spends about $7 million a year to maintain.
The predictions for boat traffic that were used to justify the spending never materialized. The amount and value of river freight has actually declined sharply since the late 1970s, a few years before the project was finally completed, according to federal data.
Though the river cuts through the heart of farm country, almost no grain is transported on the Missouri -- 4.8 million of the 5 million tons of cargo moved by barge last year was sand and gravel, which was usually shipped less than a mile. Traffic upriver from Kansas City all but disappeared.
''They've had decades to prove this is worth the expenditure of taxpayer dollars,'' said Andrew Fahlund, a vice president for conservation at American Rivers, a conservation organization that has sued over the management of the river.
Even the shipping company of Roger Blaske, whose great-grandfather and every generation since have plied these waters, was one of several on the river to close after years of drought made business even more unpredictable. He was unsure if it would ever again be profitable to work on the waterway.
''I guess it could be,'' Mr. Blaske said with a heavy sigh. ''It was at one time.''
Some leaders maintain that the industry will revive. In St. Joseph, Mo., where just two barges have visited in the decade since the construction of a $1.3 million port, city leaders insist that the river is still viable as a commerce route.
Just downriver in Kansas City, leaders are looking into reopening a port, with the head of the effort saying he hoped upriver states would not ''choke off the opportunity for people below.'' And the State of Missouri received $900,000 in federal money to examine how to get more freight on the river.
''The highways are congested, the railways are headed that way, the waterways have capacity,'' said Ernest Perry, the freight development administrator for the Missouri transportation department.
Other rivers have shown that shipping can still be viable. Though slower than other forms of transit, river barges are able to carry far larger quantities at a lower cost. Even with aging infrastructure on many major shipping routes -- and despite the widespread flooding this year -- the business as a whole remains healthy, industry leaders say.
But the Missouri can accommodate fewer barges because of the strong current and sharper bends. And though navigation, along with flood control, gets priority for releases of water from dams, the unpredictable river levels have made shipping contracts riskier.
The most substantial contribution to navigation that the river makes is supplying water to the far busier Mississippi, into which the Missouri empties just north of St. Louis.
Kevin Holcer, a manager for AGRIServices, a Missouri company that sells fertilizer and other agricultural products, said that when the shipping operations they worked with went out of business, the company bought its own tugboat.
''We're really the only one on the Missouri that's out here every day for hire,'' he said. The current flood shut down river traffic and has caused substantial losses, he added.
Officials with the Army Corps of Engineers have said that the reservoir levels were drawn down to ''full flood capacity,'' when rain unexpectedly filled the space set aside for snowmelt -- forcing the dams to release more water than ever before. Various parties have suggested that more water than necessary was being held back. Corps leaders acknowledge the tension between vacating water for a flood and holding it for other use, but maintain that the guidelines never anticipated a flood of this size.
That defense has not assuaged Gov. Terry E. Branstad of Iowa, a Republican, who has strongly criticized the Corps of Engineers for not releasing more water sooner. He said he believed that the other uses, like navigation and recreation, distracted from the focus on flood control.
''They've lost their way,'' Mr. Branstad said. ''They're not doing what the dams were designed to do in the first place. As a result, we've suffered significant losses.''

Daniel S. Loeb, the founder of Third Point, isn't shy about speaking his mind. 
So it should come as little surprise that the hedge fund's latest letter to investors, about the economic state of the world, comes out swinging.
"The budget is not the only thing in deficit today, as a paucity of leadership has left the country without a stable framework in which businesses can conduct business, investors can invest and consumers can consume without a high degree of uncertainty and fear," the letter begins.
While Mr. Loeb concluded last year by saying he would no longer be writing Third Point's quarterly investor letters, his apparent dissatisfaction with President Obama has roused him to once again pick up his pen for another blunt and acerbic piece.
From the letter:
"It is increasingly difficult to avoid the conclusion that while Washington burns, President Obama is fiddling away by insisting that the only solution to the nation's problems -- whether unemployment, the debt ceiling or deficit reductions -- lies in redistribution of wealth. Perhaps a plan that led the way forward by expanding opportunities rather than redistributing outcomes and emphasized growth and prosperity for all would be met with less political resistance."
Third Point, which manages about $7.9 billion in assets, found little to be more hopeful about Europe. The hedge fund sees a slowdown there, as the Continent is beset with sovereign debt worries. The letter, sent to investors in the firm's offshore fund, notes that the investing landscape has been schizophrenic as market participants veer between fear of being taken out in the decline and concern about missing out on an opportunity. 
Given the problems in the United States and the uncertainty surrounding Europe, Third Point is "inclined to be cautious with your capital," the letter said. The firm has reduced net exposures to the market as a result. 
June was not an easy month for most hedge funds, and Third Point was no exception. The hedge fund started the month up about 9 percent for the year to date, a standout performance in what has so far been been a time of muted returns. After June's turbulence, however, the fund is up about 7 percent for the year.
Third Point's winners include a bet on gold, a commodity that has been popular with a number of hedge fund managers; the car parts maker Delphi; and the El Paso Corporation. Losers include the paper mill company NewPage; Technicolor; and Big Lots. 
The hedge fund also sees opportunities in the fertilizer maker Mosaic, as well as Sara Lee, which decided earlier this year not to sell itself. Third Point's 2nd-Quarter 2011 Investor Letter

HEADLINE: Enthusiasm for Perry at Iowa Event

BYLINE: TRIP GABRIEL


HIGHLIGHT: Supporters of Rick Perry get a generally good response in Iowa, even though he is not officially a candidate.

 BODY:
SEARSBORO, Iowa -- Rick Perry is not yet in the race for president, but don't tell the the people collecting e-mail addresses alongside tables for other, declared candidates at a gun-rights rally here on Saturday.
In T-shirts reading "Americans for Rick Perry,'' they buttonholed the largely male crowd, who had come to inspect the wares of companies like Controlled Chaos Arms and to test-fire a 50-caliber assault rifle, its shell - one to a customer, please - as big around as an Iowa corncob. 
The month-old group has a paid staff of eight in Iowa and raised about $400,000, it says, to lay the groundwork if Mr. Perry, the Texas governor, decides to run in the Republican primary, as seems increasingly likely. 
His entry could dramatically shake up the field, siphoning Tea Party support from Michele Bachmann as well as mainstream Republicans who back Mitt Romney. 
In polls last week, Mr. Perry was near the top with Republicans and independents who lean Republican. 
But a Perry candidacy suffered a setback Saturday when the Iowa Republican Party, after a public debate, excluded him from ts closely followed straw poll next month in Ames. Mr. Perry, along with Sarah Palin, were kept off the ballot on grounds they had not yet declared their candidacies, even as the party central committee added three candidates who have said they would not compete in the poll -- Mitt Romney, Jon Hunstman and Newt Gingrich -- to the six others who earlier paid to participate. 
One committee member, according to The Des Moines Register, argued against including what-if candidates promoted by "a shady 527 group,'' a reference to Americans for Rick Perry. That group is set up under election laws allowing it to take unlimited donations, but barring it from direct ties with Mr. Perry. Its founder, Bob Schuman, a political consultant in San Diego, said he has never met the Texas governor nor spoken with his strategists. 
He said the average donation to his group was $7,000 to $8,000, with several people giving "tens of thousands'' of dollars. This week the group begins seeking small donations with a mass e-mailing in Texas. "In terms of the people contacting us, there is a big populist appeal for Perry,'' Mr. Schuman said. 
But the group is not exactly a grass-roots outfit. Its Iowa director, Craig Schoenfeld, and most of the other paid staff worked similar jobs for Mr. Gingrich before resigning en masse from his campaign last month.
Excluded from the straw poll on Aug. 13, which is a test of organizational strength in Iowa, the Perry group has shifted strategy. "If there's Iowans gathered some place and they're Republicans, we're talking about Rick Perry,'' Mr. Schoenfeld said. 
At the Second Amendment Rally here in central Iowa, Patrick McCormick added his name to about 75 others to receive information. "I like Rick Perry,'' said Mr. McCormick, a truck driver, adding he is still mulling his choices. "I really like Herman Cain. And I'm interested in Tim Pawlenty.''
A staffer asked a passerby, "Do you know much about Rick Perry?
"Only what I hear on TV,'' said James Williams, a retired Air Force officer.
"He's the Texas governor,'' said the staff member. "He's got a great record on Second Amendment rights. He's even better on the economy.''
They were cut off by another of the speeches by politicians supporting gun rights, who included Mr. Pawlenty. "I'm going to warn you to keep your speeches short,'' an announcer had said earlier, introducing the lineup of speakers. "There's a lot of armed people here."

HEADLINE: Deep Below Park Avenue, A Monster At Rest

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
Rome has the catacombs; Paris has its sewers. Now New York will have its own subterranean wonder: a 200-ton mechanical serpent's head.
It is a gargantuan drill that has been hollowing out tunnels for a train station under Grand Central Terminal. As tall as four men and with the weight of two whales, the so-called cutter head -- the spinning, sharp-edged business end of a tunnel boring machine -- is usually extracted, dismantled and sold for scrap when the work is done.
But the Spanish contractor overseeing the project is taking a different approach. It believes it can save time and money by simply leaving it behind, dormant and decayed, within the rocky depths of Midtown Manhattan. The drill's final resting place: 14 stories beneath the well-tended sidewalks of Park Avenue. 
There is little precedent for such a Brobdingnagian burial. No one at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which plans to officially entomb the machine sometime this week, can recall such an interment. ''It's like a Jules Verne story,'' Michael Horodniceanu, the authority's chief of construction, said.
A recent visit to the cutter's future crypt revealed a machine that evokes an alien life form that crashed to earth a millennia ago. Its steel gears, bolts and pistons, already oxidizing, appeared lifeless and fatigued. A wormlike fan, its exhaust pipe disappearing into the cutter's maw, was still spinning, its drone not unlike a slumbering creature's breath.
''If you came and visited this 100 years from today, this is what you'd see,'' said Dr. Horodniceanu, balancing on a catwalk that overlooks the enormous contraption. ''People would not know what it's all about.''
The cutter head, known as Seli after its Italian manufacturer, has been eating its way through several miles of Manhattan schist since 2007. Its flat face is equipped with 45 rotating discs, each carrying a layer of tungsten carbide, an exceptionally strong alloy that can easily break through the city's bedrock. (Rumors that the machine used diamonds for this purpose were ''an urban legend,'' according to a transportation authority spokesman.)
Starting in 2016, the 22-foot-diameter tunnels created by the cutter will carry thousands of Long Islanders into a station beneath Grand Central Terminal. Today, the passages are craggy and unfinished, suggesting the ominous, organic look of a monster's cave.
Seli cost $6 million to $8 million, but Dragados, the project's chief contractor and operator of the machine, decided this year that a scrap sale would not be economical. It can take months to dismantle a cutter, and the parts would have to be hauled from Midtown to the tunnel's other end in Sunnyside, Queens. The removal would delay further construction, potentially costing millions of dollars in additional wages.
''It costs, in effect, $100,000 a day just to be there -- to say, 'Hello!' '' Dr. Horodniceanu said. ''A machine like this, they want to spend $9 million pulling it out? You must be kidding me. It's not happening.''
Burial is more common for cutters in international tunneling projects. But the approach has rarely been tried in New York, whose crowded underground does not often have room.
The new Second Avenue subway line ends at the 63rd Street F train station, not an ideal cemetery plot. On the No. 7 line, which is being extended to the Far West Side, the burial would have to take place beneath the Port Authority Bus Terminal, ''and you can't bury it in the Port Authority, very simply put,'' Dr. Horodniceanu said.
But the grassy Park Avenue median, between 37th and 38th Streets, did not pose a problem. And extracting the cutter from that location was out of the question. ''There would had to have been a 40-foot-diameter shaft right in Park Avenue, in front of the Union League Club, to pull it out,'' said Mark Rhodes, an engineer on the project.
That image prompted Dr. Horodniceanu to laugh. ''As it is, we don't have many friends,'' he said, shaking his head.
A man who answered the phone at the Union League Club said the organization would not comment about the clubhouse's new underground neighbor. But he conceded that the members were ''painfully aware'' of the construction occurring 140 feet beneath their gilded lobby.
In an official ceremony this week, the cutter will be sealed off by a concrete wall; the chamber will then be filled with concrete, encasing the cutter in a solid cast, Han Solo-style, so that it can serve as a support structure for the tunnel. A plaque will commemorate the site. A spokesman said the pouring of the concrete was expected to take place on Wednesday.
One might wonder what future generations will think if and when the cutter is ever dug up. In ''Beneath the Planet of the Apes,'' an astronaut discovers the ruins of the Queensboro Plaza subway station, colorful tiles still intact. (Queensboro Plaza is an elevated station, but the film does get credit for trying.) In that instance, the discovery prompted the horrifying revelation that Earth was destroyed in a nuclear holocaust and is now overrun by a race of intelligent apes.
Dr. Horodniceanu did not quite envision that same situation for Seli.
''People will find it, and they will find it exciting to see it, if they ever unearth it,'' he said. ''Who knows? Maybe they will want to continue the railroad south, at which point they would have to take it out.''
Dr. Horodniceanu pondered that a moment: ''Not an easy thing if they want to take it out.'' He shrugged. ''If they want to take it out, they will not look upon us favorably that we left it behind.''

HEADLINE: The Unluck of the Irish in Love, Soccer and Business

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
What the Chicago Cubs are to baseball, Ireland is to the global economy.
That is one of the central themes in ''The Parting Glass,'' a one-man show about perpetual underdogs, at the Barrow Street Theater, produced by axis, an arts center in Dublin. For generations the Irish have been promised the possibility of economic and political rebirth only to have their hearts -- and wallets -- destroyed. 
In the Irish novelist Dermot Bolger's 1990 play ''In High Germany'' a young Irishman named Eoin tries to break this cycle of disillusionment and reillusionment by leaving the Emerald Isle for the (even) greener pastures of Hamburg. In Mr. Bolger's new play, a stand-alone sequel, Eoin returns home when the Celtic Tiger finally begins to roar.
Eoin (Ray Yeates) recounts the hard luck of the Irish through the lenses of three alternating autobiographies: his economic life, his love life and the last -- and most enchanting of the three -- his sporting life.
The Ireland he returns to is shiny and skyscrapered and embarrassingly rich, a land where a credit bubble has led not only to hope but also to hubris. ''We're so successful,'' one character says, ''we should license the franchise to be Irish.''
Of course that Celtic Tiger soon reveals itself to be a paper tiger, and Eoin and his countrymen lose everything in the financial crisis.
The second arc, Eoin's love life, is a maudlin tale of a lost soul mate. The more electrifying love affair is the one between Eoin and an underdog sports team. Not the Cubs, perhaps, but their Gaelic brethren: Ireland's national soccer team.
In this third story line the same dopey hopefulness that fuels the Irish economic bubble inflates its soccer fans as well, and Mr. Yeates's histrionic cheerleading is inspired. The play's rousing climax -- at the playoffs for the 2010 World Cup -- will make even the most devoted theater lover wish that she followed sports.
The manufactured motivational speech that concludes the play, however, feels unworthy of the trancelike poetry of that glorious soccer scene. Eoin, lovable loser that he is, deserves a more winning send-off.
''The Parting Glass'' continues through Sunday at the Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village; (212) 868-4444, barrowstreettheatre.com.

HEADLINE: Killings Spotlight Anti-Muslim Thought in U.S.

BYLINE: By SCOTT SHANE

 BODY:
The man accused of the killing spree in Norway was deeply influenced by a small group of American bloggers and writers who have warned for years about the threat from Islam, lacing his 1,500-page manifesto with quotations from them, as well as copying multiple passages from the tract of the Unabomber.
In the document he posted online, Anders Behring Breivik, who is accused of bombing government buildings and killing scores of young people at a Labor Party camp, showed that he had closely followed the acrimonious American debate over Islam.
His manifesto, which denounced Norwegian politicians as failing to defend the country from Islamic influence, quoted Robert Spencer, who operates the Jihad Watch Web site, 64 times, and cited other Western writers who shared his view that Muslim immigrants pose a grave danger to Western culture. 
More broadly, the mass killings in Norway, with their echo of the 1995 bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City by an antigovernment militant, have focused new attention around the world on the subculture of anti-Muslim bloggers and right-wing activists and renewed a debate over the focus of counterterrorism efforts.
In the United States, critics have asserted that the intense spotlight on the threat from Islamic militants has unfairly vilified Muslim Americans while dangerously playing down the threat of attacks from other domestic radicals. The author of a 2009 Department of Homeland Security report on right-wing extremism withdrawn by the department after criticism from conservatives repeated on Sunday his claim that the department had tilted too heavily toward the threat from Islamic militants.
The revelations about Mr. Breivik's American influences exploded on the blogs over the weekend, putting Mr. Spencer and other self-described ''counterjihad'' activists on the defensive, as their critics suggested that their portrayal of Islam as a threat to the West indirectly fostered the crimes in Norway.
Mr. Spencer wrote on his Web site, jihadwatch.org, that ''the blame game'' had begun, ''as if killing a lot of children aids the defense against the global jihad and Islamic supremacism, or has anything remotely to do with anything we have ever advocated.'' He did not mention Mr. Breivik's voluminous quotations from his writings.
The Gates of Vienna, a blog that ordinarily keeps up a drumbeat of anti-Islamist news and commentary, closed its pages to comments Sunday ''due to the unusual situation in which it has recently found itself.''
Its operator, who describes himself as a Virginia consultant and uses the pseudonym ''Baron Bodissey,'' wrote on the site Sunday that ''at no time has any part of the Counterjihad advocated violence.''
The name of that Web site -- a reference to the siege of Vienna in 1683 by Muslim fighters who, the blog says in its headnote, ''seemed poised to overrun Christian Europe'' -- was echoed in the title Mr. Breivik chose for his manifesto: ''2083: A European Declaration of Independence.'' He chose that year, the 400th anniversary of the siege, as the target for the triumph of Christian forces in the European civil war he called for to drive out Islamic influence.
Marc Sageman, a former C.I.A. officer and a consultant on terrorism, said it would be unfair to attribute Mr. Breivik's violence to the writers who helped shape his world view. But at the same time, he said the counterjihad writers do argue that the fundamentalist Salafi branch of Islam ''is the infrastructure from which Al Qaeda emerged. Well, they and their writings are the infrastructure from which Breivik emerged.''
''This rhetoric,'' he added, ''is not cost-free.''
Dr. Sageman, who is also a forensic psychiatrist, said he saw no overt signs of mental illness in Mr. Breivik's writings. He said Mr. Breivik bears some resemblance to Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber, who also spent years on a manifesto and carried out his mail bombings in part to gain attention for his theories. One obvious difference, Dr. Sageman said, is that Mr. Kaczynski was a loner who spent years in a rustic Montana cabin, while Mr. Breivik appears to have been quite social.
Mr. Breivik's declaration did not name Mr. Kaczynski or acknowledge the numerous passages copied from the Unabomber's 1995 manifesto, in which the Norwegian substituted ''multiculturalists'' or ''cultural Marxists'' for Mr. Kaczynski's ''leftists'' and made other small wording changes.
By contrast, he quoted the American and European counterjihad writers by name, notably Mr. Spencer, author of 10 books, including ''Islam Unveiled'' and ''The Truth About Muhammad.''
Mr. Breivik frequently cited another blog, Atlas Shrugs, and recommended the Gates of Vienna among Web sites. Pamela Geller, an outspoken critic of Islam who runs Atlas Shrugs, wrote on her blog Sunday that any assertion that she or other antijihad writers bore any responsibility for Mr. Breivik's actions was ''ridiculous.''
''If anyone incited him to violence, it was Islamic supremacists,'' she wrote.
Mr. Breivik also quoted European blogs and writers with similar themes, notably a Norwegian blogger who writes under the name ''Fjordman.'' Immigration from Muslim countries to Scandinavia and the rest of Europe has set off a deep political debate across the continent and strengthened a number of right-wing anti-immigrant parties.
In the United States, the shootings resonated with years of debate at home over the proper focus of counterterrorism.
Despite the Norway killings, Representative Peter T. King, the New York Republican who is chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said he had no plans to broaden contentious hearings about the radicalization of Muslim Americans and would hold the third one as planned on Wednesday. He said his committee focused on terrorist threats with foreign ties and suggested that the Judiciary Committee might be more appropriate for looking at non-Muslim threats.
In 2009, when the Department of Homeland Security produced a report, ''Rightwing Extremism,'' suggesting that the recession and the election of an African-American president might increase the threat from white supremacists, conservatives in Congress strongly objected. Janet Napolitano, the homeland security secretary, quickly withdrew the report and apologized for what she said were its flaws.
Daryl Johnson, the Department of Homeland Security analyst who was the primary author of the report, said in an interview that after he left the department in 2010, the number of analysts assigned to non-Islamic militancy of all kinds was reduced to two from six. Mr. Johnson, who now runs a private research firm on the domestic terrorist threat, DTAnalytics, said about 30 analysts worked on Islamic radicalism when he was there.
The killings in Norway ''could easily happen here,'' he said. The Hutaree, an extremist Christian militia in Michigan accused last year of plotting to kill police officers and planting bombs at their funerals, had an arsenal of weapons larger than all the Muslim plotters charged in the United States since the Sept. 11 attacks combined, he said.
Homeland Security officials disputed Mr. Johnson's claim about staffing, saying they pay close attention to all threats, regardless of ideology. And the F.B.I. infiltrated the Hutaree, making arrests before any attack could take place.
John D. Cohen, principal deputy counterterrorism coordinator at the Department of Homeland Security, said Ms. Napolitano, who visited Oklahoma City last year for the 15th anniversary of the bombing there, had often spoken of the need to assess the risk of violence without regard to politics or religion.
''What happened in Norway,'' Mr. Cohen said, ''is a dramatic reminder that in trying to prevent attacks, we cannot focus on a single ideology.''

HEADLINE: The Signs of a Bubble, Sensed Again

BYLINE: By CLAIRE CAIN MILLER

 BODY:
ASPEN, Colo. -- Frank P. Quattrone is the banker who helped set off the dot-com boom when he took Netscape public in 1995. Today he is having flashbacks. 
Answering the question on the tip of everyone's tongues in the tech world -- is there a bubble? -- he said that current times remind him not of the height of the last bubble but of the early days of the boom.
''It really feels to me more like 1995, which is the beginning of a new era of I.P.O.'s,'' he said at Fortune's conference here. ''The new era is called social, local, mobile, real-time.''
Shares of Web companies that have recently gone public, from LinkedIn in May to Zillow on Wednesday, have surged in the first day of trading, reminiscent of the dot-com bubble. But Mr. Quattrone said that is probably because so many investors want to invest in social networking companies, just as Netscape attracted investors desperate to own shares in a Web company. It was not until four or five years later than investors started speculating and the bubble peaked, he said.
''If people wanted to invest in Web, that was the only stock they could do it, so Netscape's market value was higher than it probably should have been, and people could probably say the same thing about LinkedIn today,'' Mr. Quattrone said. ''LinkedIn is the Netscape of its era.''
Mr. Quattrone, a star investment banker of the dot-com era who was sidelined for four years as he fought and beat obstruction of justice charges, is staying out of I.P.O.'s this time around. His young investment banking firm, Qatalyst Partners, advises big and small companies on acquisitions and other business matters.
He has quietly been involved in many recent deals, including the sale of National Semiconductor to Texas Instruments for $6.5 billion, the sale of PopCap to Electronic Arts for $750 million and the sale of Zong to eBay for $240 million.
One sign that we might be approaching another bubble: if companies start manufacturing new metrics to replace profits, like ''a multiple of engineers,'' he said. ''When you see stuff like that happen, it's time to put a big short on the market.''
Some companies in the local business are asking investors to trust that they can grow based on success in one city. ''A lot of cohort analysis has crept in,'' he said. But over all, he is not worried. ''It all comes down to good old free cash flow, and I think that's just healthy,'' he said.
One company that is not yet profitable in which Mr. Quattrone has faith: Twitter. He doubted its usefulness at first, he said, but was convinced when his daughter was in New Zealand when an earthquake hit and Twitter gave him information quicker than any other Web site.
''Twitter has a several-hour advantage in getting information,'' Mr. Quattrone said. ''I don't follow any particular periodical anymore. I use Twitter as my customized news feed.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: To Reach Simple Life of Summer Camp, Lining Up for Private Jets

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY; Polly Saltonstall contributed reporting from Maine.

 BODY:
Gov. Paul LePage of Maine happened to be waiting for his flight at Augusta State Airport on a recent Saturday when the weekend crush began.
A turboprop Pilatus PC-12 carrying Melissa Thomas, her daughter, her daughter's friend and a pile of lacrosse equipment took off for their home in Connecticut, following the girls' three-week stay at Camp All-Star in nearby Kents Hill, Me. Shortly after, a Cessna Citation Excel arrived, and a mother, a father and their 13-year-old daughter emerged carrying a pink sleeping bag and two large duffel bags, all headed to Camp Vega in Fayette.
''Love it, love it, love it,'' Mr. LePage said of the private-plane traffic generated by summer camps. ''I wish they'd stay a week while they're here. This is a big business.'' 
For decades, parents in the Northeast who sent their children to summer camp faced the same arduous logistics of traveling long distances to remote towns in Maine, New Hampshire and upstate New York to pick up their children or to attend parents' visiting day.
Now, even as the economy limps along, more of the nation's wealthier families are cutting out the car ride and chartering planes to fly to summer camps. One private jet broker, Todd Rome of Blue Star Jets, said his summer-camp business had jumped 30 percent over the last year.
This weekend, a popular choice for visiting day at camps, private planes jammed the runways at small rural airports.
Officials at the airport in Augusta said 51 private planes arrived between Thursday and Saturday; on a normal day, they would expect just a few. The airport was so busy that one of its two public runways was closed so all the incoming planes would have someplace to park, said Dale Kilmer, operations manager for Maine Instrument Flight, which operates the airport.
''We have 50 to 60 jets up here in just that one day,'' Mr. Kilmer said. ''It's a madhouse because they all leave at the same time, between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m.''
At Sullivan County Airport in Bethel, N.Y., roughly 40 percent of recent flights have carried families heading to summer camp. Officials at Laconia Municipal Airport in Gilford, N.H., and Moultonborough Airport in Moultonborough, N.H., reported similar numbers.
At Robert Lafleur Airport in Waterville, which is close to many of the private camps in the Belgrade Lake region of Maine, the assistant manager, Randy Marshall, brought on two extra people to help handle the traffic last weekend.
In Augusta, Mr. Kilmer usually creates a temporary lounge on parents' weekend for the pilots and flight attendants who must wait for their clients to return from their children's camps, so that they can depart later that afternoon. He has already received catering orders for return flights, which include fruit and sandwich trays for adults and sandwich boxes for younger siblings. One flier has already requested a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, a fruit cup with a single strawberry, a juice box, a banana and a cookie or brownie.
The popularity of private-plane travel is forcing many high-priced camps, where seven-week sessions can easily cost more than $10,000, to balance the habits of their parents against the ethos of simplicity the camps spend the summer promoting.
Kyle Courtiss, whose family runs Camp Vega in Maine, said that his staff was trained ''to be cognizant of stuff like that'' and that private planes were ''not what this camp is about.''
Some camps said they recognized that the parents who flew in private planes were often strong financial supporters of these camps. Arleen Shepherd, director of Camp Skylemar, in Naples, Me., said that while some of the high-profile parents whose children attend Skylemar might fly privately, some campers had never flown on a plane.
Private-plane companies and parents say these flights have also become more affordable to a broader base of fliers.
Parents said round-trip commercial flights from the New York area to Portland, Me., on peak weekends when they are allowed to visit could cost $500 to $600, even when bought well in advance. Mr. Rome, the Blue Star Jets president, said families could rent a seven-person turboprop planestarting at $3,800 for a round trip in one day, making the price competitive with some commercial flights.
''You don't have to be a millionaire to do it,'' Mr. Rome said.
Ms. Thomas, at the airport in Augusta, said the convenience of flying privately far outweighed the cost.
''I left my home at 6:45 this morning and I'll be home by noon; I'm turning this trip around in six hours,'' she said as she unloaded her daughter's bags from the back of her rented Crown Victoria sedan. ''Otherwise, it's a couple days' trip.''
The practice of flying charters to camps has become so prevalent that some parents have been known to try to hitch a ride -- even if they are reluctant to talk about it.
A woman whose two daughters attend Tripp Lake Camp in Poland, Me., said, ''A large part of the parents at my kid's camp own their own planes.'' She is scheduled to take a commercial flight to Portland for visiting days this weekend, but hopes to catch a private ride back.
But some parents have already tired of this private-plane status infiltrating the simpler world of summer camp. Nancy Chemtob, a divorce lawyer, made several summer trips to Maine in the past decade, where her children attended camp. She once managed to get on a charter plane from the airport in East Hampton, N.Y., for $750 (her husband had hung a sign in the airport seeking a ride). After listening to enough banter among parents about ''who is flying, who is flying private, who they can get a lift home with,'' she decided she ''was done with Maine and the planes and all of the people.''
''It's a crazy world out there,'' she added. She now sends her children to camp in Europe.

HEADLINE: Red Lobster Campaign to Showcase Some of Its Own Workers

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
FORGET those ''real housewives.'' How about some real fishermen of Alaska? Or a real grill master of Bronx County?
That is the premise of a campaign for the Red Lobster chain of seafood restaurants, scheduled to begin on Monday. The theme of the campaign, ''Sea food differently,'' is new, replacing ''Ignite the crave'' (whatever that meant).
The approach of the campaign is new, too, focused on the workers who help bring Red Lobster's fare to its customers. The initial two commercials -- as well as content on substantially redesigned versions of the Red Lobster Web site, redlobster.com, and Facebook fan page, facebook.com/RedLobster -- feature Jon Forsythe, who fishes for crabs in Alaska, and Charles Himple, who presides over the oak-wood grill at the Red Lobster restaurant in the Bronx. 
Among those to appear in subsequent ads is Annie Sessler, who designed the artwork for Red Lobster's menus.
The campaign will also significantly increase the Red Lobster presence in social media like Facebook and YouTube. The campaign is created for Red Lobster, a division of Darden Restaurants, by Grey New York, part of the Grey unit of the Grey Group, which is owned by WPP. The budget is being estimated at $110 million to $115 million.
The campaign is among several under way that seek to burnish brand images by using actual employees rather than actors. For instance, in new commercials for Perdue Farms, the chairman, Jim Perdue, is joined by workers, including the chief veterinarian, and a farm family that raises chickens for Perdue.
The strategy behind using so-called real people is to cater to consumers who ''want to know a lot more about the company behind the product,'' said John Bartelme, chief marketing officer at Perdue Farms. They are interested in brands they perceive to be authentic or genuine, with a history and track record, rather than the spawn of slick corporate marketing.
Red Lobster ''is a great brand with a great heritage, a place where America goes for seafood'' since 1968, said Salli Setta, executive vice president for marketing at Red Lobster in Orlando, Fla.
''We have a unique story to tell and that story is best told through our people,'' she added. ''We think of them as 'the real people of Red Lobster.' ''
The story the workers are to tell will include chapters about new fare like wood-fire grilled dishes and a ''today's fresh fish menu''; remodeling the restaurants with a New England motif; and a new logo that proclaims ''Fresh Fish, Live Lobster.''
Ms. Setta said she did not believe the proliferation of real-people ads would dent the effectiveness of her campaign because ''so much of the interaction'' that consumers have with the Red Lobster brand ''occurs with our people at the restaurants.''
In focus groups, consumers who saw the campaign ''related to the stories, related to the real people,'' she added.
In turning to workers to be the mainstay of its ads, Red Lobster is playing down an approach for which it has long been known: commercials celebrating lavishly photographed food. Some spots still include such beauty shots, only now pairing them with workers like Mr. Forsythe and Mr. Himple.
That shift, along with the theme ''Sea food differently,'' are meant to ''force reappraisal'' of Red Lobster among potential customers, said Tor Myhren, president and chief creative officer at Grey New York, by signaling that ''there's change in the air, a different Red Lobster than you think you know.''
Because some consumers had developed ''a sense'' that Red Lobster ''was becoming less authentic,'' he added, the campaign is intended to ''prove that authenticity by showing the real people, the real places, with real dialogue that is not scripted.''
Using workers for that purpose is not ''an entirely new concept,'' Mr. Myhren acknowledged, but ''we hope the way we execute it'' will help the ads stand out.
A sibling of Red Lobster's in the Darden family, Olive Garden, recently had problems with consumer perceptions of the authenticity of new menu items bearing coined names like pastachetti and soffatelli. After sales suffered, the dishes were replaced with more familiar fare.
The new Red Lobster campaign arrives amid continuing uncertainty over the course of the economy. It has been challenging for casual-dining chains like Red Lobster to attract customers as worried consumers trade down to cheaper places to eat out -- or even eat more often at home.
To address the reality of ''somewhat of a rattled consumer,'' Ms. Setta said, Red Lobster is looking to its roots as a restaurant that ''delivered seafood to everyday people at an affordable price.''
''We have to deliver superior value to our guests,'' she added, which is conveyed in ads that will ''talk openly about prices, to reassure guests that when they come to Red Lobster they can afford the food.''
Red Lobster spent $38.2 million on advertising in major media in the first quarter, according to the Kantar Media unit of WPP, compared with $37.2 million in the same period last year.
In addition to Grey New York, the creative agency of record for television and digital ads, Red Lobster is working with Starcom, a media agency that is part of the Starcom MediaVest Group unit of the Publicis Groupe.
Among the nontraditional aspects of the campaign will be a 90-second version of the commercial with Mr. Forsythe, to run during ''Deadliest Catch -- Behind the Scenes'' on Tuesday on the Discovery cable channel.
And ''we do plan to explore'' starting a feed on Twitter, Ms. Setta said, as part of the efforts to expand Red Lobster's presence in social media.

HEADLINE: At Microsoft, Bing Too Costly to Keep

BYLINE: By ROBERT CYRAN and MARTIN HUTCHINSON

 BODY:
Microsoft needs to concentrate on a different kind of search: finding a buyer for Bing, its online search business. Bing is the industry's distant No. 2 after Google. It has become a distraction for the software giant -- one that costs shareholders dearly. The division that houses Bing lost $2.6 billion in the latest fiscal year. Facebook, or even Apple, might make a better home for Bing. A sale would be a boon for Microsoft's investors.
Microsoft has been pouring money into Bing. The company thinks search makes its offerings in everything from mobile phones to business software more compelling. Perhaps, but there is little evidence to date. And Bing and sites it powers like Yahoo still control only about 27 percent of the United States market; Google has more than twice as much. 
Advertisers do not want a monopoly in search, which should assure Bing of future revenue. And Google may be partly hamstrung as a competitor by antitrust inquiries worldwide. But the business has more value to a buyer that could bring it traffic.
How much? Microsoft's online services unit, of which Bing is the main component, had $2.5 billion of sales in the year that ended June 30. Google is valued at about six times sales. At a 25 percent discount to Google, the unit would be worth about $11 billion.
Moreover, there are potential buyers. Facebook already works with Bing. It might be interested in buying the site, keeping more traffic onsite, and perhaps using its data to better tweak search results. That would be a potent weapon in its fight with Google, which recently introduced a rival social network, Google+. Apple might even be interested, given its growing online ambitions, evidenced by its consideration of a bid for Hulu.
In a deal, Microsoft could either get paper in a highly coveted company or cash, which Microsoft, to its credit, has been good about returning to shareholders. Equally, it could buy back stock, as the company trades at nine times estimated earnings, almost a 20 percent discount to the Standard & Poor's 500-stock average.
On top of any proceeds a sale would bring, it would stanch losses like last year's $2.6 billion. Without that, Microsoft would have made 10 percent more profit. That is something that should excite even jaded Microsoft investors.
Rethinking Debt
Standard & Poor's could choose to cut America's AAA rating even if Congress does a debt ceiling deal. That would force a rethink. The 18 other top-rated sovereigns are either caught up in the European mess or are tiny. Without the ''risk-free'' benchmark of Treasuries, even ultracautious bond investors would have to get used to credit risk.
America's $7.8 trillion of Treasury bonds, notes and inflation-protected securities, together with more than $5 trillion of federal housing agency paper and the debt of several insurers, would all be affected if America's rating slipped to AA, according to S.&P.
For bond investors fixated on AAA credits, there is not much capacity elsewhere to pick up the slack. Other top-rated sovereign entities include the Isle of Man, Guernsey and Liechtenstein, which are tiny. Even the largest of them, Germany, has only 2 trillion euros ($2.9 trillion) of public debt outstanding. Moreover, six of the entities are euro zone members, and several others are closely connected to the European Union's debt troubles. Only Australia, Canada, Norway, Singapore and Switzerland hold top ratings without such blemishes, but all five have relatively small amounts of debt.
Top-rated companies do exist, but in the United States there are only four of them. That is nowhere near enough to absorb investor demand -- even assuming that buyers could get used to relying on corporate, rather than government, credit.
Money market funds, obliged to hold almost all their assets in AAA credits, might be spared a huge sell-off in a downgrade because their rules refer to short-term ratings, and S.& P.'s threat might only apply longer term. For other investors, adjusting portfolio holdings, and even their guiding rules, to include the United States and other AA-rated names should require only modest changes, though banks and some insurers might have to raise capital. And the United States government bond market would still be there, even if interest-rate comparisons with Treasury yields would have to contemplate negative numbers as well as positive.
The biggest impact could be psychological: there would no longer be a globally accepted liquid benchmark viewed as ''risk-free.'' Fifty years of thinking, and computer models, would need tweaking.

HEADLINE: Consumers vs. the Banks: Without more White House support, the new consumer protection agency could founder

 BODY:
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau officially opened its doors last week a year after it was established under the financial reform law. Score one for consumers. But the fight to create a bureau strong enough and independent enough to really take on the banks isn't over. 
Federal watchdogs have given the bureau stellar marks for getting up and running in a timely, professional manner. The bureau has already begun to tackle crucial issues, like simplifying mortgage disclosure requirements and handling credit card complaints.
Banks and their Congressional allies are pushing back hard, determined to weaken the bureau. It is not clear how much political capital President Obama is willing to spend to stop that from happening.
It is important to recall why the bureau is so necessary. The financial crisis had its roots in dangerous, unregulated loans that inflated a credit bubble. When that burst, tens of millions of Americans lost their jobs, savings and home equity; millions lost their homes; and everyone lost trust in financial and government institutions.
The new bureau concentrates consumer protection in one agency, with the sole purpose of shielding Americans, and the financial system, from abusive and deceptive lending in mortgages, credit cards and other borrowing.
The banks -- big campaign contributors -- don't want robust consumer protection because complex and obscure products are lucrative. House Republicans have begun to pass bills that would severely constrain the bureau's power to write and enforce rules and reduce and imperil its budget. Mr. Obama has pledged to veto the bills if they reach his desk, but that won't stop the assaults. Under the law, the bureau cannot exercise its full regulatory powers without a director. In May, 44 Republican senators vowed to block any nominee unless Democrats agreed to weaken the agency as called for in the House bills.
Last week, when President Obama nominated Richard Cordray, the former attorney general of Ohio and currently chief of enforcement at the bureau, Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama, the top Republican on the banking committee, wrote in The Wall Street Journal that the nomination was ''dead on arrival.'' Acting as if Dodd-Frank is not already the law of the land, he called on President Obama to ''come to the negotiating table.''
Mr. Obama erred in passing over Elizabeth Warren -- the Harvard law professor and consumer advocate who set up the bureau -- for the director's job. Mr. Cordray is a good choice, with a notable pro-consumer track record. Ms. Warren, who pioneered the idea for the bureau and helped push it through Congress, has drawn particular fire from banks and Republicans, who had turned their opposition to consumer protection into opposition to her.
In deciding not to fight for Ms. Warren, the president has forfeited the opportunity to stand up to the banks and to highlight their relentless efforts to undermine reform. It is hard not to think that Mr. Obama was worried that choosing Ms. Warren would have cost him and Democratic senators campaign contributions from the banks.
Mr. Cordray has the credentials and skills for the job. To win confirmation and, from there, to take on the banks and fully defend consumers, he will also need strong support from the White House. President Obama's decision to jettison Ms. Warren is not a reassuring sign.

HEADLINE: With Washington at Impasse, Worry Over Investor Reaction

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY and DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI; Bettina Wassener contributed reporting.

 BODY:
As Congress and President Obama failed yet again to break their stalemate over the debt limit, Wall Street and Washington turned their attention to a critical question: How long will investors give them?
''We may have a few stressful days coming up -- stressful for the markets of the world and the American people,'' William M. Daley, the chief of staff for Mr. Obama, said on CBS's ''Face the Nation'' Sunday morning.
Early reaction to the gridlock indicated worries in global markets, with the dollar losing ground to an index of currencies, United States stocks futures declining and gold, deemed a safe investment during times of uncertainty, rising.
For weeks, the market for United States Treasuries -- long considered the world's ultimate safe haven -- has held relatively steady. 
''It wouldn't be surprising to see a little bit of global reaction to the fact that there's no sign of an agreement. A sell-off of maybe 1 to 2 percent,'' said Fred H. Dickson, chief investment strategist at the Davidson Companies, a brokerage and money management firm in Montana.
It is too soon to know how the stalled progress will play out in the markets all week and whether selling might be even greater.
The Treasury Department has said that the government must reach a deal by Aug. 2 or risk being unable to temporarily meet all its obligations like interest payments on debt, Social Security or paychecks to federal workers.
Few investors believe the United States will renege on its debt. Analysts point out that the government has neared the brink on reaching crucial financial agreements in the past without marketwide collapse. Still, the greatest anxiety in the markets is that investors will lose confidence in Treasuries and move toward selling them, which would drive their values down and their rates up.
John Canavan, a market analyst at Stone & McCarthy Research, a research firm in Princeton, N.J., said that he thinks investors might sell some United States bonds to buy German bonds, or assets in Asia and emerging markets. Foreign investors, he noted, own a far greater share of United States debt than was the case several decades ago.
''They don't hold them because they have any patriotism or anything else and they're going to be quick to unload them if they feel there is danger to hold them,'' Mr. Canavan said.
Mr. Canavan did not miss a beat when asked when investors would become more nervous. ''Now,'' he said. ''There has been this expectation that at some point, they'd come up with a deal, but given the failure this weekend, I think market confidence is eroding.''
The initial reaction in Asian markets was muted. The Nikkei 225 was down about 0.6 percent in midday trading, while the S.& P./ASX 200 index in Australia fell 1.3 percent. Gold rose again to about $1,612 an ounce by midday in Asia. Futures for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index were down about 1 percent.
It is often difficult to contemporaneously pinpoint when a panic begins. The financial crisis of 2008, for instance, is often dated to the summer of 2007, but it did not result in full-fledged market chaos for more than a year. During that time, many government officials said the situation was under control.
The situation in the United States does carry some of the classic ingredients for flurries of selling, financial historians said. Panics sometimes occur when an asset that is considered perfectly safe comes into question. Other conditions for financial mayhem include excessive speculation in a sort of investment -- often one thought to be very safe -- and sometimes low interest rates.
Some financial historians also believe the markets have become more panic-prone than they once were, in part because of the mass of cash that has poured in recent decades into short-term investments like money market funds.
The current situation is unusual, though, in an important way, said David A. Moss, an economic policy professor at Harvard Business School. Treasuries, he said, are the typical safe haven during a panic, so people might not run away from them.
Mr. Moss said that the outcome could be that there is a ''mad rush'' out of Treasuries, or it also might be that ''people aren't sure what to do, so they just stay there.''
Treasuries have been at the center of panics in the United States before, though far earlier in American history. Richard Sylla, a finance professor at the Stern School of Business of New York University who has written about panics, pointed to 1792, when one Treasury trader ran into problems and sent the market into a spiral in which it lost 25 percent of its value.
About 100 years later, Congress had to call an emergency session because the Treasury was running out of gold reserves as foreign investors redeemed dollars for gold, Mr. Sylla said.
''Today we talk about what happens if the Chinese sell all the U.S. securities; in 1893, foreign investors were doing just that,'' Mr. Sylla said.
Mr. Sylla's initial assessment of the current situation was, ''They're playing with fire in Washington, D.C., right now.''
Or as the chief of fixed income at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, Kevin Flanagan, said: ''When you're a bond guy, the thought of default is like Kryptonite. It's a word you just don't want to hear.''
Still, perhaps because no one likes to talk in earnest about possible panics, Mr. Moss, Mr. Sylla and Mr. Flanagan said they did think a deal would be reached in Washington before Aug. 2. That would avoid even a technical default, which is a short-term, nonpermanent default that could occur if the government had to delay some payments temporarily while it wrapped up a budget deal.
In addition to watching market signals like interest rates on Treasuries, traders said they were eager to see whether the Treasury Department would announce on Monday that it will decrease the size of this week's auction of new Treasury securities. The department has been decreasing the size of its weekly auction over the last month, to give it more flexibility if the debt limit is not increased by next week.
Mr. Moss of the Harvard Business School said he did not think that many people were thinking that the nation might enter into an all-out default on its debt and refuse to pay it. But he said a panic could ''take on a life of its own'' if the Aug. 2 deadline passed, for instance, and if contracts that relied on securities had to be unwound.
When it comes to regular investors, David B. Armstrong, a financial adviser in the Washington area, is not seeing much panic. Of his 125 clients, two called him last week, but none called over the weekend.
''People don't seem to think that it will end in a default,'' said Mr. Armstrong, a managing director of Monument Wealth Management. ''Everybody's talking about it, but no one is panicking about it.''

HEADLINE: The 14th Amendment, the Debt Ceiling and a Way Out

BYLINE: By ADAM LIPTAK

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A few days ago, former President Bill Clinton identified a constitutional escape hatch should President Obama and Congress fail to come to terms on a deficit reduction plan before the government hits its borrowing ceiling.
He pointed to an obscure provision in the 14th Amendment, saying he would unilaterally invoke it ''without hesitation'' to raise the debt ceiling, ''and force the courts to stop me.''
On Friday, Mr. Obama rejected the idea, though not in categorical terms. 
''I have talked to my lawyers,'' Mr. Obama said. ''They are not persuaded that that is a winning argument.''
Adding another element of uncertainty, and possible court battles, to the debate do not seem to appeal to the White House. And it is, in any event, not clear that the nation's creditors would continue to lend money to the United States were the president to take unilateral action.
The provision in question, Section 4 of the amendment, was meant to ensure the payment of Union debts after the Civil War and to disavow Confederate ones. But it was written in broader terms.
''The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payments of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion,'' the critical sentence says, ''shall not be questioned.''
The Supreme Court has said in passing that those words have outlived the historical moment that gave rise to them.
''While this provision was undoubtedly inspired by the desire to put beyond question the obligations of the government issued during the Civil War,'' Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes wrote for the court in 1935, ''its language indicates a broader connotation.''
In recent weeks, law professors have been trying to puzzle out the meaning and relevance of the provision. Some have joined Mr. Clinton in saying it allows Mr. Obama to ignore the debt ceiling. Others say it applies only to Congress and only to outright default on existing debts. Still others say the president may do what he wants in an emergency, with or without the authority of the 14th Amendment.
The words of the provision are in important ways quite vague. ''Nobody would argue,'' said Sanford Levinson, a law professor at the University of Texas, ''that Section 4 is clear in its meaning, other than at the time everyone thought that the South, if they ever got back in control, would not pay Civil War debt.''
But Jack M. Balkin, a law professor at Yale, said it was possible to infer a broader principle.
''You're not supposed to hold the validity of the public debt hostage to achieve political ends,'' Mr. Balkin said. He added, though, that ''Section 4 is a fail-safe that only comes into operation when everything else is exhausted.''
Mr. Obama's statement largely dismissing the possibility of invoking the provision may have had a strategic element to it. A deficit reduction deal would seem to be more likely, after all, if both sides thought there was no alternative but economic chaos.
Mr. Obama's reference to ''a winning argument'' suggested the likelihood that the courts would weigh in if he took unilateral action. But that is not certain.
''This is not a circumstance,'' said Laurence H. Tribe, a law professor at Harvard, ''in which the courts have any plausible point of entry.''
Professor Balkin agreed. ''This is largely a political question,'' he said. ''It is unlikely courts would decide these questions.''
Some law professors have put forward possible legal claims that might overcome threshold requirements for lawsuits, like the one in which plaintiffs show that they have been directly injured and so have standing to sue. ''It's unthinkable,'' Professor Tribe responded, ''that the courts would allow a gimmicky lawsuit to proceed.''
The president, moreover, can move quickly, but court cases take time. ''At the point at which the economy is melting down, who cares what the Supreme Court is going to say?'' Professor Balkin said. ''It's the president's duty to save the Republic.''
Another possible reaction to unilateral action from Mr. Obama is impeachment. Professor Tribe said that was ''not politically a very plausible scenario.''
Professor Levinson was less certain. Impeachment by the House of Representatives ''seems to me quite likely.'' But, he added, ''it is also literally unimaginable that the Senate would convict.''
A third possible response is what some law professors call ''popular constitutionalism.'' The meaning of the Constitution, these professors say, is in the end what the public believes it to be. The president and members of Congress may thus pay a political price for taking stands at odds with what the public understands to be their constitutional obligations.

HEADLINE: Rival Debt Plans Being Assembled By Party Leaders

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER and HELENE COOPER; Jackie Calmes contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The House speaker, John A. Boehner, and the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, were preparing separate backup plans to raise the nation's debt ceiling on Sunday after they and the White House were unable to form a bipartisan plan that would end an increasingly grim standoff over the federal budget.
The dueling plans emerged after Mr. Boehner walked away from negotiations with the White House on Friday, leading to a frustrating weekend of talks in heat-scorched Washington. The leaders of both parties variously negotiated together over the phone, talked separately, conferred with their caucuses and tried to plot an end to the debt crisis that would assure the capital markets around the world that America would meet its debt obligations.
As the Aug. 2 deadline for lifting the debt ceiling nears, warnings are growing that the nation's economy may be damaged by the protracted stalemate. A downgrade of the nation's credit rating, which could raise the cost of borrowing, seemed more likely, deal or no deal. 
Mr. Reid, the Senate's top Democrat, was trying on Sunday to cobble together a plan to raise the government's debt limit by $2.4 trillion through the 2012 elections, with spending cuts of about $2.7 trillion that would not touch any of the entitlement programs that are dear to Democrats or raise taxes, which is anathema to Republicans.
President Obama could endorse such a plan, even though it would fall far short of the ambitious goal of deficit reduction and entitlement changes that he says are necessary to shore up the nation's finances.
At the White House on Sunday evening, Mr. Obama spent about an hour meeting in the Oval Office to try to hash out details of the Democratic proposal with Mr. Reid and the House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi. The two emerged from the meeting with nothing to say to the throngs of reporters who had been encamped there for the third consecutive weekend, awaiting an agreement on the debt ceiling.
But administration and Congressional officials said that during the meeting, Mr. Obama and the Democratic leaders had resolved to hold firm against any short-term agreement that did not raise the debt ceiling beyond next year's presidential elections.
''You see how hard this is right now,'' one administration official said Sunday night. ''Can you imagine going through this again in six months?''
That means, officials say, that Mr. Reid's proposal may gather steam as the only viable alternative that is palatable to the administration.
The contours of Mr. Boehner's backup plan were not entirely clear, but it seemed likely to take the form of a two-step process, with about $1 trillion in cuts, an amount the Republicans said was sufficient to clear the way for a debt limit increase through year's end. That would be followed by future cuts guided by a new legislative commission that would consider a broader range of trims, program overhauls and revenue increases.
''The preferable path would be a bipartisan plan that involves all the leaders, but it is too early to decide whether that's possible,'' Mr. Boehner said in a ''Fox News Sunday'' interview. ''If that's not possible, I and my Republican colleagues in the House are prepared to move on our own.''
In a conference call with Republican lawmakers that lasted over an hour on Sunday night, Mr. Boehner said he was seeking ''a vehicle that can pass in both houses,'' according to someone on the call, who added that Mr. Boehner had made an emotional appeal to his fellow Republicans to stick together. ''If we're divided,'' he said, ''our leverage gets minimized.''
One freshman lawmaker on the call described Mr. Boehner as sounding weary and said many Republicans were focused on some version of a balanced budget amendment, which was already passed by the House as part of broader legislation but then rejected by the Senate.
For the White House, the Reid proposal represents a Hail Mary pass that is meant to, at the very least, avoid putting the country through a repeat of the debt ceiling negotiations next year, an election year.
Even if Mr. Boehner loses Tea Party members and other conservative Republicans in Congress, the administration hope is that enough House Democrats would vote for the Senate plan that it would offset the loss of conservative Republican votes.
The White House remained largely on the sidelines over the weekend as lawmakers set out with their own plans. While the White House remains adamantly opposed to a two-step deal that does not extend the debt ceiling beyond next year's elections, administration officials expect that the Senate would modify Mr. Boehner's proposal.
While a modified plan might fail to gain the support of the more right-leaning and Tea Party-influenced House members, it could win enough Democratic votes to pass if it is blessed by Mr. Reid. However, if Mr. Boehner were to reject Senate modifications and go with a deal that would pass muster with his Republican conference, the Senate would have to offer a rebuttal, as the clock ticks.
The dueling plans were a departure from the so-called grand bargain that Mr. Obama had been pushing, which would have included trillions of dollars in budget and entitlement cuts over the next 10 years along with the elimination of tax loopholes and possibly the addition of new taxes.
The impasse has set the tone for the 2012 presidential race, with the debate growing rancorous and the two parties' visions for the country at odds.
The enormous deficit challenges have been clearly articulated to voters, as the parties seek unified control of Congress, where the Republicans are the majority in the House and the Democrats in the Senate. Mr. Obama will veto any debt legislation unless it extends the ability of the nation to borrow into 2013, the White House chief of staff, William M. Daley, said on Sunday.
Mr. Daley, appearing on the NBC News program ''Meet the Press,'' said that world markets and the American economy would not tolerate continued doubts brought on by periodic fights over the debt ceiling. ''The president believes that we must get this uncertainty out of the system,'' Mr. Daley said.
Minutes after Mr. Daley promised a veto, Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, said on the same program that Mr. Daley's remarks were ''a ridiculous position, because that's what he's going to get presented with.''
Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner suggested that there was still hope for a grand bargain.
''They are talking again,'' Mr. Geithner said in an appearance on ''This Week'' on ABC. ''They've been in touch throughout this time.''
Both Mr. Geithner and Mr. Daley said they believed Congress would figure out a way to avoid default.
''The leaders of Congress have said unequivocally that we will meet our obligations,'' Mr. Geithner said.
Mr. Daley acknowledged, however, that both sides were still at the brink.
''We are now getting to a point where markets around the world will question whether the political system can come together and compromise for the good of the country,'' Mr. Daley said.

HEADLINE: Working With New Script To Stop a Train Wreck

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The toughest legislative negotiations always resemble those old movies in which a terrified and helpless damsel lies bound to the railroad tracks.
At the last instant, a hero intervenes to stop the locomotive. It happened with tax reform in the 1980s, deficit reduction in the '90s, and the health care overhaul last year.
Odds remain good that because of the immense pressure for action on all involved, the pattern will repeat itself this week on raising the debt limit and averting a default by the United States government. But Washington's capacity to recreate that narrative arc faces an unusually demanding test. 
One set of reasons involves the continuing evolution of the American political culture in ways that make bipartisan compromise more difficult. In 2008, Barack Obama, as a presidential candidate, made changing that culture a signature objective; if anything, it has grown more dysfunctional during his presidency.
Another set involves specific near-term circumstances and the characters attempting to resolve the crisis.
The House speaker, John A. Boehner, has lived through many political storms during two decades in Congress. His relatively inexperienced leadership team, and the ideologically ardent freshmen in his caucus, have not.
President Obama has earned the gray spreading through his hair since reaching Washington in 2005. His chief of staff, William M. Daley, is in his seventh month on the job after a 10-year absence from Washington.
None of the institutional players hold power securely. The Democratic president, the Democratic Senate, the Republican House -- each could get tossed out in the 2012 elections.
As all three reach for a solution, their margin for error has grown very small.
Powerful Boundaries
What most complicates the chances for compromise is the broad political realignment that has played out over the decades since World War II. Once, partisan differences were blurred by intraparty factions in a Democratic caucus with Southern conservatives and a Republican caucus with Northern liberals.
Now, partisan and ideological boundaries are powerfully self-reinforcing -- a double-layered Great Wall of Division, buttressed by fund-raising patterns and gerrymandered House districts.
A National Journal analysis of voting patterns earlier this year showed the trend essentially perfected. The 2010 record of the most liberal Senate Republican lay to the right of the most conservative Senate Democrat.
The attitudes of average voters are not quite that polarized. But they are nearly so. The ascendant methods by which they receive political information -- cable television, the Internet, Twitter -- reinforce divisions.
In a crisis, skilled leadership and fortuitous circumstances can overcome them. That happened in the fall of 2008 when Congress passed the $700 billion Wall Street bailout.
The request then came from a Republican president, with strong free-market credentials, whose term was nearly over. Democrats controlled both chambers of Congress and were heading toward Election Day positioned to gain strength.
Even then, passage came only after one market-rattling floor defeat. This time, the pro-bailout votes cast by many incumbents make them doubly gun-shy about supporting a debt limit increase.
Senate Democrats, with at least 10 incumbent seats in jeopardy, could easily lose their majority next year. House Republicans could lose theirs too; after taking a big risk by overhauling Medicare in their budget plan, they have doubled their bet on the debt limit.
Another Wild Card
Mr. Obama, too, is vulnerable. He hopes to repeat the deftness that President Bill Clinton displayed in facing down the speaker then, Newt Gingrich, and securing a second term in 1996.
Mr. Clinton benefited from the prior Congressional experience of Leon E. Panetta, who was his White House chief of staff and is now Mr. Obama's defense secretary. At the moment, some senior Democrats on Capitol Hill believe Mr. Obama misses the legislative savvy of his former chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, now the mayor of Chicago.
Similarly, some veteran House Republicans fret that the ''young guns'' of their leadership team may lack the ability to command the votes of recalcitrant caucus members the way Tom ''The Hammer'' DeLay, as majority leader, and Roy Blunt of Missouri, as whip, did during the Bush era.
Institutional strains between the House and the Senate, which do cross party lines, add another wild card. That much was clear when a fallback plan written by the top Senate Republican, Mitch McConnell, yielded no support from House Republicans.
The Tea Party-influenced House caucus poses the biggest obstacle because so many members have declared themselves impervious to normal political pressures. Disdaining the White House, the Senate, Wall Street and re-election concerns all at once, they reflect the declining confidence in established institutions that has transformed political debate for a half-century.
As the first unsuccessful bailout vote showed in 2008, legislative leaders sometimes bring critical measures to the floor without knowing for certain where all the votes lie. Even a slight miscalculation, at the White House or the Capitol, could produce a devastating financial market reaction.
The race to brake the locomotive of economic chaos proceeds hour by hour now. And as Senator Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, a Republican member of the so-called Gang of Six, said on the CBS News program ''Face the Nation'' on Sunday, ''Frankly, we don't know what's going to happen for sure.''

HEADLINE: The Wrong Way to Free Trade

BYLINE: By JAGDISH N. BHAGWATI. 
Jagdish N. Bhagwati a professor of economics at Columbia, is a co-author of ''Offshoring of American Jobs: What Response From U.S. Economic Policy?''

 BODY:
LATE last week, a longstanding debate over free-trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia and Panama -- deals that were negotiated under President George W. Bush but never finalized -- stalled once again. President Obama supports the agreements, but only if more retraining for workers is part of the deal, a condition Republican leaders are resisting.
Both sides claim to advance the trade agenda, but they are fighting over fairly minor points. Neither side shows the slightest interest in reinvigorating the nearly 10-year-old Doha round of global trade negotiations, which have far greater potential to create prosperity and help working Americans. 
Bilateral trade agreements are not the same as free trade. Yes, they liberalize trade for the parties involved, but outsiders then face a handicap. The discrimination comes in the form of barriers like tariffs and antidumping charges, which countries impose on imports that they believe are priced artificially low.
When the United States negotiates bilateral deals with other countries, the unbalanced nature of the one-on-one negotiations also opens the way for all manner of lobbies to ram their self-serving demands into the agreements.
For example, when Washington negotiated free trade deals with Chile and Singapore, Wall Street lobbied to curtail those countries' right to impose restrictions on capital flows at times of crisis -- even though the International Monetary Fund now admits that such restrictions often make sense. Business lobbies have also pressed for excessively favorable treatment on intellectual property rights.
American labor unions have learned these same tricks, urging Democratic legislators and administrations to block bilateral trade deals unless their demands for labor protections are met, as they did with the three long-delayed agreements now pending.
But larger countries with more clout, like India and Brazil, will allow no such provisions. They correctly see these labor provisions as a form of anticompetitive protectionism. And they point out that it takes chutzpah for the United States to argue for labor rights abroad that often exceed those at home.
Moreover, when powerful business and labor interests can extract concessions in those bilateral deals, they have no reason to support a multilateral trade agenda. Mr. Obama's trade representative, Ron Kirk, points out that business leaders press bilateral trade deals, not the Doha round. The proponents of bilateral deals always complain that multilateralism is too slow. This surely confuses cause and effect.
Only presidential leadership can set our trade policy in the right direction: away from bilateral deals and toward Doha. First, Mr. Obama needs to bring the business lobbies on board.
Here is one sweetener he can offer: Finish the Doha round on the basis of what has been negotiated and then declare a new round that will start right away and address unresolved issues. The Doha round, after all, was conceived to address the ''unfinished agenda'' of the preceding Uruguay round, which ended in 1995 with much accomplished but also much left undone.
Next, the canard that Doha offers little gain for the United States must be put to rest. C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, has estimated that the annual economic gain to the United States from the Doha round would be only $6 billion to $7 billion -- a figure widely cited by Doha's opponents. But a policy must be judged not just by what it directly achieves but also by what would happen in its absence.
The failure of Doha would cause immeasurable harm. It would undermine the credibility of the W.T.O. and its progress in promoting multilateral trade liberalization, and it would begin to erode the binding dispute settlement mechanism, an achievement unparalleled in other international institutions.
The value of that mechanism was demonstrated just this month, when a W.T.O. panel ruled for the United States and the European Union in a case challenging China's restrictions on exports of industrial raw materials.
President Obama must persuade labor unions, core Democratic constituents, that they are wrong to buy into the fear-mongering that says trade with poor countries produces poverty in rich countries. In fact, what depresses workers' wages are deep and continuing technological changes; cheap imports of consumer products help workers by offsetting that effect.
The president should ask Democrats and Republicans to immediately add the Doha round, as it has been negotiated over 10 years, into the same all-or-nothing package as the three bilateral deals. Such a bold gesture has a precedent. After sitting on the fence his first year in office, President Bill Clinton embraced the cause of trade, despite the political costs, and fought fiercely, and against great odds, for the Uruguay round. Mr. Obama should do no less.

HEADLINE: Messing With Medicare

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
At the time of writing, President Obama's hoped-for ''Grand Bargain'' with Republicans is apparently dead. And I say good riddance. I'm no more eager than other rational people (a category that fails to include many Congressional Republicans) to see what happens if the debt limit isn't raised. But what the president was offering to the G.O.P., especially on Medicare, was a very bad deal for America.
Specifically, according to many reports, the president offered both means-testing of Medicare benefits and a rise in the age of Medicare eligibility. The first would be bad policy; the second would be terrible policy. And it would almost surely be terrible politics, too. 
The crucial thing to remember, when we talk about Medicare, is that our goal isn't, or at least shouldn't be, defined in terms of some arbitrary number. Our goal should be, instead, to give Americans the health care they need at a price the country can afford. And throwing Americans in their mid-60s off Medicare moves us away from that goal, not toward it.
For Medicare, with all its flaws, works better than private insurance. It has less bureaucracy and, hence, lower administrative costs than private insurers. It has been more successful in controlling costs. While Medicare expenses per beneficiary have soared over the past 40 years, they've risen significantly less than private insurance premiums. And since Medicare-type systems in other advanced countries have much lower costs than the uniquely privatized U.S. system, there's good reason to believe that Medicare reform can do a lot to control costs in the future.
In that case, you may ask, why didn't the 2010 health care reform simply extend Medicare to cover everyone? The answer, of course, is political realism. Most health reformers I know would have supported Medicare for all if they had considered it politically feasible. But given the power of the insurance lobby and the knee-jerk opposition of many politicians to any expansion of government, they settled for what they thought they could actually get: near-universal coverage through a system of regulation and subsidies.
It is, however, one thing to accept a second-best system insuring those who currently lack coverage. Throwing millions of Americans off Medicare and pushing them into the arms of private insurers is another story.
Also, did I mention that Republicans are doing all they can to undermine health care reform -- they even tried to undermine it as part of the debt negotiations -- and may eventually succeed? If they do, many of those losing Medicare coverage would find themselves unable to replace it.
So raising the Medicare age is a terrible idea. Means-testing -- reducing benefits for wealthier Americans -- isn't equally bad, but it's still poor policy.
It's true that Medicare expenses could be reduced by requiring high-income Americans to pay higher premiums, higher co-payments, etc. But why not simply raise taxes on high incomes instead? This would have the great virtue of not adding another layer of bureaucracy by requiring that Medicare establish financial status before paying medical bills.
But, you may say, raising taxes would reduce incentives to work and create wealth. Well, so would means-testing: As conservative economists love to point out in other contexts -- for example, when criticizing programs like food stamps -- benefits that fall as your income rises in effect raise your marginal tax rate. It doesn't matter whether the government raises your taxes by $1,000 when your income rises or cuts your benefits by the same amount; either way, it reduces the fraction of your additional earnings that you get to keep.
So what's the difference between means-testing Medicare and raising taxes? Well, the truly rich would prefer means-testing, since they would end up sacrificing no more than the merely well-off. But everyone else should prefer a tax-based solution.
So why is the president embracing these bad policy ideas? In a forthcoming article in The New York Review of Books, the veteran journalist Elizabeth Drew suggests that members of the White House political team saw the 2010 election as a referendum on government spending and that they believe that cutting spending is the way to win next year.
If so, I would respectfully suggest that they are out of their minds. Remember death panels? The G.O.P.'s most potent political weapon last year -- the weapon that caused a large swing in the votes of older Americans -- was the claim that Mr. Obama was cutting Medicare. Why give Republicans a chance to do it all over again?
Of course, it's possible that the reason the president is offering to undermine Medicare is that he genuinely believes that this would be a good idea. And that possibility, I have to say, is what really scares me.

HEADLINE: To the People Who Haven't Saved Anything Yet

BYLINE: CARL RICHARDS


HIGHLIGHT: Plenty of people wake up at 40 having saved nothing or having spent their savings because of lack of discipline or economic necessity.

 BODY:
Starting Now
We often hear about the importance of starting to save early. Usually the examples are focused on saving whatever you can when you're in your 20s to take advantage of the power of compound interest.
But what if you were too busy trying to pay a student loan and other bills in your 20s, or like many of us, had to use all the savings you built up to get through the last few years? Now you find yourself closing in on 40 and feeling like you missed the boat.
I've thought about this problem ever since I read about the recent study that found that nearly half of Americans wouldn't be able to come up with $2,000 in 30 days if they needed it. This reality hits home every time I have a conversation with people 35 to 45 who feel so far behind the savings game that they aren't sure what to do.
For that group the advice is no longer start early, but simply start now. The only thing that matters at this point is that the longer you wait, the more painful it will be. Compound interest can still work, but not until you start saving.
When we get behind on our savings goals, we start to feel more pressure to make up for lost time. That pressure can often lead to spending hours looking for that home-run investment. It's a bit like a gambler doubling down to dig out of a hole.
I've also noticed that as we get "smarter" we start to overthink things and ignore the simple advice about spending less than you earn, saving for a rainy day and avoiding larger losses. The basics seem like kids' stuff. So we spend hours talking about saving and investing, but we never get started.
If you've found yourself in a financial situation that was less flush than what you planned for, it's time to make some changes. Here are few ideas to help you get started:
Review Don't spend too much time dwelling on the past, but it can be really helpful to take a step back and look for patterns that have been harmful. This has to be done in a "no shame, no blame" sort of way. Give yourself permission to use the past as a springboard, not a bully club.
Give up on finding the home-run investment Maybe it's un-American, but finding the next Apple is highly unlikely no matter how hard you work at it. Not impossible, just highly improbable. So instead just start saving! Certificates of deposit are fine. Broadly diversified mutual funds work as well. The point is to start.
Make a plan It's eye-opening to put a number on all your financial goals. Have you looked at how much it will cost to put a child through college, for example? Any good plan will start with a clear understanding of where you are today and end with a where you want to go. Now you need to calculate the cost of getting there.
Remember that your plan is worthless unless you make the ongoing course corrections required when you're either off course or the destination changes. Plans are full of guesses, but when done correctly, the ongoing process of planning can provide the context for you to make decisions in the future. It's a lot easier to say "no" to the new car, if you are saying "yes" to a more important goal.
Maybe you have other ideas, but the point is to stop beating yourself up over what you didn't do in your 20s and start focusing on making today count.
So what have you done to get over the hump and make a plan for your future?

HEADLINE: Think Global Gets a Russian Lifeline

BYLINE: JONATHAN SCHULTZ


HIGHLIGHT: The Norway-based manufacturer of the Think City, which filed for bankruptcy in June, was purchased by a Russian investor.

 BODY:
A month after filing for bankruptcy, which marked the fourth time in the company's history that it suffered a financial collapse, Think Global AS has been saved, again.
The Norway-based builder of electric cars was bought by Boris G. Zingarevich, a Russian investor with assets spread primarily across timber holdings and lithium-ion battery technology. According to a statement released Monday by Electric Mobility Solutions AS, a newly created entity that will market Think products worldwide, Mr. Zingarevich is the principal investor in Ener1, a manufacturer of lithium-ion batteries with production operations in the Indianapolis area. Think North America, once a wholly owned subsidiary of Think Global AS, has manufactured the Think City E.V. runabout in Elkhart, Ind.
Ener1 supplies batteries for the City, an arrangement that would be unlikely to change under Mr. Zingarevich's direct control.
Think's North American and British subsidiaries are now owned by Mr. Zingarevich, the statement said. European production of the City, which has been stalled since March, is expected to restart in the first quarter of 2012, with the introduction of a revised version of the City.
A Norway-based judge approved the sale to Mr. Zingarevich, ending a bizarre courtship of the once-imperiled brand, during which BD Otomotiv, an investment group with holdings in electric-vehicle infrastructure and manufacturing in Turkey and Italy, issued news release earlier this month in which it declared itself the frontrunner for a takeover.
The Electric Mobility Solutions statement did not reveal the purchase price or further terms of the recent sale.

HEADLINE: Of Loopholes and Potholes

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: Closing tax loopholes and ending subsidies to certain industries would be a big step in reducing the federal budget deficit, an economist writes.

 BODY:
How can we fill the federal budget hole? The political standoff has been largely defined as a debate over tax hikes versus spending cuts.
Many Democrats want to close tax loopholes in order to increase revenue. Many Republicans believe that government spending should be cut because it hurts the economy, rather than helping it -- digging potholes, as it were, rather than fixing them. 
But many tax loopholes for big business are potholes for the rest of us. Closing and filling them would cut spending and improve economic efficiency. 
Special provisions in the tax code often provide specific subsidies to distinct groups. Such tax expenditures have the same effect as spending programs. 
The word "loophole" implies an opportunity for clever manipulation that leads to unintended results. While some loopholes fit this description, others represent explicit efforts to provide special benefits, reflecting greater political priorities and intense lobbying efforts. As Senator Russell Long of Louisiana once put it, a tax loophole is "something that benefits the other guy; if it benefits you, it's tax reform." 
Corporate tax policies in the United States provide significant benefits to shareholders, at considerable cost to everyone else.
Our statutory corporate tax rate, at 35 percent, looks high relative to those of other countries. But the many deductions, credits and other special breaks mean that the effective rate (or taxes actually paid) is much lower -- an estimated 13.4 percent of profits over the 2000-5 period, lower than the average for other major industrialized countries. 
As my fellow blogger Bruce Bartlett noted, "The United States actually has the lowest corporate tax burden of any of the member nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development." 
The proliferation of special breaks helps explain why corporate taxes have declined over time as a percentage of gross domestic product and as a percentage of total federal tax revenues.
Robert McIntyre of Citizens for Tax Justice points out that tax expenditures for corporate and other businesses will cost about $364.5 billion in 2011. That's about a billion dollars a day. 
Many special corporate tax breaks also contribute to serious economic inefficiencies. 
Corporations that invest overseas rather than within the United States enjoy a huge advantage in the form of deferred taxes on profits. Republican policy makers are now proposing a "tax holiday" or even total elimination of American taxes on offshore profits. 
Such policies would further encourage corporations to relocate to countries with the lowest tax rates and avoid contributing to social investments in health, education and environmental protection. 
There also is good reason to believe that increased "offshoring" will reduce employment growth. 
Some companies, especially those that rely heavily on intellectual property rights like patents, can simply shift their profits to offshore tax havens. Small business owners who cannot easily engage in such practices are rightfully indignant.
Other members of the business community are also speaking out. A Caterpillar executive recently filed suit against his company (the world's largest construction equipment manufacturer), asserting that he was demoted for criticizing the company's tax minimization strategy. 
Everyone concerned about environmental sustainability should take a close look at corporate tax loopholes. The United States, like most other industrialized countries, continues to provide billions of dollars of special tax subsidies for fossil fuel industries that contribute to global warming. 
Nuclear power is also on the dole. Without public subsidies, including limits on economic liability in the event of an accident, it would not be economically viable. 
If only we could throw these loopholes into the potholes and have a real discussion of tax reform, instead of getting buried by partisan obsession with the ratio of overall tax increases to spending cuts.

HEADLINE: Of Loopholes and Potholes

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: Closing tax loopholes and ending subsidies to certain industries would be a big step in reducing the federal budget deficit, an economist writes.

 BODY:
How can we fill the federal budget hole? The political standoff has been largely defined as a debate over tax hikes versus spending cuts.
Many Democrats want to close tax loopholes in order to increase revenue. Many Republicans believe that government spending should be cut because it hurts the economy, rather than helping it -- digging potholes, as it were, rather than fixing them. 
But many tax loopholes for big business are potholes for the rest of us. Closing and filling them would cut spending and improve economic efficiency. 
Special provisions in the tax code often provide specific subsidies to distinct groups. Such tax expenditures have the same effect as spending programs. 
The word "loophole" implies an opportunity for clever manipulation that leads to unintended results. While some loopholes fit this description, others represent explicit efforts to provide special benefits, reflecting greater political priorities and intense lobbying efforts. As Senator Russell Long of Louisiana once put it, a tax loophole is "something that benefits the other guy; if it benefits you, it's tax reform." 
Corporate tax policies in the United States provide significant benefits to shareholders, at considerable cost to everyone else.
Our statutory corporate tax rate, at 35 percent, looks high relative to those of other countries. But the many deductions, credits and other special breaks mean that the effective rate (or taxes actually paid) is much lower -- an estimated 13.4 percent of profits over the 2000-5 period, lower than the average for other major industrialized countries. 
As my fellow blogger Bruce Bartlett noted, "The United States actually has the lowest corporate tax burden of any of the member nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development." 
The proliferation of special breaks helps explain why corporate taxes have declined over time as a percentage of gross domestic product and as a percentage of total federal tax revenues.
Robert McIntyre of Citizens for Tax Justice points out that tax expenditures for corporate and other businesses will cost about $364.5 billion in 2011. That's about a billion dollars a day. 
Many special corporate tax breaks also contribute to serious economic inefficiencies. 
Corporations that invest overseas rather than within the United States enjoy a huge advantage in the form of deferred taxes on profits. Republican policy makers are now proposing a "tax holiday" or even total elimination of American taxes on offshore profits. 
Such policies would further encourage corporations to relocate to countries with the lowest tax rates and avoid contributing to social investments in health, education and environmental protection. 
There also is good reason to believe that increased "offshoring" will reduce employment growth. 
Some companies, especially those that rely heavily on intellectual property rights like patents, can simply shift their profits to offshore tax havens. Small business owners who cannot easily engage in such practices are rightfully indignant.
Other members of the business community are also speaking out. A Caterpillar executive recently filed suit against his company (the world's largest construction equipment manufacturer), asserting that he was demoted for criticizing the company's tax minimization strategy. 
Everyone concerned about environmental sustainability should take a close look at corporate tax loopholes. The United States, like most other industrialized countries, continues to provide billions of dollars of special tax subsidies for fossil fuel industries that contribute to global warming. 
Nuclear power is also on the dole. Without public subsidies, including limits on economic liability in the event of an accident, it would not be economically viable. 
If only we could throw these loopholes into the potholes and have a real discussion of tax reform, instead of getting buried by partisan obsession with the ratio of overall tax increases to spending cuts.

HEADLINE: Debt Crises, Real and Fake

BYLINE: FLOYD NORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: There are real debt crises -- Greece is going through one -- and there are phony ones, created by politicians playing chicken with the nation's credit.

 BODY:
I expressed that sentiment in a column last week that ran in the Asian editions of The International Herald Tribune on Friday. The new Greek rescue caused me to write a different column for The Times, and the I.H.T. column never made it onto the Web. It follows.
In the world of government bond markets, never have the haves been treated so much better than the have-nots. The haves can borrow for virtually nothing. The have-nots, if they can borrow at all, must pay exorbitant rates. 
Yet politicians, even in the countries that investors seem to trust completely, talk of impending budget disaster if spending is not cut immediately. 
This summer, as the markets offered a ''no confidence'' vote on Europe's effort to rescue Greece - and grew notably more worried about Italy and Spain - they appeared to be highly confident about the debt of the United States government. 
The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury securities fell back below 3 percent this month, even as the Washington rhetoric about the debt ceiling heated up. 
That was a sign that investors were not alarmed about a potential United States default, whether in the next few weeks or the next 10 years. If they were, rates would be soaring. 
For much of the spring and summer, the proportion of people who believed that Congress would raise the debt ceiling seemed to vary based on the distance from Washington. The closer to Capitol Hill, the more doubt there was that rationality would prevail. 
In politics, it appears, familiarity breeds contempt. 
If rationality does prevail, the debt ceiling will be raised. For that matter, there is no good reason to have a debt ceiling other than to give politicians a chance to grandstand. The important decisions for Congress and the White House concern spending and taxing. Borrowing, or paying back debt as happened for a couple of years before the Bush tax cuts, is a result of the interplay of those decisions and the state of the economy. 
Trying to control the result by putting limits on borrowing is a bit like trying to balance a household budget by waiting until the money has been spent and then deciding not to pay the bills. 
To analyze the fiscal problems confronting the United States now, it is necessary not to confuse short-term and long-term problems. And it is crucial to pay attention to the state of the economy. 
A weak economy will inevitably worsen the fiscal balance. Tax receipts fall because profits and incomes decline. Government spending increases on automatic stabilizers, like unemployment insurance payments. 
To the extent high deficits are a result of a weak economy, a decision to react by cutting spending or raising taxes can lead to a vicious cycle. The solution, if possible, is to revive the economy even if that makes deficits temporarily worse. 
One of the most important failures to analyze what was happening in the economy came in the late 1990s, when the United States government, to the surprise of almost everyone, began to run budget surpluses. Some of that was a result of tax increases and spending restraint, but a lot of it was caused by a completely unexpected and misunderstood surge in tax receipts. 
That surge was the result of the bull market in stocks, and of the peculiar nature of it. Individual income tax payments soared both because of high capital gains and because profits from stock options are taxed at ordinary income rates, not the reduced rate charged on capital gains. 
Most analyses ignored that. The conventional assumption was that the taxes on option profits were balanced by reduced taxes paid by companies. That would have been accurate if the companies were paying taxes and could use the additional deductions. But many of those companies - the heroes of the dot-com bubble - paid no taxes because they had no profits. So the extra deductions did them no good. 
A proper analysis would have seen that the inevitable end of the bull market would reduce tax receipts, and a slowdown would increase government spending. In that sense, it is wrong to blame the Bush tax cuts for ending the surpluses of the Clinton years. They would have ended anyway. The deep tax cuts and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq made the deficits that much larger. 
There is a risk that many analysts now are making the opposite mistake. Deficits have skyrocketed in recent years for reasons that are clearly temporary, or that will be temporary if the economy recovers. In some of the debate, the short-term problems are mixed up with longer-term demographic concerns caused by the aging and retirement of the baby boomers and the rising costs of Medicare, the health insurance program for Americans over the age of 65. 
It is worth looking at what has happened to financial markets around the world since the financial crisis exploded. A mild slowdown turned into something much worse after the collapse of Bear Stearns in March 2008 showed the vulnerability of the financial system. Stock markets plunged around the world, credit dried up for many borrowers and there was a flight to safety. Central banks intervened with unprecedented measures and banks were bailed out. Deficits soared. 
Now, more than two years later, the American stock market is about where it was in February 2008, just before the crisis hit. That may not sound impressive, but markets in nearly every other country are down sharply. The dollar has lost ground against the Swiss franc and the yen, but is up versus the euro and the pound. 
The yields on government bonds - the price investors demand to lend money to the government - are down in countries with solid foundations, including the United States. They have soared in markets where default seems a real possibility, and are up in some European countries where investors are getting more nervous, including Italy and Spain. 
That is a vote of confidence in Uncle Sam, at least relative to the alternatives.
 Markets can be wrong, of course. But Europe is in far worse shape. Greece is insolvent. It must have its debt reduced, but a default could cause bank failures and substantial losses for the European Central Bank. Europe's battles reflect the fact that there are no good alternatives. There is a crisis in Europe, where lenders now fear to tread. Would there be one in the United States if the politicians produced an unnecessary default? Let's hope we will not find out.

HEADLINE: On Debt Talks, a Lose-Lose-Lose-Lose Situation

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Whatever happens this week with Washington's debt talks, the economy will likely be worse off.

 BODY:
Whatever happens this week with Washington's debt talks, the economy will likely be worse off.
Here are the four likely scenarios I see:
1) Held up by disputes over how to reduce deficits, Washington doesn't raise the debt ceiling in time. As a result, the Treasury stops paying debts it owes.
If that happens, the ratings agencies downgrade the United States's debt. The cost of borrowing for the United States government shoots up, since lenders demand higher interest rates from borrowers that are less trustworthy. Many other interest rates are pegged to the cost for the United States to borrow, making interest rates on all sorts of other loans like mortgages rise, too. Credit markets freeze up, crushing an already-feeble economic recovery.
Macroeconomic Advisers predicts that failing to raise the debt ceiling in time -- even if the delay is only one month -- will likely result in a new recession. Plus, because it's more expensive for the United States to borrow, the United States debt gets even larger, the exact opposite effect that fiscal hawks are hoping for.
2) Held up by disputes over how to reduce deficits, Washington doesn't raise the debt ceiling in time. But rather than default on its debt, it diverts money from other spending into paying back bondholders.
That could mean that Social Security checks don't get sent, soldiers in Afghanistan and Iraq don't get paid, and all sorts of other hoary consequences.
Plus, bond markets might still freak out because the threat of default remains, so interest rates could rise anyway and cause all the terrible consequences in Scenario No. 1 (potential second recession plus even bigger federal debt).
3) Washington comes up with a deal to raise the debt ceiling, but it amounts to less than $4 trillion in savings.
Standard & Poor's has said that just raising the debt ceiling is not enough; without a "credible" plan for at least $4 trillion in savings, the United States may still have its credit rating downgraded. That could, again, mean higher interest rates and all the other terrible consequences of Scenario No. 1.
4) Washington comes up with a deal to raise the debt ceiling that amounts to more than $4 trillion in savings.
The credit ratings agencies are appeased, but such severe austerity measures put the fragile economic recovery at risk. The states in particular are anxious about what major spending cuts mean for them, and for the many social safety net services they provide with federal support.
As Bruce Bartlett and others have written, similar fiscal tightening during a fragile economy happened in 1937. Those actions resulted in a severe second recession and prolonging of the Great Depression, partly because it was coincident with monetary tightening as well. While a sharp, sudden monetary tightening seems unlikely, the Fed is at the very least pulling back on its easy monetary policy with the end of its second round of quantitative easing.
As The Wall Street Journal's Kelly Evans observed, Japan had a similar experience in 1998, when austerity measures were followed by a recession and a widespread sell-off of Japanese bonds. 
And even if these likely American austerity measures don't result in an outright recession, job growth is already so feeble that most Americans still think we're in recession.
Imagine how terrible things would feel if the economy slows down even further.

HIGHLIGHT: Whatever happens this week with Washington's debt talks, the economy will likely be worse off.

 BODY:
1:07 p.m. | Updated 
Almost whatever happens this week with Washington's debt talks, the economy will likely be worse off.
As Dean Maki, the chief United States economist at Barclays Capital, put it: "The basic issue is that the U.S. is on an unsustainable fiscal track, which is pretty widely agreed upon. From that point, none of the choices are fun."
Here are the likely scenarios I see:
1) Held up by disputes over how to reduce deficits, Washington doesn't raise the debt ceiling in time. As a result, the Treasury stops paying debts it owes.
If that happens, the ratings agencies downgrade the United States's debt. The cost of borrowing for the United States government shoots up, since lenders demand higher interest rates from borrowers that are less trustworthy. Many other interest rates are pegged to the cost for the United States to borrow, making interest rates on all sorts of other loans like mortgages rise, too. Credit markets freeze up, crushing an already-feeble economic recovery.

Plus, because it's more expensive for the United States to borrow, the United States debt gets even larger, the exact opposite effect that fiscal hawks are hoping for.
2) Held up by disputes over how to reduce deficits, Washington doesn't raise the debt ceiling in time. But rather than default on its debt, it diverts money from other spending into paying back bondholders.

Plus, bond markets might still freak out because the threat of default remains, so interest rates could rise anyway and cause all the terrible consequences in Scenario No. 1 (potential second recession plus even bigger federal debt).
3) Washington comes up with a deal to raise the debt ceiling, but it amounts to less than $4 trillion in savings.
Standard & Poor's has said that just raising the debt ceiling is not enough; without a "credible" plan for at least $4 trillion in savings, the United States may still have its credit rating downgraded. That could, again, mean higher interest rates and all the other terrible consequences of Scenario No. 1.
4) Washington comes up with a deal to raise the debt ceiling that amounts to more than $4 trillion in savings,over a near-term horizon.
The credit ratings agencies are appeased, but such severe austerity measures put the fragile economic recovery at risk. The states in particular are anxious about what major spending cuts mean for them, and for the many social safety net services they provide with federal support.
As Bruce Bartlett and others have written, similar fiscal tightening during a fragile economy happened in 1937. Those actions resulted in a severe second recession and prolonging of the Great Depression, partly because it was coincident with monetary tightening as well.

And even if these likely American austerity measures don't result in an outright recession, job growth is already so feeble that most Americans still think we're in recession.
Imagine how terrible things would feel if the economy slows down even further.
5) Washington comes up with a deal to raise the debt ceiling that amounts to more than $4 trillion in savings, but over a longer-term horizon.
This is the best-case scenario: It deals with the long-term unsustainability of the country's fiscal arrangements -- which is good for growth in the long run -- but doesn't rock the boat in the current economic recovery.
Unfortunately, it also seems like the scenario that is least likely to be pulled off effectively.
Economists want spending cuts and/or tax increases that come after 2012, when the economy is expected to be stronger. But to use Standard & Poor's lingo, cuts that take effect 2012 may not be fully "credible." Committing to cuts/tax increases is just another way of kicking the can down the road, as Washington has been doing for decades now. Almost every time Congress promises painful fiscal measures at some future date, later politicians jump in to dismantle them just before they take effect.
"We do seem to have a time-consistency problem," said Mr. Maki. "There does never seem to be a good time for major cuts, and they're not going to be more popular five years from now versus now."
So he says that Congress must come up with a way to prove that these cuts will actually happen versus something that's on the drawing board and is therefore erasable.
Unfortunately, he says, "There is no way to completely tie the hands of future legislators."

HEADLINE: An Odder Look to Fuel-Efficient Trucks

BYLINE: MATTHEW L. WALD


HIGHLIGHT: The TrailerTail protrudes about four feet from the back doors of a tractor trailer and reshapes the vortex left behind on the highway, minimizing it.

 BODY:
 New jet planes have winglets, curved structures at the tips of the wings that change the airflow and reduce the turbulence in the passing wind. That reduces drag, the amount of effort needed to speed ahead, and that in turn reduces fuel requirements. Can it work on the ground? 
Not only can it, but it may have to. Soon, possibly this week, the federal Environmental Protection Agency will issue fuel economy standards for trucks mimicking those that have been in place for cars since the 1970s. Trucks have never been covered; these would be the first rules of their kind. And if the standards are as aggressive as some experts predict, the rules will lead to some high-technology innovations. 
But Andrew Smith, the founder and chief executive of a start-up company called ATDynamics, already has a product on the market. It was designed with some serious attention to the dynamics of the passing wind, never a simple subject, but on close examination, the word that comes to mind is not so much "high-tech" as "clever." 
His TrailerTail protrudes about four feet from the back doors of a tractor trailer and reshapes the vortex left behind on the highway, minimizing it. The effect is to increase fuel economy by about 6 percent, which sounds modest, but it comes to eight gallons per 1,000 miles traveled. An over-the-road tractor trailer can go over 200,000 miles a year at six or seven miles a gallon. So a 6 percent reduction amounts to a lot of fuel, perhaps as much as a typical car uses in an entire year. 
The TrailerTail is made of ordinary-looking plastic composite and metal tubing and springs. The clever part is that with a simple push, it can be folded flat against the back of the truck. If the door is swung all the way open so that it lies flush against the side of the truck, the tail folds automatically. 
Last week Mr. Smith was showing off his device in Washington on the back of a Werner Enterprises tractor trailer parked near the Capitol. The idea was that Congressional staff members and maybe some government officials would come out and kick the tires, so to speak, but since the temperature was pushing 100 degrees, few other than mad dogs, Englishmen and this reporter actually showed. 
The cab, a 2011 Volvo, also carried fairings on the sides that extended back toward the trailer. Tom Pietrzak, the driver, said that for highway driving, he adjusts the distance between the trailer and the cab to just a few inches so that there is little gap between the back of the fairing and the front of the trailer. For maneuvering in city driving or at loading docks, he moves the trailer back a few inches so the fairing does not catch on the trailer.
The adjustment mechanism was originally intended to help redistribute weight but now has an energy purpose, he said. This month Mr. Pietrzak drove a load of vegetables from California to Indianapolis with the trailer snuggled up against the cab because little maneuvering was required on the roads, he said. Other than changing lanes, he said, "there weren't a lot of turns."
Werner's trucks have some less visible improvements too, Mr. Pietrzak said. For example, many of them have devices that read the tire pressure on each of the 18 wheels and display alarms to the driver if one is getting low. Low pressure causes fuel economy loss and is one reason that truck tires shed their treads, leaving thick strips of black rubber in the road.
 "We call them gators, because they look like alligators,'' Mr. Pietrzak said of the detritus. 
The Volvo's headlights are under a plastic cover to smooth out their profile against the oncoming wind. The mirrors mounted on the hood are a little smaller than some other companies use, to cut wind resistance. 
Anybody with a tractor or a trailer can make improvements, but often the tractor owner is pulling a trailer owned by somebody else. And since the tractor owner is paying for the fuel, the trailer owner may not be concerned about fuel economy. Backers of a fuel economy standard say everybody would be better off if diesel consumption declined, and that a new rule would solve that problem. 
There are about two million trailers in the United States, although not all of them travel at highway speeds for long periods. President Obama wants a final rule by July 30. 
The draft rule is strict enough to make devices like the TrailerTail common on all trucks.

Trucks have never been covered; these would be the first rules of their kind. And if the standards are as aggressive as some experts predict, the rules will lead to some high-technology innovations. 
But Andrew Smith, the founder and chief executive of a start-up company called ATDynamics, already has a product on the market. It was designed with some serious attention to the dynamics of the passing wind, never a simple subject, but on close examination, the word that comes to mind is not so much "high-tech" as "clever." 
His TrailerTail protrudes about four feet from the back doors of a tractor trailer and reshapes the vortex left behind on the highway, minimizing it. The effect is to increase fuel economy by about 6 percent, which sounds modest, but it comes to eight gallons per 1,000 miles traveled. An over-the-road tractor trailer can go over 200,000 miles a year at six or seven miles a gallon. So a 6 percent reduction amounts to a lot of fuel, perhaps as much as a typical car uses in an entire year. 
The TrailerTail is made of ordinary-looking plastic composite and metal tubing and springs. The clever part is that with a simple push, it can be folded flat against the back of the truck. If the door is swung all the way open so that it lies flush against the side of the truck, the tail folds automatically. 
Last week Mr. Smith was showing off his device in Washington on the back of a Werner Enterprises tractor trailer parked near the Capitol. The idea was that Congressional staff members and maybe some government officials would come out and kick the tires, so to speak, but since the temperature was pushing 100 degrees, few other than mad dogs, Englishmen and this reporter actually showed. 
The cab, a 2011 Volvo, also carried fairings on the sides that extended back toward the trailer. Tom Pietrzak, the driver, said that for highway driving, he adjusts the distance between the trailer and the cab to just a few inches so that there is little gap between the back of the fairing and the front of the trailer. For maneuvering in city driving or at loading docks, he moves the trailer back a few inches so the fairing does not catch on the trailer.
The adjustment mechanism was originally intended to help redistribute weight but now has an energy purpose, he said. This month Mr. Pietrzak drove a load of vegetables from California to Indianapolis with the trailer snuggled up against the cab because little maneuvering was required on the roads, he said. Other than changing lanes, he said, "there weren't a lot of turns."
Werner's trucks have some less visible improvements too, Mr. Pietrzak said. For example, many of them have devices that read the tire pressure on each of the 18 wheels and display alarms to the driver if one is getting low. Low pressure causes fuel economy loss and is one reason that truck tires shed their treads, leaving thick strips of black rubber in the road.
 "We call them gators, because they look like alligators,'' Mr. Pietrzak said of the detritus. 
The Volvo's headlights are under a plastic cover to smooth out their profile against the oncoming wind. The mirrors mounted on the hood are a little smaller than some other companies use, to cut wind resistance. 
Anybody with a tractor or a trailer can make improvements, but often the tractor owner is pulling a trailer owned by somebody else. And since the tractor owner is paying for the fuel, the trailer owner may not be concerned about fuel economy. Backers of a fuel economy standard say everybody would be better off if diesel consumption declined, and that a new rule would solve that problem. 
There are about two million trailers in the United States, although not all of them travel at highway speeds for long periods. President Obama wants a final rule by July 30. 
The draft rule is strict enough to make devices like the TrailerTail common on all trucks.

HEADLINE: Drink Up | North Philly Beer, Part 1

BYLINE: JORDAN MICHELMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Philadelphia's bar scene is flourishing thanks to a focus on local brews and a community of excellent taprooms, pubs and bars.

 BODY:
On Poplar Street, between Second and Third Street in the Northern Liberties neighborhood of Philadelphia, there sits a placard placed by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission. It reads, "AMERICA'S FIRST LAGER: In 1840, John Wagner brought lager yeast from his native Bavaria and brewed the nation's first lager beer. Later, other German immigrants began brewing lagers, which soon became popular & promoted growth of America's brewing industry."
One hundred seventy years later, Wagner would be proud of his neighborhood. Decimated over the years, first by Prohibition, then by recession and urban decay, the beer scenes in the North Philadelphia neighborhoods of Northern Liberties and Fishtown are currently thriving, thanks to a spate of excellent taprooms, pubs and bars that focus on local brews. Beer culture in this part of America is lively, rife with chance taking, hybridization and healthy competition, and while a week or more could be spent driving across Delaware and Pennsylvania to properly experience it all, a simple walk makes for an easier journey.
If an embarrassment of riches is your thing, visit during the annual Philly Beer Week, a brewing bacchanalia that takes over the city's bars. Otherwise check out this first installment of our bar-hopping guide. When it comes to beer in Philadelphia, Anders Larson, a bartender at the groundbreaking Northern Liberties pub 700 Club, put it best: "It's a happy time to be a Philadelphian. You can rarely say that!"
700 Club 
Open for 14 years, the 700 Club in Northern Liberties is a bar that caters to a wide-ranging clientele, equal parts soccer fans and trendy 20-somethings seeking sweaty communion in the upstairs dance hall. The tap menu traces the history of craft brewing in this neighborhood by placing Philadelphia Brewing Company's Kenzinger next to its Germanic inspirations Gaffel Kolsch and Franziskaner Weissbier. The staff actually helped the Philadelphia Brewing Company develop its recipe for Kenzinger by expressing their devotion for German-style ales and a desire for something cheap, local and made with Philadelphia water. It seems to have worked; Kenzinger is now firmly entrenched as Philadelphia's inexpensive local beer of choice, but it's no beer for dummies. The recipe is quite capable of complexity and inspires clever appreciation.
"For years, everyone here drank cheap macrobrews-now we're seeing people drink so much more Kenzinger," Larson said. "It makes sense, because this city is a union town; it's what happens when you have the political, the social, the financial concentrations of power to the North and South of you. There's this profound regionalism here, this sense of tribalism-you can taste it in our beer, especially the Kenzinger, which is kind of the people's beer of Philadelphia." But his favorite local beer? Pikeland Pils from Sly Fox Brewery, in nearby Phoenixville, Pa. It's thirst quenching, clean and delicious, the first of many local beers that seem perfectly suited to the heat of Philadelphia in the summertime.
Standard Tap 
An upscale gastropub in the heart of Northern Liberties, Standard Tap is an essential part of the North Philadelphia beer scene. Simply belly up to the downstairs bar and mention an interest in local beer, then watch in wonder as the staff shifts into a second gear - this is quite literally the specialty, as Standard Tap restricts its ample tap list to beers from within 90 miles of the city. Among the highlights, the "Standard Pils" is served only here, developed by one of the owners and the Sly Fox Brewery. It's a sharply carbonated pilsner, tasting of honey and lemons .
Other recommendations from the bartender included Dogfish Head's Burton Baton, from the Dogfish Head Brewery in Milton, Del., a dark IPA/wheat hybrid that tastes strongly of vanilla bean scrapings, more challenging than refreshing, with flavor notes that linger past the last sip. Better still is the Sly Fox Dry Stout, packing a thick head and fleeting, uncomplicated dark chocolate and coffee notes. Last, a fellow bar patron extolled the virtues of Yards Brewing's ESA, which stands for "Extra Special Ale," a variation on the traditional British ESB, or "Extra Special Bitter." On the day I visited, Standard Tap was offering the Yards ESA via cask service, a method of pouring from a hand pump that has a pleasant, mellowing effect on many beers. Yards ESA served in this manner had a kind of syrupy sweetness, all body, with very little carbonation or spark on the front end, rounding the beer into a kind of starchy texture reminiscent of banana bread. The best part? The Yards brewery is located only a few blocks away.
The Foodery
A surprising number of restaurants in Philadelphia have a bring-your-own-booze policy, so it's no surprise that high-end beer marts have stepped in to fill the gap. Just across the street from Standard Tap, the Foodery offers patrons a daunting amount of beer to choose from: more than 14 floor-to-ceiling cases, 900 beers and counting, full of selections from down the street and around the world. You can take yours to go or enjoy in a small seating section next to the coolers. Pint glasses and bottle openers are provided, of course. The gentleman behind the checkout counter transformed into a beer monger when pressed for recommendations, finally settling on the Yards Brawler "Pugilist Style Ale." It's a malt-forward but not overpowering regional take on the classic British bitters style.
North Third
North Third sits just a few blocks away from the beer nexus of Standard Tap, the Foodery and 700 Club, where boisterous street traffic and nouveau condominium architecture melts away into a calm neighborhood. North Third's interior is a delight, filled to bursting with bric-a-brac, stained glass, a papier-mache spangled American eagle, high tables, booths, stuffed boars and crows, and of course, the Phillies on TV. Its small but carefully curated tap selection features several local beers, including the ubiquitous Kenzinger and the Yards Philly Pale Ale. Easy drinking and neutral, both dry and sweet, this Pale Ale makes for a delicious Philadelphia baseball beer.
The Abbaye
Don't let the name fool you. The Abbaye does indeed focus on Belgian beers, but it's also home to between four to six regional taps at all times. One of these, the Manayunk Altercation, comes from the nearby Manayunk brewery, based inside a former textile mill on the Schuylkill River. Altercation is an English-style Amber, though the bartender was quick to opine: "We're so into hybrids out here, it's kind of hard to tell what that means."
The Abbaye is an easy recommendation, a bar that feels at once instantly warm and familiar, with Chimay-red walls and a worn copper bar. It offers a Belgian beer-brined chicken wing plate with Lancaster County blue cheese, paired with Indie rock on the iPod and the Phillies on TV, and it provides ample outdoor seating. The Abbaye also does a "buy the glass" monthly event, where $10 gets you a take-home mug and free refills, sponsored by a rotating cast of local breweries.

HEADLINE: ING to Sell Latin American Insurance Unit for $3.9 Billion

BYLINE: CHRIS V. NICHOLSON


HIGHLIGHT: The ING Group announced on Monday that it would sell its Latin American insurance unit to Grupo de Inversiones Suramericana for $3.9 billion, as the Dutch financial firm looks to shed assets to comply with the terms of its government bailout.

 BODY:
The ING Group announced on Monday that it would sell its Latin American insurance unit to Grupo de Inversiones Suramericana for $3.9 billion, as the Dutch financial firm looked to shed assets to comply with the terms of its government bailout. 
The bank, which received 10 billion euros from the Dutch government during the financial crisis, agreed to separate its banking and insurance businesses. The deal to sell its Latin American unit, Insurance Latam, to Grupo de Inversiones Suramericana is the first step in that process. 
"Over the years we have built a first rate Latin American franchise with a terrific management team and leading market positions in most countries we operate in. I am pleased that we have found in Grupo Sura a very solid and complementary owner with the ambition to further build on the success of this leading Latin American pensions and insurance provider, in the interests of both our customers and our employees," said Jan Hommen, chief executive of the ING Group.
ING plans to spin off the remaining insurance and investment management operations through two public offerings, one for the United States group and one that encompasses the European and Asian divisions. Mr. Hommen said the company would "proceed" with the offerings when the "markets are favorable."
In June, ING reluctantly moved to divest one of its crown jewels, its American online banking group, also as part of the arrangement with the Dutch government. Capital One agreed to pay $9 billion for ING Direct. 
The deal for Insurance Latam is expected to close by the end of the year, pending regulatory approvals, with the proceeds going toward paying down ING Insurance's debt. Insurance Latam is involved in life insurance in Chile and Peru, as well as pensions and savings Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Uruguay. Its mandatory pension business is one of the largest in the region. 
Altogether, Insurance Latam has about 10 million clients and manages assets of $70 billion, but the combination with Grupo de Inversiones Suramericana will increase that to 25 million customers and $120 billion. 
Grupo de Inversiones Suramericana, listed on the Colombian stock exchange, is a financial company already operating in the pension sector, and has an interest in Colombia's biggest insurance company and top bank. The deal would be one of the largest outbound acquisitions ever for a Colombian company. Last week, the company's board approved the issuance of an additional 131 million shares to finance its expansion. 
Grupo de Inversiones Suramericana's shares rose 0.45 percent to close on Friday at 35.44 Colombian pesos. ING slipped 1 euro cent, to 8.08 euros, in morning trading in Amsterdam on Monday.

HEADLINE: Ex-Moore Trader Pays $1 Million Fine to Settle Market Manipulation Case

BYLINE: AZAM AHMED


HIGHLIGHT: Christopher Louis Pia was accused of trying to manipulate prices of palladium and platinum futures contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange in a trading practice known as "banging the close."

 BODY:
A former money manager at the hedge fund giant Moore Capital Management agreed on Monday to a $1 million payment to U.S. regulators to settle allegations of market manipulation. 
From late 2007 until mid-2008, Christopher Louis Pia tried to manipulate prices of palladium and platinum futures contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange in a trading practice known as "banging the close," the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said. Banging the close is when a trader buys or sells a large number number of futures contracts just before a given market closes in an effort to disrupt the price. That, in turn, typically favors a different position held by the trader that profits from the swing.
Mr. Pia, once an associate of Moore Capital's founder Louis Bacon, is permanently banned from trading any product regulated by the C.F.T.C. during the market's closing period and any such product related to platinum or palladium.
"Christopher is pleased to have settled with the CFTC in order to put this matter behind him," the firm said in a statement. "Pia Capital, his current firm, is committed to abiding by the CFTC order and to maintaining the highest level of compliance."
In addition, Mr. Pia, who founded the hedge fund Pia Capital Management, will have to distribute the regulator's order to his current investors, prospective investors, and current and future employees. Mr. Pia neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing as part of the settlement.
"To protect market participants and promote market integrity, individuals who attempt to manipulate commodity prices must and will be held personally accountable," said David Meister, director of the C.F.T.C.'s division of enforcement.
A similar settlement was reached with Moore Capital last year, costing the hedge fund some $25 million. The fund, which makes bets on the economy by trading commodities, currencies and other securities, manages about $15 billion dollars.

HEADLINE: Lincoln Center Announces New Discussion Series

BYLINE: ROBIN POGREBIN


HIGHLIGHT: The Lincoln Center Dialogue series will be held at the David Rubenstein Atrium.

 BODY:
Business, not cultural affairs, will be on the breakfast menu at Lincoln Center this fall as the Center begins a morning series where leaders will "discuss significant issues facing American society." Reynold Levy, the center's president is to announce the breakfast series on Tuesday. 
The Lincoln Center Dialogue series will be held at the David Rubenstein Atrium and its first conversation on Sept. 28 - "Private Equity, Public Scrutiny" - will feature the venue's namesake, David Rubenstein, the managing director and co-founder of the Carlyle Group who is also on Lincoln Center's board. The other participant is Stephen Schwarzman, the chairman and co-founder of the Blackstone Group. 
 The discussions this fall will be moderated by Tom Brokaw, the journalist and author, and will all focus on business and the economy. Mr. Levy said future dialogues would feature other topics.
In bringing early morning activity to the campus, the program represents an ongoing effort to remake Lincoln Center as a 24/7 hub of activity and the 200-seat atrium offers an intimate setting, Mr. Levy said. "You'll have a good shot at asking a question," he added, "and getting an answer." 
On October 12, Blair Effron, the founder of Centerview partners and a Lincoln Center trustee, and Greg Fleming, the president of Morgan Stanley Smith Barney and Morgan Stanley Investment Management, will discuss the American economy. On Nov. 16th Peter R. Orszag, the vice chairman of global banking at Citigroup and Ruth Porat, the executive vice chairwoman and chief financial officer at Morgan Stanley will address America's competitive challenges. Morgan Stanley is the series' corporate sponsor.

HEADLINE: On Jobs, the U.S. Is Turning Into Europe

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Between 1980 and 2000, the share of adults working was on average about 10 percentage points higher in the United States than in Europe. But that gap is closing.

 BODY:
Hide your wives, and hide your children. Economists' worse fears have come true: The United States has been slowly turning into Europe.
One of many reasons blamed for (Western) Europe's stagnant growth in recent decades has been that so many European adults are not working, and are effectively not employable because they have been out of jobs for so long. The United States, on the other hand, has had a much higher share of its population in gainful employment. In fact, between 1980 and 2000, the percent of adults working was on average about 10 percentage points higher in the United States than in Europe.
But that gap is closing, according to a new paper from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. A chart is worth a thousand words:
The gap had been narrowing even before the Great Recession, largely as a result of social and economic policy changes in Western Europe. For example, the authors note, in the mid-2000s Germany and Italy deregulated markets for temporary hiring, which enabled more people to find jobs. Reductions to Europe's traditionally generous pensions have also encouraged workers to work later in life. 
Meanwhile, in the decade before the financial crisis, employment growth in the United States was relatively weak. In particular, while more women were joining labor markets in Europe -- perhaps partly because of policy incentives, and partly because of changing cultural norms -- more women were dropping out of the labor market in the United States. Here are the employment-to-population ratios for women that resulted:
The trends were slightly different for male workers. In both the United States and Europe, the share of men working generally dropped over the last decade. But the decline was bigger in the United States.
Finally, the recession nearly closed the gap between employment-rates in Europe in the United States.
But while an extraordinarily generous safety net may have held back growth in Europe in the decades before the recession, the authors suggest that it paradoxically helped protect Europe from the huge job losses that the United States experienced during the Great Recession. They write:The employment rate fell by only 1 percentage point in Europe, despite an output decline of almost 4 percent. In contrast, output decreased less dramatically in the United States (by 2.5 percent), but the country lost many more jobs - the employment rate declined 4.0 percentage points. This difference is likely due in part to European restrictions on firing workers and programs that encourage work sharing, most notably in Germany (see, for example, a recent analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland).It's not clear whether the gap between employment-population ratios in the United States and Europe will continue to shrink. Certainly it does not help that the United States has been accumulating a huge underclass of long-term unemployed workers. As we've noted before, the longer people are out of work, the harder it is to find them a new job.
Which is exactly the experience Europe had seen, and that the United States hadn't learned from, in decades past.

The gap had been narrowing even before the Great Recession, largely as a result of social and economic policy changes in Western Europe. For example, the authors note, in the mid-2000s Germany and Italy deregulated markets for temporary hiring, which enabled more people to find jobs. Reductions to Europe's traditionally generous pensions have also encouraged workers to work later in life. 
Meanwhile, in the decade before the financial crisis, employment growth in the United States was relatively weak. In particular, while more women were joining labor markets in Europe -- perhaps partly because of policy incentives, and partly because of changing cultural norms -- more women were dropping out of the labor market in the United States. Here are the employment-to-population ratios for women that resulted:
The trends were slightly different for male workers. In both the United States and Europe, the share of men working generally dropped over the last decade. But the decline was bigger in the United States.
Finally, the recession nearly closed the gap between employment-rates in Europe in the United States.
But while an extraordinarily generous safety net may have held back growth in Europe in the decades before the recession, the authors suggest that it paradoxically helped protect Europe from the huge job losses that the United States experienced during the Great Recession. They write:The employment rate fell by only 1 percentage point in Europe, despite an output decline of almost 4 percent. In contrast, output decreased less dramatically in the United States (by 2.5 percent), but the country lost many more jobs - the employment rate declined 4.0 percentage points. This difference is likely due in part to European restrictions on firing workers and programs that encourage work sharing, most notably in Germany (see, for example, a recent analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland).It's not clear whether the gap between employment-population ratios in the United States and Europe will continue to shrink. Certainly it does not help that the United States has been accumulating a huge underclass of long-term unemployed workers. As we've noted before, the longer people are out of work, the harder it is to find them a new job.
Which is exactly the experience Europe had seen, and that the United States hadn't learned from, in decades past.

HEADLINE: Debt Drama Blocks Out Big Picture on Credit

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSS SORKIN


HIGHLIGHT: How rating agencies will view the country's creditworthiness will end up being a bigger deal than the current back and forth over the debt ceiling.

 BODY:
As Washington continues to debate a debt deal, the Obama administration has been preparing the country for the worst, with officials essentially saying the sky is about to fall.
But so far, oddly enough, nothing has happened. Despite warnings that a deal would need to be brokered by Sunday night before the Asian markets opened, stocks merely stumbled on Monday - the type of weakness usually associated with soft corporate earnings instead of an economic apocalypse.
Wall Street's blase response presents a serious challenge for the administration. The government has been ringing the alarm bells of an impending catastrophe to add urgency to its efforts to get Republicans to hash out a compromise.
While the sky indeed may fall if a deal isn't reached, the fact that the market has been calm has served only to deepen the resistance to a deal. People who perhaps should be worried don't seem to be, and worse, appear to have stopped listening to the warnings.
How did it come to this?
The administration may have made a strategic mistake in warning too soon that the market would react negatively. It ultimately undercuts the government's negotiating position because the doomsday scenario has not played out, even though the deadline is fast approaching.
"They have lost all credibility," said Neil M. Barofsky, the former special inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program. "It's so typical of the way Treasury and the Fed treat everything - it is always to warn that Armageddon is coming."
The Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, is among those who may have miscalculated.
He has consistently held out Aug. 2 as the cutoff date for lawmakers to reach a compromise. After that, Mr. Geithner has said the government might not be able to continue sending out Social Security checks or Medicare payments. "On Aug. 2, we're left running on fumes," he told the CBS program "Face the Nation."
He told me back in May that he was expecting to reach a deal by mid-July, way ahead of the final deadline. "Why would you want to experiment? In July, you'd want this done."
But increasingly, the market seems to believe it was a false deadline. Some economists have said the government would have enough cash on hand to continue making payments for several days at least. The administration could also decide how to prioritize payments. The government, for instance, could opt to pay interest on Treasuries and put off other bills.
In other words, the United States has some wiggle room.
"The Aug. 2 deadline is not as hard as indicated by Secretary Geithner," said Mohamed El-Erian, the chief executive of Pimco, the large bond manager.
It doesn't help the government's case that investors believe the debate over the debt ceiling amounts to political posturing. Wall Street is counting on lawmakers to work out a deal, albeit at the last minute - a big reason the markets remain sanguine.
"The markets believe the political parties will reach a compromise agreement to avert a default," Mr. El-Erian said, especially considering that they may have a bit more time on the doomsday clock.
Investors have good reason to ignore the drama. In years past, politicians have rubber-stamped an increase in the debt ceiling with little discussion or dissent. Since 1962, Congress has voted to increase the limit 74 times, according to the Congressional Research Service, a division of the Library of Congress. It happened 17 times under President Ronald Reagan and four times during the Clinton administration.
But investors may have been lulled into a false sense of security and, as a result, they may have missed the bigger picture.
Whether lawmakers reach an agreement about the debt ceiling may be beside the point. Republicans and Democrats are likely to comprise at some eventual date.
The question is how rating agencies will view the country's creditworthiness, even if a deal is reached.
To some extent, that's why lawmakers are wrangling over whether to pursue a stop-gap measure for the next couple of months versus a long-term plan. Standard & Poor's threatened that it would cut the United States rating if lawmakers didn't come up with a "credible" solution.
"What I think is underappreciated until now is a possible outcome whereby the debt ceiling is increased, debt default is avoided, but one of the rating agencies feels compelled to downgrade America's AAA because of insufficient agreement on medium-term fiscal reform," Mr. El-Erian said.
If the country were to lose its vaunted rating, the federal government, companies, homeowners and innumerable others would see their costs skyrocket - a situation that would certainly send the markets into a downward spiral.

As Washington continues to debate a debt deal, the Obama administration has been preparing the country for the worst, with officials essentially saying the sky is about to fall.
But so far, oddly enough, nothing has happened. Despite warnings that a deal would need to be brokered by Sunday night before the Asian markets opened, stocks merely stumbled on Monday - the type of weakness usually associated with soft corporate earnings instead of an economic apocalypse.
Wall Street's blase response presents a serious challenge for the administration. The government has been ringing the alarm bells of an impending catastrophe to add urgency to its efforts to get Republicans to hash out a compromise.
President Obama, in his address on Monday night, again warned of dire consequences if a deal is not reached.
 "We would risk sparking a deep economic crisis, this one caused almost entirely by Washington," he said.
While the sky indeed may fall if the sides cannot compromise, the fact that the market has been calm has served only to deepen the resistance to a deal. People who perhaps should be worried don't seem to be, and worse, appear to have stopped listening to the warnings.

HEADLINE: This Week in Small Business: Are Small Businesses The Answer?

BYLINE: GENE MARKS


HIGHLIGHT: Plus: Does technology sometimes make you less productive?

 BODY:
What's affecting me, my clients and other small-business owners this week.
The Deficit: Can Small Businesses Reduce the National Debt?
President Obama blogs about deficit reduction: go big! About that debt ceiling: Ezra Klein asks the question we've all been asking. A new poll reports that the president edges out the G.O.P. on helping small businesses. A Congressman says that small businesses are crucial to reducing this country's debt. A massive deficit reduction plan is proposed by a staunch budget-cutter. Jared Bernstein says, "Consumer spending is way down, and it's not getting much of a boost from jobs and paychecks. Which means that fiscal stimulus is about the only game in town, or it would be if policy makers weren't spending practically every waking minute on budget cuts."
The Data: A $300,000 Home Sells for $16
Mortgage refinancings surge but Wells Fargo reports a sharp decline in new mortgages. Existing home sales decline. Architectural billings fall. June housing starts, however, are at a six-month high and some economists think we've hit a housing bottom. A guy in Texas buys a $300,000 home for $16. American builders were slightly more confident in July, and the remodeling industry sets a record. Commercial property prices are increasing.
The Economy: A Slow Growth Decade Is Raging
As weekly jobless claims increase, here are nine signs the recovery might be losing momentum. Leading indicators grow slowly for the second month in a row. A well known forecaster says "a slow-growth decade is already raging. You feel it everywhere. And it's going to get worse, much worse. A recession is virtually certain for 2012." However, corporate cash is at an all-time high. David Beckworth concludes that the root of our problems lies in weak demand. The Hartford finds that we are optimistic about our personal finances, and (gasp) more are saving for retirement. A University of Helsinki study makes me re-think the benefits of gross domestic product growth. Borders is forced to liquidate, and Wharton's Daniel Raff explains why this is bad for the entire publishing industry. Cisco cuts 6,500 jobs. Scott Grannis issues a money supply alert. Is Microsoft to blame for high unemployment?
Starting Up: Kauffman Wants Start-Up Legislation
The Kauffman Foundation proposes start-up legislation and laments that "start-ups are opening their doors with fewer employees and, once they get going, are hiring fewer people, regardless of the economic climate." A microlender gives us eight crucial elements of start-up success, such as: "You want to raise enough money initially so that you can hit a major milestone and have something to show investors." The founder of Cvent tells an inspiring story about his experiences as a start-up founder and dot-com era survivor. A 21-year-old sells her start-up for $21 million.

Mediapost.com reports that Facebook scores low in customer satisfaction. Ever wonder which are the most expensive keywords for GoogleAds? Kristi Hines gives us four ways to increase traffic with Stumbleupon. Tim Hartford explains why social marketing doesn't work. Example: "The first surprise, then, is that the typical Twitter cascade is both rare and tiny. Ninety per cent of Tweets are never re-tweeted, and most of the remainder are re-tweeted only by a person's immediate followers, not by those at two or three removes." More important: no new social networks were announced last week and, phew, a neuroscientist concludes that Google does not melt our memories.

Sylvia Ann Hewlett, consultant and author, writes about the benefits of coming out: "L.G.B.T. employees who stay on track and make it into senior management are much more likely to be out than closeted: 71 percent compared to 28 percent of their closeted counterparts."
Around The States and The World: Parking Tickets Mean Corruption
The Small Business Administration goes on tour. According to Urbanophile.com, our states give us a smaller scale model to find out what works and what doesn't and can serve as test beds for new policy ideas.

This Week's Bests

While many factors explain the paradox, the one most relevant to modern knowledge workers is the dual capacity of technology to aid and to distract. To resolve this paradox, my guiding principle for productivity applies: Mold your life so that the path of least resistance is the path of maximum productivity."
Philanthropy Idea: Tony Elumelu, investor and philanthropist, writes about the newly created African Markets Internship Programme: "At this moment, the A.M.I.P. is placing students from top African, European, and American business schools in highly structured programs with African companies. A.M.I.P. matches the unique skills of each intern with the particular needs of each host business to tackle their most pressing business problems."

 BODY:
What's affecting me, my clients and other small-business owners this week.
The Deficit: Can Small Businesses Reduce the National Debt?
President Obama blogs about deficit reduction: go big! About that debt ceiling: Ezra Klein asks the question we've all been asking. A new poll reports that the president edges out the G.O.P. on helping small businesses. A Congressman says that small businesses are crucial to reducing this country's debt. A massive deficit reduction plan is proposed by a staunch budget-cutter. Jared Bernstein says, "Consumer spending is way down, and it's not getting much of a boost from jobs and paychecks. Which means that fiscal stimulus is about the only game in town, or it would be if policy makers weren't spending practically every waking minute on budget cuts."
The Data: A $300,000 Home Sells for $16
Mortgage refinancings surge but Wells Fargo reports a sharp decline in new mortgages. Existing home sales decline. Architectural billings fall. June housing starts, however, are at a six-month high and some economists think we've hit a housing bottom. A guy in Texas buys a $300,000 home for $16. American builders were slightly more confident in July, and the remodeling industry sets a record. Commercial property prices are increasing.
The Economy: A Slow Growth Decade Is Raging
As weekly jobless claims increase, here are nine signs the recovery might be losing momentum. Leading indicators grow slowly for the second month in a row. A well known forecaster says "a slow-growth decade is already raging. You feel it everywhere. And it's going to get worse, much worse. A recession is virtually certain for 2012." However, corporate cash is at an all-time high. David Beckworth concludes that the root of our problems lies in weak demand. The Hartford finds that we are optimistic about our personal finances, and (gasp) more are saving for retirement. A University of Helsinki study makes me re-think the benefits of gross domestic product growth. Borders is forced to liquidate, and Wharton's Daniel Raff explains why this is bad for the entire publishing industry. Cisco cuts 6,500 jobs. Scott Grannis issues a money supply alert. Is Microsoft to blame for high unemployment?
Starting Up: Kauffman Wants Start-Up Legislation
The Kauffman Foundation proposes start-up legislation and laments that "start-ups are opening their doors with fewer employees and, once they get going, are hiring fewer people, regardless of the economic climate." A microlender gives us eight crucial elements of start-up success, such as: "You want to raise enough money initially so that you can hit a major milestone and have something to show investors." The founder of Cvent tells an inspiring story about his experiences as a start-up founder and dot-com era survivor. A 21-year-old sells her start-up for $21 million.

HEADLINE: Speaker Boehner's Big Gamble

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: In seeking to trip up President Obama in the debt-ceiling standoff, Speaker John A. Boehner may be putting his own majority at risk.

 BODY:
The Republican Speaker John A. Boehner, following the collapse of negotiations with President Obama, appears to be considering a path that would involve the House Republicans voting to raise the federal debt ceiling on their own terms, with little expectation of Democratic support.
It's unclear what Mr. Boehner's proposal, set to be unveiled tomorrow, will entail. Some reports suggest that it might consist of a six-month increase in the debt limit, which would put the issue into play again in January or February just as the Iowa caucuses were taking place. But Mr. Boehner also hinted that his plans could include elements of the Republicans' "cut, cap and balance" proposal, which was approved by the House last Tuesday but is stymied in the Senate.
If the House were able to approve any kind of increase to the debt limit, it would transfer focus to the White House and to the Senate. Mr. Obama has threatened to veto a short-term increase, but he would have little time left before the Treasury's Aug. 2 deadline and perhaps little leverage. The Democratic-led Senate would probably be the bigger barrier: it could move to vote on its own proposal, leading to a potential standoff between the two chambers. Still, Mr. Boehner could put Democrats on the defensive, if not necessarily into checkmate.
Mr. Boehner, however, has a math problem. Republicans have 240 members in the House, and 217 votes are currently required to pass a bill. That means they could lose at most 23 votes, or about 10 percent of their caucus, assuming they picked up no Democratic support.
Mr. Boehner had previously indicated, however, that at least 59 Republicans would not vote to raise the debt limit under any circumstances, a number that appears to coincide with the 60 Republicans who are members of the Tea Party Caucus. 
It is telling, perhaps, that the "cut, cap and balance" bill, although winning the support of all but 11 Republicans, did not raise the debt ceiling. Instead, it erected another barrier to it, requiring that a balanced budget amendment be approved by two-thirds majorities of both houses of Congress before additional borrowing authority was given to the Treasury.
In addition to Republicans who might defect for ideological reasons, some others might do so for electoral ones. Polling on the debt limit, which at earlier points had appeared to show a clear plurality of Americans against any increase, has now become highly ambiguous, with widely varying results depending on question wording. But both the debt limit increase and the spending cuts attached to it are likely to inspire mixed feelings in voters, and the roughly 75 Republicans serving in swing districts would need to consider the contours of the proposal carefully.
Thus, the sharp rhetoric in the Republican conference call today, in which Mr. Boehner and other Republican leaders took a number of swipes at Mr. Obama while also urging their members to unite behind the proposal. Kevin McCarthy, the Republican House majority whip, reportedly told his colleges that Mr. Obama was "throwing a fit because he's worried about the election." The idea seems to be that, if the most conservative Republicans aren't swayed by pressure from Wall Street, or from the potential effects to the economy, perhaps the only thing that can move them is the potential to force Mr. Obama to concede defeat.
But if the vote on Mr. Boehner's proposal fails, the risks to him are clear. It would presumably rattle markets, while making him look ineffectual. Most importantly, it would demonstrate that Republicans could not pass a bill, even through the House, without Democratic support, which would substantially reduce their leverage, as Mr. Boehner explicitly acknowledged in the conference call.
Then again, even if the Republican bill failed in the House, the counter-proposal by Democratic leaders in the Senate would reportedly focus solely on spending cuts with no tax increases. Although some of the savings the Senate bill might claim to achieve would reflect an accounting treatment of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, that seems as much like a victory for Republicans as a defeat.
Meanwhile, although calling Mr. Obama's bluff on his stated refusal to accept a short-term increase might qualify as a tactical victory for Republicans, its longer-term implications are ambiguous. Polls show that the public has a lukewarm view, at best, of how Mr. Obama has handled the negotiations. But the ratings for Republicans are much worse, calling into question whether they would benefit from another round of negotiations next winter under the heat lamp of the presidential primaries. There are increasing suggestions in the polling that the public could tell both Mr. Obama and the Republican Congress to find a new line of work.
Thus the real gamble that Mr. Boehner is taking: in seeking to trip up Mr. Obama, he may be putting his own majority at risk.

HEADLINE: Washington Is Out of Touch. How About Wall Street?

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: The risk of a default starts to increase exponentially as we get nearer to the deadline for raising the debt limit, but Wall Street may not be getting that message.

 BODY:
The stock market, digesting Friday afternoon's news of a breakdown in negotiations between President Obama and House Speaker John A. Boehner on plans to raise the federal debt limit, behaved relatively calmly today, with the Dow Jones shedding 0.7 percent to close at 12,593 points.
Should investors be more worried? Perhaps. Wall Street has trouble anticipating unprecedented events. The heuristic "Congress always comes through in the end" has pretty much always been right in the past. But one can point to a number of signs that this time is different.
In particular, there are several pieces of evidence that the Republican House of Representatives is extraordinarily conservative on fiscal issues. According to statistical systems like DW-Nominate, the median voter in the House -- who is a very conservative Republican because the Republicans have a reasonably large majority and have very few moderates -- may well be more conservative than at any point in the nation's history, although comparisons become harder to make the further you go back into the past.
But you have a Democratic president and a Democratic Senate -- and even if both President Obama and Harry Reid are quite amenable to compromise, there is still an enormous ideological gulf to bridge. Even just considering the House itself, the mechanics of passing a bill are problematic because some Republicans appear unwilling to sign onto any compromise at all, whether because of a philosophical opposition to raising the debt ceiling, the sense that Democrats will ultimately capitulate to a solution as far-reaching as 'cut, cap and balance,' distrust of Mr. Boehner and Mr. Obama, or some combination thereof. That means a bill will probably need the support of a significant number of Democrats -- and since Blue Dog Democrats are becoming an extinct species, that implies a significant number of liberal Democrats. To get something that is mutually agreeable to at least some members of Republican Study Committee and the Congressional Progressive Caucus is going to be extremely difficult.
Moreover, a precedent the markets may see as comforting -- the passage of the Troubled Assets Relief Program through Congress in late 2008 after the Dow Jones lost 777 points -- could reverberate upon the endgame in a negative way. There is evidence that voting for the bailout program may have been directly responsible for costing some members of Congress their seats. Although voting for a debt limit increase is not likely to be nearly so unpopular as bailing out the banks -- in fact, it's not clear where public opinion stands about it at this point -- that's something that many members of Congress, especially in swing districts, will have in the back of their minds.
Thus, it's no surprise that we've been through so many plans and so many backup plans. The backup plans to the backup plans -- Mr. Reid's in the Senate and Mr. Boehner's in the House -- are each already on unsure footing, according to various reports. In their speeches before the nation tonight, meanwhile, Mr. Boehner and Mr. Obama focused more on ideas that seem to have little chance of passing -- the Republican 'cut, cap and balance' bill, which has already been rejected by the Senate, and Mr. Obama's "grand bargain" -- hardly an encouraging sign with the deadline just a week away. (Stock market futures declined slightly as the speeches were being delivered.)
But let's abstract ourselves from the situation for a moment. (Just as someone on Wall Street could plausibly be naive about the political danger at hand, someone in Washington could easily be a bit too close to it.)
What we know is that any deal on the debt ceiling was likely to come later rather than earlier in the process -- that's the nature of almost any complicated and high-stakes negotiation.
Suppose you tried to construct a simple statistical model predicting the likelihood of a debt default. What I'd probably do is something like this. Assume the negotiation period lasts for 30 days -- from July 3 through Aug. 2. On the first day, there is a 1 percent chance of a deal getting done. This fraction rises by 1 percent every day that a deal fails to be completed. So on the second day, there is a 2 percent chance of a deal getting done (if one hasn't gotten done already) ... up to a 30 percent chance of a deal being closed if the final 24 hours if we've gotten that close to the brink.
Assuming that the failure to close a deal within the 30-day window is tantamount to a debt default, that would produce a chart that looks like this:
The salient features of this model are as follows. First, the initial estimate of default risk is quite low, and remains quite low for some time. It doesn't mean that much when 5 or 10 or even 20 days go by without a deal because a deal was unlikely to have been closed so quickly in the first place. But second, the risk of a default starts to increase exponentially as we get nearer to the deadline. Not only are there fewer days remaining, but each day that passes without a deal is of more consequence. As leaders fail to close a deal with more and more pressure upon them, it's a sign that something has gone seriously wrong with the political system.
Hypothetically, the model would posit that the failure to have closed a deal today, July 25, had increased the risk of a default by a little less than 2 percent. But that was enough to send the Dow down by 88 points. If you do the extrapolation, it implies that the markets could lose another 4,400 points or so if a deal fails to be completed by the deadline.
The real world, of course, is considerably more complicated. You'd have to account for possibilities such as that the Treasury actually has another week or so worth of slack, and that Mr. Obama would cite Constitutional provisions and would act to prevent a default if he were left with no other choice.
The point is, however, that it does not necessarily tell us very much that markets have been "well-behaved" so far. We're just now nearing the inflection point where we go from brinksmanship -- a negotiating tactic -- to the risk of an actual disaster.
What we should see, of course, is the pressure tending to mount on the markets with each remaining day, although the trajectory could be noisy within any 24-hour period because of contingencies related to the negotiations and to the broader economy.
If markets don't start to react more strongly, the appropriate conclusion may be that Wall Street is as out of touch as Washington.

HEADLINE: Washington Is Out of Touch. How About Wall Street?

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: The risk of a default starts to increase exponentially as we get nearer to the deadline for raising the debt limit, but Wall Street may not be getting that message.

 BODY:
The stock market, digesting Friday afternoon's news of a breakdown in negotiations between President Obama and the House speaker, John A. Boehner, on plans to raise the federal debt limit, behaved relatively calmly today, with the Dow Jones shedding 0.7 percent to close at 12,593 points.
Should investors be more worried? Perhaps. Wall Street has trouble anticipating unprecedented events. The heuristic "Congress always comes through in the end" has pretty much always been right in the past. But one can point to a number of signs that this time is different.
In particular, there are several pieces of evidence that the Republican House of Representatives is extraordinarily conservative on fiscal issues. According to statistical systems like DW-Nominate, the median voter in the House -- who is a very conservative Republican because the Republicans have a reasonably large majority and have very few moderates -- may well be more conservative than at any point in the nation's history, although comparisons become harder to make the further you go back into the past.
But you have a Democratic president and a Democratic Senate -- and even if both President Obama and Harry Reid are quite amenable to compromise, there is still an enormous ideological gulf to bridge. Even just considering the House itself, the mechanics of passing a bill are problematic because some Republicans appear unwilling to sign onto any compromise at all, whether because of a philosophical opposition to raising the debt ceiling, the sense that Democrats will ultimately capitulate to a solution as far-reaching as "cut, cap and balance," distrust of Mr. Boehner and Mr. Obama, or some combination thereof. That means a bill will probably need the support of a significant number of Democrats -- and because Blue Dog Democrats are becoming an extinct species, that implies a significant number of liberal Democrats.

HEADLINE: Volleys Fly in House Debate on E.P.A. and Interior

BYLINE: JOANNA M. FOSTER


HIGHLIGHT: The fiercest debate over an appropriations bill seemed to center on 39 riders that would hobble the regulation of big polluters and prevent the Department of Interior from listing new endangered species.

 BODY:
The House Representatives began heated debate on Monday on an appropriations bill for the Department of Interior and Environmental Protection Agency that pits Republican critics of environmental regulation against Democrats who fear that landmark protections could be gutted. 
The legislation, which could come to a floor vote this week, would cut Interior's funds by $750 million or about 7 percent and the E.P.A.'s budget by $1.5 billion or 18 percent. (The latter cut would bring reductions in the E.P.A.'s budget to 34 percent over two years.)
Yet the fiercest debate seemed to center on 39 riders attached to the bill that would hobble the regulation of big polluters and direct an additional $55 million in subsidies to oil and gas companies. 
Representative James Moran, Democrat of Virginia, pronounced it "a sad day for the environment, and for America's great national and cultural heritage." Citing both the cuts and the abundance of riders associated with special interests, he said the bill "falls far short of meeting our responsibility to protect and wisely use our nation's natural resources."
Among the 39 riders are measures that would open up uranium mining in lands adjacent to the Grand Canyon, limit the E.P.A.'s oversight powers over mountaintop removal mining and free oil companies from meeting Clean Air Act standards for offshore drilling projects. 
Perhaps one of the most striking measures is a rider that would prevent the Fish and Wildlife Service from adding new species to the endangered species list, upgrading species listings or protecting vital habitat by eliminating all funds for those activities. 
Representative Mike Simpson, the Idaho Republican who is chairman of the Interior and Environment Appropriation Subcommittee, said that of the 2,018 species currently listed, only 21 had recovered -- a result that shows that the project is a failure, he contended. "Any other program with such a poor rate of success would have been terminated," Mr. Simpson said. 
Representative Moran countered that at least 260 species in need of listing status that would receive no protection if the bill passed. 
Mr. Simpson also said that regulatory enforcement by an "overfunded" E.P.A. was creating economic uncertainty and killing jobs. But Representative Tim Bishop, Democrat of New York, argued that the economy of his Long Island district depended on clean water, clean air and swimmable beaches. Any tax cuts adopted for small businesses would be irrelevant if those small businesses had no income because of worsening pollution, he said. 
Representative Harold Rogers, a Kentucky Republican, said the proposed cuts in the E.P.A. budget were simply "common sense."
"The E.P.A. has lost grip with economic reality and is having destructive effects on the nation's economic recovery," he said.
Representative Betty McCollum, Democrat of Minnesota, offered still another perspective, likening the legislation to a toxic Superfund site in need of remediation. "This is the most extreme piece of anti-environmental legislation ever to come to the floor of the House," she said.
President Obama has threatened to veto any bill that hamstrings the E.P.A. in exercising its regulatory powers.

HEADLINE: Best Political Quotes of the Weekend

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: The Caucus has collected the best of the weekend's political conversation.

Watch the latest video at video.foxnews.com
Miss all the best political quotes while you were trying to stay cool this weekend? Don't worry about it. The Caucus has collected the best of the political conversation.
1. The weekend was dominated by the back-and-forth over the effort to reach a deal on the nation's debt. Here are a few of the most significant statements by the nation's political leaders:
* Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader: "I have said repeatedly, including last night and again today, that I will not support any agreement that fails to raise the debt ceiling though the end of 2012," Reid said. "Anything less than that will fail to provide the certainty that the markets - and the world - are looking for, risking an immediate downgrade of America's credit rating."
* House Speaker John Boehner: "I would prefer to have a bipartisan approach to solve this problem. If that is not possible, I and my Republican colleagues in the House are prepared to move on our own."
* Bill Daley, White House chief of staff: "Right now, you've got three things that must be done -- the debt ceiling must be extended, it should not be short-term, it must be beyond 2000 -- into 2013 to continue this uncertainty."
* Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the minority leader: "I applaud Senator Reid for putting forward an approach to reduce the deficit that protects Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. The major features of Senator Reid's proposal have already been supported by Republicans in the past months."
2. Some of the most interesting conversation over the weekend took place on Twitter as staff members for the White House and the Republicans in Congress argued on behalf of their principals. Here is an exchange between Dan Pfeiffer, the White House communications director, and Brad Dayspring, the communications director for Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the majority leader in the House.
* Pfeiffer: "Three times the GOP has walked away from a deficit deal bc they wouldnt ask wealthy and corps to pay a little more. Too bad for the country."
* Dayspring: "And then he offered a compromise middleground with POTUS 2 weeks ago to avoid default and #Obama got pissed -"Call my bluff" @pfeiffer44"
* Pfeiffer: "@BDayspring I don't think I have ever heard a staffer from any party describe any President of the United States that way publicly."
* Dayspring: "The description was of the reaction to a middle ground compromise offer from Cantor, not a personal critique. @pfeiffer44"
3. Even as most of the conversation over the weekend was in Washington, there were still interesting exchanges between Republican presidential candidates. One of the most engaging was a running commentary between Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota and Tim Pawlenty, the former governor of Minnesota. Both are rivals for the Republican presidential nomination. And both are eager to prove their mettle by winning the Iowa straw poll in Ames next month.
Mrs. Bachmann started the exchange off by suggesting that Mr. Pawlenty's views were similar to those of President Obama. "Governor Pawlenty said in 2006, "'The era of small government is over,'" she noted. "'The government has to be more proactive and more aggressive.' That's the same philosophy that, under President Obama, has brought us record deficits, massive unemployment and an unconstitutional health care plan."
A spokesman for Mr. Pawlenty, who has tried to make his executive experience an asset in the race, responded: "Congresswoman Bachmann has her facts wrong," said the spokesman, Alex Conant. "The truth is that there is very little difference between Governor Pawlenty and Congresswoman Bachmann on their issue positions. The difference is that when Governor Pawlenty was scoring conservative victories to cut spending, pass market-based health care reform and transform a supreme court from liberal to conservative, and was elected twice in a very blue state, Congresswoman Bachmann was giving speeches and offering failed amendments."
A spokeswoman for Mrs. Bachmann came back again in another statement: "Governor Pawlenty has changed his positions in recent years, but he can't run from his big government record as governor of Minnesota that left the state's budget in a multibillion dollar mess," said the spokeswoman, Alice Stewart. "That's not executive experience we need."
4. Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska, also chimed in this weekend, writing on her Facebook page that Mr. Obama should be considered a lame duck president. "This is the same president who wants to slam Americans with tax hikes to cover his reckless spending, but has threatened to veto a bill proposing a balanced budget amendment," she wrote. "This is the same president who hasn't put forward a responsible plan himself, but has rejected reasonable proposals that would tackle our debt. This is the same president who still refuses to understand that the American electorate rejected his big government agenda last November."
Ms. Palin urged Republican lawmakers to stand strong in the debt negotiations with Mr. Obama, saying "Thank you, GOP House leaders. Please don't get wobbly on us now. 2012 can't come soon enough."
5. Also making a bit of news was Rick Perry, the governor of Texas, who is considering jumping into the presidential contest. In an interview with the Union Leader, a New Hampshire newspaper, he defended his conservative, religious beliefs but said he would not try to impose them on others. "I can no sooner separate my public life from my values - I can't do that," Mr. Perry told the newspaper. "But am I going to say that if you don't believe this particular way, you're wrong? Far be it from me. The idea that I have an idea about who's going to go to heaven and who's not, I don't. That is way above my capability."

HEADLINE: Best Political Quotes of the Weekend

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: The Caucus has collected the best of the weekend's political conversation.

Watch the latest video at video.foxnews.com
Miss all the best political quotes while you were trying to stay cool this weekend? Don't worry about it. The Caucus has collected the best of the political conversation.
1. The weekend was dominated by the back-and-forth over the effort to reach a deal on the nation's debt. Here are a few of the most significant statements by the nation's political leaders:
* Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader: "I have said repeatedly, including last night and again today, that I will not support any agreement that fails to raise the debt ceiling though the end of 2012," Mr. Reid said. "Anything less than that will fail to provide the certainty that the markets - and the world - are looking for, risking an immediate downgrade of America's credit rating."
* House Speaker John Boehner: "I would prefer to have a bipartisan approach to solve this problem. If that is not possible, I and my Republican colleagues in the House are prepared to move on our own."
* Bill Daley, White House chief of staff: "This has to be two steps," Mr. Daley said. "But the second step must get us through '13 without having to go through this ridiculous fight over extending the debt ceiling."
* Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the minority leader: "I applaud Senator Reid for putting forward an approach to reduce the deficit that protects Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. The major features of Senator Reid's proposal have already been supported by Republicans in the past months."
2. Some of the most interesting conversation over the weekend took place on Twitter as staff members for the White House and the Republicans in Congress argued on behalf of their principals. Here is an exchange between Dan Pfeiffer, the White House communications director, and Brad Dayspring, the communications director for Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the majority leader in the House.
* Pfeiffer: "Three times the GOP has walked away from a deficit deal bc they wouldnt ask wealthy and corps to pay a little more. Too bad for the country."
* Dayspring: "And then he offered a compromise middleground with POTUS 2 weeks ago to avoid default and #Obama got pissed -"Call my bluff" @pfeiffer44"
* Pfeiffer: "@BDayspring I don't think I have ever heard a staffer from any party describe any President of the United States that way publicly."
* Dayspring: "The description was of the reaction to a middle ground compromise offer from Cantor, not a personal critique. @pfeiffer44"
3. Even as most of the conversation over the weekend was in Washington, there were still interesting exchanges between Republican presidential candidates. One of the most engaging was a running commentary between Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota and Tim Pawlenty, the former governor of Minnesota. Both are rivals for the Republican presidential nomination. And both are eager to prove their mettle by winning the Iowa straw poll in Ames next month.
Mrs. Bachmann started the exchange off by suggesting that Mr. Pawlenty's views were similar to those of President Obama. "Governor Pawlenty said in 2006, "'The era of small government is over,'" she noted. "'The government has to be more proactive and more aggressive.' That's the same philosophy that, under President Obama, has brought us record deficits, massive unemployment and an unconstitutional health care plan."
A spokesman for Mr. Pawlenty, who has tried to make his executive experience an asset in the race, responded: "Congresswoman Bachmann has her facts wrong," said the spokesman, Alex Conant. "The truth is that there is very little difference between Governor Pawlenty and Congresswoman Bachmann on their issue positions. The difference is that when Governor Pawlenty was scoring conservative victories to cut spending, pass market-based health care reform and transform a supreme court from liberal to conservative, and was elected twice in a very blue state, Congresswoman Bachmann was giving speeches and offering failed amendments."
A spokeswoman for Mrs. Bachmann came back again in another statement: "Governor Pawlenty has changed his positions in recent years, but he can't run from his big government record as governor of Minnesota that left the state's budget in a multibillion dollar mess," said the spokeswoman, Alice Stewart. "That's not executive experience we need."
4. Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska, also chimed in this weekend, writing on her Facebook page that Mr. Obama should be considered a lame duck president. "This is the same president who wants to slam Americans with tax hikes to cover his reckless spending, but has threatened to veto a bill proposing a balanced budget amendment," she wrote. "This is the same president who hasn't put forward a responsible plan himself, but has rejected reasonable proposals that would tackle our debt. This is the same president who still refuses to understand that the American electorate rejected his big government agenda last November."
Ms. Palin urged Republican lawmakers to stand strong in the debt negotiations with Mr. Obama, saying "Thank you, GOP House leaders. Please don't get wobbly on us now. 2012 can't come soon enough."
5. Also making a bit of news was Rick Perry, the governor of Texas, who is considering jumping into the presidential contest. In an interview with the Union Leader, a New Hampshire newspaper, he defended his conservative, religious beliefs but said he would not try to impose them on others. "I can no sooner separate my public life from my values - I can't do that," Mr. Perry told the newspaper. "But am I going to say that if you don't believe this particular way, you're wrong? Far be it from me. The idea that I have an idea about who's going to go to heaven and who's not, I don't. That is way above my capability."

HEADLINE: Congressional Week Ahead: Debt Deadlines, Almost


HIGHLIGHT: Congress takes the debate down to the wire on a formula to raise the debt ceiling, cut spending and raise revenues.

 BODY:
Congress heads into one of its most intensely watched weeks in recent history as top lawmakers try to solve the debt limit dilemma that has overwhelmed every other issue for the moment.
Anything else occurring on Capitol Hill over the next few days will be barely noticed as two veteran Congressional operators - Speaker John A. Boehner and Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader - try to navigate the political and economic minefield before them and their colleagues and wind up with an increase in the federal debt ceiling.
Experienced lawmakers predicted the crisis would pass and a debt ceiling hike would occur, as it always has before.
"I think we'll get there," said Senator Tom Coburn, the conservative Oklahoma Republican, on NBC's "Meet the Press."
The debt limit brinksmanship has reached new levels and just a few days were separating the United States government from a historic default that could rattle economies around the globe.
Both Democrats and Republicans plan to brief their returning - and anxious - lawmakers Monday on what lies ahead and what their specific plans are for reaching a successful conclusion.
In a conference call with his conservative rank-and-file, Mr. Boehner on Sunday warned some of them that they might have to give ground to get a debt limit increase to the president's desk.
"I do think there is a path," Mr. Boehner said during the call, according to those familiar with what took place. "But it's going to require us to stand together as a team. It's going to require some of you to make some sacrifices.
"If we stand together as a team, our leverage is maximized, and they have to deal with us," he said. "If we're divided, our leverage gets minimized."
Mr. Boehner needs to begin moving his proposal quickly to meet his own party's rules for transparency as well as to give the Senate time to act. Mr. Reid has to contend with procedural rules that allow the minority party to slow things considerably if Republicans choose to do so.
It is crunch time on Capitol Hill and the next few days hold significant consequences for the nation and the political careers of those who determine the outcome of this legislative cliffhanger.

HEADLINE: Ads Attack Republicans on Debt Ceiling

BYLINE: JENNIFER STEINHAUER


HIGHLIGHT: The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is making automated calls to voters in 60 congressional districts held by Republicans.

 BODY:
The debt ceiling debacle is now the subject of political ads against Republican members of the House.
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has begun making automated calls in 60 Republican-held Congressional districts that were won by President Obama in 2008. The ad copy suggests that those members are refusing to budge on negotiations to lift the debt ceiling by Aug. 3, negotiations that stalled last week after Speaker John A. Boehner walked away from his negotiations with Mr. Obama. 
Those voters who answer their phone will hear: 
Hi, this is Travis calling on behalf of the D.C.C.C. Congressman X and Speaker Boehner would rather our economy default just to protect tax breaks for big oil companies and billionaire jet-owners. Republicans quit negotiating with President Obama on raising the debt ceiling.
This is serious. X's billionaire buddies will be O.K. But we will pay the price if government can't pay its bills. Our Social Security and Medicare benefits are at risk. Interest rates would spike for our credit cards, car loans and mortgages. Our 401(k) retirement accounts would drop. And, gas and food prices would skyrocket. Enough is enough. Call Congressman X and tell him not to gamble our future to protect tax breaks for big oil and billionaires.
Republican response ads cannot be far behind. "Democrats won't quit spending money we don't have," said Paul Lindsay, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, "and they won't quit raising taxes and burdening Americans with policies that make a bad economy even worse."

HEADLINE: Debt Crisis Has Already Hurt Economy, Bloomberg Says

BYLINE: JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ


HIGHLIGHT: In a speech, the mayor will indirectly criticize President Obama and Congressional leaders, suggesting they have behaved irresponsibly and irrationally.

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, in a blistering critique of Washington politics, will argue on Monday that the failure of national leaders to reach an agreement on the debt ceiling has already done damage to the economy.
While he will not name names, Mr. Bloomberg, in a speech in Midtown Manhattan, will indirectly criticize President Obama and Congressional leaders, suggesting they have behaved irresponsibly and irrationally.
"That the United States of America has come this close to defaulting on its debts - a failure that would have potentially disastrous economic consequences for us all, including New Yorkers - ought to be all the evidence anyone needs that there's something profoundly wrong in Washington," Mr. Bloomberg will say, according to a copy of his speech obtained by The New York Times. 
Mr. Bloomberg, a successful businessman, has often used his pulpit to play the role of economic referee, but he has grown particularly irritated in recent days after the collapse of budget talks between Mr. Obama and the House speaker, John A. Boehner.
On Monday, Republican and Democratic Congressional leaders were working separately to prepare backup plans to avert a default.
In the speech, Mr. Bloomberg says the uncertainty has already inflicted pain on the economy, with employers hesitating to hire because they lack confidence in Washington to solve the crisis.
"Every day this standoff goes on, more seeds of doubt are sown - not just among American companies, but among investors around the world," he says in the speech.
While Mr. Bloomberg's speech is short on specifics, he says tackling the federal deficit will require a combination of tax increases and spending cuts. Anything short of that, he says, will jeopardize the status of the dollar as the world's reserve currency.
"We're making a mistake if we think that American dominance on the world economic stage is inevitable," Mr. Bloomberg says. "Our national leaders need to stop staring down the other side and waiting for them to blink."

HEADLINE: Student Reading Contest Winner | On Counterfeit Merchandise

BYLINE: HOLLY EPSTEIN OJALVO


HIGHLIGHT: Drum roll, please &#8230; here is the third winner to date in our New York Times as Your Summer Reading contest. 

 BODY:
She's been a runner-up the past two weeks, and now she's our Week 3 contest winner. We'll tell you more about her, and share her winning entry, in a minute.
But first, we want to acknowledge the 71 students who wrote in to participate in the third week of the contest. They were interested in a wide range of New York Times articles, on topics like tiny toads, swimming with sharks, sidewalk advertising, playgrounds, the Internet and memory.
We received not one but two articulate entries from a writer named Calvin, both on the national debt, and a discussion about the Women's World Cup from the obviously passionate Arsenije. The entries from these two writers nicely demonstrate the breadth of interest, and strong writing skills, exhibited by our student contest participants. 
Our runners-up this week are all from the Baccalaureate School for Global Education in Astoria, Queens, whose rising eighth graders are participating as a summer assignment. They are:

        
Nicholas, who self-identifies as a "beta male."
        
Munawar R., who shared his admiration for meteorologists.
        
Raiaan, who is concerned about the famine in Somalia.
And now, for this week's winner. 
Aglaia, 15, of Forest Hills, N.Y., who last week philosophized about noise and the previous week about Cy Twombly, evidently has wide-ranging interests. In her winning entry this week, she delved into the issues raised in an article about counterfeit merchandise:
A true New Yorker knows where to find the best restaurants, museums, shopping centers, and now, places to buy counterfeit purses. Selling counterfeits of designer purses is nothing new. It has become "an industry" spreading from downtown to Time Square. This article caught my attention because I'm familiar with the world of counterfeit purses. While I've never bought (nor sold) any bootlegged products, I know plenty of people who have been coaxed by low prices and adept salesmen and have bought counterfeit purses.
This article is extremely relatable. The description is true to reality and also a bit humorous, though it doesn't take away from the gravity of the issue itself. A year ago, I went to Chinatown with my mom. We witnessed, firsthand, venders scurrying around slyly trying to sell their goods. I begged unsuccessfully for a counterfeit purse since my friends had designer handbags (real or fake; I didn't care.)
Still, let's face it; we're not fooling anyone with our bootlegged products. Consumers know that their purchases are not genuine. Many just cannot afford a real one. Our psyche tricks us into thinking that we'll fit in if we keep up with the latest trends. Thus, we need a look-a-like designer bag to stay in the loop.
The problem with counterfeiters is that they take business away from actual brands. However, our main concern shouldn't be the "cat-and-mouse game" the author describes. I actually sympathize with the venders. They're only the middlemen, doing the painfully arduous task of dodging the police and settling deals. Additionally, many venders are immigrants, legal and illegal, who speak little or broken English. For them, they just trying to make ends meet.
The origins of the problem stem from foreign manufacturers who knowingly undermining brand-name companies. Nevertheless, consumers share an equal amount of blame. I've learned in history class that our economy is controlled by the dynamics of supply and demand. In this case, demand creates its own supply. If people want fake purses, manufacturers will continue to produce and wholesalers will continue to import, enlarging the problem.
I propose three alternatives to harness demand for illegal counterfeits: 1) Crackdown on wholesalers who import illegal products. 2) Impose penalties on guilty consumers. 3) Educate our generation and teach them, like my mom has taught me, that we, as individuals, are worth much more than anything we own.
If that isn't food for thought, we don't know what is.

HEADLINE: Shares Down Moderately on U.S. Debt Talks

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
The lack of a deal to raise the debt limit in the United States hung over the financial markets on Monday, unsettling investors because of the uncertainty but not provoking a major reaction in bond or stock prices.
House Republicans and Senate Democrats were readying competing plans in an effort to avoid a federal default next week. Republicans were trying to sell to their rank and file a two-step plan that would allow the federal debt limit to immediately rise by about $1 trillion and tie a second increase next year to more deficit reductions.
''We are being subjected to headline after headline, interview after interview, extolling the horrors of what happens if the debt ceiling isn't raised,'' said Hank Smith, Haverford's chief investment officer of equity. 
''Yet the market is ignoring this and for the most sensitive part of the market, the bond market, it is a big yawn,'' he added.
At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 88.36 points, or 0.70 percent, to 12,592.80. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 7.59 points, or 0.56 percent, to 1,337.43. The Nasdaq was down 16.03 points, or 0.56 percent, to 2,842.80.
The unease was also signified by investors turning to the perceived safety of gold and by a slight rise in Treasury yields.
Stocks had declined sharply at the opening before retracing some ground.
''Obviously the market was selling off, but during the course of the day I think that market participants were getting a growing sense that something will be carved out, that there will be something that that will placate markets before the deadlines,'' said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist for Prudential Financial.
The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 11/32 to 101 1/32, pushing the yield up to 3 percent, from 2.96 percent late Friday. Guy LeBas, the chief fixed-income strategist for Janney Montgomery Scott, said the Aug. 2 deadline was forming a ''gigantic overhang'' in investors' minds. He said that while the risk grows day by day, ''a default is not the most likely outcome right now.''
Investors were becoming leery of Washington's ability to come to an agreement on a debt deal, said Kevin H. Giddis, the executive managing director and president for fixed-income capital markets at Morgan Keegan & Company, in a research note.
''The world owns our debt and wants to continue to hold it as long as we can find a way to keep issuing what was once considered, and likely still is, the safest debt on the planet,'' Mr. Giddis wrote in a research note.
Investors have driven gold above $1,600 an ounce in recent days amid the uncertainty.
''With little optimism on U.S. debt talks at the moment, the gold price acutely reflects investor nervousness that limited progress will be made before the Aug. 2 deadline,'' Edel Tully, a strategist at UBS, wrote in a research note. ''This nervousness is in many ways justified as the threat of a U.S. ratings downgrade is very real.''
The markets have also been buffeted by the uncertainty around Greece, where European leaders last week were able to agree on a bailout package. Still, on Monday, Moody's downgraded Greece's local and foreign currency bond ratings, saying that there were still implications for private creditors of ''substantial economic losses'' on their holdings of government debt.
In Europe, the FTSE 100 index of leading British shares closed down 0.16 percent at 5,925.26, while Germany's DAX was up 0.25 percent to 7,344.54. The CAC 40 in France ended 0.77 percent lower at 3,812.97.
The euro was trading slightly lower against the dollar, at $1.4374.
The spread on Italian and Spanish bonds against German bonds widened on Monday.
Earlier in Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 closed down 0.8 percent at 10,050.01, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index lost 0.7 percent to 22,293.29.
China's Shanghai Composite Index slid nearly 3 percent to 2,688.75. The Associated Press reported it was the biggest one-day loss in six months.

HEADLINE: You Pursue a Wall Street Cabal. Or Do You?

BYLINE: By SETH SCHIESEL

 BODY:
For 250 years Bydder Financial has been one of the most powerful forces in the global economy. It has underwritten the expansion of American multinational corporations, shaping the destiny of smaller countries to suit the priorities of the United States and of Bydder itself. From its august headquarters on Broad Street, barely a block from the New York Stock Exchange, Bydder stands astride international commerce like a colossus (or perhaps Croesus).
So when the firm offered me a job recently and invited me to an orientation session, I leapt at the opportunity for a glimpse inside one of the most fabled and feared forces on Wall Street. Yet by the end of the afternoon I found myself embroiled in an ancient conspiracy involving secret payoffs, a battle for control of third world natural resources, and a conflict between Bydder and a militant anticorporate underground. 
O.K., fine, Bydder is not a real company; there is no secretive, incredibly wealthy downtown finance cabal that has been plotting world domination since before the American Revolution. But the 14th-floor conference room I visited was real. The tall, blond woman who met me there and introduced me to other recruits was certainly real. While subsequently investigating the streets and parks of the financial district, the phone calls and text messages we received were definitely real (as are the Web sites for Bydder and its foes). The pamphlet-wielding agitator we encountered on Broadway and the undercover anti-Bydder operative we met in a bar were real. And by the end of the afternoon the choices we had to make about our core values and loyalties felt a lot like moral and ethical reality.
It is all part of ''Red Cloud Rising: The Fifth Wall,'' an innovative, genre-defying entertainment created by the director, producer and actress Gyda Arber. Call it an alternate-reality game played in primary reality. Call it avant-garde performance art. Call it whatever you want. I just call it brilliant.
''Red Cloud Rising'' is theater outside the theater. It unfolds like real life, especially in the way we deal with people these days, not just in person but through phone calls, texts and e-mails. But it is more personally engaging than traditional theater. You can't just sit back and watch (or fall asleep) during the performance. You have to get up on your feet and participate. You have to walk around discovering landmarks, uncovering clues and solving puzzles. You have to talk to people. You have to make decisions.
In short, the main character in ''Red Cloud Rising'' is you.
That can be a simultaneously exhilarating and daunting proposition. In ''Red Cloud'' the traditional gamer is wrenched off the sofa, and the traditional theatergoer is plucked from a comfortable seat in the darkness and placed onstage. And you find yourself on one of the most dynamic, exciting stages in the world, the streets of New York City. So while you pass through the rabbit hole into a series of clandestine meetings and alternately cryptic and frantic phone calls and texts, you are surrounded by an unending cast of extras: people going about their everyday lives.
That means that everyone's experience is different, and it also means that you may not be quite sure where the game ends, and reality begins again. While I scurried along Maiden Lane clutching a box of purloined, incriminating financial statements, I was accosted by two large men in a black S.U.V. who wanted to know if they could pull into the garage I was walking past. Were they a Bydder security team keeping tabs on me? A rogue anti-Bydder cell after my stolen balance sheets?
Suspicious and entirely caught up in the fantasy, I almost blurted out in response, ''Who are you working for?'' Good thing I didn't, because it turned out that they were just two guys from New Jersey trying to find a parking spot.
Or so it seemed.
No video game and no traditional stage play can deliver this sort of immersion, yet ''Red Cloud'' clearly draws heavily from the design vernacular of both disciplines. (Though it takes place in Manhattan, ''Red Cloud Rising'' is being produced as part of the Game Play festival at the Brick Theater in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.)
As it unfolds, you become aware that Ms. Arber has created a rich, internally consistent back story that intertwines real history and geography -- and real people and places -- with fictional storytelling. Rather than impose an arbitrary plot onto reality, Ms. Arber has picked out a few cornerstones of reality, then layered her imagination atop them. Sidewalks, cemeteries and dry cleaners all play roles, as do professional actors, including Ms. Arber as the mysterious recruiter Charlotte Gaffney.
A day after I thought ''Red Cloud'' was over, I received an e-mail from Ms. Gaffney welcoming me to the Bydder family. ''As a member of the Bydder team, you have a lifetime tenure at our company,'' she wrote. ''Your assignments will come when you least expect them, as will your rewards.''
Then, a week later, I received another e-mail, this time from the anti-Bydder conspirator Rene Veart.
It contained only one line: ''Do you seek the truth?''
''Red Cloud Rising: The Fifth Wall'' runs through Saturday and is part of the Game Play festival at the Brick Theater; (718) 907-6189, bricktheater.com.

HEADLINE: Envoy Says U.S. Will Start Afghan Pullout, Slowly

BYLINE: By ALISSA J. RUBIN; Jack Healy contributed reporting.

 BODY:
KABUL, Afghanistan -- The new American ambassador to Afghanistan took the oath of office on Monday, saying in a succinct but personal speech that the United States would start to pull back from its engagement here -- but only gradually.
The ambassador, Ryan C. Crocker, a diplomat with deep experience in some of the most difficult postings of the last 40 years, spoke to embassy staff members and senior diplomats at a moment when the Afghan war, while incrementally improved in terms of NATO casualties, is claiming a rising number of civilian lives and the Afghan government remains shaky. 
He left no doubt that he saw this chapter of American policy as one when ''it is time for us to step back and for the Afghans to step forward, and they are doing so.''
At the same time, he warned that Western powers needed to ''proceed carefully'' and said there would ''be no rush for the exits.''
''The way we do this in the months ahead will have consequences far beyond Afghanistan and far into the future,'' Mr. Crocker said. ''Frankly, we left the wrong way in the early 1990s, and we all know the history of those decisions: the civil war, the rise of the Taliban, sanctuary for Al Qaeda, and 9/11.''
Mr. Crocker, the sixth United States ambassador to serve in Afghanistan since the ouster of the Taliban government in 2001, takes over from Ambassador Karl W. Eikenberry. The turnover at the embassy coincides with a change in the NATO military leadership. Gen. John R. Allen took over last week from Gen. David H. Petraeus as the commander for the war in Afghanistan. General Petraeus will still be involved in the Afghan fight, but as director of the Central Intelligence Agency.
Ambassador Crocker comes to the job here after serving for decades in the Arab world, as well as Iran and Pakistan. He had retired from the State Department in 2009 after serving as ambassador in Baghdad and had become a dean at Texas A&M University.
This spring, Mr. Crocker agreed to come out of retirement to take over in Kabul and indicated on Monday that he felt a personal sense of duty to do so. ''Almost 10 years ago, Ambassador Pearce and I traveled to New York on U.N. business,'' he said, referring to David D. Pearce, the new assistant chief of mission, who helped administer the oath on Monday. ''We arrived on the morning of 9/11, just as the towers were hit, and we watched the collapse from the Queensboro Bridge.''
Mr. Crocker reopened the American Embassy in Kabul in 2002, six months after the fall of the Taliban.
In a message as much to Pakistan and Iran, Afghanistan's neighbors, as to the this country, he took the opportunity to rule out the possibility of permanent bases on Afghan soil, saying unequivocally that it was not part of the United States agenda.
''We have no interest in using Afghanistan as a platform to project influence into neighboring countries,'' he said.
Left unsaid was that long-term bases were another matter, and that if America was providing military and police training to Afghanistan over the next 10 to 12 years -- as has been suggested by Afghanistan's national security adviser in recent days -- American military and police trainers would need to live on bases and would need to have safe passage for their supplies.
Similarly, if America is to help protect Afghanistan from terrorists, it will need to have launching platforms for its fleet of surveillance aircraft, which have proved instrumental in detecting insurgent movement, especially near the border.
Ambassador Crocker emphasized the importance to the West of leaving a country that is able to sustain itself -- with a working government, an economic base and a military. At the moment, the three branches of government are at a crisis point, with the Parliament at odds with the president and the judiciary.
Mr. Crocker made no mention by name of President Hamid Karzai, suggesting that American interests have less to do with individual politicians than with workable government systems. The goal, he said, is to have ''capable, sustainable and stable Afghan institutions.''
A few hours later, the ambassador was at the presidential palace, a large complex built around rose gardens and shaded by tall pines, where he was welcomed by an honor guard and then went to a reception room to present his credentials to Mr. Karzai -- a formality, but one that allowed the two men, who had known each other in 2002, to be reintroduced.
An American official who was present described Mr. Karzai as ''upbeat'' and said that Mr. Crocker took the opportunity to introduce his new senior team, among them four diplomats as well as several other senior Foreign Service officials.
Elsewhere, an American helicopter was brought down by enemy fire in Kunar Province, said Master Sgt. Nicholas Conner, a spokesman at NATO's Regional Command East. A quick-response force responding to the attack was fired on while coming to the aid of the crew of the helicopter, which crashed about 100 yards outside the base. All of the coalition soldiers returned safely, Sergeant Conner said.

HEADLINE: The Help-Wanted Sign Comes With a Frustrating Asterisk

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
The unemployed need not apply.
That is the message being broadcast by many of the nation's employers, making it even more difficult for 14 million jobless Americans to get back to work.
A recent review of job vacancy postings on popular sites like Monster.com, CareerBuilder and Craigslist revealed hundreds that said employers would consider (or at least ''strongly prefer'') only people currently employed or just recently laid off.
Unemployed workers have long suspected that the gaping holes on their resumes left them less attractive to employers. But with the country in the worst jobs crisis since the Great Depression, many had hoped employers would be more forgiving.
''I feel like I am being shunned by our entire society,'' said Kelly Wiedemer, 45, an information technology operations analyst who said a recruiter had told her that despite her skill set she would be a ''hard sell'' because she had been out of work for more than six months. 
Legal experts say that the practice probably does not violate discrimination laws because unemployment is not a protected status, like age or race. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission recently held a hearing, though, on whether discriminating against the jobless might be illegal because it disproportionately hurts older people and blacks.
The practice is common enough that New Jersey recently passed a law outlawing job ads that bar unemployed workers from applying. New York and Michigan are considering the idea, and similar legislation has been introduced in Congress. The National Employment Law Project, a nonprofit organization that studies the labor market and helps the unemployed apply for benefits, has been reviewing the issue, and last week issued a report that has nudged more politicians to condemn these ads.
Given that the average duration of unemployment today is nine months -- a record high -- limiting a search to the ''recently employed,'' much less the currently employed, disqualifies millions.
The positions advertised with preferences for the already-employed run the gamut. Some are for small businesses, and others for giants, including the commercial University of Phoenix (which, like some other companies, removed the ads after an inquiry by The New York Times) or the fast-food chain Pollo Tropical. They cover jobs at all skill levels, including hotel concierges, restaurant managers, teachers, I.T. specialists, business analysts, sales directors, account executives, orthopedics device salesmen, auditors and air-conditioning technicians.
''It is really a buyer's market for employers right now,'' said Harry J. Holzer, an economist at Georgetown University and the Urban Institute. One consequence is that the long-term unemployed will rack up even more weeks of unemployment, Mr. Holzer said, and will find it harder to make the transition back to work.
Even if Congress passed a measure forbidding companies from making current employment a requirement for job applicants, companies could still simply decide not to hire people who are out of work. Discrimination would be difficult to prove.
After all, there are legitimate reasons that many long-term unemployed workers may not be desirable job candidates. In some cases they may have been let go early in the recession, not just because business had slowed, but because they were incompetent.
Idle workers' skills may atrophy, particularly in dynamic industries like technology. They may lose touch with their network of contacts, which is important for people in sales. Beaten down by months of rejection and idleness, they may not interview well or easily return to a 9-to-5 schedule.
''We may be seeing what's called statistical discrimination,'' said Robert Shimer, a labor economist at the University of Chicago. ''On average, these workers might be less attractive, and employers don't bother to look more closely to pick out the good ones.''
Employers receive so many applications for each opening that some may use current employment status as an easy filter. In some cases -- as with Ms. Wiedemer, of Westminster, Colo. -- recruiters merely assume employers do not want jobless workers.
''Clients don't always tell us 'we don't want to see resumes from unemployed workers,' but we can sense from what people have interested them in the past that they're probably looking for somebody who's gainfully employed, who's closer to the action,'' said Dennis Pradarelli, a talent acquisition manager for Marbl, a recruiting firm in Brookfield, Wis. Many of the job ads posted by his firm seek workers who are ''currently employed or only recently unemployed.''
Many firms that are not intentionally screening out the unemployed may still disqualify such applicants for having bad credit histories after having fallen behind on the bills -- which they of course need a job to pay.
It's not clear what can be done to pull workers out of this unemployment trap.
Government incentives for companies to hire unemployed workers have met with limited success. One such tax incentive from last year was poorly publicized, so most employers did not know about it. Better publicity may not suffice, either. An experiment from the 1980s found that telling companies that the unemployed were eligible for generous wage subsidies actually made employers less likely to hire such workers.
Job counselors often encourage the long-term unemployed to go back to school or volunteer to demonstrate that they are still productive, engaged members of society. But absent the actual acquisition of marketable skills -- which many retraining programs do not provide -- it's not clear such efforts improve the chances of being hired.
''Mentally, it may be good for the candidate, but I think companies are still in a position to say 'O.K., we're looking for a candidate with the most up-to-date skills,' '' Mr. Pradarelli said. ''If you've been out of pocket for two years, going back to school sounds nice, but it doesn't make or break the situation.''
The best solution, economists say, would be to encourage job growth more broadly, which may initially involve poaching people from other companies but could eventually draw even the least desirable workers back into jobs. During the boom years of the late '90s, the labor market was so tight that ex-convicts had relatively little trouble finding work.
In the meantime, people like Ms. Wiedemer -- who has been out of work for three years -- are exhausting their benefits and piecing together what support they can from food stamps and family members. And they are stuck hoping that economic growth manages to outpace their own descent into permanent economic exile.
''I worry that unemployment may eventually come down, not because older workers who have been unemployed for a year or two find jobs,'' Professor Shimer said, ''but because older workers finally give up and drop out of the labor force.''

HEADLINE: Plan for Greece Favors Creditors

BYLINE: By HUGO DIXON

 BODY:
A deal was better than a disaster. But last week's plan to rescue Greece has the astonishing byproduct of increasing the country's debts. It also lets private creditors off lightly while making taxpayers elsewhere in the euro zone pay through the nose. It doesn't even mean the end of the crisis.
True, the sustainability of Greek debt has been improved. Greece's government will receive 109 billion euros of new 15- to 30-year loans from the euro zone at an interest rate of 3.5 percent. Private sector creditors will swap or roll over 135 billion euros of existing bonds into new, longer-term instruments. 
But this private sector involvement comes at a huge cost. Because the European Central Bank put the fear of God into politicians about the consequences of a Greek default, private creditors have been handled with kid gloves. Though they are going to suffer 21 percent losses compared to the face value of their bonds (assuming a 9 percent discount rate), it's much less than the 50 percent haircut that is needed to put Greece's finances on a stable footing.
What's more, the financial fiddling used to corral the creditors actually means Greece's debt will rise. This is mainly because Athens will need to borrow 35 billion euros to buy collateral to partly guarantee the new bonds it will give its creditors.
The deal also envisages Greece's borrowing 20 billion euros to buy back debt with a face value of 32.6 billion euros. The price, equivalent to 61.4 percent of face value, is another sweetheart deal for the creditors. A more muscular approach would have cut it to half face value.
Taxpayers in other euro zone countries, by contrast, are digging deep. Imagine they applied the same 9 percent discount rate that private creditors think is appropriate. Their new 109 billion euros of loans would be worth only 54 billion euros, according to an analysis by Breakingviews. In other words, they are the ones taking a 50 percent haircut.
Taxpayers elsewhere might chip in, too, if the International Monetary Fund makes a contribution. Evangelos Venizelos, the Greek finance minister, was traveling to Washington on Monday for discussions with monetary fund leaders and other officials.
But it would be surprising to see the institution pay a third of the total bill as it did with Athens's first bailout. Non-European countries, even the United States, are balking at the amount of money the institution is pouring into Greece.
Two factors could tilt the deal back in favor of the taxpayers and away from the private sector creditors. First, the euro zone leaders hinted in their communique that Greece might be asked to give them collateral, too. As well as providing taxpayers with protection, the collateral would give Greece an added incentive not to veer off its economic fitness regime. Given the length of the program and the fact that the Greek opposition has refused to buy into it, there is a sizable risk that Greece could stray.
Second, private sector creditors will still be liable for 150 billion euros -- or 115 billion euros once the collateral is subtracted. This means that if and when it becomes apparent that Athens cannot bear its debts, it will be possible to give them another, more severe haircut.
But even if these mitigating factors kick in, the deal is very much a second-best option. It would have been better to have done a full restructuring of Greece's debts now. A forcible swap of all the private sector's bond holdings, currently around 200 billion euros, at 50 percent of face value would have cut the need for new official funding to Greece to virtually zero.
In the Middle Ages, a common scam was to sell a cat in a bag while pretending it was a far more valuable pig. Buyers who did not look inside the bag first were conned. In those days, the word for bag was poke. Taxpayers outside Greece are being sold a pig in a poke. HUGO DIXON

HEADLINE: A Step Toward Trust With China

BYLINE: By MIKE MULLEN. 
Mike Mullen, a Navy admiral, is the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

 BODY:
Washington
THE military relationship between the United States and China is one of the world's most important. And yet, clouded by some misunderstanding and suspicion, it remains among the most challenging. There are issues on which we disagree and are tempted to confront each other. But there are crucial areas where our interests coincide, on which we must work together.
So we need to make the relationship better, by seeking strategic trust. 
How do we do that?
First, we've got to keep talking. Dialogue is critical.
A good bit of misunderstanding between our militaries can be cleared up by reaching out to each other. We don't have to give away secrets to make our intentions clear, just open up a little.
That's why I invited my counterpart in the People's Liberation Army, Gen. Chen Bingde, to the United States in May, and it's why he was my host in China two weeks ago. We broke new ground by, among other things, showing him Predator drone capabilities in detail and a live-fire exercise; the Chinese reciprocated with a tour of their latest submarine, a close look at an SU-27 jet fighter and a complex counterterrorism exercise.
Our discussions were candid and forthright. General Chen made no bones about his concerns about American arms sales to Taiwan, and I made it clear that the United States military will not shrink from our responsibilities to allies and partners. He said the P.L.A.'s strategic intentions were purely defensive; I said that neither the skills they were perfecting nor their investments seemed to support that argument.
Not exactly cordial, but at least we were talking.
Second, we need to focus on the things we have in common.
We're both maritime nations with long coastlines and economies dependent on unhindered trade. We both face threats of drug trafficking, piracy and the movement of weapons of mass destruction. We both want stability on the Korean Peninsula and in Pakistan. We both recognize the need for coordinated international humanitarian aid and disaster relief.
These are challenges we can tackle together, and missions we can plan and train for, and perhaps someday execute side by side. Our staffs signed a few initiatives in that regard, including a commitment to conduct joint counter-piracy exercises in the Gulf of Aden this year.
Good steps all, but there is a long way to go.
We still don't see eye-to-eye with China over military operating rights in the South China Sea. We still don't fully understand China's justification for the rapid growth in its defense spending or its long-term military modernization goals. And we don't believe that China should be allowed to resolve disputes in contested waters by coercing smaller nations. Instead, as Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has made clear, we advocate a collaborative diplomatic process among all parties to resolve disputes under international law. And we need better mechanisms to deal with inevitable tensions.
That said, these sticking points aren't all bad. It's all right to disagree sometimes, to have substantial differences.
In fact, sometimes bluntness and honesty are exactly what's needed to create strategic trust. And we will need more of it. Our military relations have only recently begun to thaw, but China's government still uses them as a sort of thermostat to communicate displeasure. When they don't like something we do, they cut off ties. That can't be the model anymore. Nor can we, for our part, swing between engagement and over-reaction. That's why the commitment by President Obama and President Hu Jintao to improve military-to-military relations is so important. Real trust has to start somewhere. And it shouldn't be subject to shifting political winds.
So, General Chen and I are considering more frequent discussions, more exercises, more personnel exchanges. We both believe that the younger generation of military officers is ready for closer contact, and that upon their shoulders rests the best hope for deeper, more meaningful trust.
I'm not naive. I understand the concerns of those who feel that any cooperation benefits China more than the United States. I just don't agree. This relationship is too important to manage through blind suspicion and mistrust. We've tried that. It doesn't work.
I'm not suggesting we look the other way on serious issues, that we abandon healthy skepticism, or that we change our military's focus on the region. But we need to keep communication open and work hard to improve each interaction.
We can shrink from this opportunity, or rise to it. We can let narrow interests and suspicion define our relationship, or work toward more transparency, more pragmatic expectations of each other, and more focus on our common challenges. That would be a great start toward strategic trust.

HEADLINE: Factories Find Favor

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
PUNE, India -- When Ranjit Date returned to India 20 years ago after earning a doctorate in robotics from an American university, he hoped to help automate factory assembly lines in his home country.
His company, Precision Automation and Robotics India, has done that. But more recently it has also begun selling robots to Western manufacturers like Caterpillar, Ford and Chrysler. This year, in fact, a third of Precision Automation's sales will come from exports, up from almost nothing five years ago.
Mr. Date's company is emblematic of a recent surge in exports of engineered and other sophisticated goods from India -- a country perhaps better known for exports of skilled services like software outsourcing.
But in fact, Indian exports of goods are now nearly double exports of services, growing 37.5 percent, to $245.9 billion, in the 12 months that ended in March. Leading the way are high-value products like industrial machinery, automobiles and car parts, and refined petroleum products. 
Indian exports are following a different path from that taken by other Asian countries like Japan, Korea and China. Those countries started by exporting products like garments and toys made by large numbers of low-paid, low-skilled workers, before moving to more sophisticated products like cars and industrial machinery.
India has largely skipped the first step and gone straight to producing capital-intensive items that require skilled workers but not necessarily many of them. Rather than pursue the traditional developing-country model of exports, India aspires to eventually achieve something more like Germany's mix of industrial goods for the global market -- even if India has a long way to go before approaching Germany's $1.3 trillion in annual exports.
Over the last decade, industrial export hubs have sprouted around India, some with the help of government planning. Here in Pune, about 100 miles east of Mumbai, a vibrant domestic automotive and engineering hub supplies the United States and other Western markets.
Chennai in the south has become India's Detroit, as car factories ship small Fords, Nissans and Hyundais to Europe, Africa and Latin America.
In the west, Gujarat State is home to several large petroleum refineries that take imported crude oil and process it into products like jet and diesel fuel that are sold in other Asian countries. (The need to import crude oil for domestic use, though, is the main reason India continues to run a trade deficit -- $104.8 billion in the last fiscal year.)
Meanwhile, traditional exports like textiles and agricultural products together account for less than 20 percent of the goods India sells to the world. India now exports fewer garments than its neighbor Bangladesh, which has one-eighth India's population and an economy only about one-fifteenth as large.
''India has moved away from the textiles story,'' said Rohini Malkani, an economist at Citigroup in India. ''Now, it's engineering goods and chemicals, including pharmaceuticals.''
In many ways, these are virtues born of necessity. The country's poor transportation and electricity infrastructure and restrictive labor laws have discouraged companies from setting up labor-intensive manufacturing plants like those for which China is known. Instead, many Indian exporters specialize in higher-value goods and services that require fewer, but more skilled, workers.
The flowering of these industrial bases can be traced to the early 1990s. That is when a financial crisis forced Indian policy makers to slough off socialist policies known as the ''licenses raj,'' which tightly regulated industrial production and kept foreign competition out. The changes let businesses set up factories based on market demand and allowed foreigners to invest in India, exposing domestic companies to greater competition.
''India is beginning to get its act together in terms of the productivity of its industrial sector,'' said Eswar S. Prasad, an Indian-born economics professor at Cornell University. ''Fundamentally, India always had a good productive base. And given the low base which we were starting from, it's not surprising that India is doing so well.''
But still not as well as it could be. Some economists predict the Indian economy will grow by 7.5 percent this year, to $1.6 trillion. Such growth might thrill many countries, but it would be down from 8.5 percent last year. And it is below the 10 percent growth rate that many economists say India could achieve if it invested more in infrastructure and if the government further relaxed its tight grip on many parts of the economy.
The slowing growth is all the more reason the increase in industrial exports is a bright spot for India.
Here in Pune, manufacturers say exports are booming.
Mr. Date, the robotics entrepreneur, expects sales at his company to increase 20 percent this year, to $67 million. The company is building a second factory, a 150,000-square-foot plant on the outskirts of Pune, to keep up with demand for its robots and automated assembly lines. He said Precision Automation's products were 10 to 50 percent less expensive than similar equipment made by Western suppliers.
Mr. Date started the business with a friend, Mangesh Kale, who, like him, grew up in Pune. After earning advanced degrees from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., they returned to India in the early 1990s -- just as policy makers were pushing through early economic changes.
At first many Indian manufacturers were unwilling to invest in robots, Mr. Date said, because labor in India was so cheap. But in the increasing global economy, Indian manufacturers had to improve productivity to meet rising demand and compete with foreign companies.
''We have grown in waves with the Indian economy,'' he said.
In 2003, the company opened an office near Detroit and started winning small contracts to supply assembly line machinery and other equipment to auto parts makers. After a few years, it landed a small contract with Caterpillar, which has since become one of its biggest customers. It also won overseas orders from companies like Renault after supplying their Indian factories.
Analysts say Indian exporters like Precision Automation have performed admirably given the challenges they face. But for India to become an export powerhouse like China -- which had exports of $1.58 trillion last year -- policy makers must substantially improve its infrastructure, make labor regulations more flexible and improve basic education, said K. T. Chacko, director of the Indian Institute of Foreign Trade in New Delhi.
Mr. Date said his biggest challenge was finding, training and keeping qualified engineers. His company puts every entry-level engineer through a year of paid in-house training that he says costs it 1 million rupees (about $22,200) each, because college graduates do not have sufficient skills. About one-quarter of employees stay for just three years before jumping to other companies.
Infrastructure is another big concern. His factory receives power from the electric utility only about half the time, forcing him to rely on diesel generators.
Yet, roads and regulatory approvals are improving, Mr. Date said. As recently as five years ago, it took customs and tax authorities seven days to approve export shipments. That has been reduced to two days, he said.
''It is bearable,'' he added, ''but still needs improvement.''

HEADLINE: A Mystical Tale, From Tee to Green

BYLINE: By CHARLES McGRATH

 BODY:
For many golfers Michael Murphy's 1972 novel, ''Golf in the Kingdom,'' is practically a sacred text. It's about a young man, modeled on Mr. Murphy himself, who on his way to an ashram in India stops off in Scotland, where his life is transformed by an encounter with a golf pro and mystic named Shivas Irons, who knows as much about Pythagoras and the Hindu scriptures as he does about hitting a high fade. Several filmmakers have felt similarly transported by reading the book, and ''Golf in the Kingdom'' has been optioned or in development since before it was even published. Gus Van Sant was interested for a while. Sean Connery was approached about playing Shivas. Clint Eastwood fell in love with the book and clung to the rights for a decade or so before giving up. 
At last, though, ''Golf in the Kingdom'' is coming to the screen. It opens in New York on Friday in a version written and directed by Susan Streitfeld, who has never played golf in her life, and produced by Mindy Affrime, an independent producer who says that ''Hollywood is a men's club for guys who don't need to work.'' She made the movie not on a shoestring but on the discarded baling twine you use when you can't afford a shoestring. The cast, which includes Mason Gamble as Murphy, David O'Hara as Shivas, and Malcolm McDowell as a crusty Scottish doctor who thinks the electric golf cart spells the end of civilization, worked for $100 a day.
For reasons of economy, the film was shot at Bandon Dunes, a golf resort in Oregon that looks more Scottish than much of Scotland, and Mike Keiser, owner of the resort, wound up feeding and housing the cast and crew free during the 20 days of shooting.
''It's hard to escape Mindy,'' he said last week. ''Using 'Golf in the Kingdom,' she became an expert mooch. I think Michael approved, and I'm sure the Shivas character would have approved too.''
Mr. Murphy, now 80, is better known as a founder of the Esalen Institute, home of the human potential movement and scene of countless nude hot tub encounters. He gave up golf a few years ago when his brother began to outdrive him, but took a keen interest in the film and helped write the script. He focused particularly on a long meditation sequence at the end and also suggested a scene, not in the novel, in which a golfer and a barmaid turn each other on by quoting the Robert Burns poem ''Nine Inch Will Please a Lady'' to each other.
''I've been waiting for this a long time,'' he said of the movie. ''I had got to calling 'Golf in the Kingdom' the world's longest virtual movie, coming soon to a mind near you.''
One reason the film took so long to get made is that the book is close to unfilmable. It's less a novel than a philosophical parable, in which the Murphy character plays an eye-opening round with Shivas; attends a dinner party, probably based on Plato's ''Symposium,'' where the guests takes turns expounding on the meaning of golf; and has a nighttime mystical encounter with Shivas, and while swinging in the dark discovers the importance of his ''inner body.''
It ends with a little coda of speculations about matters like the whiteness of the ball, the holeness of the hole and the importance of becoming one sense-organ. There is hardly any plot, and no love interest. By the end the Murphy character has become so spiritual that he has sworn off sex entirely. The book's popularity among golfers probably has less to do with novelistic elements than with its tantalizing suggestion that there is already a perfect golf swing inside you, if you can just close your eyes and find it.
Mr. Murphy guessed that the absence of a traditional narrative is what thwarted so many filmmakers, and said he knew of some 15 different screenplays that had tried to impose more of a story on his book. In one version the Murphy character is a used-car salesman in the Bronx who falls in love with Shivas's daughter and winds up a remittance man in Tahiti.
Ms. Affrime, who grew up playing golf, was introduced to the book by Mr. Van Sant and remained eager to film it even when he bowed out. After finally acquiring the rights, which she did by wheedling Warner Brothers, now the owner, she interviewed a number of male directors.
''There were all these guys who said they wanted to make 'Golf in the Kingdom,' '' she recalled. ''They all had their opinions on what it should be, and they all had their own relationship to golf. It became their story, not Michael's.''
Ms. Streitfeld, whose film ''Female Perversions'' Ms. Affrime had produced in 1996, was Mr. Murphy's idea, and what she brought to the project was essentially a blank slate. She comes from ''an extremely tall, nonathletic family,'' she said last week (her uncle is Paul Volcker, the 6-foot-7 former chairman of the Federal Reserve), and saw the book less as a golf story than as a ''layering of ancient religions and philosophies and ideas.''
Talking about ''Golf in the Kingdom,'' Ms. Streitfeld sounded like someone who had spent a great deal of quality time with Shivas Irons. She referred to the book not as a novel but as ''the material,'' and said she had spent years ''standing around and listening to it.''
''It was very elusive and mysterious,'' she added. ''There's so little that's holding you, so little you can grab onto.''
Normally a very methodical director, she more or less improvised ''Golf in the Kingdom.'' She and the cinematographer, Arturo D. Smith, went to Bandon Dunes with a script but no story board or shot list, and some of the most striking scenes are in parts of the Bandon landscape that don't look Scottish at all.
''It was a process of all the senses being in relationship to the essence of the material,'' she said, and added, ''The crew basically wanted to kill us.''
The finished version is nonlinear, jumping forward and flashing back in time. This was not her original intention, Ms. Streitfeld said, but the movie resisted being edited into a traditional form.
''The sense the film had of itself was very, very strong,'' she said with Shivas-like wonder, and went on: ''The whole thing really was instinctual. I would hope I never do that again.''
Mr. Murphy said that at a certain point during the filming he was ''advised to retire to the perimeter of the set,'' but he nevertheless highly approves of the movie.
''I've seen it five or six times, and it depends on my mood what my reaction is,'' he said. ''The second time I had had a couple of glasses of wine and I thought it was hilarious. I said, 'What have you done?,' and they said, 'No, it's the same movie.' ''

HEADLINE: Sign of Arrival, for Xinhua, Is 60 Feet Tall

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT; Andrew Jacobs and David Barboza contributed reporting.

 BODY:
ONE of the most prominent advertising spaces in Times Square is soon to be occupied by a Chinese brand.
Xinhua, the news agency operated by the Chinese government, is leasing a giant sign, known as a spectacular, on 2 Times Square, the building that is the northern anchor of the district. The new LED sign, 60 feet high by 40 feet wide, is being built for Xinhua (pronounced Shin-wa) and is scheduled to make its debut next Monday.
Xinhua, which has recently expanded its business presence in the United States, is taking over the space on 2 Times Square that had been occupied for the last decade by the HSBC bank. The HSBC lease expired and was not renewed. The sign for Xinhua, which means New China News Agency, will be underneath the sign for Prudential, an American company, and above signs for Samsung (South Korean), Coca-Cola (American) and Hyundai (South Korean). 
Chinese brands have previously occupied signs in Times Square. For instance, in the mid-1990s the 999 Pharmaceutical Company leased a painted vinyl sign atop two buildings at the southeast corner of Seventh Avenue and 48th Street.
And in January, the Chinese government ran promotional commercials on six oversize screens in Times Square featuring celebrities like the retired basketball star Yao Ming and the pianist Lang Lang. The campaign, deemed the biggest such effort by Beijing, was timed to coincide with the visit to the United States by the Chinese president, Hu Jintao.
Also, Haier, a Chinese company that makes appliances, has its name on a building at 1356 Broadway, at 36th Street.
Still, the arrival of Xinhua on 2 Times Square is significant because of the building's premier location in the so-called crossroads of the world. In the 1970s and 1980s, Japanese and South Korean marketers like Fuji, GoldStar, JVC, Sony and Samsung began leasing signs on Midtown Manhattan buildings like 2 Times Square and its sibling, 1 Times Square. It was considered a signal of their arrival in the global consumer marketplace.
''A lot of Chinese companies are coming, or getting ready to come, into this country with their own brands,'' said Jeffrey Katz, the chief executive and principal owner of Sherwood Equities, a commercial real estate firm with properties that include 2 Times Square and 1 Times Square and that also owns the subsidiary Sherwood Outdoor, which oversees the spectaculars on both of those buildings.
In May, Xinhua moved its North American headquarters from Woodside in Queens to a tower in Times Square, 1540 Broadway, at 45th Street. And last year, Xinhua introduced a 24-hour English-language broadcast service, China Network Corporation, or CNC World, that seeks to reach 50 million viewers around the world.
Xinhua also recently began aggressively marketing its news wire service, particularly in the developing world, with a goal of competing with news agencies like The Associated Press, Bloomberg News and Reuters. (The Reuters building at 3 Times Square, on Seventh Avenue between 42nd and 43rd Streets, is decorated with huge video ad screens.)
Like the Japanese and South Korean brands that came to Times Square to better familiarize the United States with their products, the arrival of Xinhua is a prominent expression of its ambitions with Americans, many of whom are either unfamiliar with the state-owned news agency or associate it with relics like Tass, the official disseminator of government news releases in the Soviet Union.
Executives of Xinhua did not respond to questions sent last week by e-mail asking about their decision to lease the sign at 2 Times Square.
According to Brian Turner, president of Sherwood Outdoor, Xinhua signed a long-term lease for the space, which he described as ''in excess of six years.'' He and Mr. Katz said they hoped the lease would be a harbinger of other Chinese brands coming to Times Square.
Mr. Katz dismissed a suggestion that the presence of a Chinese brand in such a marquee location might discomfort some Americans.
''They're leasing it,'' Mr. Katz said of the sign. ''They're not buying it.''
''That's good for the home team,'' he added.
Mr. Turner echoed Mr. Katz, noting the continuing presence on 2 Times Square of Coca-Cola and Prudential.
''There's nothing more American'' than those brands, Mr. Turner said.
The last change of signs on 2 Times Square occurred in 2009, when Hyundai replaced Pontiac, a brand that was discontinued by General Motors.
Mr. Turner and Mr. Katz declined to discuss the financial terms of the lease for the Xinhua sign. However, signs in top-drawer locations in Times Square can rent for as much as $300,000 to $400,000 a month.
The expansion efforts by Xinhua are driven partly by a desire to counter what officials in the ruling Chinese Communist Party say is widespread bias against China in Western media reporting. The idea, Chinese leaders said, is to burnish the country's image and give China a voice to match its newfound economic might.
Many media analysts, however, are skeptical that Xinhua will make much headway anytime soon in markets like North America and Europe, where residents are sophisticated and often look askance at information delivered by news agencies owned by governments -- any governments.
Also, reports by Xinhua on topics like Taiwan and Tibet, which are of considerable political concern to its government bosses, are not necessarily known for being objective.

HEADLINE: Calls for Free Coverage for Birth Control

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Make Birth Control Affordable'' (Op-Ed, July 19):
Vanessa Cullins lists many excellent reasons birth control should be considered preventive medicine, but she doesn't mention one of the most powerful supporting facts: oral contraceptives can halve a woman's risk of ovarian cancer. This is a significant benefit, as ovarian cancer is the deadliest gynecological cancer and the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths for women. The only other risk-reducing treatment is surgery.
There is no early detection or screening test for ovarian cancer, so anything we can do to reduce women's risk is critical. 
As chief executive of the Ovarian Cancer National Alliance, I have seen far too many women die from this disease. From my perspective, there is no question that birth control is preventive medicine. I am grateful that the Institute of Medicine arrived at the same conclusion and recommended that this benefit be available to all women through their health insurance.
KAREN ORLOFF KAPLAN Washington, July 19, 2011
To the Editor:
Making birth control affordable, as well as making education about birth control available, would help with many vexing problems in this country -- not least the abortion battle.
Given the appalling reality that half of all pregnancies in this country are unintended, it is obvious that lack of information about birth control options as well as lack of financial resources account for too many pregnancies and the unavoidable pressures to end them.
Perhaps the women's movement should give a higher priority to ensuring education about and access to birth control than to abortion rights, which might accomplish more for more women.

To the Editor:
Thank you, Vanessa Cullins, for pointing out contraception's innumerable benefits.
My colleagues and I have treated thousands of female patients. We see firsthand how birth control protects women's health and their families' well-being. But many of our patients can't benefit from this basic rule of medicine. Their insurers won't allow it.
In the 21st century, we deserve insurance that reflects the realities of human health. Instead, we have insurers charging women extra fees for birth control as if it were a luxury. Some companies cover the pill but not the IUD or other contraceptives, as if the pill were right for everyone.
The Institute of Medicine just recommended full insurance coverage for all forms of birth control approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Now the Department of Health and Human Services must follow through. When a woman buys health insurance, contraception has to be part of the deal.

To the Editor:
Re ''Panel Calling for Free-Contraceptive Coverage'' (front page, July 20):
The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops got it wrong. The Institute of Medicine's call to include comprehensive family-planning services as a preventive benefit for women under the Affordable Care Act is in tune with women's lives. This measure will serve the health and well-being of the millions of women, many of them Catholic, whose conscience has led them to choose contraception.
The bishops' spokeswoman, who said ''pregnancy is not a disease, and fertility is not a pathological condition to be suppressed,'' missed the point, showing yet again that the hierarchy doesn't speak for all Americans, even Catholics.
Women who choose family planning are making a decision in accord with their conscience about when and whether to have children. These decisions are already well managed by women, their families and their health care providers. The Institute of Medicine wisely recommends removing economic obstacles to better women's health; policy makers shouldn't allow the bishops to stand in the way.

HEADLINE: One Way to Help the Jobless

 BODY:
It is hard to recall a time when it was tougher to find a job. Fully two years after the official end of the recession, unemployment is at 9.2 percent. Job creation has stalled. Making things even more difficult, many employers, staffing agencies and online job-posting firms are expressly screening out applicants who are unemployed, apparently as an expedient to cull resumes, or on the presumption that the unemployed are poor performers. 
The last thing America's job-seekers need are policies that require them to have a job in order to get a job. Rejecting the unemployed is also bad economics because it casts aside qualified workers who could perhaps perform jobs sooner or better than already employed candidates.
A bill introduced this month in the House would fix the problem, but with Congress bent on slashing the budget even as joblessness worsens, it faces an uphill battle.
The Fair Employment Opportunity Act of 2011, sponsored by Democrats Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut and Henry Johnson Jr. of Georgia, would prohibit employers and employment firms from rejecting applicants solely because they are unemployed. It would also make it illegal to state in job advertisements that jobless workers will not be considered.
The bill is as important for what it doesn't do as for what it does. It does nothing to dictate an employer's ultimate decision. Instead, it focuses more narrowly on recruiting and hiring, by ensuring that jobless workers are not arbitrarily kept out of the pool of candidates.
The result is a balance between the needs of workers to pursue jobs and of employers to make hiring choices based on relevant criteria like experience and education.
The bill has 30 Democratic co-sponsors in the House and no Republican supporters -- so far. It also does not yet have, and clearly needs, a champion in the Senate. With joblessness being the economy's No. 1 problem, is it really asking too much for lawmakers to move on a targeted piece of legislation that could do some good while doing no harm?

HEADLINE: Recession Study Finds Hispanics Are Hit Hardest

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE

 BODY:
WOODBRIDGE, Va. -- Hispanic families accounted for the largest single decline in wealth of any ethnic and racial group in the country during the recession, according to a study published Tuesday by the Pew Research Center.
The study, which used data collected by the Census Bureau, found that the median wealth of Hispanic households fell by 66 percent from 2005 to 2009. By contrast, the median wealth of whites fell by just 16 percent over the same period. African Americans saw their wealth drop by 53 percent. Asians also saw a big decline, with household wealth dropping 54 percent.
The declines have led to the largest wealth disparities in the 25 years that the bureau has been collecting the data, according to the report. 
Median wealth of whites is now 20 times that of black households and 18 times that of Hispanic households, double the already marked disparities that had prevailed in the decades before the recent recession, the study found.
''It's a very stark reminder of the high share of minorities who live at the economic margins of this country,'' said Paul Taylor, executive vice president of the Pew Research Center and an author of the report. ''These data really show their economic vulnerability.''
Household wealth, also referred to in the report as net worth, is made up of assets, like a house, a car, savings and stocks, minus debts, like mortgages, car loans and credit cards. It is tracked by the Census Bureau in the Survey of Income and Program Participation, a broad sampling of household wealth by race and ethnicity.
Nearly two-thirds of Hispanics' median net worth in 2005 came from home equity, according to the report, and when the housing market collapsed, so did their wealth. Median home equity for Hispanics fell by 51 percent in the period of the survey. The drop was compounded by the fact that Hispanics tended to live in the places that were hit hardest in the recession, like Florida and California, the report said.
Armando Moya, a Mexican immigrant from Woodbridge, outside Washington, experienced these swings of fortune first-hand. For a few happy years, he believed he had avoided his father's fate of scraping by. He bought a house with a backyard and opened a taco restaurant with his brothers. His bank account was growing, and he took his family on vacations several times a year.
Mr. Moya lives in Prince William County, where the Hispanic population more than tripled from 2000 to 2010, according to the Migration Policy Institute, with many newcomers working in construction trades that were flourishing in the rapidly growing suburbs of Washington.
To capitalize on the influx, Mr. Moya, who is now 38 and had been working in restaurants since he came to the United States in the early 1990s, decided to start his own, and together with his brother opened Ricos Tacos Moya in 2005.
In the same year, he bought a house valued at $350,000. His monthly payments were more than $2,300, and with hungry workers filling his restaurant, he managed.
But when the collapse of the housing market swept like a wave through this Northern Virginia county, taking his house, and his bank account, and many of his customers along with it, he lost his middle-class lifestyle.
''Everything was going down,'' he said.
Now he is back where he started, living with his family in a rented apartment, and working seven days a week in the taco restaurant. His house sold for $135,000 to a couple from Morocco, he said.
''My money changed,'' he said. ''I lost my house.''
The share of Americans with no wealth at all rose sharply during the recession. A third of Hispanics had zero or negative net worth in 2009, up from 23 percent in 2005. For blacks, the portion rose to 35 percent from 29 percent, and for whites, it rose to 15 percent from 11 percent.
About a quarter of all black and Hispanic households owned nothing but a car in 2009. Just 6 percent of whites and 8 percent of Asians were in that situation.
Whites were less affected by the crisis, largely because their wealth flowed from assets other than housing, like stocks. A third of whites owned stocks and mutual funds in 2005, compared with 8 percent of Hispanics and 9 percent of blacks.
The median value of stocks and mutual funds owned by whites dropped by 9 percent from 2005 to 2009. In comparison, the median value of holdings for those blacks who held stocks dropped by 71 percent, most likely because they had to sell when prices were low, Mr. Taylor said.
The median wealth of Hispanic and black households is at its lowest point since 1984, when the Census Bureau first conducted the study, the report said.
Mr. Moya counts himself lucky to still have his restaurant. He has to work weekends at a nightclub in Washington to keep up with his rent. His life is increasingly resembling his father's -- subsisting, without saving -- but he has pinned his hopes for a better life on his sons, and he has discarded the idea of returning to Mexico.
''I want my house back,'' he said. ''I'm working for my house right now.''

HEADLINE: Grasping for Any Way To Prevent Alzheimer's

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK

 BODY:
Is there a way to prevent Alzheimer's disease? Last week, a study presented at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference in Paris suggested there might be, something that would give hope to millions who worry that one day they may be struggling with dementia.
The new study, by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, estimated how many Alzheimer's cases might be attributable to certain behaviors or conditions: physical inactivity, smoking, depression, low education, hypertension, obesity and diabetes.
The authors used a mathematical model to surmise that these behaviors and conditions, all of which can be modified, are responsible for about half of the roughly 5.3 million Alzheimer's cases in the United States and 34 million cases worldwide.
And they calculated that if people addressed these risks -- by exercising, quitting smoking, increasing their education or losing weight, for example -- a significant number of Alzheimer's cases could be prevented. Reducing the prevalence of these risk factors by 10 percent, the researchers estimated, could prevent 1.1 million cases worldwide; reducing these risk factors by 25 percent could prevent more than three million cases. 
The operative word was ''could.'' As the researchers pointed out, there is not yet scientific proof that any of these risk factors in fact cause Alzheimer's. Only if they are shown to do so could the new analysis be considered a practical recipe for preventing the disease.
''These things are not definitive,'' said one author, Dr. Kristine Yaffe, a professor of psychiatry, neurology and epidemiology. ''We're assuming that these are sort of causally related to the risk of dementia and Alzheimer's, but unless you have a great trial, you just don't know.''
But while experts may have understood that distinction, not everyone else did. Some headlines made things sound more certain: ''7 Things You Can Do to Fight Alzheimer's'' or ''7 Steps to Prevent Alzheimer's.''
In an editorial accompanying the study, both published in the journal Lancet Neurology, Dr. Laura Fratiglioni, director of the Aging Research Center at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, suggested that the report was valuable, but said that the estimates ''could be regarded as only theoretical'' until more rigorous research is done.
''We have been able to identify some possible preventive factors,'' Dr. Fratiglioni said, ''but we do not have the final answer because we do not have the experimental studies.''
Indeed, research on prevention of Alzheimer's is in its infancy. It has only been since the 1980s that dementia has not been considered a symptom of normal aging. And studies on preventing Alzheimer's can be complicated and costly, especially the randomized controlled trials that provide the strongest evidence. Such trials have to follow people for years, and isolating individual risk factors -- separating obesity from hypertension, diabetes, nutrition and physical inactivity, for instance -- is challenging.
Last year, a National Institutes of Health panel of experts with no vested interest in Alzheimer's research concluded that ''no evidence of even moderate scientific quality exists to support the association of any modifiable factor (such as nutritional supplements, herbal preparations, dietary factors, prescription or nonprescription drugs, social or economic factors, medical conditions, toxins or environmental exposures) with reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease.''
Most research, the panel found, involved observational studies, showing that people who did or did not get Alzheimer's had certain characteristics beforehand, but not whether the characteristics were causal.
The panel found the strongest evidence for only one conclusion: that the herb gingko biloba does not prevent Alzheimer's. There was moderate evidence that neither vitamin E nor drugs called cholinesterase inhibitors, used to treat dementia symptoms, decrease risk of Alzheimer's. And there was moderate evidence that the gene ApoE4 significantly increases Alzheimer's risk, as does menopause therapy with estrogens and progestins.
Evidence for or against any other causal factor was poor, often because studies were small, used vague or changing definitions, or did not rigorously monitor what subjects were doing.
''We debated for hours and hours and hours how to write the report, because certainly we didn't want it to be the carrier of bad news,'' said Dr. Martha Daviglus, the panel's chairwoman and a preventive medicine expert at Northwestern University. But ''we wanted the public to realize that at this point nothing that people can sell to them is proven to work.''
Many members of the Alzheimer's community were stung, considering the panel's conclusions a ''glass half empty,'' said William Thies, the Alzheimer's Association's chief medical and scientific officer. ''We would agree that we haven't proven any of these risk factors, but there's data that are pretty good for some of them. And in a world where we have lots of Alzheimer's disease and no definitive medical intervention, prevention strategies that are based on lifestyle changes are certainly attractive.''
Dr. Yaffe and her colleague Deborah Barnes excluded risk factors like nutrition or brain exercise because they believed research was not solid enough. They used a more elastic threshold to evaluate research than the N.I.H. panel because, Dr. Yaffe said, the panel ''didn't quite do the field justice.''
Their model weighed the strength of existing research and how widespread the risk factors were. In the United States, they estimated that 1.1 million Alzheimer's cases, or 21 percent, may be linked to physical inactivity. Fifteen percent may owe to depression, 11 percent to smoking, 8 percent to midlife hypertension, 7 percent to obesity, 7 percent to low education and 3 percent to diabetes.
Their estimates for the risk factors worldwide differed because some behaviors and conditions are more common than in the United States. So low education accounted for 19 percent, or 6.5 million cases, worldwide, while physical inactivity accounted for 13 percent and obesity 2 percent.
Dr. John W. Williams Jr., a professor of medicine at Duke University who led an analysis of Alzheimer's prevention research for the N.I.H. panel, said studies like Dr. Yaffe's can be informative ''when we don't have other evidence'' and can help shapers of public policy ''make decisions about where to invest to reduce risk.''
But he said: ''What should individuals do with it? Probably not much.''
Among the limitations, he said, was that some risk factors, like physical inactivity and obesity, ''are darn hard to change.''
And does a risk factor like depression cause Alzheimer's -- or is it the other way around?
Still, everyone agrees these risks merit attention for other reasons: preventing cancer or heart disease, improving overall health.
''It's good if you can do it, but not in the name of Alzheimer's,'' Dr. Daviglus said. ''But maybe we will find out that by doing this for other diseases, we are also doing it for Alzheimer's.''

HEADLINE: A 'Unique Opportunity,' Squandered

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Leaders of both parties have said for months that the need to raise the nation's borrowing limit offered a ''unique opportunity'' for a bipartisan deal that would constrain the mounting federal debt.
Instead, it is shaping up to be a lost opportunity.
Whatever deal Congress and President Obama devise in this final week to allow the government to keep paying its bills after Aug. 2 and avert an economy-rattling default, it almost certainly will fall short of the compromise that Mr. Obama and Speaker John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, nearly struck last week -- before details of the negotiations leaked, opponents in both parties protested and Mr. Boehner left the table.
The difference between that attempted ''grand bargain'' and what Congress is coming up with is not just a matter of dollars. Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner did tentatively agree to more than $3 trillion in savings over 10 years -- at least hundreds of billions more than is called for in the fallback plans now bandied about in Congress to clear the way for a vote to increase the $14.3 trillion borrowing ceiling by next Tuesday. 
But the more significant difference is in where the savings would come from. The Congressional proposals mainly seek caps on annual spending for domestic and military programs and no additional revenues.
Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner tentatively agreed to raise $800 billion in revenues after 2013 by overhauling the tax code and getting significant future savings from Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security -- the entitlement programs whose growth as the population ages is driving long-term projections of unsustainable debt. While Republicans rebelled at the idea of tax increases, the package's total spending cuts exceeded new revenues by more than three to one.
The Obama-Boehner package still could serve as the basis for a bigger and more comprehensive debt-reduction deal. But that probably would not be before the 2012 elections, people in both parties say, given House Republicans' unyielding stand against higher taxes.
More likely, they say, the debate over what Mr. Boehner called their ''different visions for our country'' will define next year's elections, along with the blame game if the two parties remain at loggerheads. How it plays out could determine both Mr. Boehner's future as speaker and Mr. Obama's as president.
Each believed his party would benefit politically by a comprehensive deal, not least by easing many Americans' pox-on-both-your-houses frustration with Washington gridlock -- a threat to incumbents -- and by avoiding blame for an economic crisis.
And while Mr. Obama also seeks to appeal to independent voters who make the difference in presidential elections, many Democrats complain he is too willing to compromise, potentially disillusioning their party's voters and muddying the case against Republicans for proposing much deeper entitlement program cuts. Mr. Boehner's problem is that some otherwise persuadable Republicans worry less about the general election than party primaries, and fear they could draw a conservative rival by supporting a deal with Mr. Obama.
''If that means more to you than getting a plan and stabilizing this economy, you've really got to wonder why you're there,'' said Alan K. Simpson, a former Senate Republican leader who was a co-chairman of the bipartisan fiscal commission Mr. Obama set up last year.
A package like the one Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner were discussing would be the most ambitious deficit-reduction effort in memory. Former Republican lawmakers who fought in the deficit-cutting wars of the 1980s and 1990s, including Mr. Simpson, express puzzlement or dismay at House Republicans' willingness to let the tax issue stop them from taking Mr. Obama's offers on reducing entitlement spending, especially since the new revenues would flow from an overhaul of the tax code that would lower most rates.
''If I were there,'' said Mickey Edwards, a House Republican leader in the Reagan and first Bush administrations, ''I would say, 'My God, declare victory.' ''
If Republicans agreed to raise revenues from wealthy taxpayers and corporations, Mr. Obama was willing to reduce Medicare spending $250 billion over a decade and slowly phase in an increase in the eligibility age to 67 from 65, shrink Medicaid by $110 billion, and change the formula for cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security, which would more accurately reflect inflation, economists say, but would also mean smaller increases.
Left untested is whether Mr. Obama could have sold his compromise to Democrats. ''I have no doubt that if it came up, the votes would be there,'' said Senator Michael Bennet, Democrat of Colorado. But the vocal opposition of liberal and labor groups suggest it would not be easy.
''This is morally wrong and Congress should not allow it to happen,'' Mary Kay Henry, president of the Service Employees International Union, said in a statement last Thursday.
A full picture of the shelved compromise shows how close the two leaders were and how far each was willing to go in confronting their parties' sacred cows -- Mr. Obama on entitlement spending and Mr. Boehner on taxes. On paper about $59 billion in spending cuts separated them, a relative pittance in terms of projected spending for the decade. Most of that difference was over Medicaid; Mr. Boehner wanted $40 billion more in cuts than Mr. Obama.
But taxes were the rub: Mr. Boehner has said he quit when Mr. Obama insisted on $400 billion more in revenues above the $800 billion they had agreed to.
The $800 billion roughly reflected savings if the Bush-era tax cuts for high incomes are not extended after 2012, though the deal was not explicit about that, given potential Republican opposition. Rather, it called for Congress to overhaul the tax code to eliminate or reduce popular breaks for corporations and individuals, and to use the new revenues mostly to lower tax rates -- leaving the $800 billion for deficit reduction.
Mr. Obama sought $400 billion more after the so-called Gang of Six senators, including three of the Senate's most conservative Republicans, proposed a debt-reduction plan calling for more new revenues than Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner had been discussing -- leaving the president more vulnerable to rebellion from within his own party.
On Fox News on Sunday, Mr. Boehner said his ''last offer,'' including $800 billion in new revenues, ''is still on the table.'' But it was not ''doable'' before Congress had to raise the debt limit, he said, so he went to work with lawmakers on a fallback.
As for Mr. Obama, his endorsement on Monday of a separate proposal from the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, signaled that he, too, had given up on getting a grand bargain, for now.

HEADLINE: The Republican Wreckage: The House rejects a plan that gives them everything, because Democrats proposed it

 BODY:
House Republicans have lost sight of the country's welfare. It's hard to conclude anything else from their latest actions, including the House speaker's dismissal of President Obama's plea for compromise Monday night. They have largely succeeded in their campaign to ransom America's economy for the biggest spending cuts in a generation. They have warped an exercise in paying off current debt into an argument about future spending. Yet, when they win another concession, they walk away.
This increasingly reckless game has pushed the nation to the brink of ruinous default. The Republicans have dimmed the futures of millions of jobless Americans, whose hopes for work grow more out of reach as government job programs are cut and interest rates begin to rise. They have made the federal government a laughingstock around the globe. 
In a scathing prime-time television address Monday night, President Obama stepped off the sidelines to tell Americans the House Republicans were threatening a ''deep economic crisis'' that could send interest rates skyrocketing and hold up Social Security and veterans' checks. By insisting on a single-minded approach and refusing to negotiate, he said, Republicans were violating the country's founding principle of compromise.
''How can we ask a student to pay more for college before we ask hedge fund managers to stop paying taxes at a lower rate than their secretaries?'' he said, invoking Ronald Reagan's effort to make everyone pay a fair share and pointing out that his immediate predecessors had to ask for debt-ceiling increases under rules invented by Congress. He urged viewers to demand compromise. ''The entire world is watching,'' he said.
Mr. Obama denounced House Speaker John Boehner's proposal to make cuts only, now, and raise the debt ceiling briefly, but he embraced the proposal made over the weekend by the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, which gave Republicans virtually everything they said they wanted when they ignited this artificial crisis: $2.7 trillion from government spending over the next decade, with no revenue increases. It is, in fact, an awful plan, which cuts spending far too deeply at a time when the government should be summoning all its resources to solve the real economic problem of unemployment. It asks for absolutely no sacrifice from those who have prospered immensely as economic inequality has grown.
Mr. Reid's proposal does at least protect Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. And about half of its savings comes from the winding down of two wars, which naturally has drawn Republican opposition. (Though Republicans counted the same savings in their budgets.)
Mr. Boehner will not accept this as the last-ditch surrender that it is. The speaker, who followed Mr. Obama on TV with about five minutes of hoary talking points clearly written before the president spoke, is insisting on a plan that raises the debt ceiling until early next year and demands another vote on a balanced-budget amendment, rejected by the Senate last week. The result would be to stage this same debate over again in an election year. Never mind that this would almost certainly result in an immediate downgrade of the government's credit.
We agreed strongly when Mr. Obama said Americans should be ''offended'' by this display and that they ''may have voted for divided government but they didn't vote for a dysfunctional government.'' It's hard not to conclude now that dysfunction is the Republicans' goal -- even if the cost is unthinkable.

HEADLINE: Debt Drama Overshadows The Big Picture

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
9:42 p.m. Updated
As Washington continues to debate a debt deal, the Obama administration has been preparing the country for the worst, with officials essentially saying the sky is about to fall.
But so far, oddly enough, nothing has happened. Despite warnings that a deal would need to be brokered by Sunday night before the Asian markets opened, stocks merely stumbled on Monday - the type of weakness usually associated with soft corporate earnings instead of an economic apocalypse.
Wall Street's blase response presents a serious challenge for the administration. The government has been ringing the alarm bells of an impending catastrophe to add urgency to its efforts to get Republicans to hash out a compromise. 
President Obama, in his address on Monday night, again warned of dire consequences if a deal is not reached.
''We would risk sparking a deep economic crisis, this one caused almost entirely by Washington,'' he said.
While the sky indeed may fall if the sides cannot compromise, the fact that the market has been calm has served only to deepen the resistance to a deal. People who perhaps should be worried don't seem to be, and worse, appear to have stopped listening to the warnings.
How did it come to this?
The administration may have made a strategic mistake in warning too soon that the market would react negatively. It ultimately undercuts the government's negotiating position because the doomsday scenario has not played out, even though the deadline is fast approaching.
''They have lost all credibility,'' said Neil M. Barofsky, the former special inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program. ''It's so typical of the way Treasury and the Fed treat everything - it is always to warn that Armageddon is coming.''
The Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, is among those who may have miscalculated.
He has consistently held out Aug. 2 as the cutoff date for lawmakers to reach a compromise. After that, Mr. Geithner has said the government might not be able to continue sending out Social Security checks or Medicare payments. ''On Aug. 2, we're left running on fumes,'' he told the CBS program ''Face the Nation.''
He told me back in May that he was expecting to reach a deal by mid-July, way ahead of the final deadline. ''Why would you want to experiment? In July, you'd want this done.''
But increasingly, the market seems to believe it was a false deadline. Some economists have said the government would have enough cash on hand to continue making payments for several days at least. The administration could also decide how to prioritize payments. The government, for instance, could opt to pay interest on Treasuries and put off other bills.
In other words, the United States has some wiggle room.
''The Aug. 2 deadline is not as hard as indicated by Secretary Geithner,'' said Mohamed El-Erian, the chief executive of Pimco, the large bond manager.
It doesn't help the government's case that investors believe the debate over the debt ceiling amounts to political posturing. Wall Street is counting on lawmakers to work out a deal, albeit at the last minute - a big reason the markets remain sanguine.
''The markets believe the political parties will reach a compromise agreement to avert a default,'' Mr. El-Erian said, especially considering that they may have a bit more time on the doomsday clock.
Investors have good reason to ignore the drama. In years past, politicians have rubber-stamped an increase in the debt ceiling with little discussion or dissent. Since 1962, Congress has voted to increase the limit 74 times, according to the Congressional Research Service, a division of the Library of Congress. It happened 17 times under President Ronald Reagan and four times during the Clinton administration.
But investors may have been lulled into a false sense of security and, as a result, they may have missed the bigger picture.
Whether lawmakers reach an agreement about the debt ceiling may be beside the point. Republicans and Democrats are likely to comprise at some eventual date.
The question is how rating agencies will view the country's creditworthiness, even if a deal is reached.
To some extent, that's why lawmakers are wrangling over whether to pursue a stop-gap measure for the next couple of months versus a long-term plan. Standard & Poor's threatened that it would cut the United States rating if lawmakers didn't come up with a ''credible'' solution.
''What I think is underappreciated until now is a possible outcome whereby the debt ceiling is increased, debt default is avoided, but one of the rating agencies feels compelled to downgrade America's AAA because of insufficient agreement on medium-term fiscal reform,'' Mr. El-Erian said.
If the country were to lose its vaunted rating, the federal government, companies, homeowners and innumerable others would see their costs skyrocket - a situation that would certainly send the markets into a downward spiral.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Clinton Urges Broad Pact Among Asian Nations

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton on Monday laid out an American economic agenda in Asia that emphasized broad international agreements over bilateral pacts, part of a wider theme of preserving American involvement in Europe and Asia.
In a speech here clearly aimed at Beijing, but avoiding explicit criticism of China, Mrs. Clinton, on the last leg of a five-nation trip, called for Asian countries to protect intellectual property and open their markets for government contracts. She urged them not to provide unfair advantages to state-owned enterprises or to draft market-shaping government regulations in secret. 
The broader framework of Mrs. Clinton's remarks was to emphasize a multilateral approach to economic issues in Asia that parallels the American effort to seek multilateral negotiations in the region on security issues.
On economic and security questions, the goal has been to prevent China from using its ever-growing power in the region to push its neighbors one by one into agreements that may serve Beijing's interests and exclude the United States.
''There is now a danger of creating a hodgepodge of inconsistent and partial bilateral agreements which may lower tariffs, but which also create new inefficiencies and dizzying complexities,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''A small electronics shop, for example, in the Philippines might import alarm clocks from China under one free trade agreement, calculators from Malaysia under another, and so on -- each with its own obscure rules and mountains of paperwork -- until it no longer even makes sense to take advantage of the trade agreements at all. Instead, we should aim for true regional integration.''
Mrs. Clinton called for regional economic integration to be pursued through groups that include the United States like the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, whose annual gathering is to be led by President Obama in Hawaii this year.
Li Kui-wai, the director of the APEC Studies Center at the City University of Hong Kong, pointed out that American support for multilateralism in Asia came after many years of American bilateral deals with Asian nations. These include the United States's free trade agreement with South Korea now awaiting Congressional approval, which Mrs. Clinton also discussed.
But President Obama's chairmanship of APEC this year does give the United States a chance to embrace a more multilateral approach in Asia, Dr. Li said.
Mrs. Clinton spoke here after spending the weekend at a security conference in Bali, Indonesia. At that conference, she and other American diplomats continued to support a collective Southeast Asian response to China's assertions of sovereignty over most of the South China Sea.
Chinese diplomats have sought bilateral discussions on maritime sovereignty in the region and have strongly objected to having the United States play a role. This year's security conference was less contentious than last year's, however, as the foreign ministers of China and Southeast Asian nations agreed last Wednesday on guidelines for further talks.
Mrs. Clinton's visits to Hong Kong and Indonesia followed stops in Greece, Turkey and India, where she also pressed for a continuing American role on issues like Greece's debt troubles, for which the European Union has clearly led the international response.
After her speech in Hong Kong, Mrs. Clinton traveled by car across the border to Shenzhen in mainland China to meet with Dai Bingguo, a state councilor with broad authority over foreign policy, after which she was scheduled to fly back overnight to the United States.
Departing briefly from the Asian economy themes of her speech, Mrs. Clinton also offered an assurance that Congress and the Obama administration would find a way to raise the ceiling on the national debt.
''The political wrangling in Washington is intense right now, but these kinds of debates have been a constant in our political life throughout the history of our republic,'' she said, later adding that she was ''confident that Congress will do the right thing and secure a deal on the debt ceiling, and work with President Obama to take the steps necessary to improve our long-term fiscal outlook.''
Chinese officials have been warily watching the debt debate in the United States. With more than $1 trillion in Treasury bonds, China holds roughly a tenth of the American national debt.
China's precise holdings are unclear, as monthly data for foreign holdings of Treasury bonds are highly unreliable because the notes are frequently held in the names of various banks in other countries, while the most recent annual data is from last summer and is not fully comprehensive either.
Mrs. Clinton also spoke in Hong Kong to a gathering of the local branches of the American Chamber of Commerce and the Asia Society.
She praised Hong Kong's commitment to free markets and light regulation. She conspicuously avoided any mention of the democratic aspirations of Hong Kong residents or their concerns about one of the world's highest levels of economic inequality, which some local critics have attributed to limited regulation of oligopolies and real estate deals between large companies and the government.
A march here on July 1 by protesters calling for more democracy and more populist economic policies drew 54,000 people, according to the final police estimate, and 218,000 people, according to the organizers. Mrs. Clinton offered unalloyed praise for Hong Kong's strengths, and put them in the context of the system of one country with two economic and legal systems that China and Britain created when Britain returned the territory to Chinese rule in 1997.
China has objected strongly over the years to any American advice on how to run Hong Kong, contending that it amounts to foreign interference in China's domestic affairs.
''Under the 'one country, two systems' policy, this remains a city that bridges East and West and looks outward in all directions, a place where ideas become businesses, where companies compete on the merits, and where economic opportunity is palpable and real for millions of people, a place that defines the fierce and productive economic competition of our time,'' Mrs. Clinton said.
Albert Ho, the chairman of the Democratic Party in Hong Kong, said that he was ''a little bit disappointed'' that Mrs. Clinton did not mention democracy in Hong Kong during her speech, especially as she spoke right after she had met privately with four local lawmakers: Mr. Ho and Audrey Eu, the leader of the pro-democracy Civic Party, as well as two senior politicians from pro-Beijing parties.
Democracy in Hong Kong is important, Mr. Ho said in a telephone interview, because ''it's symbolic for possible change in China.''

HEADLINE: Government Can't Help? Tell That to the South Bronx

BYLINE: By MICHAEL POWELL. 
E-mail: powellm@nytimes.com

 BODY:
''When the economy grows, it's not because of a new government program or spending initiative. ... It's time to leave that era behind.''
-- John A. Boehner, House speaker, May 2011
It might be hard selling that narrative line to the once broken beauty that is the Bronx.
As a teenager in the 1970s, I offered visiting friends tours of the apocalypse. We piled into an old Buick and drove north from Manhattan, which wasn't in such great shape either, into the South Bronx. We rolled down ghost canyons of burnt-out buildings, saw mattresses and old sinks and tubs piled atop hills of rubble, and encountered smack dealers who cordoned off blocks for open-air markets. (We could not have been safer; they assumed we were white boys in search of a fix.) 
It was macabre and infuriating, a core of urban America discarded and forgotten. Nothing, I assumed, could breathe life into this corpse.
I was spectacularly mistaken, a point driven home again on a recent tour in the company of city housing officials. Again I rolled across the Willis Avenue Bridge into the South Bronx, and what is there should (but almost certainly will not) give pause to those who argue that government lies at the source of our ills.
The Bronx (and many neighborhoods of Brooklyn, Queens and Manhattan) stands as arguably the greatest public rebuilding achievement since World War II, a resurrection begun by Mayor Edward I. Koch and continued with great vigor by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg today.
The Bloomberg administration will, in the end, have poured more than $8 billion into building and preserved 165,000 apartments -- more than enough to house the population of Miami.
We ride a rattling construction elevator to the top of Via Verde, a handsome building that will offer solar panels and roof gardens for low- and
middle-income families. Marc Jahr, president of the city's Housing Development Corporation, stands with the city's commissioner of housing preservation and development, Mathew M. Wambua, and jabs at a forest of apartment buildings. See that building there?
And that one?
And that one?
And that one?
All city-subsidized construction carried out with private developers (Jonathan Rose Companies is building the Via Verde) and dozens of savvy nonprofit groups. (To the northwest, the gleaming Mott Haven campus also rises, with four new schools for nearly 2,000 children.)
''If you want to make an argument that government can work on a large scale and accomplish remarkable tasks, this is it,'' says Mr. Jahr (who, full disclosure, was my boss when I was a tenant organizer decades ago).
There is a tendency to hear hyperbole in such claims. But if you walk the working-class neighborhoods of Memphis, Newark, Atlanta and even Chicago you still find acres of hopelessness. Urban rebirth is a tricky business.
Mr. Koch deserves pride of place in this tale. He decided that the city would rebuild, and its investment dwarfed that of the next 50 cities. Mayor David N. Dinkins paid special attention to Bradhurst, as forbidding an expanse of north Harlem as could be found in the early 1990s. Today, its playgrounds are filled with cacophonous children.
The rebuilding was often accomplished without paying top union wages. This occasions bellows from the construction trades, although I could not help noticing that construction crews in the South Bronx also feature more black and Latino workers than those on many union work sites.
(More than 1,000 new apartments citywide come courtesy of $85 million in federal stimulus dollars; why President Obama has not pointed more forcefully to what government can accomplish remains a mystery.)
On Sunday, I walked Melrose, past new retail stores and supermarkets, past men in white fedoras playing dominoes under umbrellas, and past the Rincon Criollo community garden, where Benny Ayala and Jesus Rivera, old buddies in a restored neighborhood, tend their grape arbor.
At the corner of Third Avenue, Celida Pinet, a slight, 53-year-old woman, pushes a heavily loaded laundry cart toward her apartment building, La Puerta de Vitalidad, the first city-subsidized construction to open in that neighborhood.
She has lived there for eight years, since she arrived from a homeless shelter with a young son in tow. ''It used to be only rubble here. Oh my God, it was ghetto,'' she says.
''Now,'' she points, ''that's new, that's new, that's new. All beautiful.''
Her son is 21, is married and has a child. She adopted two children in foster care.
''I was saved and now I'm saving children,'' she says. ''I have lived to see the resurrection of this neighborhood.''
The era of government may be in danger. But it saved the South Bronx.

HEADLINE: This Is Considered Punishment?

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
Last Wednesday, nearly lost in the furor over Rupert-gate and the debt ceiling crisis, came the surprising news that the Federal Reserve has issued a cease-and-desist order against a Too-Big-to-Fail bank. The bank was Wells Fargo, which was also fined $85 million and ordered to compensate customers it had unfairly -- indeed, illegally -- taken advantage of during the subprime bubble.
What made the news surprising, of course, was that the Federal Reserve has rarely, if ever, taken action against a bank for making predatory loans. Alan Greenspan, the former Fed chairman, didn't believe in regulation and turned a blind eye to subprime abuses. His successor, Ben Bernanke, is not the ideologue that Greenspan is, but, as an institution, the Fed prefers to coddle banks rather than punish them. That the Fed would crack down on Wells Fargo would seem to suggest a long-overdue awakening. 
Yet, for anyone still hoping for justice in the wake of the financial crisis, the news was hardly encouraging. First, the Fed did not force Wells Fargo to admit guilt -- and even let the company issue a press release blaming its wrongdoing on a ''relatively small group.'' The $85 million fine was a joke; in just the last quarter, Wells Fargo's revenues exceeded $20 billion. And compensating borrowers isn't going to hurt much either. By my calculation, it won't top $20 million.
Most upsetting of all, the settlement raises the question that just won't go away: Why can't the federal government prosecute financial wrongdoers?
I realize that the Federal Reserve can't bring a criminal case (and, to be fair, there are statutory limits on how big a fine it can levy). But the Justice Department certainly can. Yet ever since it lost an early case against two Bear Stearns fund managers in 2009, it has gone after only the smallest of small fry: individual borrowers, brokers and appraisers who lack the means to do much more than plead guilty.
In March, for instance, I wrote about the sad case of Charlie Engle, the ultra-marathoner, who was convicted of lying on a liar loan -- that is, exaggerating his income on a subprime mortgage application -- even though the evidence against him was thin. Prosecuted by Neil H. MacBride, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, Engle was sentenced to 21 months in prison.
Now compare Engle's alleged crime to the case the Federal Reserve brought against Wells Fargo Financial, which, until it was shut down last summer, was the subprime subsidiary of Wells Fargo, based in Des Moines. There were several allegations, but the one that caught my eye was that Wells employees ''falsified income information on mortgage applications.'' In other words, they lied on liar loans! The only difference is that the lying was done by a group of Wells Fargo brokers rather than by some poor sap like Charlie Engle.
What's more, this practice appears to have been quite widespread -- ''fostered,'' as the Fed puts it, ''by Wells Fargo Financial's incentive compensation and sales quota programs.'' Matthew R. Lee, the executive director of Inner City Press/Community on the Move and Fair Finance Watch, spent years bringing Wells' subprime abuses to the attention of the Federal Reserve. ''The way the compensation was designed ensured that abuses would take place,'' he says. ''It was a predatory system.''
These are exactly the kind of loans -- built on illegal practices -- that gave us the financial crisis. Brokers working for subprime mortgage companies routinely doctored incomes to hand out subprime loans they knew the borrowers could never repay -- and then, after taking their fat fees, shoveled the loans to Wall Street, which bundled them into subprime securities. This was the kindling that lit the inferno of September 2008. So again, I ask: Why is there no criminal investigation into what went on at Wells Fargo Financial?
The person I called for answers was the press secretary to Nicholas A. Klinefeldt, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Iowa, which includes Des Moines. A glance at Klinefeldt's 2011 press releases suggests that he takes the MacBride approach to mortgage fraud: only the little guy has anything to fear. Needless to say, his press secretary knew nothing about the Wells Fargo case and even questioned whether the Southern District of Iowa had jurisdiction.
The next day, he referred me to a Justice Department spokeswoman. I wrote her an e-mail laying out my question as plainly as I could: ''I am trying to understand why the mortgage brokers who work at a major bank are getting a pass when they have lied on liar loans,'' I said.
That was Friday. On Monday, at 8:30 p.m., a half-hour from press time, the Justice Department sent me a statement claiming that in 2010 ''the number of defendants in mortgage fraud cases more than doubled'' from 2009.
Not one of those defendants ever worked for Wells Fargo Financial.

HEADLINE: Congress Heads For Showdown On Debt Plans

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE and JACKIE CALMES; Jennifer Steinhauer and Michael D. Shear contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Democratic-led Senate and Republican-led House on Monday barreled toward a showdown on competing plans to cut spending and raise the debt limit as a resolution to the intensifying crisis remained farther from sight just one week before a possible federal default.
With President Obama trying to employ the power of the presidency to force an agreement, House and Senate leaders said votes could occur as early as Wednesday on competing proposals to slash spending in exchange for increasing federal borrowing authority that the Treasury Department says will be exhausted Aug. 2, raising the prospect that federal bills will go unpaid.
It was a day of legislative chess moves, back-to-back party caucuses and closed-door meetings that ended with a nationally televised presidential address and a rebuttal by the House speaker, John A. Boehner. Their separate speeches reflected that the two sides are farther apart than ever -- just a week ago, the two men were in private negotiations on a ''grand bargain'' of spending cuts and additional revenue, what Mr. Obama called ''a balanced approach.'' 
''The only reason this balanced approach isn't on its way to becoming law right now is because a significant number of Republicans in Congress are insisting on a different approach, a cuts-only approach -- an approach that doesn't ask the wealthiest Americans or biggest corporations to contribute anything at all,'' Mr. Obama said in his address. ''And because nothing is asked of those at the top of the income scales, such an approach would close the deficit only with more severe cuts to programs we all care about -- cuts that place a greater burden on working families.''
Even as he sought to set Republicans up for blame for any crisis, Mr. Obama offered assurance that a crisis would be averted. He called on Americans to contact their lawmakers in support of a compromise. ''We would risk sparking a deep economic crisis -- this one caused almost entirely by Washington,'' he said. ''Defaulting on our obligations is a reckless and irresponsible outcome to this debate.''
In response to Mr. Obama, Mr. Boehner said: ''The sad truth is that the president wanted a blank check six months ago, and he wants a blank check today. That is just not going to happen.''
Mr. Boehner urged the president to sign a Republican plan to raise the debt limit. ''If the president signs it,'' he said, ''the 'crisis' atmosphere he has created will simply disappear. The debt limit will be raised.''
Earlier in the day, in dueling news conferences on Capitol Hill, neither side showed any willingness to budge even though time was running very short, creating a distinct air of uncertainty around the Capitol about how the debt limit conflict would end.
''We're about to go over the cliff,'' Senator Harry Reid, the Nevada Democrat who serves as majority leader, said Monday afternoon as he outlined his plan.
The back and forth began when House Republicans rolled out a two-stage deficit reduction plan that would allow the $14.3 trillion federal debt limit to rise immediately by about $1 trillion in exchange for $1.2 trillion in spending cuts, and tie a second increase early next year to the ability of a new bipartisan Congressional committee to produce more deficit reduction measures.
Mr. Reid dismissed the House Republican plan as a ''nonstarter'' and said Republicans were essentially trying to embarrass Mr. Obama in the middle of the 2012 election year by forcing another debt limit showdown. He said Democrats would not go along with any plan that did not guarantee a debt limit increase through next year.
Democrats countered with a $2.7 trillion menu of spending cuts and an increase in the debt limit through 2012. Neither plan would require any new revenue.
The approach assembled by Mr. Reid quickly received the president's endorsement. Over the next 10 years, it would cut $1.2 trillion from federal agency budgets and wring savings from recurring programs like agriculture subsidies. Like some earlier Republican plans, the plan also counts about $1 trillion in savings from winding down combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, a point objected to by House Republicans who consider such savings as budget trickery since they would occur regardless.
''The plan is full of gimmicks,'' Mr. Boehner told reporters about the Reid proposal, saying it makes no ''real changes in the spending structure of our government, and it doesn't deal with the biggest drivers of our deficit and our debt, and that would be entitlement programs.''
Rushing to beat the Senate to the punch, House Republican leaders were hoping to win approval of their measure on Wednesday and then send it to the Senate. The plan would cut current spending and put legal limits on future spending, saving what Republicans estimate to be about $1.2 trillion over 10 years. That approach would allow a debt limit increase that would extend into early next year.
At the same time, a new 12-member committee evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans would be assigned the job of finding an additional $1.8 trillion in savings. The panel would have special privileges to bring legislation before the House and Senate, and its proposal would not be subjected to amendment or Senate filibuster. If the plan passed, the president could seek a further $1.6 trillion increase in the debt limit based on the new committee's proposal.
In addition, members of the Senate and House would also be required to vote on a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution after Oct. 1 but before the end of the year -- a key demand from many House conservatives.
With House Democrats likely to line up solidly against Mr. Boehner's plan, the Republican leadership was pleading for support among the conservative rank and file, portraying it as the best alternative to end the impasse, even though it might fall short of the deep cuts many of the Republican newcomers want.
Some of the most conservative Republican House members, including Representative Allen West of Florida, endorsed it after the leadership made its case in an afternoon meeting. But others were balking, putting the plan's success at risk should the Republican leadership be forced to rely solely on Republican votes. By day's end, several Republicans -- including Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, the head of the conservative Republican Study Committee -- said Mr. Boehner did not have their vote.
''I can't support it in its current form,'' said Representative Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, citing insufficient cuts and ''the dearth of confidence I have in a 12-member commission being able to do what Congress hasn't been able to do.''
At least two Senate conservatives also came out against the House plan, showing that it would face some resistance there from both parties.
Mr. Reid and his fellow Democratic leaders have their own vote problems since they will almost certainly need 60 votes to break a filibuster and advance their proposal. That would require Mr. Reid to hold all the members of his party and win over at least seven Republicans.
In a tactical move, Mr. Reid on Monday night declined to begin the procedural steps needed to force a Senate vote Wednesday, preferring instead to see how Mr. Boehner fared in the House.

HEADLINE: Tribes Watch and Wait After Karzai Brother's Killing

BYLINE: By ALISSA J. RUBIN

 BODY:
KARZ, Afghanistan -- The marble grave of the Afghan president's half brother, assassinated two weeks ago by one of his own men, lies in this scruffy village that is near Kandahar and bears the family name. The white stone has a quiet to it that stands in stark contrast to the din he left behind.
Ahmed Wali Karzai's killing put the region's spoils up for grabs, and the tribal elite of Kandahar are watching, waiting, and above all, calculating their next move. They all want a piece of the future, and among them are strong men with guns.
Kandahar, the onetime capital of the country, is Afghanistan's center of gravity and the Taliban's heartland, deep in the south, where insurgents once penetrated most completely. 
''Ahmed Wali Karzai was a lid for Kandahar; he contained it,'' said Haji Agha Lalai, a tribal leader. He was a political enforcer for his brother; a kind of C.E.O. of vast economic and smuggling enterprises; go-to man for the Americans; and a bulwark against the insurgency.
He wielded power, tribal leaders can now say, with a Machiavellian ability that made many elders chafe. They say they are unlikely to tolerate that again.
With President Hamid Karzai's family split by rivalries and the brother he appointed to succeed Ahmed Wali as leader of the Populzai tribe seen as weak, elders predict that the family's, and by extension the president's, power in the south is waning. All the possible successors to Ahmed Wali as de facto leader in Kandahar are seen as flawed, suggesting that greater uncertainty and insecurity lie ahead in the scramble to control a rich prize.
Kandahar is the only major city in a rural region dominated by the lucrative poppy trade that supplies the world with most of its opium. Billions of dollars have poured in from American military for security contracts, and billions more from United States and British foreign aid programs. A brisk smuggling trade to and from Pakistan to circumvent Afghan customs yields large payouts to corrupt officials.
The Karzai family's loyalty to the president has begun to fracture openly, with fights over money as one motive. ''I completely disagree with President Karzai on all levels, on the military side, on security and on economics; we are completely at odds,'' said Mahmoud Karzai. He cited his brother's handling of Kabul Bank, in which Mahmoud Karzai was a shareholder and had borrowed more than $22 million from the bank, according to an Afghan anticorruption office report.
The bank was put into receivership after the discovery that it had more than $850 million in bad loans, effectively cutting off the supply of cash to Mahmoud Karzai and other politically connected borrowers. Mahmoud Karzai said he had wanted a plan drawn up for shareholders and borrowers to repay the bank.
Hashmat Karzai, a powerful cousin in Kandahar, has also been battling President Karzai over the outcome of the election from which he was disqualified after accusations of fraud.
Several contenders for provincial governor are outside the family. Among them is Gul Agha Shirzai, a former governor of Kandahar and current governor of Nangarhar Province. He has a reputation for promoting economic development and for demanding a share of every contract. When he was last in Kandahar, he rewarded members of his own tribe. He fought against people he labeled Taliban, but many of them claim they were wrongly identified, intensifying resentment of the government, tribal elders said.
Another possibility is the current mayor, Ghulam Haider Hamidi, who was close to Ahmed Wali, but whom many Kandaharis describe as distant because he spent many years in the United States. There is also Arif Noorzai, Ahmed Wali's brother-in-law, who is often described as having links to drug smugglers and ties to the same private security industry that enriched many close to Ahmed Wali, according to a report by the Institute for the Study of War, a nonpartisan policy research group.
Tribal elders complained Ahmed Wali bypassed them in favor of junior members and did not seek their counsel. ''He did it to all the tribes, and instability and resentment is the result,'' said Haji Mohammed Ehsan, a member of the provincial council and a member of the Noorzai tribe.
While Ahmed Wali was in power, however, his tactics worked. His home was crowded with people who came from Kandahar and neighboring provinces to seek his counsel or ask for favors. His ability to maneuver among them maintained an uneasy equilibrium, albeit one pockmarked by violence. Although attacks by suicide bombers and armed gunmen still took place, he helped the Americans go after the Taliban, effectively eliminating their safe havens in rural districts, although not yet their presence.
One senior American official who formerly worked in Afghanistan described him as a ''guy we could always go to and get things done.'' The official requested anonymity because of the delicacy of the situation. The price was allowing him great influence over security contracts in the area.
No American diplomats would speak for this article.
''Most of the people feel relief that he's gone, even in his own tribe,'' said Mohammed Satai, a local elder. ''Any construction, whether Afghan or foreigner, if they didn't give him a share, he wouldn't let them work here.''
A former director of education for the province, Hayatullah Rafiqi, said he had been pressured by Ahmed Wali to hire specific people for jobs as principals at schools. When he refused he was detained and prosecutors asked him to write down the name of every school in the province -- there are more than 300. Ultimately, he said, he was released and forced into retirement.
Of more than a dozen people interviewed, only members of the Karzai family believed that Shah Wali Karzai, anointed by President Karzai as the new head of his Populzai tribe, will be able to take his brother's place. Shah Wali, did not respond to requests through his brother Mahmoud Karzai to meet with The New York Times.
Kandahar elders describe Shah Wali in generally positive terms. The mayor, Mr. Hamidi, recalled asking Ahmed Wali to release someone who had been arrested as a Taliban. Ahmed Wali warned that it was not a good idea, but agreed to mayor's request. The man later returned to the Taliban, the mayor said. ''I believe Shah Wali would not have accepted my request,'' he said.
Mahmoud Karzai said politics was not his brother's first choice. ''He doesn't know every one yet but very soon he will,'' he said.
While few of the choices seem appealing, many Kandaharis believe they do need a unifying force. ''Any person from any of the districts would come with his problem and go to Ahmed Wali Khan and Ahmed Wali Khan's door was open,'' said Ustad Abdul Halim, a leader of the Noorzai tribe, one of the strongest in Kandahar. ''Now the people have lost the door so they are looking until they find a new door.''

CORRECTION-DATE: July 28, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Tuesday about speculation in Afghanistan over who might replace Ahmed Wali Karzai, the assassinated leader of the provincial council in Kandahar and a half-brother of President Hamid Karzai, misstated the name of the province where Gul Agha Sharzai, a possible successor, is the governor. It is Nangarhar -- not Jalalabad, which is the Nangarhar provincial capital.

GRAPHIC: PHOTOS: Workers build a permanent grave for Ahmed Wali Karzai, whose assassination on July 12 left a power vacuum in the strategic Kandahar region.
''I completely disagree with President Karzai on all levels, on the military side, on security and on economics,'' his brother Mahmoud Karzai says. (A4)

HEADLINE: Congress In the Lead

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
Some of us like to think big. We thought at the beginning of this debt crisis that it might be possible to reach a Grand Bargain. This deal would make a serious dent in the country's awful debt problem. It would begin to reform entitlements. It would involve enough revenue to forestall ruinous cuts in domestic programs.
The Grand Bargain would yield obvious political benefits. President Obama would show independents that he could move to the center. Republicans would be able to brag about a big reduction in the size of government. 
Alas, the dream of a Grand Bargain died Friday evening for three reasons.
First, it was always going to be difficult to round up the necessary Congressional votes. Republicans didn't want the tax increases. Democrats didn't want the entitlement cuts.
Second, the White House negotiating process was inadequate. Neither the president nor the House speaker ever wrote down and released their negotiating positions. Everything was mysterious, shifting and slippery. One day the president was agreeing to an $800 billion revenue increase; the next day he was asking for $400 billion more. Spending cuts that seemed to be part of the package suddenly seemed hollow. Negotiating partners disappeared.
It was phenomenally hard to figure out exactly who was offering what. Democrats in Congress were kept in the dark and were understandably suspicious. It was all a recipe for misunderstandings, hurt feelings and collapse.
Third, the president lost his cool. Obama never should have gone in front of the cameras just minutes after the talks faltered Friday evening. His appearance was suffused with that ''I'm the only mature person in Washington'' condescension that drives everybody else crazy. Obama lectured the leaders of the House and Senate in the sort of patronizing tone that a junior high principal might use with immature delinquents. He talked about unreturned phone calls and being left at the altar, personalizing the issue like a spurned prom date.
Obama's Friday appearance had a gigantic unintended consequence. It brought members of Congress together. They decided to take control. The White House is now on the sidelines. Democratic and Republican Congressional leaders are negotiating directly with one another.
The atmosphere has changed. It now seems more likely that we will get a deal. It just won't be as significant as we Grand Bargainers originally wanted.
John Boehner and Harry Reid will continue to verbally abuse each other. But there's a script to their taunts. Nobody's feelings are hurt. The old pros are perfectly capable of exchanging cliched volleys in the morning and then going off and negotiating with each other in the afternoon.
Furthermore, the negotiating process has changed. On Monday, both Boehner and Reid produced proposals. The main points were written down and available for all to see. Each side not only represented its own views, it sent signals about where future agreements could be found.
Boehner released a plan that involved statutory spending caps with an enforcement mechanism to make sure the cuts are real. Reid released a plan involving bigger long-term spending cuts, with much of the heavy lifting done by a bipartisan select committee. These two carefully coordinated plans are different, but they naturally fit together.
With a little imagination, it's easy to see how they could be merged to give everybody something. Republicans would get some guaranteed spending reductions. Democrats in swing states could campaign on a nominal multitrillion-dollar debt reduction while protecting entitlements. Republicans wouldn't have to vote on raising the debt ceiling until after some guaranteed spending cuts. Democrats could count the reduced Iraq and Afghanistan war costs as part of the spending reductions.
It's not clear if an arrangement would really push the next debt ceiling fight until after the 2012 election, but even that could presumably be fudged, especially if Democrats were willing to give the Republicans broader spending cuts and a balanced-budget amendment vote in the Senate.
On the one hand, there has been an outbreak of sanity since Congress took control. On the other hand, the deal they are working on doesn't come close to cutting the $4 trillion or so many say would be required to prevent a downgrade of the U.S. debt.
This should be a humbling moment for the White House, and maybe a learning experience. There are other people who have been around Washington a long time. They know how to play this game. As a result of their efforts, we may see some debt reduction but nothing big and transformational. Obama won't get his centrist election boost. Republicans won't have to wrestle with tax increases. Democrats won't have to wrestle with entitlement reform.
The Old Guard wins. Obama's televised campaign speech Monday night was behind the times. The action has moved to Capitol Hill.

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths THOMASES, FLORENCE JOSEPHSON

 BODY:
THOMASES--Florence Josephson, mother of four, mentor of many, died July 24, 2011 at the age of 97. The loving wife of the late Fred Thomases, devoted mother to Robert, Matthew, Jeffrey and Susan and caring mother-in-law to their respective partners, Jo, Jean, Mary Kay, and Bill (who left us too early), she dedicated her life to family, friends and philanthropy. She graduated from Hunter College in 1934 and served for a many years as a director of the Scholarship and Welfare Fund of the Alumni Association. Mrs. Thomases was a founding member of the Ramapo College Board of Trustees and served several years as Board President. 
She supported countless students and faculty through endowed scholarships and grants for research and teaching excellence. Along with her late husband, she founded The Florence and Fred Thomases Foundation which supports many agencies and projects (both domestic and off-shore) that concern themselves with hunger, education, health, and economic development. Mrs. Thomases was an energizing figure in dozens of Jewish and civic organizations. She was a strong supporter of the State of Israel and, in particular, the Jerusalem Foundation and the Israel Cancer Research Fund. A lifelong Democrat and political activist, Mrs. Thomases campaigned over the years to help elect scores of progressive candidates. At the age of 94, she was a passionate supporter of Hillary Clinton in the 2008 primaries and then volunteered for Barack Obama in the general election. She grew up in the Bronx, raised her family in Englewood, New Jersey, and then relocated to Manhattan to spend the last seven years of her life to be near what she loved doing most -- enjoying the cultural life of the city. Over the years, Mrs. Thomases sponsored many struggling artists. And, despite her failing health, she found time this past June to fund one last project -- a documentary film about the hard-working women in the cattle industry of rural Arizona. The beloved grandmother of Holly, Andrew, Ken, Caroline, Josh, Ben, David, Danny, Greg, Lili, Phoebe, Shannon, Tom, and Justine, Mrs. Thomases also took great pride in being the great-grandmother of 12.

HEADLINE: The End of Eurosclerosis

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Employment, the non-difference.

 BODY:
I've written a number of times about the weird way American perceptions of Europe seem stuck in the past. It's common -- especially on the right, but more broadly too -- to see Europe as a land of stagnant economies and lack of jobs. This vision had some truth in the 1990s, but was becoming less and less true even before the crisis, which hit US employment much harder than European employment.
The New York Fed has noticed. Via Mark Thoma, the Liberty Street blog has a piece on the vanishing US-EU employment gap. If you want a simple takeaway, here's the picture: 
More detailed analysis shows that the remaining gap comes from lower employment rates in Europe for the young and old; prime-age workers, especially men, are if anything more likely to be working in Europe.
And you should note that this European performance comes despite the fact that tax levels and levels of social benefits are vastly higher than they are here. Any US politician proposing even a partial move in Europe's direction would be accused of being a job-killer. Somehow, though, the jobs survive.
Oh, and as many people have noticed, America now has European levels of joblessness without a European safety net. We're definitely leading in the misery race.

HEADLINE: Everyone Should Learn Japanese

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Well, recent Japanese economic history, anyway.

 BODY:
OK, maybe not. But you really shouldn't be commenting on current economic events unless you've studied the last time a major economy found itself up against the zero lower bound on interest rates. Those of us who had paid attention to Japan knew that large increases in the monetary base wouldn't be inflationary and that large government borrowing wouldn't drive up interest rates. Those who hadn't got it completely wrong.
So when Dan Gross -- generally a good guy on these things -- wrote this, I was kind of shocked:
As for the credit ratings, again, don't hold your breath. It would be an exceedingly bold move for S&P and Moody's to downgrade the U.S. sovereign credit rating. And, generally, these firms only act on sovereign credits after the market has made them look like chumps by driving up interest rates. If there has been a time in history when S&P downgraded a sovereign credit that was borrowing for 10 years at 3 percent, I'm not aware of it. Despite their desire to get ahead of the curve, the ratings agencies won't act until well after the market does.
Uh, Japan 2002. And that's not an obscure example: it's a key piece of evidence that the rating agencies (a) have an ideological agenda and (b) have no idea what they're doing when it comes to sovereign debt.

HEADLINE: The Cult That Is Destroying America

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Not the right wing, either.

 BODY:
Watching our system deal with the debt ceiling crisis -- a wholly self-inflicted crisis, which may nonetheless have disastrous consequences -- it's increasingly obvious that what we're looking at is the destructive influence of a cult that has really poisoned our political system.
And no, I don't mean the fanaticism of the right. Well, OK, that too. But my feeling about those people is that they are what they are; you might as well denounce wolves for being carnivores. Crazy is what they do and what they are.
No, the cult that I see as reflecting a true moral failure is the cult of balance, of centrism.
Think about what's happening right now. We have a crisis in which the right is making insane demands, while the president and Democrats in Congress are bending over backward to be accommodating -- offering plans that are all spending cuts and no taxes, plans that are far to the right of public opinion.
So what do most news reports say? They portray it as a situation in which both sides are equally partisan, equally intransigent -- because news reports always do that. And we have influential pundits calling out for a new centrist party, a new centrist president, to get us away from the evils of partisanship. 
The reality, of course, is that we already have a centrist president -- actually a moderate conservative president. Once again, health reform -- his only major change to government -- was modeled on Republican plans, indeed plans coming from the Heritage Foundation. And everything else -- including the wrongheaded emphasis on austerity in the face of high unemployment -- is according to the conservative playbook.
What all this means is that there is no penalty for extremism; no way for most voters, who get their information on the fly rather than doing careful study of the issues, to understand what's really going on.
You have to ask, what would it take for these news organizations and pundits to actually break with the convention that both sides are equally at fault? This is the clearest, starkest situation one can imagine short of civil war. If this won't do it, nothing will.
And yes, I think this is a moral issue. The "both sides are at fault" people have to know better; if they refuse to say it, it's out of some combination of fear and ego, of being unwilling to sacrifice their treasured pose of being above the fray.
It's a terrible thing to watch, and our nation will pay the price.

HEADLINE: Chinese Reverse-Merger Companies Draw Lawsuits

BYLINE: AZAM AHMED


HIGHLIGHT: According to a new study, more than one-fourth of all federal securities class-action lawsuits filed so far this year come from investors in these China-based companies.

 BODY:
A few years back, Chinese reverse-merger companies were all the rage on Wall Street.
These days, they are experiencing a different kind of rage.
According to a new study, more than one-fourth of all federal securities class-action lawsuits filed so far this year come from investors in these China-based companies, which are listed on American exchanges through a back-door method that circumvents the scrutiny of a conventional initial public offering. The companies do so by purchasing a defunct American-listed company, merging with it and then adopting its ticker symbol.
Stock prices in these companies have fallen more than 50 percent this year, thanks to a crackdown by American regulators in the wake of a number of financial scandals. Some Chinese companies have fired auditors, restated earnings and owned up to lying about assets, admissions that have decimated billions of dollars in market value and harmed other reverse-merger companies that have been accused of no wrongdoing. 
This year has been particularly bad, with several high-profile implosions at companies whose investor base included members of the hedge fund elite. The Nasdaq Stock Market has delisted companies and the Securities and Exchange Commission has halted trading in the shares of a number of these companies. 
For example, Sino Forest, a timber company in China, has seen its stock price drop sharply following a report from Muddy Waters Research accusing the company of fraud. John A. Paulson, who heads the $38 billion hedge fund Paulson & Company, lost nearly half a billion dollars following the sell-off in shares of Sino Forest after the report. Others reverse-merger companies that have seen their stock prices tumble this year following accusations of fraud include China Media Express and Duoyuan Global Water. 
As a result, shareholders are increasingly filing class-action lawsuits against the companies, auditors and even the investment banks that helped structure the deals that brought these companies to North American exchanges. There have been 24 lawsuits filed in the first half of this year, 17 of which were filed in the second quarter, according to the study by the Stanford Law School Securities Class Action Clearinghouse and Cornerstone Research in Boston. That compares with seven suits filed in all of 2010.
In the wake of the financial crisis, reverse-merger transactions became an alluring way for both banks and investors to make money outside of a flagging American market. For Chinese company executives, it allowed them to tap into American capital markets. For bankers, it was a way to supplement dwindling business. For investors, it promised access to the growth of China.
The process entailed a wide network of handlers for these Chinese companies, including bankers, lawyers and auditors. But over the last few years, as these companies have been subjected to withering criticism from an army of bloggers and investors betting against their stock prices, the entire process has come under scrutiny.

HEADLINE: Deadline for Mortgage Help Program Extended

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: The deadline for a program to help at-risk homeowners was extended until Wednesday,

 BODY:
The deadline for unemployed homeowners in 32 states to apply for mortgage assistance under a special emergency program has been extended until Wednesday.
If they qualify, homeowners can get interest-free loans to pay a portion of their monthly mortgage, as well as back payments and legal fees, for up to $50,000 or two years, whichever comes first. The loans do not have to be repaid, as long as the homeowner continues making mortgage payments on time for five years. The program was expected to help from 20,000 to 30,000 distressed homeowners.
Known as the Emergency Homeowners' Loan Program, it is available to homeowners ineligible for the larger, $7.6 billion "hardest hit" fund, which provided assistance to 18 states that absorbed the worst of the housing crisis.
The emergency program is available in the following states: Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.
The program is also offered in Puerto Rico. Five other states also have similar programs: Connecticut, Delaware, Idaho, Maryland, and Pennsylvania.

HIGHLIGHT: Can conservatives declare victory?

 BODY:
Yuval Levin, on the debt ceiling state of play:As the details of the Boehner bill become clearer, it's increasingly apparent that the bill is just what the moment calls for: significant cuts achieved through statutory sequestration caps, no tax increase, no backsliding on entitlement reform or implicit acceptance of Obamacare, a path to another process that could lead to more cuts without tax increases, and the setting of a precedent that from now on increases in the debt ceiling must be accompanied by proportional spending cuts. It's far from perfect, of course-meaningful entitlement reform is the only way to really address the debt problem, and even short of that some more significant discretionary cuts would be good-but Republicans don't control Washington, and given their limited formal power, an end to this process that looks something like this bill would be pretty remarkable.
Even the Reid bill, though its cuts are less real, would be a better conclusion than has seemed plausible throughout much of this process, and there is nothing particularly important about a "short-term" rather than a "long-term" increase, provided a long-term one maintains the one-for-one ratio of spending cuts to debt-ceiling increase. Something between the two bills, which is now perhaps the most that Democrats can hope for, would be an extraordinary win for Republicans. []But it's only a victory if you actually have the votes to reach out and claim it - and, just as importantly, if you have the capacity to admit to yourself that you've won. I just don't sense that House Republicans and many conservatives are there yet. And in an ever-so-precarious economic situation, isn't there a point at which trying to turn an extraordinary win into an extra-extraordinary win ceases to be sound strategy and becomes something more dangerous and irresponsible?

HEADLINE: Independent Motorcycle Designers Achieve Over 150 M.P.G. at Ohio Challenge

BYLINE: STUART F. BROWN


HIGHLIGHT: Contestants at the 2011 Vetter Fuel Economy Challenge were required to design bikes that would face down headwinds at highway speeds while hauling four bags of groceries.

 BODY:
LEXINGTON, Ohio - Motorcycle tinkerers questing after high fuel efficiency were forced to consider everyday practicality at the 2011 Vetter Fuel Economy Challenge at Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course last weekend.
An industrial designer best known for his work with motorcycle fairings, Craig Vetter founded the efficiency event in the early 1980s before taking a break for a few years to raise a family. He decided recently to revive the event, with a new focus on developing two-wheelers that could transport people and their effects comfortably at real-world speeds.
This year's contenders were required to create bikes that could sustain 70 miles per hour running into a headwind, provide a comfortable riding position and carry four bags of groceries onboard as a demonstration of everyday usefulness.
"I don't want to end up with museum queens," Mr. Vetter said here on Sunday. "I want to change the world and carry four bags of groceries." About 20 entrants answered Mr. Vetter's call.
Today's motorcycles generally return fairly poor mileage for their size and weight because the market has emphasized high performance above other factors. But with escalating fuel prices and rising awareness of carbon emissions, it does not seem inconceivable that a manufacturer might create new products that incorporate some of the ideas seen in the home-builts on display here.
Charly Perethian, a longtime efficiency chaser from Dahlonega, Ga., took top honors on a machine based on the Honda NX 250 dirt bike, which achieved 156 miles per gallon over the 110-mile highway course. For Mr. Perethian, winning with 156 m.p.g. might have seemed perfunctory at best. He prevailed at the 1983 Vetter Challenge on a 185 cc Yamaha-powered bike that went 372 miles on a gallon of fuel, earning it a spot in the Smithsonian's collection. That bike, however, was a peapod-shape micromachine that traveled at 50 m.p.h. with its rider tucked tightly inside. It was hardly comfortable, and there was no room for cargo.
A streamlined diesel-powered motorcycle ridden by Fred Hayes of Hesperia, Calif., earned second, at 143 m.p.g. Hayes Diversified Technologies, Mr. Hayes's company, supplies the United States Marines with Kawasaki KLR 650 scout bikes equipped with special diesel engines.
Mr. Vetter placed sixth, achieving 109 m.p.g. on a bulbous yellow machine derived from a Honda 250 Helix scooter.
Mr. Vetter's bike is a rolling D.I.Y. transportation manifesto. Its aerodynamic shell tapers to a thin wedge. The front section is formed from plastic looseleaf-binder covers joined with plastic rivets. Toward the aft end, the skin transitions to paper normally used for making milk cartons. Replacement headlights designed for the Toyota Prius merge into the nose contours. The effect is more sea creature than road-going conveyance.
Mr. Vetter said that while some streamlining was necessary for efficiency, designers needed to devise shapes that would behave acceptably in crosswinds. Concentrating weight forward seems to help with this, and having enough horsepower to do the job, but nothing in excess, is critical to stretching the gallons.

HEADLINE: Maybe the Unemployed Aren't Invisible After All

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Maybe there's a good reason that Washington wants to talk about everything but unemployment.

 BODY:
America is in the worst jobs crisis since the Great Depression, and Washington is fussing about whether it will make good on the debts it has already committed to. What gives?
I've described a few different theories explaining why the unemployed are invisible, including that unemployed people have low voter turnout rates; they don't congregate at unemployment offices anymore; the labor unions that used to organize them have weakened; extended jobless benefits have kept these workers complacent; the media haven't devoted sufficient coverage to unemployment; and the huge unemployment statistics desensitize people to the jobs crisis.
But what if the entire premise of my question is wrong: What if the unemployed are actually visible, and that's why Washington keeps wanting to talk about everything else?
In his column last week, David Leonhardt noted that "by pushing for new stimulus," President Obama "would also tie himself ever closer to the troubled economy and the unpopular policies to help it."
Maybe members of Congress are thinking the same way about their own images. They know the jobs crisis is the elephant in the room. But they don't want to talk about it, because almost anything they could do to alleviate unemployment would still not return it to prerecession levels, so they would still be blamed for any remaining pain.
And so the debt ceiling debate is just a big fiscal version of "Wag the Dog" - a diversion created to distract America from the real crisis at hand. Except that in the process, Washington may be creating a whole other crisis that merely magnifies the first one.

        
Are We About to Repeat the Mistakes of 1937?
        
Media Culpa? Coverage of Jobs vs. Deficit
        
Are Jobless Benefits Keeping the Unemployed Complacent (and Invisible)?

HEADLINE: Conspiracy Theories About Republicans and the Economy

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Cynics may contend that the G.O.P. has a strategic interest in continued economic turmoil. But the economy is likely to be in bad shape in November 2012 no matter what happens in Washington.

 BODY:
In the last few days, several readers, economists and radio hosts have asked me whether I buy the most cynical interpretation of the debt crisis stalemate: maybe Republicans are reluctant to raise the debt ceiling, or are calling for austerity measures that could slow the recovery, because they actually the economy to do badly. That way voters will demand a change in political leadership, and vote more Republicans into office in 2012.
I'm no political scientist, but that sounds a little too Machiavellian even for the most hardhearted of politicians.
But more important, I'm also reluctant to believe this conspiracy theory because the conspiracy isn't necessary. That is, the economy is likely to be in bad shape in November 2012 no matter what happens with the debt talks.
As of January, the Congressional Budget Office projected that unemployment in the fourth quarter of 2012 would be 8.2 percent. Macroeconomic Advisers, another respected forecaster, recently published a similar outlook.
Of course, there are many outcomes to these debt negotiations that would make the economy even worse off than the current projections show. But really, there's no need to paint the lily.

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Removes Credit Ratings From Regulations

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: On Tuesday, the Securities and Exchange Commission unanimously approved a plan to erase references to credit ratings from certain rulebooks.

 BODY:
Credit ratings are sprinkled throughout hundreds of pages of financial statutes and guidelines. 
But ever since Standard & Poor's, Moody's and other credit rating agencies belatedly sounded the alarms about the subprime mortgage mess, securities regulators have aimed to curb their influence over the financial industry. 
 On Tuesday, the Securities and Exchange Commission unanimously approved a plan to erase references to credit ratings from certain rulebooks. The agency also adopted a substitute to the ratings, the first of several such changes the commission must enact in the coming months.
"I believe the rules will provide an appropriate and workable alternative to credit ratings," Mary L. Schapiro, the agency's chairwoman, said in a statement. 
The rules, stemming from the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory law, are part of a broader movement in Washington to crack down on the rating agencies, which awarded rosy grades to dubious investments at the peak of the mortgage bubble. 
Dodd-Frank created a laundry list of new regulations for the industry, including proposals to make it easier for investors to sue the agencies. The S.E.C. must also create its own Office of Credit Ratings to police the raters, though the agency has yet to open its doors as it struggles to scrape together the needed funds. 
The S.E.C. instead prioritized its plans to remove credit ratings from dozens of regulations, some of them decades old. For instance, securities laws currently require banks and corporations to rely on credit ratings when issuing debt and setting capital levels. 
The S.E.C. is not acting alone. Dodd-Frank requires every financial regulator to scrub credit ratings from their regulations. The Federal Reserve on Monday said it identified more than 40 bank regulations that reference credit ratings. 
The S.E.C.'s decision on Tuesday centered on longstanding rules that provide companies a shortcut for issuing debt securities. Until now, companies could register certain securities with the S.E.C. through an abbreviated disclosure process if at least one rating agency awarded the securities an investment-grade rating.
Now, the S.E.C. will enforce a new standard of creditworthiness. Companies can dart around lengthy reporting forms, regardless of credit ratings, if they meet one of several qualifications, the agency said. 
Companies that issue more than $1 billion of regulated nonconvertible securities within the last three years or have $750 million of outstanding non-convertible securities will qualify, according to the S.E.C. Firms that are a "wholly-owned subsidiary of a well-known seasoned issuer" will also be eligible. 
To allay some concerns about the rules, the agency also agreed to grandfather in companies that were previously eligible for the shortened disclosure. The extention will last for three years. 
Ms. Schapiro said "just about all issuers that currently" qualify for the shortcut will meet the new standards. 
The rule drew rare bipartisan support from the agency's commissioners. Troy Paredes, a Republican commissioner who originally objected to portions of the rule when it was first proposed in February, said it was "meaningfully improved." 
The S.E.C. on Tuesday also adopted new rules that require larger trading firms - including hedge funds, banks and high-frequency traders - to disclose crucial information to the agency. The rule, regulators said, will allow the S.E.C. to keep a closer eye on risky trading tactics that could spark a repeat of last year's flash crash, when the Dow Jones industrial average dropped roughly 900 points in 20 minutes before climbing back later that day to erase most of the earlier losses.

HEADLINE: UBS and Deutsche Bank Results Underscore Anxiety Over Risk

BYLINE: JACK EWING and JULIA WERDIGIER


HIGHLIGHT: Investment banking performance falls short at both financial institutions amid the uncertainty caused by Europe's debt crisis.

 BODY:
FRANKFURT - Two of Europe's largest financial institutions delivered a reminder on Tuesday that investment banking remains a fickle source of revenue, as UBS issued a profit warning and Deutsche Bank reported earnings that were below expectations.
UBS, Switzerland's biggest bank, warned that it would probably miss an earnings target set two years ago after its profit fell by half in the second quarter, in part because of a dismal performance at its investment banking unit. Deutsche Bank fared better, reporting a 6 percent increase in net profit that still missed forecasts. Revenue from trading fell because of uncertainty caused by Europe's debt crisis, the bank said, while warning that profit from investment banking would fall short of targets.
The results may help reinforce Deutsche Bank's decision on Monday to split its leadership between Anshu Jain, the head of its volatile investment banking business, and Jurgen Fitschen, a member of the management board with closer ties to the more stable retail banking business in Germany. They will succeed Josef Ackermann, who is expected to become chairman of Deutsche Bank's supervisory board, in May.
While banks have experienced a recovery in investment banking profits since the financial crisis, they are under pressure by regulators to reduce risk, and they continue to face market turbulence caused by the European sovereign debt crisis and the budget deadlock in the United States. In addition, there are signs that growth is slowing in Europe.
Deutsche Bank has responded by putting more focus on its network of branches in Germany, while UBS is slashing costs.
"Banks' returns have declined overall in the last 12 months, reflecting deleveraging and the actions being taken in advance of increased capital requirements," Oswald J. Grubel, the chief executive of UBS, said in a statement.
UBS's profit fell to 1 billion Swiss francs ($1.2 billion) in the three months through June, from 2 billion francs in the comparable quarter a year earlier, the company said. Pretax profit in the investment banking unit slumped to 376 million francs, from 1.3 billion francs in the same period last year.
UBS said in 2009 that it intended to reach a pretax profit of 15 billion francs by 2014. But Mr. Grubel said on Tuesday that goal "is unlikely to be achieved in the original time frame."
Mr. Grubel added that UBS was "likely" to "book significant restructuring charges later this year" after a series of cost cuts.
Mr. Grubel has been focusing UBS on its main wealth management and investment banking activities to repair a bank that was among the hardest hit in the financial crisis.
But some analysts have recently started to doubt that Mr. Grubel's plan would be enough. Its investment banking unit has continued to struggle, and the stricter capital requirements have hurt profitability.
A string of departures by bankers and lower appetite for risk among clients have hampered efforts to repair the unit.
UBS said Tuesday it plans to cut costs by as much as 2 billion francs over the next two to three years. At the same time, a decline in demand for its services because of a weaker economic outlook is expected to "constrain growth prospects."
Deutsche Bank, the largest bank in Germany, said it increased revenue from noninvestment banking businesses such as retail banking, helping lift net profit to 1.2 billion euros ($1.7 billion). The numbers showed that Deutsche Bank was making progress in reducing its dependence on investment banking. Pretax profit in the corporate and investment bank was flat at 1.3 billion euros, while pretax profit from private clients and asset management more than doubled to 684 million euros, the bank said.
"Our efforts to recalibrate and rebalance our platform are paying off nicely," Mr. Ackermann said in a statement.
Deutsche Bank said that Europe's sovereign debt crisis has unsettled investors and led to lower sales and trading revenue, making it unlikely that the bank would meet its pretax profit goal for 2011 of 6.4 billion euros for the investment banking unit. However, the bank as a whole will still meet its full-year pretax target of 10 billion euros because of improved performance by the other units, Deutsche said.
Deutsche Bank also said it took a charge of 132 million euros to reflect the decline in value of its Greek bonds. It thus became one of the first European banks to recognize losses from Greece following a debt-relief agreement by European leaders.
"While the earnings environment remains tough for investment banks, Deutsche Bank has fared better than European peers and arguably faces lower short-term earnings risk," Jon Peace, banking analyst at Nomura International, said in a note.
Late Monday, Deutsche Bank resolved a leadership crisis by saying that Mr. Jain and Mr. Fitschen will share chief executive duties. Mr. Ackermann, 63, has been chief executive since 2002.
Investors had favored Mr. Jain, 48, whose unit continues to supply by far the greatest share of profits, as chief executive. But Mr. Jain, a native of India who is not fluent in German, was regarded as not ready to assume the statesmanlike duties expected of the head of an institution that holds a prominent place in the nation's identity.
Mr. Fitschen, 62, is expected to help overcome reservations by Deutsche Bank staff members about Mr. Jain.

HEADLINE: Stagecraft of the Obama-Boehner Debt Debate

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Two speeches on Monday night capped a remarkable series of dueling theatrical performances by the nation's two most powerful politicians.

 BODY:
Set aside the great policy debate and the ideological struggles of the debt fight in Washington, and what's left is a remarkable series of dueling theatrical performances by the nation's two most powerful politicians, played out for all to see on television.
On Monday night, the stagecraft reached a pinnacle, with President Obama pleading his case before a prime-time national audience of millions, and House Speaker John A. Boehner demanding -- and receiving -- time before the same audience to respond.
With just seven days before the threat of a national financial default, Mr. Obama once again seemed professorial, if increasingly annoyed that Republicans refuse to accept what he calls a "balanced" solution to the nation's debt crisis. Mr. Boehner was defiant on that point, saying that the president's approach "means we spend more, you pay more."
For weeks, the two men have been engaged in a rare back-and-forth series of confrontational public exchanges. Such arguments in Washington are often carried out by proxies -- a spokesperson, a fellow partisan, a sympathetic media personality or an authorized surrogate. But in this fight, those would not do.
"This has been, in many ways, a personal conversation between the two of them carried out in public without spokesmen," said a senior Democratic strategist, who asked for anonymity to discuss the president's public appearances. "The stakes are so high for both of the parties, that using your most effective and your largest megaphones to deliver the message is critical."
At stake in their blame game has been not only the resolution of the debt fight and their own political futures, but the view of their two parties as the country heads toward an election year.
"This is a moment that will help shape both events and perceptions well into 2012," the Democratic strategist said. "The perceptions of the two parties and who they fight for and what they are doing is at stake."
For Mr. Obama, who won election in no small part on the strength of his oratorical skills, it has been a natural decision to use the bully pulpit that comes with winning the Oval Office. In the month since the debt fight has been fully engaged, Mr. Obama has held four news conferences and, now, a prime-time address to the nation.
A White House official said the president's goal had been to convince Americans to put pressure on Republicans. It was also clearly an effort by the president to reassert his relevance after a weekend in which negotiations moved from his White House back to the halls of Congress.
"With the imminent threat of default facing our nation, the president chose this moment to take the case to the American people that we need a solution that lets us keep our obligations and reduce our deficits," the official said. "He wanted to lay out what is at stake, why it matters to people across the country and why it is essential we move forward."
For Mr. Boehner, the effort to match the president appearance-for-appearance has been no accident. The speaker and his top aides decided weeks ago that Mr. Boehner would not let an opportunity go by to respond in kind.
"Early on, we made a pledge that at any time the president was going to go out, we were going to go out," a senior aide to Mr. Boehner said, also asking for anonymity to discuss the strategy. "If he's going to speak to cameras, we were going to, too."
But Mr. Boehner's intended audience was very different than Mr. Obama's. In addition to speaking to the broader public, those close to the speaker said his remarks were directed at Republicans, and in particular at his Republican members in the House. It was important, they said, for those House members to see Mr. Boehner standing up to the president. 
"I think our members appreciated seeing Boehner out there. They said 'thank you for getting out there and spreading our message and sticking up for us,'" the aide to Mr. Boehner said. "In terms of advancing our message internally, it's helpful. It sets up the dynamic of their speaker standing up to the president."
Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner have worked privately during the last month to try to reach a deal, and there has been much speculation that the two men have a surprisingly strong rapport. Each has praised the other for a willingness to listen -- up to a point. But Mr. Boehner's decision to walk away from those discussions three times has made their public explanations for the breakdowns more direct and angry. 
In public appearances, the two men have seemed to alternate between the good cop and the bad cop.
In Mr. Obama's first news conference on the subject, he came across as judgmental, wagging his finger at Republicans for their stubbornness. But in his next appearance before the press, he went out of his way to suggest that Mr. Boehner and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, were "sincere" in their efforts to reduce the deficit and avoid default.
"I think Speaker Boehner has been very sincere about trying to do something big," Mr. Obama said on July 11. "I think he'd like to do something big. His politics within his caucus are very difficult -- you're right."
Likewise, Mr. Boehner has repeatedly said Mr. Obama has negotiated with him "in good faith," but he also has lashed out at the president. In one statement he accused the Obama administration of "burying our kids and grandkids in new debt and offered no plan to rein in spending."
And in an appearance on Fox News Sunday, Mr. Boehner accused the president of believing that "the next election matters more than doing what is right for the country."
Asked about Mr. Boehner's increasingly harsh tone -- including in Monday night's remarks -- his senior aide said the speaker "would never go out and be angry. If we ever were harsher in our tone, that reflected some frustration with the president for not being serious enough about this."
If anything, the remarks from both men on Monday night served to reinforce what they have been saying publicly for weeks: that there remains little, if any, area where they truly agree.
In his 15-minute speech, delivered behind a podium from the East Room of the White House, President Obama expressed optimism that "enough members of both parties will ultimately put politics aside and help us make progress."
Likewise, Mr. Boehner said that "we are up to the task," and he expressed hope that "President Obama will join us in this work."
But within both speeches, it was hard to find the substance to back up that optimism. With the clock ticking, one thing that seems certain to continue is the dueling appearances by the two men.

HEADLINE: 'Very Few' Democrats Will Back Boehner Plan, Hoyer Says

BYLINE: JADA F. SMITH


HIGHLIGHT: Representative Steny H. Hoyer, the House's No. 2 Democrat, grudgingly endorsed the Senate's debt limit proposal.

 BODY:
Representative Steny H. Hoyer, Democrat of Maryland and his party's whip, said that his side of the aisle has no plans to support the debt reduction proposal issued by House Speaker John A. Boehner. The bill will receive "very few", if any, votes from Democrats when it comes up for a vote as early as Wednesday, Mr. Hoyer said. Insisting that Republicans want to "hold the country hostage" with a short-term deficit strategy, he grudgingly pointed to the plan proposed by his Senate colleague, Harry Reid, majority leader and Democrat of Nevada, as the only plausible alternative to appease both chambers in a very divided Congress.
"I'm hopeful for the Reid plan, which is not a plan I would have been for," he said. "I would have been for a $4 trillion solution to deal with this long-term. We cannot solve this problem without revenues. Even Mr. Coburn said that," he added, referring to an acknowledgment by Senator Tom Coburn, an Oklahoma Republican and one of the most outspoken fiscal conservatives in Congress.
Mr. Hoyer argued that both parties had previously agreed that a debt ceiling increase should involve a long-term fix for the federal deficit. However, he said, the current G.O.P. proposal would extend the nation's borrowing authority for a brief period and force Congress to revisit the issue in another nine months. 
He said that Mr. Reid's plan would stabilize the economy and give confidence to the financial markets while appeasing at least some of the demands from both parties. "I think the Reid plan is the way out. It accomplishes everything they ask for," Mr. Hoyer said, which includes $1.2 trillion in spending cuts and no new revenue from tax increases. "But they can't take 'yes' for an answer."

HEADLINE: For Boehner, Pushback From Conservatives Over Debt Plan

BYLINE: MICHAEL SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Conservative House Republicans voiced opposition to the debt-ceiling bill proposed by their party's leader.

 BODY:
John A. Boehner, the House speaker, faced opposition Tuesday from some conservatives to his two-step plan for raising the debt ceiling even as he proceeded toward a vote on the proposal that could come as early as Wednesday.
Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, the chairman of the Republican Study Committee, a group of conservative House Republicans, issued a statement Tuesday opposing the legislation as an inadequate response to the nation's fiscal challenges.
"While I thank the Speaker for fighting for Republican principles, I cannot support the plan that was presented to House Republicans," Mr. Jordan said in a statement. He urged lawmakers to return to the "cut, cap and balance" legislation that has already failed in the Senate.
"Cut, cap and balance is the only plan on the table that meets this standard," he said. "Only a balanced budget amendment will actually solve our debt problems."
Mr. Jordan's opposition threatens to deprive Mr. Boehner of a significant number of his own members as he searches for 217 "yes" votes in the next 24 hours. Votes of "no" by more than 23 Republicans would mean the bill would need Democratic support to pass.
And Mr. Boehner's troubles with conservatives extend beyond his chamber. The Club for Growth, a conservative Washington interest group which is often influential with Republican members, also issued an "alert" to its members on Tuesday urging defeat of Mr. Boehner's legislation.
"The Club for Growth strongly opposes the Boehner debt limit plan," Chris Chocola, the president of the Club said in a statement. "The Boehner plan does not achieve the goals of cut, cap and balance and doesn't fix our fiscal mess. We are urging club members to call their members of Congress and ask them to oppose it."
The club statement promised to include Wednesday's vote on its annual scorecard of members' commitment to fiscally conservative legislation.
"Our Congressional Scorecard for the 112th Congress provides a comprehensive rating of how well or how poorly each member of Congress supports pro-growth, free-market policies and will be distributed to our members and to the public," the group said.
Not all conservatives are weighing in against Mr. Boehner's plan. Representative Allen B. West of Florida, a member of the Tea Party caucus, said on Twitter on Tuesday that he would support the bill.
"I will support the new debt deal -- it has enough of what I need including no tax hikes, spending caps and a step toward a balanced budget," Mr. West said.
And the U.S. Chamber of Commerce issued its own alert to members strongly supporting Mr. Boehner's legislation.
"While no legislation is perfect," the group said, the House legislation would "cut spending in the immediate term by more that the increase in the debt ceiling; ensure a workable, enforceable mechanism to facilitate additional spending cuts for future debt limit increases; and allow for a vote on significant reform to the budget process."
Still, the conservative opposition highlights the limits of Mr. Boehner's influence among his own members. And it suggests that the speaker and his lieutenants have their work cut out for themselves as they seek to pass their plan.
Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the majority leader, reportedly told Republican House members in a closed-door session that "the debt limit vote sucks" but that it must be passed anyway.

"While no legislation is perfect," the group said, the House legislation would "cut spending in the immediate term by more that the increase in the debt ceiling; ensure a workable, enforceable mechanism to facilitate additional spending cuts for future debt limit increases; and allow for a vote on significant reform to the budget process."
Still, the conservative opposition highlights the limits of Mr. Boehner's influence among his own members. And it suggests that the speaker and his lieutenants have their work cut out for themselves as they seek to pass their plan.
Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the majority leader, reportedly told Republican House members in a closed-door session that "the debt limit vote sucks" but that it must be passed anyway.

HEADLINE: Four Republican Senators Reject Boehner Plan


HIGHLIGHT: Four Republican Senators write colleagues in the House urging them not to support the fiscal plan being brought to the floor by the Republican leaders tomorrow.

 BODY:
File under: with friends like those ...
As if to highlight House Speaker John Boehner's challenge in mustering support within his own caucus, four Republican Senators have sent a letter to their colleagues in the House urging them to vote against fiscal legislation offered by Mr. Boehner.
"We write you today in strong opposition to the Debt Limit extension you will be considering in the House tomorrow," says the letter from Senators Rand Paul of Kentucky, Jim DeMint of South Carolina, David Vitter of Louisiana, and Mike Lee of Utah.
"For many reasons, we cannot support this bill and urge you to protect the American taxpayers by strongly opposing this bill."
The bill falls too far short of the House "Cut, Cap and Balance" act, which passed the House but was rejected by the Senate, and therefore falls short of conservative principles, the Senators argued. 
"There remains one way to raise the debt ceiling that can both solve our long term debt crisis and avert a short term down grade," the letter concludes -- passage of a bill that ties debt relief to a balanced budget amendment. "We urge you to hold the line for real reform, to vote no on the Debt Limit extension, and to urge House leaders to stand up for taxpayers and our economic future."

HEADLINE: Hispanic Congressman Is Arrested in Deportation Protest

BYLINE: JULIA PRESTON


HIGHLIGHT: Representative Luis V. Gutierrez, a Democrat from Illinois, said he decided to participate in the protest after President Obama rejected his proposals to suspend deportations of some college students and make it easier for illegal immigrants married to American citizens to remain in the United States.

 BODY:
Representative Luis V. Gutierrez, a Democrat from Illinois who has become a perennial thorn on immigration for President Obama, was arrested Tuesday afternoon along with about a dozen activists in a protest outside the White House.
The protesters were arrested peacefully after they sat down on the White House sidewalk, following a rally where demonstrators denounced the Obama administration for deporting more than one million immigrants in the last two years.
In a letter to Mr. Gutierrez on Monday, Mr. Obama rejected his proposal to suspend deportations of illegal immigrant college students with clean criminal records. Last week, Mr. Gutierrez and three other House Democrats had sent a letter to the president requesting the suspensions and also asking him to take executive measures to make it easier for illegal immigrants married to American citizens to remain in the United States.
Mr. Gutierrez said he decided to go ahead with the protest after receiving Mr. Obama's response. "It didn't disappoint me as much as I was saddened," Mr. Gutierrez said in an interview after he paid a $100 fine and was released by the police. He was arrested in May 2010 in a similar protest.
In his letter, Mr. Obama argued that immigration authorities had succeeded in increasing the numbers of convicted criminals among immigrants who are deported, while deporting fewer immigrants who lack legal status but have not been convicted of any crime. In 2010, Mr. Obama wrote, 51 percent of deportees were convicted criminals, while 49 percent had noncriminal violations. Two-thirds of the noncriminal deportees had either committed multiple violations of immigration law (which is generally a civil offense) or had been caught at the border soon after crossing illegally, Mr. Obama wrote.
On Monday, in a speech at a meeting of the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic civil rights organization, the president appealed to Hispanic leaders, including Mr. Gutierrez, to help him pass a broad overhaul of the immigration laws by focusing pressure on Republicans.
"I need you to keep building a movement for change outside of Washington, one that they can't stop," said Mr. Obama, referring to Republican lawmakers. While his reception at the Latino gathering was generally enthusiastic, when the president said he could not unilaterally cancel student deportations, groups of students stood up from the audience and chanted, "Yes you can!"
The partisan conflict over immigration policy was on full display on the Hill on Tuesday. At a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing convened by Senator Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat, top executives from Microsoft and Nasdaq OMX appealed for more flexible visas for immigrants with technology and science skills, warning that the United States is losing the global competition for talented entrepreneurs who can lift the economy.
But at a House Judiciary subcommittee hearing convened by Representative Lamar Smith, a Texas Republican, the president of an immigration agents' union, Chris Crane, delivered scathing criticism of the administration, saying officials are pandering to immigrant groups at the expense of public security. Mr. Crane, president of the union of employees of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said ICE agents broadly rejected recent measures by agency leaders to allow some immigrants to avoid deportation.
"Law enforcement and public safety are no longer a priority at ICE," Mr. Crane said. "Politics are the priority at ICE."

HEADLINE: Romney and Perry: Dual Front-Runners?

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: Some of the smart money is betting on Rick Perry in the Republican nominating fight, but polls still give the edge to Mitt Romney.

 BODY:
At the betting market Intrade, Texas Gov. Rick Perry has overtaken Mitt Romney and is now considered the most likely person to win the Republican presidential contest. Mr. Perry is given a 35 percent chance of claiming the nomination as compared to Mr. Romney at 29 percent; Michelle Bachmann is a distant third place and assigned a 9 percent chance of winning.
Are the bettors being sensible or getting ahead of themselves? Although this is all fun and games as compared to the debt ceiling debate, a quick overview of the state of play is in order.
An average of the seven most recent polls of Republican voters (the six contained in the Real Clear Politics average plus the Economist / YouGov poll) finds Mr. Romney with the lead, with an average of 22 percent of the vote. After that, there's essentially a four-way tie between Ms. Bachmann (13 percent), Sarah Palin (13 percent), Mr. Perry (12 percent) and Rudolph W. Giuliani (11 percent in the polls in which he is included). Herman Cain's momentum appears to have faded, while Newt Gingrich and Tim Pawlenty are now often polling in the low rather than the high single digits.
The results tighten up a bit, however, once we adjust for name recognition based on the latest Gallup numbers. (Dividing a candidate's polling average by his name recognition can somewhat improve the predictive power of early-stage polls.) In particular, Mr. Perry is recognized by only slightly more than half of Republican voters. Of those who recognize his name, 21 percent list him as their first choice, just slightly behind Mr. Romney at 25 percent.
Ms. Bachmann also moves up slightly by this metric -- but her name recognition has already grown to 78 percent, leaving her somewhat less upside than she once seemed to have.
A more important contingency for Ms. Bachmann is whether Sarah Palin runs. Four of the polls ran versions without either Ms. Palin or Mr. Giuliani, and in those surveys, Ms. Bachmann's support averaged 18 percent rather than 13 percent.
However, this version of the numbers helps Mr. Romney as well -- his support grows to 27 percent from 22 percent. Some of that is the runoff from moderate-leaning voters who might have preferred Mr. Giuliani, although Mr. Romney might also be picking up a few Sarah Palin supporters who haven't thought much about the field and are defaulting to the most recognizable names.
Mr. Perry, interestingly, is not helped in this case -- in fact, with Ms. Palin and Mr. Giulaini out of the race, his numbers decline a bit to 10 percent from 12 percent. The decline shouldn't be taken too literally and is likely a sample size fluke at least in part. But it hints that Ms. Palin's entry in the race would take more votes away from Ms. Bachmann than it would from Mr. Perry and could plausibly make his path easier despite the more crowded field.
Mr. Perry, however, has also yet to officially enter the race, and that's the reason why it may be at least a little premature to anoint him as the frontrunner.
It's not that Mr. Perry is literally likely to skip the presidential derby after making so much noise about it -- most reporting suggests that he'll officially become a candidate. But Mr. Perry will be getting off to something of a late start and will have to spend time fundraising or tweaking his campaign staff while Mr. Romney is in New Hampshire and Ms. Bachmann and Mr. Pawlenty are in Iowa. While not likely to be a fatal flaw, this could harm him in some intangible ways down the road.
More important is that Mr. Perry has yet to really endure the period of heightened scrutiny that almost all the other Republican faced when they announced their campaigns -- and with decidedly mixed results. Mr. Romney survived his roll-out relatively well, although he got poor marks from conservative commentators for his health care speech. At the other end of the spectrum are Newt Gingrich, who was all but dead on arrival, and Jon Huntsman, whose campaign is moribund.
Apart from the general vetting that will take place -- something that is relatively less likely to be a problem for Mr. Perry, the four-term governor of the nation's second-largest state -- there may be questions raised about his electability (is nominating a conservative Texas Republican the equivalent of a liberal Massachusetts Democrat?). Given his late start, comparisons may be made -- perhaps unfairly -- to Fred Thompson, whose 2008 campaign flailed.
And Mr. Perry will have to decide how to position himself between the establishment and the Tea Party. But that is a nice choice for a Republican candidate to have: Mr. Perry is probably the most capable of the candidates to maintain credibility with both groups. Given how conservative the Republican electorate has become, particularly in states like Iowa and South Carolina, Mr. Perry is probably closer than Mr. Romney to the median Republican primary voter.
So we have these two factors to weigh against one another: the fact that Mr. Romney's campaign is at a far more advanced stage against the fact that Mr. Perry's positioning is probably more in line with the mood of the G.O.P. electorate. You can make a credible case for either one; I tend to default toward Mr. Romney because he's still a little bit ahead in the polls.
If Mr. Perry's roll-out goes well, however, the Republican campaign could well develop into a heavyweight battle between the two rather than the Lord-of-the-Flies scenario that had seemed more likely before.
Ms. Bachmann or Mr. Pawlenty could also make themselves factors by winning Iowa, but they risk being relegated to the undercard if Mr. Perry gets off to a fast start. Look for them to throw a few banana peels his way to try to trip him up.

HEADLINE: An Inconvenient Precedent for the Debt Crisis

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Speaker John Boehner said the current debt crisis is without precedent. He's wrong on that point. 

 BODY:
Last night, President Obamaand the House speaker, John Boehner, gave dueling speeches on how to fix the deficit. One line from Mr. Boehner's speech confused me:Here's what we got for that spending binge: a massive health care bill that most Americans never asked for. A 'stimulus' bill that was more effective in producing material for late-night comedians than it was in producing jobs. And a national debt that has gotten so out of hand it has sparked a crisis without precedent in my lifetime or yours. 
The wording is a little ambiguous, but it appears that the "crisis without precedent in my lifetime or yours" refers to the current stalemate over the debt ceiling and the resulting threat of default.
With all due respect to Mr. Boehner, there is a precedent for this, and it was in his lifetime.
Mr. Boehner was born in 1949. In 1979 there was a showdown over raising the debt ceiling, and the country came within hours (not days) of defaulting on its obligations. In fact it actuallytemporarily default on some of its obligations, although that seems to have been because of technical difficulties because discussions ran so close to the wire.
Brady Dennis of The Washington Post wrotea nice summary of this event earlier this month:Congress had been playing a game of chicken with the debt limit, raising it to $830 billion - compared with today's $14.3 trillion - only after Treasury Secretary W. Michael Blumenthal warned that the country was hours away from the first default in its history. 
That last-minute approval, combined with a flood of investor demand for Treasury bills and a series of technical glitches in processing the backlog of paperwork, resulted in thousands of late payments to holders of Treasury bills that were maturing that April and May.
"You hear a lot of people say, 'The government never defaulted.' The truth is, yeah, they did. It might have been small, it might have been inadvertent, but it happened," said Terry Zivney, a finance professor at Ball State University who co-authored a paper on the episode titled "The Day the United States Defaulted on Treasury Bills."

HEADLINE: Storing Water For a Dry Day Leads to Suits

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

 BODY:
BAKERSFIELD, Calif. -- Peter Key knew something was strange when the water levels in his tropical fish tank began to go down last summer. Then the washing machine took 40 minutes to fill, and the toilets would not flush.
But even as Mr. Key and neighbors spent $14,000 to deepen their community well here, they had identified a likely culprit.
They blamed water banking, a system in which water-rights holders -- mostly in the rural West -- store water in underground reservoirs either for their own future use or for leasing to fast-growing urban areas.
So the neighbors' small local water utility has gone to state court to challenge the wealthy farming interests that dominate two of the country's largest water banks. 
Viewed as test cases for the size and scope of water-banking operations, the lawsuits claim that enormous withdrawals of water by the banks lowered the water table, causing geological damage, service disruptions and costly repairs.
Water managers and the farmers they serve have long been major political players here in Kern County, a center of conservative political power. But even inside these tight circles, there is increasing friction as governments, businesses -- especially agriculture -- and a population that has swelled by 26 percent in a decade all compete for water. Even a trendy fruit, the pomegranate, plays a role in these water wars.
A memorandum of understanding between the small local utility that brought the suit, Rosedale-Rio Bravo Water Storage District, which serves 20,000 customers, and the Kern County Water Agency, which operates one of the water banks, stipulated that any problems resulting from its bank would be the agency's responsibility.
But the agency said it was not to blame, and made no effort to cover costs.
''For two years, we asked them to do it and they didn't,'' said Eric Averett, general manager of the district.
Instead, the smaller districts and the City of Bakersfield had to pay to deepen wells. The two water-banking operations, one public and one quasi public, have denied responsibility.
Water remains a contentious subject. Everyone's complaining, said Mr. Key, a horse trainer, who had to borrow from his neighbor to water the horses he boards.
Water banking has been widely embraced as a tool for making water supplies reliable, sustainable and marketable. Groups traditionally at odds -- environmentalists seeking full rivers for fish and farmers tending pistachio or pomegranate trees -- agree that water banking is a useful strategy for managing a vital resource. A consulting group based in Idaho, WestWater Research, estimates there are up to 30 working water banks in the West.
As climate change produces earlier snowmelts, sending too much of the water into reservoirs in the spring and too little in summer, the need for storage grows.
''Water banking is a way of dealing with the volatility,'' said Bruce Aylward, an expert in water economics who founded Ecosystem Economics in Oregon.
The economic concept is simple. Farmers, through the water districts that they control, have acquired land entitling them to use water, or have contracted for water supplies flowing to their region. Municipal and industrial water users also have rights.
While some districts limit sales to distant urban areas, others allow them. One Kern County district, Berrenda Mesa, sold part of its state entitlement for a one-shot payment of $3,000 an acre-foot -- about 90 percent higher than its costs. The buyers were water districts supplying homes and golf courses in Palm Springs.
The value in banking lies in the certainty that water will be available when it is needed. In wet years, excess water recharges the depleted aquifer, a hedge against a prolonged drought.
The porous soil below the gravel and sand here, which are carried here from the Sierra Nevada by the Kern River, is ideal for the purpose. ''It's a huge bucket,'' said Florn Core, the former water resources manager for the City of Bakersfield, which is located in a natural desert where rainfall averages 5.7 inches annually.
Yet with its local supplies and water deliveries from the state and federal governments, Kern County is an agricultural paradise of carrots, citrus, pomegranates and pistachios.
Changes in the agricultural economy over the last 15 years, including the rising popularity of pomegranates and pistachios, prompted many farmers to switch to permanent crops, taking away the option of letting fields lie fallow in dry years. So water banking expanded.
Since 1978, when water banking started here, 5.7 million acre-feet -- about a third of the annual flow of the Colorado River -- has been stored in the two largest banks, said James M. Beck, the general manager of the Kern County Water Agency, which regulates local use. The two banks' combined storage capacity is about 2 million acre feet.
Pumping out huge amounts of stored water in dry years was thought to have little impact on the underground geology -- at least until Mr. Key's shower head sputtered. Now engineers believe it reversed the area's underground hydraulic gradient, turning a hill-shaped water table, accessible by shallow wells, into a valley. The trigger for the huge withdrawals was a drought that began in 2007. Kern County's allocation of water from Northern California was cut. Then, in the 40 months beginning in March 2007, roughly half the banks' capacity was pumped out to keep fruit and nut trees alive.
''I don't think anyone fully appreciated the magnitude of the impact they would have,'' said Mr. Averett of the Rosedale-Rio Bravo Water Storage District.
POM Wonderful, part of the fruit-drink empire owned by Stewart and Lynda Resnick, makes its profits from pomegranate trees kept green by the Kern Water Bank Authority. The authority, technically a public agency, is controlled by the Paramount Farming Company, which like POM, is a subsidiary of Roll Global, a company owned by the billionaire Resnicks.
Ernest Conant, a lawyer for the Kern Water Bank, disagrees with the lawsuit's main contentions -- that the rapid pumping caused the well problems in west Bakersfield and that environmental reviews, in failing to anticipate the problem, were inadequate.
''You have the right to bank water and take it out, but you have to do it in a manner that does not cause significant harm to others,'' Mr. Conant said. ''We think our program accomplishes that.''
Mr. Beck, whose agency manages the Pioneer Water Bank and who is the defendant in the other suit, said, ''We haven't seen enough data to indicate that our operations are the cause of the decline.''
Because so much is at stake, many people expect a settlement before a judge can decide the issues. The water problems have eased, and some contend the aquifer healed itself -- although Mr. Averett said the water tables were still lower than before. A separate suit filed by environmentalists a year ago challenges the 1990s deal that transferred the Kern Water Bank from the state to a group of water suppliers controlled by the Resnicks.
All three lawsuits could have broad consequences.
''Everybody wants to bank and sell. Everybody,'' Mr. Core said. ''If a lawsuit like Rosedale-Rio Bravo's is successful, someone may be working on a banking project and it could come to a screeching halt -- after they've started counting the money.''

HEADLINE: Lessons From The Malaise

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com; twitter.com/DLeonhardt

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
When I began covering the American economy 11 years ago, it was the envy of the world.
The last 11 years have not been kind to it. First came the dot-com bust. Then there was the weakest economic expansion in decades, followed by the worst financial crisis and deepest recession in decades. Now we're suffering through a painfully slow recovery, which Washington may soon make worse.
The malaise obviously has several causes, some of which are beyond our control. One major cause, however, is entirely our doing. We do not spend enough time focusing on our actual economic problems.
We are too often occupied with distractions, rather than trying to answer a simple question: What works? What economic policies have succeeded before and are most likely to lead to the best life for the largest number of people? Instead, we've effectively decided that because the United States is the richest, most successful country in the world, it is guaranteed to remain so. 
Today's column is my last in this space. I will continue to write in my next job, as Washington bureau chief, but not every week and not this column. So I want to take a step back today and look at what we know about the American economy and, almost as important, what we do not.
One of the tricky things about the subject is that almost nothing is certain in the way that, say, two plus two equals four. Economics -- which is at root a study of human behavior -- tends to be messier. Because it's messier, it can be tempting to think that all uncertainty is equal and that we don't really know anything.
But we do. It's just that the knowledge tends to come with caveats and nuances. Economic truths may not rise to the level of two plus two equals four, but they are not so different from the knowledge that the earth is round or that smoking causes cancer.
The earth is not perfectly round, of course. Some smokers will never get cancer, while most cancer is not caused by smoking. Yet in the ways that matter most, the earth is still round, and smoking does cause cancer. Both of these facts are illustrative in another way, too: seemingly smart people spent decades denying them.
When it comes to economics, we know that a market economy with a significant government role is the only proven model of success. The United States has outgrown Europe partly because of our greater comfort with market forces. China and India boomed after allowing more of a market economy. On the other hand, unencumbered market forces often lead to disaster, as 1929 and 2008 made clear.
We also know that ever-rising levels of education are crucial to a country's success. Not only is the evidence all around us -- the college wage premium has been higher than ever lately -- but careful studies have found that, on the margin, education itself tends to make people wealthier, healthier and happier. The next time you hear naysayers poormouth college, ask them if they plan to send their own children.
We know that the federal government has promised more benefits than it can currently afford. The only way out of this problem involves some combination of tax increases and cuts to Medicare, Social Security and the military. Anyone who won't get specific about which ones they favor is not a fiscal conservative.
We know this country spends vastly more on health care than any other country -- about 75 percent more per person than other rich countries -- without getting vastly better results. The waste in our medical system offers the best chance to reduce the deficit without harming our living standards.
We know the planet is getting hotter. Last year tied for the warmest on record, and the 10 hottest have all occurred since 1998. The resulting risks, economic and otherwise, may be even more serious than the risks from the deficit, but receive far less attention in Washington. (And climate worriers do not need to be so skittish about making the connection between heat waves and the larger trend. The thing about global warming is that it warms the globe.)
We know that Wall Street, having bounced back from the crisis, remains a historically large part of the economy. Not coincidentally, we know that income inequality remains sharply higher than it used to be.
The most common income statistics can exaggerate the stagnation of middle-class pay, partly because they exclude health benefits. The American middle class is not disappearing. But it's not doing well, and has not been for some time.
The bottom 50 percent of households, based on pretax income, make less combined than the top 1 percent. Only three decades ago, the bottom half made more than twice as much. The middle class has also received a much smaller tax cut in recent decades than the affluent.
This list is obviously a partial one. You could add the fact that the United States has benefited enormously from immigration, especially high-skill immigration, or the fact that discrimination, while hardly vanquished, is greatly reduced. But I think the issues here cover most of the high points.
The place where economic knowledge gets murkier is how to best deal with many of our biggest problems.
We cannot know, for example, what would happen if the government raised taxes to cut the deficit. A moderate increase seems unlikely to do much damage to economic growth, given that the increases by George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton did not prevent the 1990s boom -- and that George W. Bush's tax cuts were followed by mediocre growth. All things equal, though, tax increases do not lift growth.
Likewise, we do not know precisely how to regulate Wall Street so that it will remain the global financial capital without also being a drain on our national resources. We do not know whether the most promising attack on climate change involves a carbon tax or more money for clean energy research. We don't know how much medical costs would fall if people had to pay more out of pocket, as conservatives advocate, or how much costs would fall if Medicare tried to crack down on dubious care, as the Obama administration prefers.
The real problem with so many of these issues is that the political system is not even trying to find solutions.
Instead of a spirited, even partisan, debate over how health reform could be do a better job of controlling costs, lawyers are skirmishing over whether all Americans should have health insurance. Some of the world's most talented people -- students and would-be entrepreneurs who would like nothing more than to remain in this country -- are told they are not welcome. Amazingly, Congress may be about to create a whole new economic problem by voluntarily defaulting on the national debt.
Democracy, not unlike economics, is often messy. And there are certainly some reasons for optimism, whether it's the bipartisan push to improve schools or the simple fact that American society in 2011 is quite different from what many people could have imagined only a few decades ago. Much of that change has been for the good.
Perhaps the last refuge for optimists is Churchill's reputed line: ''In the long run, Americans will always do the right thing -- after exploring all other alternatives.'' The sentiment is nice. It would be comforting to have a little more reason to believe that history was going to repeat itself.

HEADLINE: On All Levels of the Economy, Concern About the Impasse: For Consumers, Volatility And Then Market Corrections

BYLINE: By TARA SIEGEL BERNARD

 BODY:
This is not yet one of those stuff-your-money-in-a-mattress moments.
Still, the talk in Washington of a federal budget crisis and possible default has given rise to all sorts of consumer fears of doomsday scenarios. Missed Social Security payments. Spikes in interest rates. Draconian cuts in government services.
But the most likely outcome, experts said in interviews this week, is that the nation's credit rating will be downgraded a notch. And if that turns out to be the case, investors and borrowers should be able to ride out any volatility.
Over the last few days, financial advisers have tried to allay investor fears by sending notes to clients with the same message they have delivered in past periods of market uncertainty: As long as you're diversified across different investments, the best action, in this case, is inaction. 
The financial markets may become more volatile in the near-term, they say. And interest rates on several types of consumer loans can be expected to tick modestly higher because the rates track government-issued debt. But a credit downgrade is unlikely to cause a major shock to the system.
That said, the only investment that did not plunge in the 2008 market crisis was Treasuries, and they could conceivably lose some of their luster. ''Sometimes I worry that a U.S. debt downgrade could have long-term negative psychological consequences as Americans realize the greatest power on earth is, alas, a mere mortal too,'' said Milo Benningfield, a certified financial planner in San Francisco. But ''we're still looking pretty good relative to most everyone else in the world.''
That does not mean there will not be a wide ripple effect, at least in the short term. The magnitude of the deficit reductions and their effect on the broader economy are another wild card. But in the near term, here's what investors and consumers can expect, and some advice from experts.
STOCKS AND BOND INVESTMENTS Both the stock and bond markets are expected to endure a period of volatility if the nation's debt drops a notch from its AAA perch. ''Once a plan is in place, we would expect the markets to return to normal, and for investors to focus on more fundamental issues like long-term earnings growth and the economic health of countries around the globe,'' said Gus Sauter, chief investment officer at Vanguard.
''That said, it's simply not possible to gauge precisely how the equity and fixed income markets would react and for how long, so the best course of action is to ignore the headlines and maintain a long-term approach.''
That sort of advice might come as cold comfort to people on the cusp of retirement, and for whom the memories of the recent downturn are fresh. That is why many advisers suggest that people who are living off their investments set aside enough cash so that they are not forced to sell investments during a rough patch.
''This is certainly creating a lot of concern, and the games being played in Washington by Congress are increasing the stress,'' said Diahann Lassus, a financial planner in New Providence, N.J. ''Cash reserves are very important for both retirees and pre-retirees.'' She suggests six months to two years in cash, depending on the investor's age and specific situation.
A downgrade may cause Treasury yields to move modestly higher, which, in turn, may cause corporate, municipal and other bond issues to follow suit. Budget cuts, though, may have a more serious effect, depending on their severity. ''If they really make some severe cuts, that is deleterious to the municipal bond space,'' said Marilyn Cohen, chief executive of Envision Capital Management, which manages bond portfolios. ''That means less trickle-down to the states, cities and counties.''
But if there are not enough cuts, she said, that could also cause the broader bond market to swoon.
MONEY MARKET FUNDS These funds hold 40 to 45 percent of the shorter-term Treasury debt outstanding, according to Deborah A. Cunningham, chief investment officer for money markets at Federated Investors. But if the nation's debt rating were downgraded, these funds would not be required to sell the Treasuries they hold. In fact, a fund would not be required to sell in the event of a default, either, as long as the fund deems the securities to be safe and able to make their interest payments.
''The money market world asset flow, what comes in and goes out, has been pretty benign,'' Ms. Cunningham said.
And she said she would not expect a downgrade to change those flows in any significant way. ''The debt that is held in money market funds is so short in maturity that a downgrade will just not be an event that causes any kind of pricing concerns. As such, there shouldn't be issues for investors.''
HOME LOANS AND CREDIT CARDS Fixed-rate mortgages generally track the 10-year Treasury note, whose interest rates would rise in the event of a downgrade. ''The concern behind rates rising comes from the risk that investors -- foreign and domestic -- would rush to sell U.S. debt,'' said Cameron Findlay, chief economist at LendingTree.com, noting that a sell-off would push the price of the debt lower, while causing its yield to rise. ''So the question then is by what magnitude, and that remains the unanswered element everyone is struggling with.''
Shortly after a downgrade, he said, he would expect interest rates to spike a bit, though he said he did not expect rates on fixed-rate mortgages to rise more than half a percentage point to a full percentage point, at most. Nor did he expect a rise in rates to affect the pace of lending. After all, stricter credit standards are making lending difficult.
But once the federal debt issue is resolved, he said he expected mortgage rates to fall back to the range they are in now. Rates on a 30-year fixed mortgage averaged 4.52 percent for the week ending July 21, according to Freddie Mac. Though adjustable-rate mortgages typically do not track the 10-year Treasury note, experts said those rates could still move modestly higher.
Home equity lines of credit, meanwhile, track the prime rate, which is generally pegged to the federal funds rate. ''Do we expect that to increase any time soon?'' he asked. ''We don't. But if the risk of inflation increases, then, of course, the risk is that you will see that index start to increase.''
Credit cards are also pegged to the prime rate, so any increase in interest rates is more likely to be a result of broader economic factors or a decision by lenders to increase their profit margins. But as Greg McBride, a senior financial analyst at Bankrate.com, said, lenders must give borrowers at least 45 days' notice before raising their interest rate, and that can be applied only to new balances.
STUDENT LOANSThe interest rates on most private student loans are pegged to the London Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor, which is influenced by Treasury yields. So if the yields on government securities rise, student loan rates could rise as well, said Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of the FinAid and Fastweb Web sites. Borrowers taking out new loans, however, might see a greater increase in costs because of activity in the securities market backed by student loans.
Federal student loans are made by the government, which sells Treasuries to raise money to finance them. The government profits on the interest from the loans. If the government's cost of borrowing rose, the government's profit would decrease. But for now, since the interest rates are fixed, students would not necessarily see their costs rise unless Congress passed legislation to raise rates, he said. And then, the higher rates could apply only to new loans, he added.
The deficit reduction plan, which is likely to cut education spending, could have a broader effect on student lending. Some proposals, for instance, would cut subsidized interest on loans to graduate and professional students.
Experts also recommended contacting local representatives in Congress. ''Let your Congressional leaders know you are paying attention by writing, e-mailing or calling them,'' Ms. Lassus, the financial planner, said.

HEADLINE: Local Food Has Been No Easy Sell in Appalachia

BYLINE: By JANE BLACK

 BODY:
Meadowview, Va.
WHEN Steven Hopp envisioned his restaurant, the Harvest Table, he drew up a list of strict rules. Local farmers would provide the produce, meats and cheeses. Lemons would be banned: after all, why ship something that is mostly water when homegrown lemon thyme might suffice? Coffee and tea would be allowed because they are dried, but they should be organic, fair trade or both.
That philosophy grew out of his own experience. From 2005 to 2006, Mr. Hopp and his wife, the author Barbara Kingsolver, decided to see if their family could rely on the food they grew here in the hills of southwest Virginia. Their 2007 best seller, ''Animal, Vegetable, Miracle: A Year of Food Life,'' a memoir about their experiment, helped introduce Americans to the locavore creed.
With the Harvest Table, Mr. Hopp is trying to determine whether those same principles can sustain a business beyond the big city. 
''My motive is not that I love the restaurant business or that I want to create a fine-dining restaurant with local ingredients,'' he said. ''We want to design a business that maximizes the benefit to the most local people that it possibly can.''
Mr. Hopp's goal was to create an egalitarian restaurant, one that is built by and caters to the community. Four years later, his dream is still a work in progress. The restaurant has breathed some life into the central square of this deflated old railroad town in dire need of economic development. It employs 18 people, significant in a community with a population of about 2,200. Its chefs buy from dozens of local farms, pay foragers for ramps and morels that proliferate in the Appalachian woods, and get all the wine from Virginia.
But in the heart of Appalachia, where there isn't a critical mass of suppliers or customers for whom the term ''locavore'' rolls naturally off the tongue, the restaurant remains something of a curiosity. Mr. Hopp is, once again, a pioneer. The 50-seat Harvest Table has not yet turned a profit. Over the past several years, it has struggled to build a fan base among the area's predominantly blue-collar residents for whom the average annual income is $15,750, and many of whom view local and organic food as out of reach.
''I've heard it's expensive, so I've never been in,'' said Bobbie Cornett, the site manager at the town medical clinic next door. ''Well, that's not true, I got a can of pop there once.''
Initially, Mr. Hopp, who teaches environmental studies at the nearby Emory & Henry College, wanted to build a year-round farmers' market. But he soon decided that a restaurant was more viable.
He renovated two century-old buildings, using salvaged wood and old bricks, then painted them pastel blue and rose with neat, white trim. The Harvest Table and the Meadowview Farmers' Guild, the general store next door that sells local grits, microbrews and a collection of Ms. Kingsolver's books, opened in October 2007.
The warm, friendly restaurant has a low-key vibe that would help make it an instant hit in a progressive, urban enclave like Brooklyn or Berkeley, Calif. There is an open kitchen, and colorful paintings of barns adorn the walls.
On one visit, the special was ''salad pizza,'' a white pie with a spicy mix of local greens, dressed with red wine vinaigrette. A middle-aged couple greeted Philip Newton, one of the restaurant's chefs, with a handshake, then sat down to lamb sausage burritos. One enthusiastic server wielding a charming drawl successfully sold nearly every table on desserts like warm berry cobbler.
When summer is over, chefs will face up to the short Appalachian growing season by relying on house-canned, frozen or dried ingredients. (Among the benefits of being outside a metropolitan area are cheap rents and ample storage space.)
While the chefs have worked hard to woo local farmers, finding the ingredients they need remains a challenge. For at least a century, tobacco was the area's main crop. When federal subsidies for that crop ended in 2005, many older farmers put away their ploughs. Those who have switched to produce have often been happier to sell a single crop to one big buyer than to grow the small quantities of a variety of fruits and vegetables that a small restaurant needs.
''There aren't a lot of farmers keyed into growing vegetables, which, actually, works to our advantage,'' said Mark Scott, an owner of Eden Farms, which sells heirloom vegetables, including tomatoes, to the restaurant. ''A lot of old-time farmers still do a few acres of the basics: tobacco, hay and corn.''
Mr. Newton, the chef, said things were getting better. ''After four years, the farmers are more willing to take a chance and grow a few things,'' he said. ''We are showing them that we are not going away.''
Despite some progress, Mr. Hopp decided last fall to begin growing his own produce. He hired a farm manager who helped him carve terraces on a steeply sloped four-acre plot adjacent to his home and build hoop houses to extend the season. They planted beets, cauliflower, broccoli and a small orchard of cherries, plums, Asian pears and persimmons. They even made an investment in the future by planting asparagus, which won't produce a significant crop for several years. Mostly, though, the farm is meant to provide the basics like greens, onions and carrots that a restaurant needs in large volumes. The goal is not to stop paying farmers, Mr. Hopp said, but to fill in the gaps until suppliers can meet demand.
The biggest challenge has been winning over townspeople. It's not hard to find residents who say that a meal at the Harvest Table is more than they can afford, though none who said so in interviews had actually eaten there.
For many here, ''farm fresh'' food is not necessarily more appealing than the chain restaurants that are anathema to Mr. Hopp. ''If you go over there and eat, you have to pay $20,'' said Kay Thomas, 69, who has been farming in Meadowview with her husband for a half-century. ''You can go to Pizza Hut and eat for $6. With the economy the way it is, you have to watch what you do.''
It was no wonder that some residents were furious when in 2009, the County Board of Supervisors rejected a plan for a truck stop with a McDonald's for Meadowview. Supporters of the proposal said it would have lured customers for local businesses off the highway, created jobs and provided a more affordable dining option than the Harvest Table.
''Anything you can get into a little town like this is good,'' Terry Hagy, who owns Hagy's Garage and Wrecker Service in Meadowview, said of Mr. Hopp's venture. ''But we've got farmers and working people here. They don't have time to sit and order a meal. They run in and grab a burger.''
Mr. Hopp said he does not want to feed only ''people who have the money to make it work financially.''
To compete, he keeps prices reasonably low. Lunch entrees cost no more than $10, and most dinner options hover around $15. (Prices are comparable to those at, say, Applebee's, though portions at the chain are bigger.)
The dishes are sophisticated comfort food, and the chefs are careful about how they describe them. What might be called ''fennel pasta with pecans'' in Brooklyn and served with a detailed description of the vegetable provenance, is ''pasta primavera'' here. A plate of Padron peppers was called ''pepper roulette,'' Mr. Hopp said, because there is always one that is mind-blowingly spicy.
''When people who are interested in food ask me questions, I tell them: 'I can give you the nauseatingly long version or a short one,' '' Mr. Hopp said. ''We are always trying to figure out how to educate people more, but with the recognition that most people don't want a lecture.''
Finding that balance between an agent of cultural change and friendly neighborhood hangout won't be easy. ''If this was a really successful model, there would be one between every 7-Eleven in the country,'' he said. ''This provides a model for people to think about.''

HEADLINE: Billionaires' Ascent Helps India, and Vice Versa

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY and VIKAS BAJAJ; Hari Kumar contributed reporting from Mundra, and Nikhila Gill from New Delhi.

 BODY:
MUNDRA, India -- On a recent wind-whipped morning, a steel-hulled behemoth arrived at a desolate stretch of India's western coast groaning with enough coal to power a city of one million people for more than two weeks.
The ship, the Vanshi, was carrying coal from Indonesia, a two-week trip across the Indian Ocean. India has its own abundant reserves of coal, which raises a question: Why did India need to go so far to get something it already had?
For Gautam Adani, the power mogul, the answer was simple: the easiest and most profitable way to meet India's rising demand for electricity is to avoid the obstacles, divisive political confrontations and practical inefficiencies of India. In the spirit of the workaround ethos typical of India's private sector, Mr. Adani is working around the subcontinent itself.
He owns the Indonesian coal mine, the Korean-made cargo ship (named for his niece Vanshi), the Indian power plant and, most important, the private Mundra port. He owns coal mines and a major port in Australia, and has built his own private railroad spur in India. His business plan is to do as much as possible without relying on the creaky infrastructure of the Indian state. 
''He is able to do so well partly because he is very entrepreneurial and has found the right opportunity,'' said Eswar Prasad, an economic adviser to India's finance minister. ''But it's a symptom of a dysfunctional state. He is able to deliver something more effectively than the state.''
Today, India is increasingly turning to the private sector to deliver the electricity needed to maintain rapid economic growth into the future. India's economy is growing at more than 8 percent annually, but is badly constrained by an inadequate power supply after years in which the government dominated the power sector and failed to keep up with growing demand.
The rise of Mr. Adani attests to a broader shift, as the private sector is playing a greater role in areas once controlled by the state like telecommunications, ports, airports, banks and infrastructure. At a global level, this contrasts sharply with China, where huge state-owned enterprises dominate strategic industries and lead the country's global expansion. Mr. Adani recently had to outbid the Chinese for his Australian port.
Within India, though, the success of private tycoons has created a paradox: India's moguls are essential to the country's success and admired for their ability to get results. Yet their staggering wealth is made possible in part by their coziness with powerful politicians who help arrange environmental clearances, land use rights and other thorny issues. That raises accusations of crony capitalism.
India in the 21st century is now often compared to the United States during the Gilded Age of the late 19th century, when robber barons dominated the American economy. The country has 55 billionaires whose aggregate wealth of $250 billion is equivalent to almost a sixth of the nation's annual economic output.
''No question, there is an oligarchy developing that has an enormous amount of influence,'' said Arvind Subramanian, an economic adviser to the Indian government. ''That is a matter of great concern. But in India, these are also the guys who are performing. In some cases, they may be gaming the system, but they are also performing despite how bad the system is.''
Mr. Adani is now India's sixth-richest person, with a fortune valued at $10 billion. He was an import-export trader during the 1980s when the Indian government tightly controlled trade and industry through high tariffs and an abstruse licensing regime. During the 1990s, after India embarked on economic reforms, Mr. Adani expanded his trading business and befriended influential politicians, including the powerful and controversial chief minister of his home state, Gujarat.
Mr. Adani entered the power business partly because of criticism that traders were just ''intermediaries'' who did not own anything or contribute to society. He decided to start acquiring things, only to find that India's new business climate would mean shopping around the world.
Going Vertical
It was a singularly Indian dilemma: tigers versus electricity.
In 2009, India's power and coal ministries granted Mr. Adani initial approval to build a power plant in Maharashtra state, a deal that included the right to develop a coal mine. But the coal concession was in a forest near a wildlife reserve for endangered tigers. Protests mounted until India's Ministry of Environment and Forests blocked the mine project.
The dispute underscored how often important national priorities -- environmentalism versus expanding electricity -- collide. India has the fifth-largest coal reserves in the world and depends on coal-fired power stations for electricity, yet much of India's coal lies beneath forests in areas populated by tribal groups. Rare is the project without protests, controversy or violence.
Mr. Adani's canceled mining lease was only part of his problem. He had plans to become India's biggest private power company by 2020, yet he could not get domestic coal. Two other applications for domestic mining rights were snagged in red tape after India's environment minister declared broad areas of the country to be ''no-go'' regions for mining.
His advantage was Mundra. He had spent a decade assembling tracts of land into a special economic zone and had transformed Mundra into India's biggest private port. Now the port would become his Indian gateway for a global expansion.
He acquired mining rights in Indonesia. He bought two cargo ships (with two more on order) and began prospecting in Australia, where he bought a mine and, this year, the Abbot Point port. In short order, he became an overseas coal baron even as his Indian mining applications remained tangled in a ministerial turf war.
''He learned that it is difficult to get such clearances,'' said Devendra Amin, a spokesman for the Adani Group. ''The challenges are political, as well as logistical.''
Indeed, the logistics of transporting coal in India were another problem.
Indian Railways is a huge government bureaucracy with some of the world's highest freight charges, even though Indian freight trains travel slowly and carry small loads. Mr. Adani found it cheaper, more efficient and sometimes faster to ship coal 4,000 miles by sea than 1,000 miles by train. (Indonesian coal is also of a higher quality than Indian coal.)
In the space of a few years, Mr. Adani had created a vertically integrated global supply chain reminiscent of when Henry Ford once owned Brazilian rubber plantations to supply his car factories in the United States. Outside of India, this model is seldom seen these days, as big companies often specialize in areas where they have expertise and outsource other activities.
''It's quite atypical in the global context,'' said Rajiv Lall, chief executive of the Infrastructure Development and Finance Corporation, based in Mumbai. But in India, he said, ''it's probably the fastest, most likely to succeed approach in the current environment.''
In the past two years, India has become Indonesia's largest customer for coal, as other Indian corporations have also bought mining rights to ensure a reliable supply for their private power projects. The Adani Group is currently constructing or planning seven power stations, with the largest at Mundra. When the port needed a 40-mile rail connection to the Indian Railways network, Mr. Adani decided that the fastest solution was simply to build his own line. It is the first such private rail spur in India.
''They took all the risk,'' said P. N. Shukla, a former senior official at Indian Railways. ''Now, the traffic is so high that they are building a second line.''
Analysts credit Mr. Adani with a bold vision and a world-class ability to execute projects. But he has also demonstrated talents in another realm: Few Indian billionaires get rich without playing politics, too.
The Billionaires' Club
This year, Narendra Modi invited India's most powerful tycoons to the Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit. The glittering lineup of tycoons was, in essence, a homage to Mr. Modi, the state's chief minister and highest-ranking official.
Mr. Modi is one of India's most polarizing politicians, deplored by critics as a Hindu right-wing extremist and blamed for his role in the bloody 2002 anti-Muslim riots in Gujarat. Yet within corporate India, he is a hero known for business-friendly policies that for much of the past decade have helped make Gujarat the country's hottest state-level economy, with sizzling growth that has averaged 11.2 percent a year.
At the summit meeting, held in a sparkling new convention center, Mukesh and Anil Ambani, the feuding billionaire brothers who dominate several Indian industries, were both in the audience. Ratan Tata, chairman of the sprawling Tata Group, was on hand.
But the seat beside Mr. Modi during the inaugural ceremony was reserved for Mr. Adani, who used the occasion to announce an investment of an additional $17.8 billion in Gujarat. He also heaped praise on Mr. Modi as a brother and ''an architect'' responsible for building a grander state.
This nexus between tycoons and powerful politicians courses through the public-private relationship in India and forms the crux of a continuing debate on whether the rise of India's billionaires is a sign of dynamism or cronyism.
India's billionaires control a considerably larger share of the national wealth than do the superrich in bigger economies like those of Germany, Britain and Japan. Among the Indian billionaires included on the most recent Forbes rich list, a majority have derived their wealth from land, natural resources or government contracts and licenses, all areas that require support from politicians.
''Both in its rot and heady dynamism, India is beginning to resemble America's Gilded Age,'' Jayant Sinha, the head of an investment and philanthropic organization, and Ashutosh Varshney, a political science professor at Brown University, argued in a column in The Financial Times.
Others are more sanguine. Swaminathan Aiyar of the Cato Institute considers the Indian economy far more open and competitive today, noting that of the 30 largest companies on India's stock exchange in 1991, at the beginning of India's market-oriented reform period, only 9 are still on that list today. He argues this turnover suggests fierce competition rather than a hardening oligarchy.
''Crony capitalism hogs the headlines,'' he wrote in a recent column. ''Yet industrial and financial deregulation since 1991 means that political discretion affects only part of the economy.''
Mr. Adani, 49, represents the new guard among India's billionaires. A stocky man with a no-nonsense demeanor, he dropped out of college to enter the Mumbai diamond trade but returned home to do business in Gujarat, where he first ran a plastics factory before becoming a trader and industrialist. His career has not lacked drama: he was kidnapped and held for ransom in 1997 and was inside the Taj Mahal Palace & Tower Hotel when it was attacked during the November 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai.
In an interview at his corporate headquarters in Ahmedabad, Mr. Adani defended India's style of capitalism, noting that the economy has grown far faster in the past decade than in the previous five decades. He described his career as propelled by circumstances: his trading in the 1980s led to his interest in the Mundra port, while having a port and a special economic zone led him into power generation. India's coal predicament and poor domestic transport infrastructure led him overseas.
Throughout the years, Mr. Adani has benefited from various governmental approvals and also bought coastal land from the Gujarat government at very low prices -- in one instance paying as little as $540 an acre. Once he completed infrastructure, Mr. Adani sold land at a handsome profit to corporations locating inside the economic zone, including one parcel to Indian Oil Corporation, a state-owned firm, for $54,000 an acre.
''Who made him so rich?'' asked Babu Meghji Shah, an opposition state legislator and a vocal critic of Mr. Adani's. ''The Gujarat government had made him rich.''
Mr. Adani dismissed any suggestion of wrongdoing but said that no business leader could afford to alienate a chief minister. ''You cannot put up infrastructure or a larger project without the blessing and active support of the state government,'' he said. ''You have to work along with the government, whoever the chief minister is, from whichever party he is.''
Winners and Losers
For generations, the barren, low-lying coastline near Mundra has provided a livelihood for 10,000 people who depend on the sea. Fishermen live at the water's edge in shanties framed with driftwood. Not far away, the port is fast becoming an economic powerhouse, employing several thousand people.
The fishermen blame the Mundra development for dwindling populations of shrimp and plankton and the disappearance of huge areas of mangroves, a threat to the estuary that has drawn scrutiny from national environmental officials. Fishermen are fighting in court but say they cannot match Mr. Adani's political clout. They say Adani officials have offered jobs to some people, though only menial work paying $2 per day.
''We don't trust them,'' said Hashim Haji, 55, an uneducated fisherman who supports a family of 18. ''They just talk. They promised us schools, hospitals, job training. But they have not done anything.''
The anger of the fishermen could be said to represent the collateral damage caused by India's work-around private economy in which the state often takes a back seat and does not do enough to bring along people displaced by development. This summer, India's Parliament is expected to consider a national law establishing clear guidelines for development projects when land is acquired or residents are displaced. Yet legislative action is hardly certain: the land bill has already been under discussion for several years.
Mr. Adani acknowledged the fishermen's concerns and said his company was working to address them, but he insisted that Mundra's expansion would continue. ''We are working together with the community in such a manner that their livelihoods should not be disturbed,'' he said, but added, ''At the same time, development also should not be stopped.''
In fact, Mr. Adani is trying to replicate the Mundra model as he pursues other Indian ports as hubs for importing coal and building new power stations. Inside Mundra, he is building his own world: There are housing developments for employees, including a gated community of gardens and modernist bungalows for top executives. Private schools serve the children, while a private health chain has opened a hospital. There is a private airstrip for jets.
And even though Mundra is a remote place, far from any major city, thousands of employees are willing to move here because they believe working for a company like the Adani Group represents the future.
''Everything was done by us,'' said Javed Sindhi, a public relations manager for the company in Mundra. ''That was the achievement. If you do it the government way, it would take years.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Housing Prices Rise Slightly, but Remain Weak

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
Home prices in the United States rose slightly for the second consecutive month in May, but the real estate market still has a long way to go before a recovery, analysts said on Tuesday.
The private Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller index, a closely watched measure of home prices, was up 1 percent compared with April, according to the broadest measure of data tracking 20 cities. Prices rose in 16 of the cities; they fell in Detroit, Las Vegas and Tampa, Fla., and were unchanged in Phoenix.
Separately, in Census Bureau data from the Commerce Department for June, the median sales price for a new home increased 5.8 percent in June to $235,200. Prices rose 7.2 percent year over year, the agency said. Sales of new single-family houses in June were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 312,000, according to estimates, a rise of 1.6 percent from June 2010. 
The rise in May for Case-Shiller came after the index edged up a fractional 0.6 percent in April, which was the first time prices were higher in eight months.
But the trend in the 20-city composite index, while positive, was attributed to seasonal factors, and analysts were hesitant to read too much into one or two months of data. Demand is typically stronger in the spring, and continued weakness was evident in other barometers of housing health, such as contract cancellations, tightened lending standards and sales of new homes in June.
''We have now seen two consecutive months of generally improving prices; however, we might have a long way to go before we see a real recovery,'' said David M. Blitzer, the chairman of the index committee at S.& P. home price indexes. ''Sustained increases in home prices over several months and better annual results need to be seen before we can confirm real estate market recovery,'' he said in a statement released with the survey.
The data showed that prices in Detroit, Las Vegas and Tampa reached new lows, down nearly 50 percent or more since the peaks of 2005-6, the survey shows.
The overall index in May was down compared with May 2010, by 4.5 percent. That reflected a decline in prices in 19 of the 20 metropolitan areas when compared with the previous year.
The District of Columbia was the area with the only annual price increase, while Minneapolis, where home prices were up 2.6 percent in May and 0.1 percent in April, had the biggest fall in prices from May last year, with an 11.7 percent drop.
Barbara T. Jandric, the president of Edina Realty in Minneapolis, said that the drop from last year reflected prices of many foreclosed homes. But in recent months the profile of houses being sold was starting to grow sounder, with fewer foreclosure sales as a percentage of the whole.
''We still have quite a few of those sales in our market, but we see that we maybe hit our peak,'' she said.
In addition, the firm has noticed more buyers on the higher end of the market, she said.
''So for the first time in many, many years, in that segment of the market we are seeing shortages of listings,'' she said. ''For us, it is another glimmer of hope that the market is really slowly, slowly trying to come back.''
Analysts said that the spring uptick started in April and was likely to dwindle by October, when weak demand typically drags down home prices.
In addition, other variables in the economy are deflating hopes for a housing rebound, including a struggling jobs market in which the unemployment rate is at 9.2 percent and consumer confidence is at depressed levels, said Chris G. Christopher Jr., senior principal economist for IHS Global Insight.
''Things do not look very favorable on the housing front since the employment situation has taken a turn for the worse in May and June,'' he said in a research note. ''Going forward, the Case-Shiller indexes are likely to post increases during the home-buying season, and then turn down again.''

HEADLINE: Colleges Join Plan for Faster Computer Networks

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
A coalition of 29 American universities is throwing its weight behind a plan to build ultra-high-speed computer networks -- with Internet service several hundred times faster than what is now commercially available -- in the communities surrounding the participating colleges.
The project, which is named Gig.U and will be announced on Wednesday, is meant to draw high-tech startups in fields like health care, energy and telecommunications to the areas near the universities, many of which are in the Midwest or outside of major cities. These zones would ideally function as hubs for building a new generation of faster computer networks, which could make the United States more competitive internationally. 
For now the plan is a work in progress, with the universities reaching out to telecommunications companies for suggestions and to corporations and nonprofits for business ideas. The institutions involved include Arizona State University, Case Western Reserve University, Howard University, Duke University, the University of Michigan, the University of Washington, the University of Chicago and George Mason University.
''We're not asking for government money,'' said Blair Levin, a fellow at the Aspen Institute who is heading the project. ''We believe the right approach is to have the private sector fund the networks.''
By offering one-gigabit network connections -- fast enough to download high-definition movies in less than a minute -- not just to scientific researchers and engineers but to the homes and businesses that surround universities, the group aims to create a digital ecosystem that will attract new companies, ideas and educational models.
''It's a sandbox for the research community and the residents, too,'' said Lev Gonick, chief information officer at Case Western in Cleveland.
Last year, Case Western set up a pilot program in a several-block area near campus, he said. The Case Connection Zone offers one-gigabit fiber-optic networking to 104 homes adjacent to the university. Within three months of its birth, Mr. Gonick said, three startups moved to the neighborhood.
''We believe a small amount of investment can yield big returns for the American economy and our society,'' he said.
The Gig.U members come mainly from the heartland -- states like Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri, Montana and West Virginia -- where they can potentially have a big impact on midsize communities across the country. The biggest universities already have access to higher-speed networks.
The colleges are preparing to talk to big telecommunications companies about ways to attract new ventures to their neighborhoods through super-fast computing. Then, they will seek out business proposals for building the networks, ''not decades hence, but in the next several years,'' the group said in a statement.
Although the United States pioneered computer networks from the 1960s through the '90s, in recent years it has fallen behind other nations in deploying and improving network technology. A recent study by the World Economic Forum found that while the United States ranked fifth in overall network ''readiness'' -- a broad index comparing countries in the digital era -- it came in 30th in network bandwidth available to the population.
In 2010, before joining the Aspen Institute, a policy research group, Mr. Levin was the staff director of the Federal Communications Commission's National Broadband Plan, which aims to make high-speed Internet service available throughout the United States. After leaving the agency and talking to researchers at universities around the country, he came to believe that the United States needed to find a strategy for continuously improving the quality of its Internet technology.
''It's the difference between seeing it as a race-to-a-tape versus creating a constantly evolving ecosystem that is improving our networks,'' Mr. Levin said.
The research community must still counter skepticism about what some technologists call a ''build it and they will come'' mentality. Some technologists say that once faster networks are deployed, new uses will emerge that cannot be foreseen today. Others argue that high-resolution video is the only current general application for the highest speed network technology.
''The concept is laudable, but the real question is for what purpose?'' said Michael Kleeman, a computer network designer and telecommunications policy strategist at the University of California, San Diego.

HEADLINE: A Living Wage in New York

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''They, Too, Sing America'' (column, July 16):
Charles M. Blow is right on the mark when he writes, ''The people who work these [low-wage] jobs are the backbone of this country, and will continue to be.'' In New York City, more low-wage workers are employed in retail than in any other sector of the economy, and the number of these jobs continues to increase. 
The fast growth in low-wage retail jobs is spurred by publicly subsidized development. Yet almost half of retail workers in New York earn less than $10 an hour.
Should taxpayers be subsidizing development that results in poverty-wage jobs? We don't think so. That's why we are leading a coalition that seeks passage of the Fair Wages for New Yorkers Act.
This vital legislation requires large developers receiving sizable public subsidies to pay a minimum of $10 an hour plus benefits, or $11.50 an hour without benefits, to all employees. Other cities that have begun to guarantee living wages on publicly subsidized development projects have found that such safeguards have not slowed growth or prevented projects from moving forward.

HEADLINE: U.S. Freezes Grant to Malawi Over Handling of Protests

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

 BODY:
CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- In a sharp blow to Malawi's international standing, an agency of the American government on Tuesday froze a $350 million grant to the nation after antigovernment protests there last week left 19 people dead.
The American decision followed Britain's July 14 suspension of aid to the Malawian government -- which has in the past gotten almost half its budget from international donors -- on grounds that it had suppressed demonstrations and intimidated civic groups. 
Malawi is one of the poorest countries in the world and its president, Bingu wa Mutharika, 77, a former World Bank economist, had been widely credited with successful efforts to reduce hunger by subsidizing small farmers' fertilizer use. But human rights activists and academics have been sounding alarms in recent months about his increasingly authoritarian tendencies, reminiscent, they said, of Hastings Kamuzu Banda, the dictator who ruled the country for 40 years until the advent of multiparty elections in 1994.
A senior American official, Sheila Herrling, said Tuesday that the Millennium Challenge Corporation, a federal agency, was ''deeply disturbed'' by accusations that the police had fired live rounds on unarmed people last week, and by claims that press coverage of the two-day demonstrations had been suppressed. The $350 million grant from the corporation, which was announced only in April and was to be disbursed over five years for electricity generation, is a large amount of money for Malawi, whose annual budget is about $2 billion.
''We are in the hands of the government of Malawi, and what they do right now will be critical to restoring the confidence of the M.C.C. and its board,'' said Ms. Herrling, a vice president at the corporation, whose mission is to give large antipoverty grants to well-governed developing countries.
Mr. Mutharika has rejected accusations that the police force under his command used excessive force against demonstrators and blamed his political opponents and civic leaders who organized the protests for the violence. His spokesman, Hetherwick Ntaba, said the police had to contend with looters, vandals and rioters. Peaceful demonstrators were protected, not harmed, he said.
Mr. Ntaba said he was disappointed that the United States announced its decision on the grant so quickly. ''We would have expected them to wait for independent investigation and the government's side,'' he said.
But the government's critics say they are afraid. Undule Mwakasungula, who organized the protests last week, said by cellphone that he had gone into hiding since the president named him as one of those to blame for the violence. Mr. Mwakasungula said his lawyer told him the police had prepared charges against him.
''We are being hunted so we can't expose ourselves,'' he said. ''We're a target of ruling party agents.''
The protests themselves were fueled by what the government's critics see as its mismanagement of the economy and its antidemocratic ways. Malawi has had a rapidly growing economy, but this year brought a collapse of tobacco exports -- a major foreign exchange earner for the country -- to about one-third of last year's level.
''It's a huge calamity for an export to fail that way,'' Janet Stotsky, the International Monetary Fund's mission chief for Malawi, said in a telephone interview.
As the country has faced an acute shortage of foreign exchange along with rising international fuel prices, Mr. Mutharika has resisted advice from the International Monetary Fund to devalue the local currency, the kwacha. The lack of foreign currency to pay for imports has worsened fuel shortages, leading to long lines at gas stations and leaving businesses struggling to operate with unreliable electricity and a lack of diesel to power private generators.
The protests themselves seem to have created more discontent. Kondwani Munthali, a political reporter for The Nation and a former Neiman Fellow at Harvard, said photographers, as well as radio, freelance and newspaper journalists -- including himself -- were beaten by the police with gun butts, whips and sticks. He wrote on his blog that the police took turns beating Mr. Mwakasungula, one of the protest's chief organizers, ''one after another whipping him with gun butts.''
As he fell asleep last Wednesday night with images of people being tear gassed, beaten and shot in his mind, Mr. Munthali said he wondered ''is this part of the legacy President Bingu wa Mutharika would like to leave.''

HEADLINE: House Panel Plans to Question Rating Agencies Over Downgrade Threat to U.S.

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
Credit rating agencies have been questioning Congress about its credibility. Now, Congress gets to turn the tables.
A House Financial Services oversight panel on Wednesday will give lawmakers their first chance to ask senior executives at Standard & Poor's and Moody's about their judgments in putting the government on notice that its top-flight credit rating is at risk.
The hearing had been called to discuss the impact of new financial regulations on the major rating agencies. But as the possibility of a credit downgrade becomes increasingly likely, representatives from both political parties are expected to take a closer look at the record of those issuing the reviews of United States government debt. 
Representative Randy Neugebauer, a Texas Republican who leads the Financial Services Oversight Subcommittee, said he believed the agencies were acting properly to raise questions about the nation's debt problem. Still, he added, the financial crisis showed that the rating agencies did not always get it right.
''A lot of folks feel the agencies failed,'' he said. ''Their credibility is somewhat in question.''
Representative Barney Frank, the ranking member of the House Financial Services Committee, who is a Massachusetts Democrat, said he believed the rating agencies had made flawed assessments on ratings of state and municipal debt over the years. Now, he said, he thinks they may be misjudging Congress's political will to rein in the deficit.
''I don't think that in judging how the political system is going to respond, going forward, that they have any credibility,'' he said. ''They are terrible at that.''
Wednesday's hearing will be the latest act in a week of political drama over an agreement to raise the debt ceiling and lower the federal deficit. Even as Democrat and Republicans work on competing plans to get the nation's financial house in order, the judgments of the major credit rating agencies hang over any deal. Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings have all warned that they might lower the American credit rating. S.& P. has gone a step further, suggesting that the uncertain political climate could lead it to take action by mid-October even with an agreement to cut the deficit.
S.& P. has indicated that the Obama administration and the Congress will need a ''credible plan'' to cut the deficit by $4 trillion to keep its top rating.
Few believe that such a plan is now possible. Critics of the rating agencies charge that they are inserting themselves in a highly charged political debate.
''For them to weigh in with such specificity of what needs to happen seems to be outside their mission and charter,'' said Joshua Rosner, a managing director at Graham Fisher & Company, a research firm. ''It feels much more like a rating agency consulting business than a ratings business.''
Ratings can be useful in helping investors evaluate the performance of complex and lightly traded securities. But, ever since the financial crisis, the ratings agencies' own track record has come under attack.
After the mortgage collapse, critics charged that the agencies gave sterling ratings to complex securities based on absurdly optimistic models, only to later watch them falter. They also pointed to the agencies' unusual compensation structure, in which issuers pay for the ratings of corporate bonds. Critics likened that arrangement to a food critic who is paid by the restaurants he reviews. A Congressional panel examining the causes of the crisis called the ratings agencies ''essential cogs in the wheel of financial destruction.''
The agencies' record on sovereign ratings has been better, but European politicians found them to be useful whipping boys.
Now, Washington is registering its complaints. Within the Obama administration, officials are frustrated with what they see as the rating agencies -- especially S.& P. -- moving the financial goalposts. Last October, an S.& P. commentary suggested that the American government would have three to five years to get its fiscal house in order. By April, when the ratings agency changed its credit outlook on the United States to negative, it suggested that the government needed a plan in place by 2013.
Then, on July 14, S.& P. warned that if the government did not agree to a deficit reduction package of about $4 trillion, it could be downgraded in the next 90 days.
The agency said on Tuesday that the changing timetables reflected the belief that if lawmakers in Washington could not reach a deal now, they were unlikely to do so in the future.
''What's changed is the political gridlock,'' said David Beers, its global head of sovereign ratings, in an e-mail. ''Even now, it's an open question as to whether or when Congress and the administration can agree on fiscal measures that will stabilize the upward trajectory of the U.S. government debt burden.''
A spokesman for the rating agency added that it would refrain from commenting on the ''many varying proposals'' that had arisen in the current debate.
Meanwhile, there is the topic that the hearing was originally called to address. As part of the Dodd-Frank Act, lawmakers pushed for new rules that stopped requiring the use of ratings, forcing investors to do their own analysis instead. But banks and their regulators have fiercely resisted the rules, saying that putting that rule into effect is difficult.
On Monday, for example, the Federal Reserve identified 46 instances in its bank regulation that required investors to rely on credit ratings, but it did not map out how it would adapt those rules so that ratings were no longer necessary. The Securities and Exchange Commission also proposed Tuesday that mortgage bond and other issuers make certain certifications in an effort to reduce investors' reliance on ratings.
Lawmakers said they planned to question ratings agency officials, financial regulators and other experts on efforts to de-emphasize the importance of credit ratings in the year since the Dodd-Frank rules were passed.
