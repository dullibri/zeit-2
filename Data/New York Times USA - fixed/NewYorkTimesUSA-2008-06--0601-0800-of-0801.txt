HEADLINE: Increase in Charitable Giving Dampened by Signs of Belt-Tightening

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
Despite a host of troubling economic signals, charitable giving rose slightly last year, according to estimates from the Giving USA Foundation. But there are signs that those trends could give way to a decline this year.
 Individuals and institutions made $306.69 billion in charitable donations and pledges in 2007, a 1 percent increase on an inflation-adjusted basis over the $294.91 billion given in 2006, according to the foundation, a research organization backed by the fund-raising industry.
 ''While it's true that there has been slower growth, the important thing is that there is growth,'' said Richard T. Jolly, the foundation's former chairman. 
 The year was punctuated by several large philanthropic commitments. Among them, T. Denny Sanford gave $400 million to Sanford Health in South Dakota, Jon M. and Karen Huntsman gave $600 million to the Huntsman Cancer Foundation, and individual donors put more than $1 billion into their charitable giving accounts at Charles Schwab. 
 Mr. Jolly said it was too early to determine trends this year, but there are signs that charitable donations are declining.
 The Robin Hood Foundation, a charity founded and supported largely by hedge fund managers, saw donations fall 21 percent, to $56.5 million, during its annual benefit last month in spite of a guest list that included people with 9- and 10-figure incomes. 
 Wealthy donors also are renegotiating the terms of gifts they have already pledged, seeking to extend payment periods and even reduce amounts, said Melanie Schnoll-Begun, managing director for philanthropic services at Citi Global Wealth Management, a unit of Citigroup.
 ''Many have used company stock or other assets in their portfolios that have declined over the last several months,'' Ms. Schnoll-Begun said. ''So we've been going to several organizations where donors have long-term pledges or even one-year gifts and looking at ways they can still live up to their commitments.''
 And if the wealthy are cutting back, the average Americans who make up the vast majority of donors likely are doing the same, said Timothy Ogden, editor of Philanthropy Action, an online journal for donors. 
 ''Those people won't make headlines because they're giving $100, not $100 million,'' Mr. Ogden said, ''but they are the vast majority of donors, and most charities depend on them.''
 Individuals gave $229 billion, accounting for roughly 75 percent of overall charitable giving, the foundation report said. 
 Religious organizations continued to receive a large share of the philanthropic pie, taking in $102.32 billion, or 33 percent of the total. Educational institutions received the second largest part, $43.32 billion, or 14.1 percent of the overall amount given.
 Organizations that provide services to the needy received 9.2 percent of total estimated giving, or about $29.64 billion.
 Giving for international causes and organizations showed the biggest gains, rising 12.9 percent on an inflation-adjusted basis to $13.22 billion. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the nation's largest, accounted for roughly $1.5 billion of that amount, and many new large donors have shown increased interest in global issues, according to a recent study from Campbell & Company, a fund-raising advisory service.
 Less money flowed into foundations last year than in 2006, when giving to them was unusually robust. About $27.73 billion went into foundations in 2007, a decline of 11.9 percent when adjusted for inflation. 
 Nonetheless, foundation giving of $38.52 billion last year accounted for an increased part of overall giving, somewhat more than 12 percent.
 ''While we still see growth in household giving, some of it has been displaced by wealthy households that are channeling their giving through family foundations,'' said Patrick M. Rooney, director of research at the Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University, which researches and writes the annual Giving USA reports. ''About half of foundation giving is controlled by families.''
 ''This Land'' by Dan Barry will resume on Monday, June 30.

HEADLINE: Labor Needs to Improve Conditions For Nonunion Workers, Official Warns

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Ed Ott, the executive director of the New York City Central Labor Council, an umbrella group for the city's labor unions, has an unexpected and unnerving warning for New York's more than one million union members.
 He warns that their wages and living standards will be threatened unless the city's unions do far more to lift the incomes and living standards of the city's nonunion working poor, including restaurant workers, supermarket cashiers and taxi drivers. 
 ''Going forward, if we don't raise the standards for the lowest-paid workers in the city, and there are literally hundreds of thousands of them, our own levels that we achieved -- of wages, pensions and time off -- they're not sustainable,'' said Mr. Ott, whose group is a federation of 400 union locals. ''For a working class that is going to be making minimum wage or slightly above, what's going to happen is that as taxpayers, that will create a social base for an attack on our own standards.''
 Mr. Ott's remarks, made in a recent speech at City University and in a follow-up interview, were an impassioned plea as well what he said was a ''wake-up call'' to the city's labor movement. New York's union movement has far more members than any other city's, although it is widely viewed as less aggressive in unionizing and helping low-wage workers than the labor movements in Los Angeles and several other cities.
 He said that many low-income workers who receive no paid vacation or sick days were bound to ask why many municipal workers are entitled to 40 days off per year -- combining vacation days, personal days and sick days -- in their first year on the job.
 ''There's a danger that in the eyes of the majority of people we might be seen as too expensive,'' said Mr. Ott, a former official with the Communications Workers of America and the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers Union who became leader of the labor council in 2006 after its previous president, Brian McLaughlin, was indicted on embezzlement charges. ''If you have an extremely low-paid strata, you can't believe they'll say, 'You should have another two sick days when I don't have any.' We have to find ways to elevate their status.''
 Mr. Ott is glad that many union members -- for instance, construction workers, telephone workers and teachers -- have achieved middle-class status. But he voiced frustration that many unions showed little concern about lifting the status of low-wage nonunion workers. He made his remarks at a time when the number of nonunion workers has soared in traditionally union-dominated industries like construction and hotels. 
 Mr. Ott sees two working classes in New York: a unionized one that is doing well and a nonunion one that is struggling to get by.
 ''You see a working class on the subway at 6:30 in the morning and you see them at 8:30 at night heading home,'' he said. ''They work in the back of restaurants, they clean buildings nonunion, they're child care workers, they're in retail. Frankly, I marvel that these guys can find a way to live in this city. They work very hard. Most of these workers who work outside a union setting, they work more than one job or they work one job many hours.''
 Mr. Ott said the union movement needed to work closely with less-well-off groups of workers -- taxi drivers, domestic workers, restaurant workers, even freelance writers and computer workers -- to help raise their living standards, not just for moral reasons but also for their own self-interest. ''Every time you go to the bargaining table now, there's downward pressure,'' he said. ''Even in the public sector, it's 'Any improvements you want, you have to pay for with concessions.' That's downward pressure, too.'' 
 As part of his strategy, Mr. Ott took the unusual step of inviting the Taxi Workers Alliance, a group of several thousand nonunion immigrant taxi drivers, to join the Central Labor Council. 
 In his view, unions need to embrace immigrant workers and work closely with their advocacy groups. The labor council is working with Domestic Workers United to help enact legislation in Albany to improve wages and benefits for nannies and housekeepers. The labor council is also trying to make common cause with the Freelancers Union, a Brooklyn-based group that is seeking to provide affordable health and disability benefits to tens of thousands of freelancers and independent contractors. 
 In his view, a major problem is that many struggling workers are viewed as independent contractors and do not have many of the basic protections guaranteed regular workers, including the right to overtime pay and workers' compensation.
 Bhairavi Desai, executive director of the Taxi Workers Alliance, praised Mr. Ott's strategy and agreed with his analysis.
 ''Unless we lift the floor, the ceiling is going to collapse,'' Ms. Desai said. ''Some of the mainstream labor movement is all about fending for yourself as opposed to working together to raise conditions across the board for all workers.''
 Mr. Ott said several New York unions have become more serious about helping low-wage workers. He cited the United Federation of Teachers, which has unionized 28,000 home-based child care providers, as well as the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which has organized nearly 1,000 workers at H & M clothing stores in Manhattan. He also praised the efforts of Unite Here to raise wages for Aramark workers, who earn an average of about $20,000 a year in corporate cafeterias at Goldman Sachs, Bank of New York and other financial institutions. 
 ''One of the dangers we have in this city is the city is polarizing economically,'' Mr. Ott said. ''There is some fabulous wealth toward the top. And there is this growing body of working-class folks. The middle could collapse. The danger is, are our standards not sustainable in a city's that's politically and economically polarized?''

 AMID DESPAIR IN PRISON,
 Women Find Hope in Music
 The orchestra at the National Institute of Feminine Orientation -- a prison perched on a hill in the slums of Los Teques, Venezuela, on the outskirts of Caracas -- includes murderers, kidnappers, thieves and dozens of small-scale drug smugglers. It's a part of a project extending Venezuela's renowned system of youth orchestras to some of the most hardened prisons. The initiative is an attempt to humanize the prisons, where 498 inmates were killed in 2007. PAGE A12
 BIKERS TURN ISLAND INTO RACETRACK
 The Isle of Man is not nearly as well known as other racing capitals. But the Tourist Trophy, or T. T., races there are more extreme than most, with motorcyclists tearing through villages and towns on public roads, achieving unimaginable speeds and resisting safety measures even as the death toll climbs every year. The races are no longer the economic mainstay they once were. Instead, their enduring value seems to lie in their influence on the national psyche. PAGE A6 
 SEOUL HALTS U.S. BEEF IMPORT DEAL
 After a new deal between South Korea and the United States did little to quell concerns about mad cow disease, officials in Seoul said that beef imports from the United States were unlikely to resume soon. A top government official said the beef accord would be put on hold ''until the people's concerns subside.'' Thousands of South Koreans rallied in the capital to protest the agreement. PAGE A13
 NATO SHELLS MILITANTS IN PAKISTAN
 NATO forces in Afghanistan shelled guerrillas in Pakistan in two separate episodes, and insurgent violence appeared to be eroding the alliance's restraint along the border. NATO officials said the shelling was in response to rocket and artillery attacks launched by militants from inside Pakistan, where they operate freely. PAGE A13
 U.N. OFFICIAL ABDUCTED IN SOMALIA
 The United Nations said that the leader of its refugee agency in Somalia's capital was abducted, and a peace advocate was killed. The kidnapped man, a Somali who works for the United Nations high commissioner for refugees, was taken Saturday night from his home on the outskirts of Mogadishu by six gunmen. The peace advocate, Muhammad Hassan Kulmiye, who led Somalia's Center for Research and Dialogue, was killed outside his home. PAGE A10

 'DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL' POLICY
 Hurts Mostly Women
 The Army and Air Force discharged a disproportionate number of women in 2007 under the ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy that prohibits openly gay people from serving in the military, according to Pentagon statistics gathered by an advocacy group. Despite stress on the armed forces from two wars, the Pentagon is not advocating a change in policy, saying it is up to Congress to decide whether the law should be altered or repealed. PAGE A14
 SCIENTIST RENEWS CALL FOR ACTION
 Twenty years ago, James E. Hansen, a climate scientist at NASA, startled the world by telling a packed crowd at a Senate hearing that he was ''99 percent'' certain that humans were already warming the climate. Dr. Hansen's statement helped propel the first pushes for legislation and an international treaty to cut emissions of greenhouse gases. He plans to testify at a House committee hearing that it is almost, but not quite, too late to start defusing what he calls the ''global warming time bomb.'' PAGE A18
 CONCERNS OVER TOWN'S AGED LEVEES
 Even as many found cheer that floodwaters along the Mississippi River in Cahokia, Ill., fell short of what had been predicted, residents and the authorities there discovered a stark reminder of what may lie ahead: a sand boil on one of the aged levees that protect the town. The mayor, Frank Bergman, said as he surveyed the waterlogged levee, ''It's clearly time to upgrade our levees and keep our system safe.'' PAGE A14

 BEHIND TRAPPINGS OF WEALTH,
 A Modern-Day Slavery Case
 Mahender and Varsha Sabhnani, who made millions selling fragrances from their home in Long Island, were the picture of upper-middle-class industry. That was until they were charged and convicted with abusing their two Indonesian domestic workers and forcing them to work in conditions resembling slave labor. The couple are scheduled to be sentenced this week in federal court, and they may have to forfeit their house and pay back wages estimated at more than $1 million to the two workers. PAGE A23
 STATEN ISLAND CANDIDATE DIES
 Francis H. Powers, a retired Wall Street executive who was picked by Republican leaders in Staten Island as their candidate for the seat being vacated by Representative Vito J. Fossella, died at his home on Staten Island. Mr. Powers's death leaves Republicans in the Congressional district with a new set of political challenges in filling Mr. Fossella's seat. PAGE A23

 NEWSPAPERS FACING DISMAL YEAR
 For Advertising Revenue
 The news keeps getting worse for print journalism, with this year's financial performance likely to be the worst on record and with newspapers reporting double-digit declines in advertising revenue. Some analysts said this augured closings and bankruptcies for some papers. Others suggested that slumping newspapers would opt for mergers. PAGE C3
 DELAYING NEWS IN THE INTERNET AGE
 NBC said it held back the announcement of Tim Russert's death to make sure that his family was informed first. But by the time the network broke into its coverage to make a report, the news was already being spread via Twitter and Wikipedia -- more proof of the difficulty of holding back the tide of news in the Internet age. Noam Cohen writes in Link by Link. PAGE C3
 A CHALLENGE TO BLOOMBERG
 Bloomberg L.P. has long been the dominant information source on Wall Street, but it finds itself facing a serious challenge in Thomson Reuters, the combined company that formed after the Thomson Corporation acquired Reuters this year and has an equal piece of the market. ''For a long time, Bloomberg had it too easy,'' said Tom Glocer, above, the Thomson Reuters chief executive. PAGE C1
 A THRIVING LIVE MUSIC SCENE
 File sharing has been bad for the music industry, but less so for live acts. Bands used to go on tour in support of a record, but now they go on tour to get the money for a record. And groups like the Drive-By Truckers have found a sustainable business model of rock stardom selling concert tickets and T-shirts instead of CDs. ''Thank God they can't download those,'' the group's guitarist said. David Carr, The Media Equation. PAGE C1
 REALLY KNOWING THE TARGET MARKET
 The television show ''Mad Men'' is set in the 1960s at a fictitious New York advertising agency, where the smooth-talking employees wear nice suits and wield spiffy cigarette lighters. So of course it's a big hit on Madison Avenue. ''It's a mirror on ourselves from another time,'' an advertising executive said. A coming edition of Advertising Age will feature a mock issue to promote the show's new season and a DVD of the first season. PAGE C6
 NOKIA'S HOLLYWOOD PUSH
 Nokia wants to position itself against Apple and is trying to woo technology-wary movie studio executives to help transform itself into a next-generation entertainment company. This is unfamiliar territory for the company, but it says the move is necessary.

 BRINGING IT ALL BACK HOME
 (To India)
 Every May for the past 35 years, Lou Majaw, above, one of India's original rock 'n' roll bards, has held a homespun celebration of Bob Dylan's birth -- in Shillong, India. ''Happy birthday, Bob Dylan, wherever you are,'' Mr. Majaw began, segueing into ''Rainy Day Women #12 & 35.'' The annual incantation is more than one man's act of madcap devotion. It is also a peephole into the love affair with Western music that goes on every day in the British-era hill town, India's hub of rock. PAGE B1 
 LADY MACBETH APPROXIMATELY
 Lady Macbeth eagerly licks Duncan's blood from her husband's hand before straddling him, and later shows distinct evidence of bladder-control problems. A guy in a sequined Uncle Sam outfit performs a few magic tricks. And a woman in Elvis Presley drag dances madly with a gang of soldiers before being assaulted. TR Warszawa's production ''Macbeth: 2008,'' staged in the roofless tobacco factory near St. Ann's Warehouse in Brooklyn, is a brash, aggressively violent and very free adaptation of Shakespeare's tragedy. A review by Charles Isherwood. PAGE B1 
 TOM BROKAW STEPS IN 
 NBC moved quickly to stop speculation about who would succeed Tim Russert as moderator of ''Meet the Press,'' announcing that Tom Brokaw, the former anchor of ''NBC Nightly News,'' would fill the role for the rest of this election year. ''I volunteered,'' Mr. Brokaw said in a telephone interview from his ranch in Montana. PAGE B2

 RUDOLPH J. VECOLI, 81
 The longtime director of the Immigration History Research Center at the University of Minnesota, he argued in numerous scholarly articles and books against the notion that immigrants to the United States left their cultures behind and did their best to blend into mainstream American society. Rather, he wrote, they clung to their traditions and developed strategies to retain their heritage and resist pressures to embrace the American social and economic system. PAGE A21

 REMEMBERING A DAY AT THE PARK,
 Seven Decades Later
 Before there could be a fourth and final All-Star Game at Yankee Stadium, there had to be a first. Lonny Frey was the first player to drive in a run in an All-Star Game there. He turns 98 in two months, and some of the details of that game in 1939 are hard to conjure up. Bob Feller, who is 89 and pitched in that contest, remembers that day vividly. They are the only men from that game who are still alive. PAGE D1
 YOUR FRIEND ON THE FIRST TEE
 A golf starter is like the golf course's concierge, greeting the players before they start their rounds. Bill Hancock, a starter at Ballyowen Golf Club in northwestern New Jersey, said his job is like being a tailor, seer, therapist and matchmaker, all at once. ''Getting ready to play golf makes a lot of people nervous and befuddled,'' he said. ''I want people to be calm and enjoy the atmosphere. Sometimes I'll stand by the first tee and sing to everyone on the practice green.'' Bill Pennington, On Par. PAGE D5

 A BASKETBALL TRENDSETTER?
 The NBA's age-limit rules mean that the best high school players have to play at least a year of college basketball before they can attempt to play professionally. That could change if Brandon Jennings, the top high school point guard prospect in the nation, makes good on a threat to play professional basketball in Europe. ''This is the latest -- and most brilliant -- plan yet to combat the three-tiered maneuver by the National Collegiate Athletic Association, the NBA and the NBA Players Association to keep talented high school players out of the NBA,'' William C. Rhoden writes. PAGE D3

HEADLINE: Couple's Downfall Is Culminating in Sentencing in Long Island Slavery Case

BYLINE: By ERIC KONIGSBERG

DATELINE: MUTTONTOWN, N.Y. 

 BODY:
With their courtship complete and their arranged marriage only a few weeks old, Mahender and Varsha Sabhnani set out for New York from India in 1981, leaving behind their wealthy families and households with live-in servants.
 By American standards, they did not have much money. But they started a perfume company and embarked on a typical exurban migration -- from Queens to Hicksville to Muttontown, where they moved into Muttontown Knolls, a new subdivision of 88 half-acre plots that offered three models of houses.
 Theirs was a modern Long Island chalet: about 5,900 square feet, with diagonal cedar siding, a sharply sloping roof and two bronze lions standing guard before their front stoop. 
 Working from home and selling fortified-strength fragrances to customers in the Middle East and Southeast Asia, the Sabhnanis made millions. ''It started in our basement and just kind of grew from there,'' said Pooja Sabhnani, 23, the oldest of their four children. ''My parents worked incredibly hard.'' 
 Eventually, they brought servants from Indonesia, where Varsha Sabhnani had been raised. On May 13, 2007, the police were called to a Dunkin' Donuts in Syosset, N.Y., where one of the domestic workers had turned up. Her face was bruised and she wore only pants and a towel. 
 When the Dunkin' Donuts employees tried to talk to the 51-year-old woman, identified as Samirah -- like many Indonesians, she uses only one name -- she made gestures of hitting herself and uttered what sounded to them like the word ''master.'' 
 Immigration officials who searched the Sabhnanis' house found Samirah's co-worker, Enung, then 46, hiding in a closet. 
 Speaking through an interpreter, the two women described for authorities an existence on Long Island that sounded very much like slave labor. They spoke of starvation, beatings and torture. Their compensation of $100 a month for working 17-hour days with no days off amounted to a wage of roughly 20 cents an hour.
 Mr. Sabhnani, 52, and Mrs. Sabhnani, 46, will be sentenced on Thursday and Friday, respectively, in federal court. They were convicted late last year on 12 counts, including forced labor, peonage and harboring aliens. Lawyers involved in the case estimated last week that Mrs. Sabhnani, who was found to have physically harmed the workers and is now in jail, might receive 12 to 15 years in prison. They said that Mr. Sabhnani, who is under house arrest, might be sentenced to five or six years.
 Last month, a judge reprimanded Mr. Sabhnani and the security firm that was guarding him for violating the terms of his confinement by allowing him to attend business dinners in Manhattan that kept him out past 1 a.m.
 The Sabhnanis may also have to forfeit their house and pay back wages estimated at more than $1 million to Samirah and Enung.
 The Sabhnanis' lawyers managed to get their sentencing dates pushed back several times, but on Friday, Pooja Sabhnani said she was resigned to prison terms for her parents. ''For months, we tried not to talk about the sentencing, but you kind of have to talk about it now,'' she said, adding that she, her father and her siblings have taken turns visiting her mother four days a week at the Nassau County Correctional Center. ''We're trying to prepare to take hold of the business ourselves.''
 The Sabhnanis maintain that they are innocent, and plan to appeal. In court, their lawyers tried to portray the domestic workers' claims as fabrications hatched to extort money from the family or to gain American citizenship. 
 The trial testimony and interviews with relatives, friends and business colleagues of the couple detail a spectacular fall for the family, which appeared to be the very picture of upper-middle-class industry, success and acquisition. 
 ''This case is very frightening for Indian families here,'' said Bharat Jotwani, a wealthy friend of the Sabhnanis' who lives nearby. ''We are all educated, nice people. We came here to make it.''
 Mahender and Varsha Sabhnani, who were introduced by a mutual family friend, were married in July 1981, when she was 18 and he was 24, and arrived in Flushing, Queens, a month later. Both are Hindu Sindhis -- the majority of whom fled to India from what is now Pakistan after the 1947 partition of the country -- and were raised in upper-class homes. 
 Mr. Sabhnani's family, in Hyderabad, India, owned a department store, his daughter said, and Mrs. Sabhnani's family, which had been in Indonesia since before she was born, was in the textiles business. The house that Varsha Sabhnani grew up in there had ''more than three'' live-in domestic workers, according to her daughter. That house, where Mrs. Sabhnani's mother still lives, is believed to now have a full-time staff of eight, according to United States government officials involved in the case. (The prosecutors sent an investigator to Indonesia.) 
 In Queens, Mr. Sabhnani worked for an import-export business owned by an uncle, his daughter said. He struck out on his own in 1983 and started a perfume company, PVM International. He now produces several fragrance lines for men and women, including Royal Mirage and Eternal Love.
 Mrs. Sabhnani was involved in the company's bookkeeping. She also possessed the family's keenest nose. ''My mother is the tester -- of everything,'' Pooja Sabhnani said.
 Although all of the scents are made in the United States, they are difficult to find here. ''In America, people prefer light and floral,'' she said. ''In the Middle East, India, Malaysia, it's so hot and humid. You need something really strong, musky.''
 Charles Wiener, a salesman at Color Carton, a Bronx company that manufactures boxes for the Sabhnanis' business, estimates that a typical product might sell to distributors for $2 to $3 per bottle and retail for about $8. ''Mahender probably sells 2.5 million units a year,'' Mr. Wiener said, adding that with little overhead -- the company has employed one to three saleswomen and accountants at a time -- the business is very profitable.
 Joseph Palazzolo, whose company in the Bronx, J. Palazzolo Son Inc., makes perfumes for the Sabhnanis, said it pained him to hear other contractors make fun of Mr. Sabhnani's Indian accent behind his back.
 ''They thought that meant he was cheap, but you know what? He could get his stuff made in China a lot cheaper, but he has everything made in America because I think, in his mind, that means quality,'' Mr. Palazzolo said.
 The Sabhnanis are a traditional, close-knit family. All three daughters have lived at home while attending area colleges, and are not allowed to date. Pooja Sabhnani said the family's first domestic worker was brought from Indonesia in 1990 by Mrs. Sabhnani's mother. The worker, named Rose, returned to Indonesia in 2002. That year, Mrs. Sabhnani's mother, whom the workers knew as ''Mrs. Joti,'' hired Samirah, trained her for about two months and then put her in the house in Muttontown. (Samirah's visa identified her then as Mrs. Joti's traveling assistant and stated that she was to return to Indonesia with her in three months.)
 Enung was brought over in 2005 by Mrs. Sabhnani's sister.
 For the workers, America was supposed to be a rung up on the ladder from their previous postings -- with higher wages and better conditions. Samirah's husband left her when she was pregnant with their fifth child, the prosecutors said. She had worked for a family in Saudi Arabia, and was last employed in Jakarta selling rice at a factory.
 Enung has been married three times -- the first when she was 14 -- and has raised nine children. She was educated until about the equivalent of the first grade, and was pulled out because, she testified, her family could not afford to have her in school. She has worked since she was 7.
 Dilip Ratha, an economist at the World Bank who has studied migration patterns of laborers from the developing world, said the case fit a common template for the many workers who leave countries like Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia for wealthier nations so that they could send their earnings home to their families.
 ''Such arrangements are not uncommon, and even though there has been a good deal of government regulation of guest-worker programs in some places, some of these patterns of financial abuse have been institutionalized by now,'' he said.
 While they were working on Long Island, Samirah and Enung were typically paid by Mrs. Sabhnani's mother through transactions in Jakarta, said Mark Lesko, the assistant United States attorney who tried the case. Samirah's compensation, for example, went directly to her daughter from Mrs. Joti. 
 The trial testimony painted the Sabhnani household dynamic as less upstairs-downstairs than a case of third-world feudalism transposed to Long Island. The jurors were repeatedly moved to tears. Samirah and Enung, who are staying in the United States on visas for trafficking victims and are living in a group home, told of being cut with a knife and burned with boiling water. Samirah said she was forced to eat bunches of hot chili peppers and spoonfuls of chili powder until she vomited. Then, she was made to eat her own vomit.
 In a locked cabinet in a closet off the master bedroom, investigators found a photo of Samirah drinking milk from a carton. At trial, Samirah explained that one day, she had not been permitted to eat by 3 p.m. -- the workers testified that they were sometimes starved and often ate out of the garbage -- so she took a sip of milk from the refrigerator. One of the Sabhnanis' daughters, Dakshina, saw her.
 ''And Dakshina told the mother, 'Samirah took milk without using a glass,' '' Samirah testified. ''And immediately I was beaten up by the missus.''
 Mrs. Sabhnani gathered the children to watch as Samirah was forced to recreate her transgression for the camera. If she ever ''stole'' food again, she was told, her children would receive the photograph. ''And then my children would be embarrassed that the mother was the thief,'' Samirah said.
 Law enforcement officials involved in the case theorized that some of Mrs. Sabhnani's behavior may have stemmed from her own complicated relationship with food. She had been extremely overweight most of her adult life. Then, three years ago, she went on a diet that brought her weight down to less than 150 from more than 300 pounds. 
 Pooja Sabhnani staunchly defended her parents and said she had not known about the abuses that were cited in the trial.
 ''They were like a part of our family,'' she said of Samirah and Enung. ''They knew when you were sick and when you were well.''
 She said that when she and her family traveled to Indonesia on holiday -- the Sabhnanis usually took a two-month trip abroad in the summer, leaving the workers at home -- they looked up one of Samirah's daughters.
 She said of the workers, ''We got them Christmas presents. I got them sneakers from K-Mart. They said we didn't give them winter coats. They had coats.''
 She continued: ''They said we never brought them out. We took them out in the snow. We took their picture and explained to them, 'We are taking your picture. When you go back, you'll get this picture. We'll give the picture to you, and you can bring it home so you can show your children that you saw snow.' '' 
 The family's closest friends are fellow Hindu Sindhis on Long Island who have been taken aback by the charges. 
 When one of them, Mr. Jotwani defended the Sabhnanis, he sounded as though he felt impelled to defend his entire community.
 ''There is no way on earth any Indian family in the United States could do what they were accused of,'' he said. ''The [Indian] people I know here all feel this way. Anybody from India who has come here comes from a very good family.''

HEADLINE: Papers Facing Worst Year for Ad Revenue

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
For newspapers, the news has swiftly gone from bad to worse. This year is taking shape as their worst on record, with a double-digit drop in advertising revenue, raising serious questions about the survival of some papers and the solvency of their parent companies. 
 Ad revenue, the primary source of newspaper income, began sliding two years ago, and as hiring freezes turned to buyouts and then to layoffs, the decline has only accelerated. 
 On top of long-term changes in the industry, the weak economy is also hurting ad sales, especially in Florida and California, where the severe contraction of the housing markets has cut deeply into real estate ads. Executives at the Hearst Corporation say that one of their biggest papers, The San Francisco Chronicle, is losing $1 million a week.
 Over all, ad revenue fell almost 8 percent last year. This year, it is running about 12 percent below that dismal performance, and company reports issued last week suggested a 14 percent to 15 percent decline in May.
 ''Never in my most bearish dreams six months ago did I think we'd be talking about negative 15 percent numbers against weak comps,'' said Peter S. Appert, an analyst at Goldman Sachs. ''I think the probability is very high that there will be a number of examples of individual newspapers and newspaper companies that fall into a loss position. And I think it's inevitable that there will be closures in this industry, and maybe bankruptcies.''
 Analysts and newspaper executives find themselves revising their forecasts downward every few months, unable to gain a stable footing on a sinking floor. Papers have cut costs by shedding thousands of workers, eliminating some distribution routes and printing fewer, smaller pages, but profit margins continue to shrink.
 Since the fall, when Media General, the owner of a major newspaper chain in the South, set its 2008 budget, ''We have pulled our thinking down twice with respect to revenue,'' said Marshall N. Morton, the chief executive.
 Over the next few years, he predicted, ''There's got to be some assimilation,'' with some major American newspapers going out of business or merging. At the corporate level, he said, ''I would guess that rather than bankruptcies, you'd see combinations.''
 Analysts have issued warnings about several companies' abilities to meet their debt obligations, though the companies insist that they are at no risk of default. 
 Most of those companies are privately held, like the Tribune Company, owner of The Chicago Tribune, The Los Angeles Times and many other papers; MediaNews Group, whose papers include The Denver Post and The San Jose Mercury News; and Philadelphia Media Holdings, which publishes The Inquirer and The Daily News in that city.
 Some analysts also see a lesser risk in a major publicly traded chain, the McClatchy Company, owner of The Miami Herald, The Kansas City Star, The Sacramento Bee and others, which said last week that its ad revenue was down 15.4 percent through the first five months of the year. 
 The company announced plans to eliminate about 1,400 jobs, leaving it with 21 percent fewer employees than it had a year and a half ago. Some other newspaper chains had already made comparable cuts.
 ''It's going a lot worse than anybody predicted, and if we have double-digit ad declines for two years, some newspapers will be in real financial jeopardy,'' said Edward Atorino, an analyst at the Benchmark Company. Even with less severe losses, ''You're going to see structural changes: papers could drop a day or two per week, they could outsource printing.''
 He said that he expected the decline in ad sales to slow, with 2008 producing a 10 percent drop for the year, but he cautioned that, like other analysts, he had not been pessimistic enough so far.
 The primary long-term threat to newspapers is the Internet's siphoning away of ad revenue, a trend that has been under way for more than a decade, but one that has picked up speed in the last year. Advertisers have vastly more choices online than on paper, so newspaper Web sites win only a fraction of the advertising that goes digital, and it pays much less than advertising in print.
 At the same time, the Internet has drawn millions of new readers to papers, and the major ones reach far more readers than ever before.
 ''As long as we've got content, we've got something nobody else has,'' said Mr. Morton, of Media General. The industry's challenge, he said, is to keep expanding that audience, ''proving to the advertiser that we, in fact, are the right link so that he can have his conversation with the customer through us.''
 Online ad revenue for newspapers grew 20 percent to 30 percent annually for most of this decade. Most analysts think the industry will return to that growth rate when the economy picks up again, but for now, it is closer to 15 percent. The Internet still accounts for less than 10 percent of newspaper ad revenue.
 Declining sales of printed papers and rising newsprint prices have also hurt the business.
 The industry will not bottom out for another three or four years, analysts predict. The question, Mr. Appert of Goldman Sachs said, ''is how far things will fall before then.''

HEADLINE: Iraq Decisions for the Next President

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Iraq: Still Inscrutable,'' by Thomas L. Friedman (column, June 18):
 Mr. Friedman discusses the difficult decisions the next president will have to make about military strategy in Iraq, and quotes the author Michael Mandelbaum as saying that ''most Americans really want to leave, but they still don't want to lose.''
 I believe that many Americans no longer think about the Iraq war in the traditional terms of winning and losing. 
 Rather, they think about leaving having created more chaos and potentially more danger in the form of terrorism against the United States or leaving having created a more stable Middle East that leans toward the democratic ideals of the Western world.
 Christopher Greene
 Brooklyn, June 18, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Thomas L. Friedman says, ''It still is not clear that Iraq is a country that can be held together by anything other than an iron fist.'' And he says, ''Kurdistan continues to operate as an island of decency and free markets.''
 Iraq is, in fact, three countries. The moment the United States withdraws, three separate peoples will fight for territory. Our staying only delays this inevitable conflict. 
 Whether the territory delineated as ''Iraq'' is ruled by the iron fist of a Shiite or a Sunni or is divided by a line defined through battles on the ground, Iraq as we have tried to invent it will be something other than what we imagine.
 Jean E. Rosenfeld
 Pacific Palisades, Calif., June 18, 2008
 To the Editor:
 It took the British a decade or more to wind down insurgencies in Kenya and Malaya. It may take us that long in Iraq.
 Despite the huge cost of staying in Iraq, the cost of leaving too quickly would be vastly greater -- in lost prestige, lost credibility in the war against terrorism, general chaos in the region and the hegemony of Iran.
 A middle ground is to stay but reduce costs, by pulling out troops as Iraqis prove they can fill the gap, and by cutting costly American contractors no longer needed, replacing others with lower-cost Iraqis and subjecting all to a strict cost-control regime.
 We should forget leverage; only genuine security, not threats of our leaving, will allow ancient divisions to heal. 
 If America is to continue as a great nation, it must act like one. Ron Cohen 
 Waltham, Mass., June 18, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Thomas L. Friedman is right. The two presumptive nominees for president should be talking more about Iraq. They could begin by debating the often-stated notion that the surge has been a ''success.'' 
 It's true that the number of American troops killed in May 2008 was the lowest monthly total since the American invasion in 2003. But another way to convey that fact is to say that 19 Americans were killed in one month more than five years after the start of an unnecessary war, bringing total troop fatalities to well over 4,000. 
 And the staggering financial cost of the war -- the second most expensive, after World War II -- continues to weaken an already battered economy.
 Let the debate begin. Niels Aaboe
 New York, June 18, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Thomas L. Friedman says that military options for Iraq should be discussed openly in the presidential campaign. I don't think that would be helpful at all. It would only reduce strategic and tactical options for the new president to the disadvantage of the United States.
 Consider the nature of campaigns: the pandering to narrow interests, the sound-bite media, and the need to be clear and specific under intense questioning. It is not easy to maintain a nuanced, flexible and complex position while running for office. 
 I would not like to see either candidate put into a box by campaign promises and rhetoric that would limit actual choices. Randie Malinsky
 New York, June 18, 2008
 To the Editor: 
 Eventually Iraq will be to America what Afghanistan was to the Soviet Union. It will be the lead pipe that breaks the camel's back. (Afghanistan cannot be to America what it was to the Soviets because we apparently don't care that much about Afghanistan.) What else can we really do except begin to withdraw in an orderly fashion? Our work there is done. It is hardly our best work, but for better or for worse, it is done. Daniel Newsome
 Elizaville, N.Y., June 18, 2008
 To the Editor:
 When Thomas L. Friedman says, ''It still is not clear that Iraq is a country that can be held together by anything other than an iron fist,'' it made me heartsick. I thought of the countless lives lost or broken and the untold treasure expended on this needless war, only to have us come to the same conclusion as Saddam Hussein.

HEADLINE: The New Fight for Financial News

BYLINE: By IAN AUSTEN

DATELINE: TORONTO 

 BODY:
For years, the Thomson Corporation was the information giant that rarely talked about its own business. 
 But since its acquisition of Reuters, which closed this year, that reticence has softened. Thomas H. Glocer, the head of the combined company, is very candid about where he is aiming next. 
 ''For a long time, Bloomberg had it too easy,'' he said in a recent interview. 
 Thomson Reuters is going hard after Bloomberg L.P., which has long been the marquee name on Wall Street for financial information. The companies are in a dead heat: Thomson Reuters has 34 percent of the market for financial data and Bloomberg 33 percent.
 Thomson Reuters is a far larger, more diverse company: its strength is delivering electronic data and services to professionals, including lawyers, doctors and scientists. It was Bloomberg, however, that defined the market by providing information unmatched in scope by any other company, married to a disciplined and customer-driven culture. 
 Mr. Glocer concedes that there is some symmetry in Thomson-Reuters's challenge to Bloomberg. After all, it was Bloomberg in the early 1980s that revolutionized financial information, stealing the market away from established companies like Reuters and Dow Jones. 
 ''Reuters used to be B.O.A.C.,'' Mr. Glocer said, referring to one of the airlines that later formed British Airways. ''Along came Richard Branson and Virgin, and suddenly British Airways became a much better airline. Bloomberg is that Virgin that forced Reuters to sharpen up.''
 That point is not lost on Peter T. Grauer, who was appointed chairman of Bloomberg in 2001 shortly before the company's founder, Michael R. Bloomberg, became the mayor of New York. The takeover of Reuters by Thomson might be a first step to reclaiming a business that Bloomberg redefined and in which Bloomberg has set the standard.
 ''My job is to worry, to take nothing for granted and make sure that we think about things in terms of humility,'' said Mr. Grauer, a close friend of Mr. Bloomberg and a former investment management executive. ''Great companies have begun to believe their own press and hubris has killed them. My mission in life is to never let that happen.''
 It was in the early 1980s that Mr. Bloomberg, a former trader at Salomon Brothers, took the high pressure atmosphere of the trading floor, imported it to the newsroom and delivered the result through proprietary, advanced technology backed by exceptional customer service. 
 ''This company has, in many ways, the most powerful business model I've ever encountered,'' said Daniel L. Doctoroff, who stepped down in December as Mr. Bloomberg's deputy mayor for economic development to become the company's president.
 The roots of Thomson Reuters go deeper. Thomson, which is controlled by the Toronto-based family of the same name, began with a newspaper empire that the company abandoned to concentrate on electronic data. While Reuters is best known for its news service, the company turned to financial information in the 1980s and is now the leading information provider in some arenas, including foreign exchange and commodities.
 While Mr. Glocer may have to deal with all the usual problems that mergers bring, he has the advantage of running a significantly bigger company. The combined revenues of Thomson and Reuters last year were $12.5 billion, more than twice those of Bloomberg, and Thomson Reuters has about five times as many employees.
 Mr. Glocer thinks he can go after Bloomberg on price and, more important, on flexibility. While Bloomberg, which is privately held, generated about $5.4 billion in revenue last year and has about 10,000 employees, the company still offers, for the most part, a single product: the Bloomberg terminal and its vast array of data -- once available only through Bloomberg's proprietary desktop system, but now found on ordinary computers and even BlackBerrys. Bloomberg combines that news and data with sophisticated analytical software that allows traders to swiftly execute and track trades.
 For clients, Bloomberg is a ''take it or leave it'' proposition that supplies everything the company generates for a monthly fee of $1,500 a user ($1,800 a month for the small number of firms that use only one terminal). Traders who have no interest in, say, debt markets cannot reduce their Bloomberg costs by subscribing to a service that drops that data.
 Bloomberg's price and packaging may not have mattered as much during a bull market, but with Wall Street firms looking to cut costs, the fourth Bloomberg terminal on a trading desk could start to be seen as a luxury. 
 Thomson Reuters has its own terminal products, some of which are delivered through proprietary terminals. Mr. Glocer said that a customer could pay about $1,000 a month for a Thomson Reuters terminal.
 Indeed, some Thomson Reuters terminals offering minimal information cost just $25 to $50 a month, depending on volume, according to Douglas B. Taylor, the managing partner at Burton-Taylor International Consulting and a former executive with both Thomson Financial and Reuters.
 ''Bloomberg has a real problem finding new business. They priced themselves at the top of the market,'' Mr. Taylor said. ''There are different points on a pricing curve that Bloomberg can't hit but that Thomson Reuters can deliver. It's going to be hard to figure out where Bloomberg's new growth opportunities will be that don't cannibalize its current pricing.''
 Mr. Grauer and Mr. Doctoroff both dismissed suggestions that the Bloomberg terminal is too costly, arguing that the price is offset by the returns subscribers generate by using it.
 ''Price is really not the issue for the vast majority of customers,'' Mr. Doctoroff said. ''It's not how cheap you are.''
 Some analysts disagree. Brad Hintz, a bank analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said that the high price of Bloomberg terminals meant that he did not qualify for one when he was the chief financial officer of Lehman Brothers. That firm, he said, had an executive who was constantly on the hunt for Bloomberg terminals that were not being used. If no one claimed it, Mr. Hintz said, the executive ''would grab the terminal and rip it out of the trading turret and carry it off the trading floor triumphantly.''
 Price may be a larger factor in emerging markets, particularly Asia, which both companies agree is the next battleground in their war for financial information supremacy.
 Thomson Reuters has been traditionally stronger outside of North America than Bloomberg, especially in India, and it has been aggressive in China. 
 Bloomberg rejects the idea that it is lagging in emerging markets. Mr. Grauer said that ''five or six major, government-owned banks'' in China use Bloomberg exclusively and that Bloomberg's business rose 55 percent in that market last year. (The company declined to quantify the size of its business in China either by revenue or customers.) Reuters's business in all of Asia grew by 14 percent last year, although analysts estimate that came on top of a much larger base.
 The next stage of the battle may also involve technology. Even before the takeover, both Thomson and Reuters were developing products for so-called black box trading, computer systems that replace human traders. The combined company now leads the business of selling data with minimal time delays for black box systems, a highly profitable line of products, according to Mr. Taylor.
 Thomas F. Secunda, a former Salomon Brothers programmer who helped Mr. Bloomberg found the company and who remains in charge of its products, acknowledged that ''we're not a big black box shop.'' However, he added that the company has technology and expertise it needs to expand that business if demand grows.
 While the market downturn has yet to significantly affect either of the two competitors, Thomson Reuters serves its electronic data and services to a much broader range of businesses, giving it protection from financial industry cycles. (The activities of physicians and scientists, key Thomson customers, do not track the markets' fortunes.) 
 Even Reuters's founding business -- the news agency that supplies articles and photos to newspapers and Web sites as well as news video to broadcasters and publishers -- is growing. As traditional publishers like newspapers shrink their staffs, they rely more on news agencies, Mr. Glocer said. Although he added, perhaps only half-joking, ''longer term, I hope the patient doesn't die.''
 But the growth of the Internet can cut both ways. Thomson-Reuters and Bloomberg face common enemies in sites like Yahoo Finance and Google Finance, which offer a much lower level of sophistication and depth but are improving and are, after all, free. 
 Reuters is allowing several companies to fill the Internet with free news and, like Bloomberg, posts freely available stories on its own Web site, although Reuters carefully keeps some stories back for paying business customers. 
 Neither company has sorted out a strategy for competing with online services. Michael F. Holland, the chairman of Holland & Company and the former chief executive of First Boston's asset management division, said he can no longer justify a Bloomberg terminal for his current role and often turns to the Web for data. He first used a terminal in the 1980s and remains a fan: ''There really is nothing else that's quite like the Bloomberg,'' he said. ''From the beginning, it has provided incredible information. But at a very high price.''
 And when asked what Google Finance and Yahoo Finance might mean for Bloomberg's future over time, Mr. Grauer paused. ''I don't know how to answer that,'' he said. ''I really don't know how to answer that.''

HEADLINE: Bollywood Goes to Hollywood, With Some Tinsel of Its Own

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS

DATELINE: NEW DELHI 

 BODY:
Hollywood loves to show outside investors just how the movie business really works. But some of the people behind Bollywood in India believe they have something to teach Hollywood about making movies. 
 Reliance Entertainment, part of an Indian conglomerate controlled by the telecommunications and finance mogul Anil Ambani, is in talks to finance Steven Spielberg and David Geffen in a new venture. The company has also recently signed production deals with several Hollywood directors like Jay Roach and Chris Columbus and stars like Brad Pitt, George Clooney and Jim Carrey. 
 Unlike other foreign investors who have stepped toward Hollywood -- and taken some grief for their efforts -- Reliance has deep experience in the film business. Mr. Ambani is a relative newcomer to the movie game, but his wife, Tina Munim, is a former Bollywood star. 
 Reliance Entertainment's chairman, Amit Khanna, a Bollywood director and producer, and the company president, Rajesh Sawhney, a former newspaper group executive, have laid out ambitious plans that include creating a $10 billion entertainment company that would be one of the world's largest. They envision nothing short of remaking Hollywood. 
 After several good years, entertainment companies in India are finding that they have plenty of money but not enough places to spend it. 
 ''Although the Indian film industry is having one of its best runs ever as far as cash inflow is concerned, the fact is that the top-bracket talent is booked up for the next couple of years,'' said Hetal Adesara, a founder of Business of Cinema, a Mumbai-based Web company that provides Bollywood news. 
 Companies like Reliance are looking to Hollywood to expand their portfolios and ''create a new genre of crossover cinema'' with talent from India and abroad, Ms. Adesara said. 
 Whether the company can change the inward-focused culture of the American movie business is an open question. Directors that have worked in both Hollywood and Bollywood say that the Indian emphasis on autonomy and innovation could have a strong impact on Hollywood. 
 ''I have complete and total creative freedom to do what I'm doing,'' said Vidhu Vinod Chopra, director of ''Eklavya,'' an Indian entry in the best foreign-language film category at this year's Academy Awards. Mr. Chopra recently signed a two-movie deal with Reliance Entertainment for close to $100 million. (Mr. Chopra's wife, Anupama Chopra, writes occasionally about film and Bollywood for the Arts section of The New York Times.)
 ''Could you think of a studio in the United States that would give me $100 million and give me creative freedom?'' he asked. ''Even if they wanted to, I don't think they could. I don't think the system would permit them to do it.''
 For one of the Reliance projects, ''Broken Horses,'' an English-language film set in New Mexico, Mr. Chopra has written the script and is directing, and may even pick out the poster, he said. ''This kind of thing is a director's heaven,'' he said.
 But the flip side is that the recipient of this type of hands-off funding is expected to be more aware of risk than one might be with Hollywood studio money. ''I'll be far more responsible than I would with five suits telling me what to do,'' he said. 
 Reliance Entertainment executives have promised to cut through the ''bureaucracy'' of Hollywood -- in some ways a remarkable goal, coming from a country known for the bureaucracy of its government. 
 The fast-growing entertainment and media industries in India and other developing countries are attracting capital and building audiences in ways their Western counterparts have not. Revenue from India's movie industry hit $2.2 billion in 2007, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers, less than a 10th that of Hollywood. But Bollywood is expected to double in size by 2012, thanks to 13 percent annual growth, versus less than 3 percent in Hollywood.
 ''There are a lot of lessons emerging markets can teach the rest of the world,'' said Rajesh Jain, head of media and entertainment for KPMG in India. Among his suggestions are how to use new platforms and how to lower costs. 
 Indian entertainment companies have embraced new channels of film distribution, like the Internet, more rapidly than their Western rivals. That's in part because of the Indian diaspora -- some 25 million people of Indian origin who live outside of India, many of whom are eager to see Bollywood films but cannot find them in the local theater. 
 Rajshri Group, owner of one of India's oldest production houses, was the first to tap into those millions, with the premiere of its film ''Vivah'' in November 2006. Rajshri made a download of the film available at the same time it premiered in theaters in India. Thousands downloaded the film, each paying $9.99. 
 Rajshri now offers an online library of hundreds of Bollywood movies and Hindi songs through its own Web site, and other production companies have followed suit, although downloads bring in a tiny fraction of what big Bollywood films earn at the box office. 
 Still, at their roots, Hollywood and Bollywood are starkly different industries, starting with the economics. A Bollywood film costs a fraction of one from Hollywood: a small budget in India might be $200,000 to $1 million, and a big budget is $4 million or more. The largest-budget Bollywood films have barely touched the $20 million mark. As much as half of the production cost can go to fees for actors and directors. 
 So far, getting mainstream Hollywood stars into major roles in Bollywood movies has proved difficult. Sylvester Stallone agreed this month to appear in ''Kambakkht Ishq,'' a move seen in the Indian film industry as a big breakthrough. But Mr. Stallone will be making a brief appearance in the movie, playing himself, not acting in a major role. Denise Richards is being wooed for a small role in the film as well, according to Indian news reports. 
 The financing of Bollywood films has historically been a less-than-transparent business, with cash flowing in from organized crime and black markets. In recent years, though, public corporations have been drawn to the industry because of its rapid growth, and banks in India and beyond have been making loans. 
 ''The industry is still in the process of going straight'' as far as financing is concerned, Ms. Adesara said. She estimates that 50 to 60 percent of the money being pumped into the industry now is ''legitimate,'' adding that ''it is going to take another couple of years for the industry to get fully transparent.''

HEADLINE: Agreements Are Elusive At Oil Talks

BYLINE: By ROBERT F. WORTH and JAD MOUAWAD; Robert F. Worth reported from Jidda, Saudi Arabia, and Jad Mouawad from New York.. 
Robert F. Worth reported from Jidda, Saudi Arabia, and Jad Mouawad from New York.

DATELINE: JIDDA, Saudi Arabia 

 BODY:
A hastily convened global energy summit meeting led by Saudi Arabia ended largely in disagreement on Sunday, with only a modest pledge of increased production by the Saudis and no resolution on what other practical steps should be taken to ease the crisis over soaring oil prices.
 The Saudis, who considered the meeting a success because of the high attendance, announced a production increase of 200,000 barrels a day and an expansion of their output capacity if needed in coming years. 
 But news of the immediate production increase had already been absorbed by the world market for oil. Some experts had anticipated that the Saudis might announce a bigger increase. 
 Saudi Arabia, the biggest oil exporter, is the only country with the ability to significantly increase production quickly. 
 By Monday morning in Singapore, the first oil market to react to the Saudi news, oil cost $135.72 a barrel, up slightly from $135.47 in New York on Friday.
 Rather than finding areas of agreement, participants in the one-day meeting in this coastal city on the Red Sea illustrated the sharply diverging views on what has caused oil prices to double in the past year to the $130 to $140 per barrel range. 
 Consumer nations, led by the United States, Britain and Japan, see more supply as the answer to higher prices. But most producing nations are either reluctant to or unable to pump more oil, and they say a big reason for the price inflation is speculation. Everyone agreed that surging demand in the developing world was a major factor.
 That point was punctuated last Thursday when China, the world's fastest-growing consumer of oil, announced it was sharply raising the subsidized prices that its own citizens pay. The price of oil temporarily dropped more than 3 percent on that news alone because of expectations that demand from China would slow. 
 But the overall demand for oil by China, India and other rapidly developing nations, including many in the Middle East, is still expected to grow relentlessly, putting enormous pressure on producers to keep pace.
 If anything, the Saudi summit meeting made plain the limited options available to push prices down from their record levels. 
 For King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, who called for the meeting just two weeks ago, it was an opportunity to show that his oil-rich kingdom was aware of growing anger and frustration caused by surging prices in oil-importing countries. It also reflected some alarm by the Saudis that the price inflation was causing consumer nations to look far more seriously at energy alternatives, which eventually could hurt the price of oil.
 The crisis is also becoming a central issue in the American presidential race, where arguments over who is to blame for high oil prices echoed some of what was heard at the Saudi summit meeting.
 President Bush has supported calls by Senator John McCain, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, to allow for more drilling off the coast of the United States. Senator Barack Obama, the presumptive Democratic nominee, opposes more offshore drilling and has called for a crackdown on oil market speculators, whom he blamed for pushing up prices.
 The question of whether speculators are influencing prices is expected to get closer scrutiny this week in Washington, where a Senate committee led by Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the Connecticut independent and former Democrat who supports Mr. McCain, will hold hearings on the price swings in the crude oil market. The oil summit meeting here was attended by energy ministers from 35 nations, who convened in a vast ballroom and listened as King Abdullah said he understood the pain that $140 oil was causing. 
 But King Abdullah and Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain, who walked into the high-ceilinged hall together as a military band played, soon offered totally different perspectives on the problem. 
 The king spoke of the ''selfish interests'' of speculators as a key reason and urged the gathered ministers to ''rule out biased rumors'' and to ''reach the real causes for the increase in price.'' 
 But Mr. Brown pointed to fundamental economics and ''oil demand rising faster than supply.'' The American energy secretary, Samuel W. Bodman, put it more bluntly in a meeting with reporters, saying, ''There is no evidence we can find that speculators are driving futures prices.''
 Both sides spoke about the need for compromise, with Mr. Brown calling for a ''global new deal'' that would allow a ''greater commonality of interest'' between consumers and producers, including greater freedom to invest in one another's markets.
 But asked how all this would help remedy the worst oil crisis in decades, some ministers seemed baffled and uneasy. 
 ''Let me ask you,'' said India's petroleum minister, Murli Deora, when a group of reporters asked him for his views, ''what else can we do to bring harmony between buyers and sellers?'' 
 Despite the urgency that brought hundreds of participants here, Jeroen van der Veer, the chief executive of Royal Dutch Shell, summarized the difficulties faced by oil producers in dealing with record prices: ''There are no overnight solutions.'' 
 King Abdullah also called for OPEC, the global oil cartel, to pledge $1 billion to help developing nations deal with the effects of soaring energy costs, to which the Saudis would contribute an undetermined share. He also offered an additional $500 million in loans from Saudi Arabia.
 Beyond that, participants called for both more transparency and more regulation in energy markets, more investments in both production and refining capacity, and more cooperation between producers and consumers. 
 While it is reaping record profits, Saudi Arabia is growing increasingly concerned that current oil prices might eventually dampen economic growth around the world and lead to lower oil demand, as is already happening in the United States and other developed countries. The current prices could make alternative fuels much more viable and threaten the long-term prospects of the oil-based economy. 
 Japan's minister for economy, trade and industry, Akira Amari, made some sharply worded comments on that subject, warning that steep increases in the price of oil were already leading to greater energy efficiency and to the introduction of alternative fuels. He called these ''natural self-defense measures'' that would ''inevitably reduce the revenues of oil producing countries in the medium- to long-term.''
 To alleviate fears over the supply of oil in the future, one of the main factors behind the rally in oil prices, Saudi officials said the kingdom would be able to increase production capacity in the coming years. The Saudi oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, said that Saudi Arabia would be capable of adding an additional 2.5 million barrels a day to its output beyond the current expansion plans the kingdom is completing. 
 Saudi Arabia is increasing its production capacity to 12.5 million barrels a day in a $90 billion expansion plan that is scheduled for completion next year. Beyond that, Mr. Naimi said, oil experts in the kingdom had identified additional opportunities to expand production, if needed, to 15 million barrels a day in future years.
 Mr. Naimi said this additional capacity would be used only ''if and when crude oil demand levels warrant their development.'' He used the same language in saying the kingdom could add even more than the new 200,000-barrels-per-day increase in the short term. 
 The Saudis have already said they believe current demand is being met, despite the high prices -- suggesting that high prices alone might not be enough to warrant the increase in supply. 
 Saudi Arabia has already increased its daily production by 300,000 barrels, or about 3 percent, to 9.45 million barrels. But that has had little impact.
 ''There is a very clear difference of opinion on key issues underpinning the high price of oil,'' said Raad Alkadiri, an energy analyst at PFC Energy, a consulting firm, who was present in Jidda. ''It's not clear that anything you heard today is going to reverse sentiment. One thing is clear: You are not going to wake up tomorrow and find that oil prices have dropped 20 or 30 dollars.''
 Cease-Fire in Oil-Rich Delta
 LAGOS, Nigeria (Reuters) -- Militants in the southern Niger Delta of Nigeria, whose campaign of sabotage has sharply cut the country's oil output, announced a unilateral cease-fire on Sunday after an appeal by community elders.
 The militants, who call themselves the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, declared the cease-fire days after one of their most daring attacks, which forced Royal Dutch Shell to halt output from Bonga, its main Nigerian offshore oil field.
 They said in a statement sent via e-mail that the cease-fire would take effect at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday.
 ''We are respecting an appeal by the Niger Delta elders to give peace and dialogue another chance,'' the statement said.
 The bombing of oil pipelines and the kidnapping of oil workers by the militants -- mostly in the labyrinthine creeks of the Niger Delta -- have cut Nigeria's oil output by at least a fifth in recent years, helping drive world oil prices to record highs.

HEADLINE: To Ease Gas Prices, Obama Eyes Speculators

BYLINE: By BRIAN KNOWLTON; Jad Mouawad and Sharon Otterman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Senator Barack Obama on Sunday proposed tightening the regulation of oil speculators in an effort to ease record high gasoline prices and address one of Americans' top concerns.
 Mr. Obama proposed closing the so-called Enron loophole, a legal provision requested by that company in 2000 that exempts crucial energy commodities from government oversight. He also proposed preventing traders of American crude oil from routing transactions through offshore markets to evade American limits and working with other countries to better regulate oil-futures markets, and he called on the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice to investigate market manipulation and oil futures.
 ''My plan fully closes the Enron loophole and restores common-sense regulation,'' the senator said in a campaign statement. 
 How large a role speculative investment plays in pushing up oil and other commodity prices is not entirely clear. While some analysts believe that large flows of money into largely unregulated exchanges have distorted markets and pushed up prices, most energy experts see no support for that theory. They point out that traditional market forces, like growing demand from emerging countries, and limited growth in oil supplies, can easily account for the increase in prices.
 Regardless, gasoline prices, and politicians' frustrating search for solutions, dominated discussion Sunday by surrogates for Mr. Obama and Senator John McCain even as news emerged that Saudi Arabia planned a production increase. One Obama supporter, Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, a former energy secretary, welcomed the Saudi move but said on ''Late Edition'' on CNN that it would dampen prices only ''a little bit.''
 Obama supporters again assailed Mr. McCain for saying, in a reversal last week, that he now favors allowing coastal oil drilling by states that want it.
 ''Senator McCain is basically following the policies of George Bush -- drill, drill, drill,'' Mr. Richardson said. New offshore drilling, he said, would bring new oil online in a decade.
 But McCain supporters said that record gas prices had changed everything. Opening up offshore drilling, said Douglas J. Holtz-Eakin, a McCain economic adviser, would not only increase supply but also clearly signal the oil markets that betting on future high prices is risky.
 ''Our national security's at risk, our economy's at risk and our environment's at risk'' if the country fails to become more energy-independent, Mr. Holtz-Eakin said on CNN.
 Mr. Obama received some support for his policies from a new quarter, former President Bill Clinton. Addressing the United States Conference of Mayors in Miami, in his first public appearance since his wife, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, ended her presidential campaign on June 7, he predicted Congress would pass a cap-and-trade system to reduce carbon emissions.
 ''Because I believe so strongly in this, I favor Senator Obama's position, which is to go to 80 percent reduction in greenhouse gasses over Senator McCain's position, which is to go to 70 percent,'' Mr. Clinton said, according to Reuters. ''But that's light years ahead of where Republicans have been.'' 
 But asked by journalists when he might endorse Mr. Obama, Reuters said, Mr. Clinton smiled and shook hands with members of the crowd without acknowledging he had heard the question.
 Mrs. Clinton, who has appeared publicly only once, at the journalist Tim Russert's funeral last week, since she conceded the Democratic nomination to Mr. Obama, spoke Sunday at a high school graduation in the Bronx. Mrs. Clinton had a personal connection to one of the graduates, Aleatha Williams, 17, whom she first met when Aleatha was 2, and her mother, Patricia Williams, 45. Both Aleatha and her mother have long been volunteers for the Clintons.
 Mrs. Clinton told Aleatha and her 83 fellow graduates of the Pelham Preparatory Academy, a small public school in the Bronx, that she had ''just finished the most extraordinary experience that anyone could possibly have,'' describing her time on the campaign trail.
 ''If you never give up, you never give in, and you keep believing that you are the best you can be, you have no idea where life will take you,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Ethanol Industry Has Provided Obama With Some Top Advisers

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

 BODY:
When VeraSun Energy inaugurated a new ethanol processing plant last summer in Charles City, Iowa, some of that industry's most prominent boosters showed up. Leaders of the National Corn Growers Association and the Renewable Fuels Association, for instance, came to help cut the ribbon -- and so did Senator Barack Obama.
 Then running far behind Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton in name recognition and in the polls, Mr. Obama was in the midst of a campaign swing through the state where he would eventually register his first caucus victory. And as befits a senator from Illinois, the country's second largest corn-producing state, he delivered a ringing endorsement of ethanol as an alternative fuel.
 Mr. Obama is running as a reformer who is seeking to reduce the influence of special interests. But like any other politician, he has powerful constituencies that help shape his views. And when it comes to domestic ethanol, almost all of which is made from corn, he also has advisers and prominent supporters with close ties to the industry at a time when energy policy is a point of sharp contrast between the parties and their presidential candidates. 
 In the heart of the Corn Belt that August day, Mr. Obama argued that embracing ethanol ''ultimately helps our national security, because right now we're sending billions of dollars to some of the most hostile nations on earth.'' America's oil dependence, he added, ''makes it more difficult for us to shape a foreign policy that is intelligent and is creating security for the long term.''
 Nowadays, when Mr. Obama travels in farm country, he is sometimes accompanied by his friend Tom Daschle, the former Senate majority leader from South Dakota. Mr. Daschle now serves on the boards of three ethanol companies and works at a Washington law firm where, according to his online job description, ''he spends a substantial amount of time providing strategic and policy advice to clients in renewable energy.''
 Mr. Obama's lead advisor on energy and environmental issues, Jason Grumet, came to the campaign from the National Commission on Energy Policy, a bipartisan initiative associated with Mr. Daschle and Bob Dole, the Kansas Republican who is also a former Senate majority leader and a big ethanol backer who had close ties to the agribusiness giant Archer Daniels Midland. 
 Not long after arriving in the Senate, Mr. Obama himself briefly provoked a controversy by flying at subsidized rates on corporate airplanes, including twice on jets owned by Archer Daniels Midland, which is the nation's largest ethanol producer and is based in his home state.
 Jason Furman, the Obama campaign's economic policy director, said Mr. Obama's stance on ethanol was based on its merits. ''That is what has always motivated him on this issue, and will continue to determine his policy going forward,'' Mr. Furman said.
 Asked if Mr. Obama brought any predisposition or bias to the ethanol debate because he represents a corn-growing state that stands to benefit from a boom, Mr. Furman said, ''He wants to represent the United States of America, and his policies are based on what's best for the country.''
 Mr. Daschle, a national co-chairman of the Obama campaign, said in a telephone interview on Friday that his role advising the Obama campaign on energy matters was limited. He said he was not a lobbyist for ethanol companies, but did speak publicly about renewable energy options and worked ''with a number of associations and groups to orchestrate and coordinate their activities,'' including the Governors' Ethanol Coalition. 
 Of Mr. Obama, Mr. Daschle said, ''He has a terrific policy staff and relies primarily on those key people to advise him on key issues, whether energy or climate change or other things.'' 
 Ethanol is one area in which Mr. Obama strongly disagrees with his Republican opponent, Senator John McCain of Arizona. While both presidential candidates emphasize the need for the United States to achieve ''energy security'' while also slowing down the carbon emissions that are believed to contribute to global warming, they offer sharply different visions of the role that ethanol, which can be made from a variety of organic materials, should play in those efforts.
 Mr. McCain advocates eliminating the multibillion-dollar annual government subsidies that domestic ethanol has long enjoyed. As a free trade advocate, he also opposes the 54-cent-a-gallon tariff that the United States slaps on imports of ethanol made from sugar cane, which packs more of an energy punch than corn-based ethanol and is cheaper to produce.
 ''We made a series of mistakes by not adopting a sustainable energy policy, one of which is the subsidies for corn ethanol, which I warned in Iowa were going to destroy the market'' and contribute to inflation, Mr. McCain said this month in an interview with a Brazilian newspaper, O Estado de Sao Paulo. ''Besides, it is wrong,'' he added, to tax Brazilian-made sugar cane ethanol, ''which is much more efficient than corn ethanol.''
 Mr. Obama, in contrast, favors the subsidies, some of which end up in the hands of the same oil companies he says should be subjected to a windfall profits tax. In the name of helping the United States build ''energy independence,'' he also supports the tariff, which some economists say may well be illegal under the World Trade Organization's rules but which his advisers say is not.
 Many economists, consumer advocates, environmental experts and tax groups have been critical of corn ethanol programs as a boondoggle that benefits agribusiness conglomerates more than small farmers. Those complaints have intensified recently as corn prices have risen sharply in tandem with oil prices and corn normally used for food stock has been diverted to ethanol production.
 ''If you want to take some of the pressure off this market, the obvious thing to do is lower that tariff and let some Brazilian ethanol come in,'' said C. Ford Runge, an economist specializing in commodities and trade policy at the Center for International Food and Agricultural Policy at the University of Minnesota. ''But one of the fundamental reasons biofuels policy is so out of whack with markets and reality is that interest group politics have been so dominant in the construction of the subsidies that support it.''
 Corn ethanol generates less than two units of energy for every unit of energy used to produce it, while the energy ratio for sugar cane is more than 8 to 1. With lower production costs and cheaper land prices in the tropical countries where it is grown, sugar cane is a more efficient source.
 Mr. Furman said the campaign continued to examine the issue. ''We want to evaluate all our energy subsidies to make sure that taxpayers are getting their money's worth,'' he said. 
 He added that Mr. Obama favored ''a range of initiatives'' that were aimed at ''diversification across countries and sources of energy,'' including cellulosic ethanol, and which, unlike Mr. McCain's proposals, were specifically meant to ''reduce overall demand through conservation, new technology and improved efficiency.''
 On the campaign trail, Mr. Obama has not explained his opposition to imported sugar cane ethanol. But in remarks last year, made as President Bush was about to sign an ethanol cooperation agreement with his Brazilian counterpart, Mr. Obama argued that ''our country's drive toward energy independence'' could suffer if Mr. Bush relaxed restrictions, as Mr. McCain now proposes.
 ''It does not serve our national and economic security to replace imported oil with Brazilian ethanol,'' he argued.
 Mr. Obama does talk regularly about developing switchgrass, which flourishes in the Midwest and Great Plains, as a source for ethanol. While the energy ratio for switchgrass and other types of cellulosic ethanol is much greater than corn, economists say that time-consuming investments in infrastructure would be required to make it viable, and with corn nearing $8 a bushel, farmers have little incentive to shift.
 Ethanol industry executives and advocates have not made large donations to either candidate for president, an examination of campaign contribution records shows. But they have noted the difference between Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain.
 Brian Jennings, a vice president of the American Coalition for Ethanol, said he hoped that Mr. McCain, as a presidential candidate, ''would take a broader view of energy security and recognize the important role that ethanol plays.''
 The candidates' views were tested recently in the Farm Bill approved by Congress that extended the subsidies for corn ethanol, though reducing them slightly, and the tariffs on imported sugar cane ethanol. Because Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama were campaigning, neither voted. But Mr. McCain said that as president he would veto the bill, while Mr. Obama praised it.

HEADLINE: Making Progress on Pensions As the Session Draws to a Close

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: ALBANY 

 BODY:
Heading into the last day of the legislative session on Monday, Gov. David A. Paterson and lawmakers are close to agreement on a series of changes aimed at preventing abuses of the state pension system, people involved in the negotiations said. 
 The legislation, drafted by Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo's office and introduced by lawmakers late last week, would ban the widespread and costly practice in which school districts pay lawyers who do consulting work by enrolling them in the pension system. It would also prevent retired public employees from collecting their pensions even after they are rehired, a practice known as ''double dipping.'' 
 The legislation comes amid an investigation by the attorney general's office and actions taken by the comptroller, Thomas P. DiNapoli, to curb pension abuses. 
 Mr. Cuomo has said that hundreds of lawyers have been unlawfully added to the pension rolls by districts over the last few decades. Last week, he announced deals with two upstate law firms that required the lawyers to forfeit their credits and pay $600,000 to the state. 
 ''The systemic abuse my office has uncovered in the public pension and benefits systems has wasted millions of taxpayer dollars,'' Mr. Cuomo said. ''We will continue working to put an end to the abuse and an end to lawyers receiving public benefits they are not entitled to.''
 On Sunday, the governor, above, also announced completed deals that would ban the sale of recalled toys, cribs and other children's products (no such ban currently is in place in New York), would impose new laws to prevent identity theft and would provide grants for making homes more energy efficient. 
 ''My colleagues in the Legislature joined in my shock as we learned how readily available dangerous and recalled toys are in stores in our state,'' the governor said of the toy agreement, adding that a series of inspections last year found that about 400 stores were selling items that had been recalled. 
 Critics have said that the legislative session has lacked urgency at a time when the state faces a $5 billion deficit in next year's budget and when citizens continue to shoulder one of the highest state and local tax burdens, according to several studies.
 In addition, some of the more high-profile issues being negotiated appeared to be far from concluded. 
 The governor's proposal to limit the amount by which school districts can increase property taxes is considered all but dead, because of opposition among Assembly Democrats. Legislation to reauthorize industrial development agencies, which are used by hospitals, private schools and nonprofit organizations to finance construction projects, also appeared to be in jeopardy. 
 A proposed overhaul of public authorities, which would tighten their oversight, also appeared to be in jeopardy, as did a proposal to advance efforts to clean up environmentally damaged land known as brownfields. 
 One thing was clear, however. The temperature has been significantly lowered between the governor's office and the Legislature since the exit of Eliot Spitzer, who resigned in March after reports that he was a client of a prostitution ring. 
 Over the weekend, Mr. Paterson kept in contact with both Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate majority leader. The Assembly was expected to extend its session beyond Monday, while the Senate was not.
 ''We all continue to meet in good faith on a wide range of issues important to the people of New York,'' said Risa B. Heller, Mr. Paterson's communications director. 
 No Greater Clarity for Brownfields
 The future of a state program that provides tax credits for companies that decontaminate and redevelop polluted land appears to be as uncertain as ever.
 Talks over how to overhaul the Brownfield Cleanup Program were said to be at an impasse in recent days, people involved in the talks said, though negotiations can often turn around in the last 24 hours of the session.
 The major obstacle is the cost, which is hardly a small concern with the state's financial outlook in question. Gov. David A. Paterson would like to see a limit set on how much each company can receive in tax credits, but Senate Republicans favor a less restrictive approach.
 This month a report by the state comptroller, Thomas P. DiNapoli, below, said that the tax credits could cost the state as much as $3.1 billion for the 200 projects currently in the pipeline. It also found New York's benefits to be far more expensive than those offered by neighboring states like Massachusetts and New Jersey.
 How to keep the cost of the tax credits down was one of many unsettled issues during negotiations over the 2008-09 budget in March and April. When agreement on a bill proved elusive, the Legislature approved a 90-day moratorium on accepting new contaminated sites into the brownfield program.
 With that moratorium set to expire next month, and the Legislature set to adjourn for the year on Monday, the future of the brownfield program could remain in limbo for some time. That prospect has some of the program's supporters anxious. 
 ''The failure to fix the brownfields program before the legislative session ends will be a disaster for desperately needed economic development in New York, and for families living next to these contaminated sites for years,'' said Mathy Stanislaus, co-director of New Partners for Community Revitalization, a nonprofit that promotes environmentally friendly development. JEREMY W. PETERS
 Bloomberg Move Stalls Negotiation
 Negotiations over a broad overhaul of the state's hundreds of public authorities, which critics have often called a shadow government, appeared to be in limbo. 
 Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester Democrat, who sponsored authority legislation, said that demands by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to have more power over his own appointees to authority boards -- ostensibly independent -- had put the negotiations in doubt. 
 ''The mayor has intervened in a very unfortunate way,'' said Mr. Brodsky, left. ''His proposals would make the authorities he has anything to do with an extension of his office. It's bizarre.'' 
 But the city believes that limiting the mayor's power will not help the situation.
 Farrell Sklerov, a spokesman for the mayor, said: ''The City has serious concerns that this proposal would ultimately reduce public accountability and hamper economic development.'' DANNY HAKIM 
 Giving Nurses a Break
 Nurses at hospitals and other health care facilities will no longer be forced to work overtime under legislation that will take effect next year. ''We cannot give patients the kind of quality care they deserve when we have exhausted nurses working well past reasonable limits,'' said Assemblywoman Aileen Gunther, Democrat of Orange County and a registered nurse. 
 Under the agreement announced last week, there would be exceptions for natural disasters, state emergencies or medical procedures in which a nurse is already taking part. DANNY HAKIM 
 Bright Spot for Beer Drinkers
 Gas may be getting more expensive, but keg deposits could be getting cheaper. A new law passed by both houses last week would reduce the deposit amount for beer kegs from $75 to $50. 
 ''The beer sellers said that it was hurting their sales,'' said Senator George H. Winner Jr., an upstate Republican who sponsored the bill. The lower fee, he said, ''would still provide a disincentive for kids.'' DANNY HAKIM

HEADLINE: Home Not-So-Sweet Home

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
''Owning a home lies at the heart of the American dream.'' So declared President Bush in 2002, introducing his ''Homeownership Challenge'' -- a set of policy initiatives that were supposed to sharply increase homeownership, especially for minority groups.
 Oops. While homeownership rose as the housing bubble inflated, temporarily giving Mr. Bush something to boast about, it plunged -- especially for African-Americans -- when the bubble popped. Today, the percentage of American families owning their own homes is no higher than it was six years ago, and it's a good bet that by the time Mr. Bush leaves the White House homeownership will be lower than it was when he moved in. 
 But here's a question rarely asked, at least in Washington: Why should ever-increasing homeownership be a policy goal? How many people should own homes, anyway?
 Listening to politicians, you'd think that every family should own its home -- in fact, that you're not a real American unless you're a homeowner. ''If you own something,'' Mr. Bush once declared, ''you have a vital stake in the future of our country.'' Presumably, then, citizens who live in rented housing, and therefore lack that ''vital stake,'' can't be properly patriotic. Bring back property qualifications for voting!
 Even Democrats seem to share the sense that Americans who don't own houses are second-class citizens. Early last year, just as the mortgage meltdown was beginning, Austan Goolsbee, a University of Chicago economist who is one of Barack Obama's top advisers, warned against a crackdown on subprime lending. ''For be it ever so humble,'' he wrote, ''there really is no place like home, even if it does come with a balloon payment mortgage.''
 And the belief that you're nothing if you don't own a home is reflected in U.S. policy. Because the I.R.S. lets you deduct mortgage interest from your taxable income but doesn't let you deduct rent, the federal tax system provides an enormous subsidy to owner-occupied housing. On top of that, government-sponsored enterprises -- Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banks -- provide cheap financing for home buyers; investors who want to provide rental housing are on their own.
 In effect, U.S. policy is based on the premise that everyone should be a homeowner. But here's the thing: There are some real disadvantages to homeownership.
 First of all, there's the financial risk. Although it's rarely put this way, borrowing to buy a home is like buying stocks on margin: if the market value of the house falls, the buyer can easily lose his or her entire stake.
 This isn't a hypothetical worry. From 2005 through 2007 alone -- that is, at the peak of the housing bubble -- more than 22 million Americans bought either new or existing houses. Now that the bubble has burst, many of those homebuyers have lost heavily on their investment. At this point there are probably around 10 million households with negative home equity -- that is, with mortgages that exceed the value of their houses.
 Owning a home also ties workers down. Even in the best of times, the costs and hassle of selling one home and buying another -- one estimate put the average cost of a house move at more than $60,000 -- tend to make workers reluctant to go where the jobs are. 
 And these are not the best of times. Right now, economic distress is concentrated in the states with the biggest housing busts: Florida and California have experienced much steeper rises in unemployment than the nation as a whole. Yet homeowners in these states are constrained from seeking opportunities elsewhere, because it's very hard to sell their houses.
 Finally, there's the cost of commuting. Buying a home usually though not always means buying a single-family house in the suburbs, often a long way out, where land is cheap. In an age of $4 gas and concerns about climate change, that's an increasingly problematic choice.
 There are, of course, advantages to homeownership -- and yes, my wife and I do own our home. But homeownership isn't for everyone. In fact, given the way U.S. policy favors owning over renting, you can make a good case that America already has too many homeowners.
 O.K., I know how some people will respond: anyone who questions the ideal of homeownership must want the population ''confined to Soviet-style concrete-block high-rises'' (as a Bloomberg columnist recently put it). Um, no. All I'm suggesting is that we drop the obsession with ownership, and try to level the playing field that, at the moment, is hugely tilted against renting.
 And while we're at it, let's try to open our minds to the possibility that those who choose to rent rather than buy can still share in the American dream -- and still have a stake in the nation's future.

HEADLINE: Market Barely Budges From Weak Level

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Stocks stalled Monday, ending mostly lower after rising oil prices and nagging worries about the financial sector gave investors little reason to buy.
 Disappointment that Saudi Arabia is not increasing production by more than 200,000 barrels a day sent oil prices higher, fanning concerns about inflation. Light crude rose $1.38, to settle at $136.74 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 Energy companies rose, but sectors like airlines and financial companies logged sizable losses. 
 With little economic data arriving, investors focused on the price of oil and the Federal Reserve's two-day meeting scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday. Most investors expect the central bank to keep its federal funds rate stable and, in its economic statement, to emphasize the rising threat of inflation.
 Denis J. Amato, chief investment officer at Ancora Advisors in Cleveland, questioned how the Fed would balance weakness in areas of the economy like the financial sector with concerns about the weak dollar and rising inflation caused by low interest rates.
 If Fed policy makers raise rates, he said, ''they run the risk of having some negative impact on the economy, and if they don't raise rates, they run the risk of negatively influencing the dollar.''
 The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 0.33 points, or less than 0.01 percent, to 11,842.36.
 After a day of back-and-forth trading, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index edged up 0.07 points, or 0.01 percent, to 1,318.00, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 20.35 points, or 0.85 percent, to 2,385.74.
 The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 5.92 points, or 0.82 percent, to 719.81.
 The modest moves on Monday followed a rough week that ended with a sharp pullback Friday. The major indexes dropped by more than 1.5 percent Friday, and the Dow fell more than 200 points to close at its lowest level since March.
 The financial sector's woes continue: Citigroup is in the midst of cutting its investment banking staff by 10 percent, and Goldman Sachs is also eliminating jobs. Citigroup fell 75 cents, or 3.9 percent, to $18.55, and Goldman fell $5.18, or 2.8 percent, to $178.59.
 Other names in the sector declined as investors fretted about the overall well-being of financial concerns. Bank of America fell $1.22, or 4.5 percent, to $25.88; the stock hit a 52-week low of $25.83. The American International Group finished down $1.80, or 5.6 percent, at $30.30.
 The rise in oil after the weekend summit punished sectors like airlines and rewarded companies focused on energy.
 United Airlines' parent, UAL, fell $1.07, or 15 percent, to $6.09, while Delta Air Lines slid 68 cents, or 12 percent, to $5.
 But Exxon Mobil advanced $2.79, or 3.3 percent, to $87.70, while Halliburton rose $2.98, or 6 percent, to $53.01.
 United States Steel rose $8.23, or 4.5 percent, to $191.02 after a Goldman Sachs analyst wrote in a note to investors that the company was best poised among steel makers to benefit from higher prices.
 The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was unchanged at 97 21/32 and its yield remained at 4.16 percent.
 Following are the results of Monday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Survey of Religion in U.S. Finds a Broad Tolerance for Other Faiths

BYLINE: By NEELA BANERJEE

 BODY:
Although a majority of Americans say religion is very important to them, nearly three-quarters of them say they believe that many faiths besides their own can lead to salvation, according to a survey by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life. 
 The report, the U.S. Religious Landscape Survey, reveals a broad trend toward tolerance and an ability among many Americans to hold beliefs that might contradict the doctrines of their professed faiths. 
 For example, 70 percent of Americans affiliated with a religion or denomination said they agreed that ''many religions can lead to eternal life,'' including majorities among Protestants and Catholics. Among evangelical Christians, 57 percent agreed with the statement, and among Catholics, 79 percent did. 
 Among minority faiths, more than 80 percent of Jews, Hindus and Buddhists agreed with the statement, and more than half of Muslims did.
 The findings seem to undercut the conventional wisdom that the more religiously committed people are, the more intolerant they are, scholars who reviewed the survey said.
 ''It's not that Americans don't believe in anything,'' said Michael Lindsay, assistant director of the Center on Race, Religion and Urban Life at Rice University. ''It's that we believe in everything. We aren't religious purists or dogmatists.''
 The survey confirms findings from previous studies that the most religiously and politically conservative Americans are those who attend worship services most frequently, and that for them, the battles against abortion and gay rights remain touchstone issues.
 ''At least at the time of the surveys in 2007, cultural issues played a role in political affiliation,'' and economic issues less so, said John C. Green, an author of the report and a senior fellow on religion and American politics at Pew. ''It suggests that the efforts of Democrats to peel away Republican and conservative voters based on economic issues face a real limit because of the role these cultural issues play.''
 For all respondents, the survey's margin of sampling error is plus or minus one percentage point. For smaller subgroups of religions or denominations, the margin of sampling error is larger, ranging from 2 to 11 points.
 The nationwide survey, which is based on telephone interviews with more than 35,000 adults from May 8 to Aug. 13, 2007, is the second installment of a broad assessment Pew has undertaken of trends and characteristics of the country's religious life. The first part of the report, published in February, depicted a fluid and diverse national religious life marked by people moving among denominations and faiths. 
 According to that report, more than a quarter of adult Americans have left the faith of their childhood to join another religion or no religion. The survey indicated that the group that had the greatest net gain was the unaffiliated, accounting for 16 percent of American adults.
 The new report sheds light on the beliefs of the unaffiliated. Like the overwhelming majority of Americans, 70 percent of the unaffiliated said they believed in God, including one of every five people who identified themselves as atheist and more than half of those who identified as agnostic.
 ''What does atheist mean? It may mean they don't believe in God, or it could be that they are hostile to organized religion,'' Mr. Green said. ''A lot of these unaffiliated people, by some measures, are fairly religious, and then there are those who are affiliated with a religion but don't believe in God and identify instead with history or holidays or communities.''
 The most significant contradictory belief the survey reveals has to do with salvation. Previous surveys have shown that Americans think a majority of their countrymen and women will go to heaven, and that the circle is wide, embracing minorities like Jews, Muslims and atheists. But the Pew survey goes further, showing that such views are held by those within major branches of Christianity and minority faiths, too.
 Scholars said such tolerance could stem in part from the greater diversity of American society: that there are more people of minority faiths or no faith and that ''it is hard to hold a strongly sectarian view when you work together and your kids play soccer together,'' Mr. Lindsay said.
 But such a view of salvation may also grow out of doctrinal ignorance, scholars said. 
 ''It could be that people are not very well educated and they are not expressing mature theological points of view,'' said Todd Johnson, director of the Center for the Study of Global Christianity at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary. ''It could also be a form of bland secularism. The real challenge to religious leaders is not to become more entrenched in their views, but to navigate the idea of what their religion is all about and how it relates to others.''
 The survey tried to determine how people's religious affiliation and practice shaped their views of culture and politics. 
 As past surveys have shown, this report found that Americans who prayed more frequently and attended worship services more often tended to be more conservative and ''somewhat more Republican'' than other people. Majorities of Mormons and evangelicals say they are conservative, compared with 37 percent of Americans over all. (Twenty percent say they are liberal, and 36 percent say moderate.)
 Respondents were evenly split on whether churches should express views about politics, with evangelicals and black Protestants favoring such activities far more than people of other faiths. 
 Nearly two-thirds of respondents favored more government help for the poor, even if it meant going deeper into debt. Sixty-one percent of respondents also said ''stricter environmental laws and regulations are worth the cost.'' 
 A majority said the United States should pay more attention to problems at home than those abroad, but in the area of foreign policy, 6 of 10 said that diplomacy, not military strength, was the best way to ensure peace.

HEADLINE: Roll With the Punches (More Are Coming)

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY

 BODY:
I AM not in the business of dispensing advice, but here is some nevertheless:
 It's summer. Air travel is bad. It's getting even worse and won't improve anytime soon. And there is absolutely nothing you or I can do about it. So chill.
 Last week, I was on a flight to Newark from Houston that landed around 9 p.m., about 45 minutes late, and then sat for nearly a half-hour while the crew tried to round up somebody to operate the jetway so that the door could be opened and people could get off. In the aisle, some passengers were crying because they had now missed connections, including international flights. 
 ''Make sure they give you a hotel voucher,'' I said, trying to be helpful, to a woman near me whose connecting flight to Bangor, Me., the last that night, had already departed. ''The least they can do is buy you a night in Newark.''
 She glared at me silently through damp eyes.
 Missed connections aside (and I had missed one in Houston from Tucson just a day earlier, causing me to postpone my return trip), that experience wasn't so bad, though I did sympathize with the tears of the damned.
 That same day, for example, passengers on a United flight from Salt Lake City to Denver found themselves in a jam after the pilot announced from the cockpit that he was ''too upset to fly,'' according to reports in USA Today and in some broadcast media, based on passengers' accounts that United did not dispute. 
 Evidently, the pilot had gotten into a disagreement with other pilots about wearing his hat. Many United pilots are not wearing their hats in a union protest over what they call generous management compensation while jobs are being cut. 
 Pilot stress is also brewing at US Airways. The US Airline Pilots Association, the union that represents pilots for US Airways, which merged with America West in 2005, recently filed a lawsuit accusing fellow pilots -- all from the former America West -- of ''racketeering.'' The union said the pilots were seeking to undermine the union with tricks like ''a deluge of frivolous calls'' that tied up the union's toll-free hot line.
 Meanwhile, flight attendants are feeling extra pressure as they deal with growing passenger stress. 
 Here's an example from last week. A JetBlue flight attendant was subject to a physical attack and racial slurs during a flight from New York to San Francisco after he removed a lighted cigarette from the mouth of an intoxicated female passenger who had refused to put it out. 
 The flight was diverted to Denver and the woman, who said she had been drinking vodka and did not remember lighting up, was arrested. Back in New York, a friend of hers blamed the vodka. ''When she drinks beer, she's O.K.,'' the friend told The Daily News.
 Seriously, folks, the only way to get through this summer is to grin and bear it -- because the fall is going to be even more stressful. All the indicators, prominent among them the untenable cost of fuel for airlines, are awful.
 I asked Kevin Mitchell, the chairman of the Business Travel Coalition and a man who always has some insight into the state of travel, if he had any advice for the summer and the fall. Starting in October, most major airlines are planning further cuts in seating capacity and reduced flights to some markets. 
 ''I can't think of any,'' Mr. Mitchell said, uncharacteristically. ''We're in a real fix.''
 Mr. Mitchell says his major concern is that one or even two domestic airlines may collapse in bankruptcy this fall, with dire implications for that significant segment of the national economy that is based on reliable air transportation. He described air service as ''the primary source of intercity transportation.''
 On Monday, Mr. Mitchell released a detailed report on the crisis called ''Beyond the Airlines' $2 Can of Coke: Catastrophic Impact on the U.S. Economy From Oil-Price Trauma in the Airline Industry.''
 With soaring fuel costs and a persistent credit crisis, ''multiple failures of major U.S. airlines are not a remote prospect,'' says the report, which can be found at the Business Travel Coalition Web site, www.businesstravelcoalition.com.
 And there's nothing funny in it at all.

HEADLINE: Officials Reject Report of Pregnancy Pact

BYLINE: By KATIE ZEZIMA

DATELINE: GLOUCESTER, Mass. 

 BODY:
The mayor of this seaside city said Monday that there was no independent evidence that a group of high school girls here had made a pact to become pregnant and raise their babies together, as a magazine reported last week. 
 ''Any planned blood-oath bond to become pregnant -- there is absolutely no evidence of that,'' Mayor Carolyn Kirk said at a news conference after a meeting with school and health officials. 
 Time magazine reported last week that Joseph Sullivan, the principal of Gloucester High School, had said that nearly half of the 18 students who became pregnant during the school year did so as part of an agreement. 
 Mayor Kirk and Christopher Farmer, the superintendent of schools, said Monday that when asked, Mr. Sullivan could not remember specifically where he had heard about the agreement. 
 ''He was foggy in his memory of how he heard this information,'' Ms. Kirk said. ''When pressed, his memory failed.'' 
 Mr. Farmer said he had spoken with other employees at the school, which has 1,200 students, and had been unable to verify the pact.
 Mr. Sullivan could not be reached for comment. Time reported on its Web site Monday that Mr. Sullivan told the magazine on June 11 that the teenage pregnancy rate had increased nearly fourfold this school year not because the school's health clinic does not dispense birth control, but because of ''seven or eight sophomore girls'' who ''made a pact to get pregnant and raise their babies together.''
 Mr. Farmer said school officials knew that some of the girls had ''expressed pleasure at being pregnant.'' That does not mean they made a pact, he said. 
 Time also reported Monday that Sue Todd, the president of Pathways for Children, a Gloucester child care provider that runs a day care center at Gloucester High School, said a social worker heard last fall that girls were planning to get pregnant. Ms. Todd did not return a call.
 Mr. Farmer suggested that the girls might have banded in support after becoming pregnant. 
 Four teenagers walking around downtown Gloucester on Monday said they knew of two girls who were close friends and planned to become pregnant together, but no more. 
 ''They wanted to get pregnant and raise their babies together,'' said Nicole Mitchell, 15. ''The two had a pact. The rest just got pregnant.'' 
 Kaitlynn Gore, 15, said some other girls did get pregnant on purpose, but not because they wanted to raise babies with friends. ''It was only two girls, but there happened to be a lot of people sleeping with other people and got pregnant,'' she said. 
 In an interview, Dr. Brian Orr, former medical director of the health clinic at the high school, and Kim Daly, the former head nurse practitioner, said they had never heard of a pact. 
 ''It was complete news to me,'' said Ms. Daly, who administered pregnancy tests in the clinic. ''I have never heard of it, ever.'' 
 Dr. Orr and Ms. Daly resigned in May after Addison Gilbert Hospital, which oversees the clinic, opposed making contraceptives available to students. ''We did it because we had to,'' Dr. Orr said. ''We cannot stand by the position of the hospital.'' 
 Dr. Orr and Ms. Daly said the spike in teenage pregnancy rates became noticeable late in the fall, when 10 girls were known to be pregnant. As of May, 15 students were known to have been pregnant during the time since the previous June. Dr. Orr said three others had been added to the list since May.
 The health center's advisory committee recommended that Gloucester introduce pregnancy prevention programs into the curriculum, offer confidential reproductive health care services and involve parents. The closest family planning clinic is in Beverly, about 15 miles away.
 Dr. Orr and Ms. Daly said increasing use of alcohol by Gloucester students, media influences, lack of sex education and the weak economy were all contributing factors in the rise in pregnancies. 
 ''We had 2 pregnancies, then 5, now 18,'' Dr. Orr said, citing statistics from the past three school years. ''We have to put a stop to it.'' 
 Mayor Kirk said the school committee planned to bring in outside experts to help determine what changes the school should make to help reduce teenage pregnancy. Changes will be adopted by the beginning of the school year, she said. 
 While the clinic still has financing for next school year, it has only one employee. Dr. Orr and Ms. Daly said they would go back if changes were made.

HEADLINE: A 'Bonfire' Returns as Heartburn

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN. 
The latest news on mergers and acquisitions can be found at nytimes.com/dealbook.

 BODY:
Almost exactly a year ago, Tom Wolfe, the author of ''The Bonfire of the Vanities,'' was wandering the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Dressed in his trademark white suit, he darted around traders and whisked past trading booths, shaking hands and waving, just before the market was about to open.
 It was a sunny, ebullient morning. The Dow stood at 13,337. Deals were zipping across the ticker: Barneys, the luxury retailer, was sold that morning to an investment arm of the Dubai government. Investment bankers were getting ready to take a half-day Friday and drive out to the Hamptons.
 But the real excitement -- the reason, traders whispered, that Mr. Wolfe must be in attendance -- was that the Blackstone Group, the big private equity firm, was minutes away from going public, the largest initial public offering in the United States since 2002. (At the time, he told The New York Observer that a friend was giving him a tour.) 
 Just then, a CNBC reporter pulled Mr. Wolfe aside to ask him what he made of all the hubbub. Mr. Wolfe paused for a moment to contemplate his answer.
 And then, with a wry smile, he delivered a prophetic declaration: ''We may be witnessing the end of capitalism as we know it.''
 Here we are a year later, and while it may not be the end of capitalism, it looks as if Mr. Wolfe got it a lot closer than, say, the investors who plowed money into Blackstone. 
 Capitalism today -- at least as Wall Street defines it -- is a very different, and worse, business. And it is only going to get tougher from here.
 Sherman McCoy, Mr. Wolfe's bond-trading protagonist -- who always bemoans he is ''hemorrhaging money!'' -- would probably be selling his 12-room apartment on Park Avenue right about now.
 Or, as Mr. Wolfe told me during an interview Monday, ''He would be eating his heart out wanting to run a hedge fund, but he's not smart enough!''
 Mr. Wolfe, who returned Monday afternoon to Manhattan from South Hampton on the Hampton Jitney, said he was mesmerized by what had happened to Wall Street in the last year. ''Nobody understands where the actual value is -- and they don't care anymore,'' he exclaimed.
 Of course, Mr. Wolfe's 1980s Wall Street -- of privileged WASPs (and Jewish Anglophiles), the sons of Harvard and Stanford and Princeton braying for money on the bond market -- is pretty much gone now. It was replaced, in part, by the world of private equity and hedge funds, by hypernumerate quants and bankers who think proprietary trading is more important than serving clients.
 And now that world is crumbling, too.
 Blackstone's stock has gone nowhere but down since it went public, dropping nearly 50 percent from its high the day it started trading. But that's the least of it.
 The once mighty Wall Street investment banks have been brought to their knees, sending out pink slips to more than 83,000 employees worldwide, racking up billions of dollars in losses as a results of their foolish forays into subprime mortgages. Bear Stearns all but went out of business before being ''saved.'' Some hedge funds have gone belly up. 
 Those lords of private equity, many of which were preparing to follow Blackstone into the public markets, have been put on semipermanent hiatus. (Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company refuses to withdraw its I.P.O filing, almost a year after submitting it, with no immediate hope in sight.) Their deal-making has all but stopped.
 As Mr. Wolfe nicely put it, ''It sounds like even the firms that aren't in trouble are in trouble.''
 And yet, there has been a perverse, and misguided, optimism that somehow the situation will improve in the second half of 2008. How? Sure, the big banks may take fewer write-downs -- but there is no way of knowing that. The news a few days ago that the big bond insurers were being downgraded will create new havoc -- and losses -- for holders of toxic subprime debt. Indeed, the bigger issue is what kind of business is going to generate any return for its investors. When you can't lend or trade -- and you can't invest with the leverage that juiced returns to support seven- and eight-figure bonuses -- how exactly are you going to make money? 
 ''It has always interested me that the word 'credit' comes from the word 'credere,' which means 'to believe,' '' Mr. Wolfe said. ''It only works if people believe in it.'' He's right, of course: one reason the credit markets have tanked is that people don't believe anymore. 
 Foreign investors seemed to have too much faith last fall, pouring money into firms like Citigroup. But their stocks just kept falling, so much so that no big sovereign wealth fund came to the rescue of Lehman Brothers in its hour of need this month.
 In truth, Wall Street is in for a radical makeover. Fewer people, lower margins, lower risk, lower compensation -- and ultimately, fewer talented people. It is likely to change the culture of an industry that for nearly a century has been the money center of the world. ''There would be a lot of firms leaving New York if it wasn't for lunch,'' Mr. Wolfe said with a laugh, remarking that bankers still like being fawned over by captains and waiters who speak in ''movie French.''
 Wall Street will clearly have to downsize. Citigroup is cutting 10 percent of its work force this week, and even the wonder boys over at Goldman Sachs are cutting 10 percent. And that may not be enough. 
 In 1973, Wall Street shrank by 15 percent amid a severe economic downturn. The bloodletting continued into the next year when 12 percent of the work force was booted out the door. That pinstriped massacre was caused by a stalling economy, amid skyrocketing oil prices, rising inflation and a faltering bond market -- very similar to the problems that the economy is facing today.
 Stir in a bit of globalization, and the world becomes more challenging. ''I think that what's going to come back to bite us is globalization,'' Mr. Wolfe said. ''It's never been tested. It's like a Ponzi scheme in which we are the Ponzi and everyone else makes money except us.''
 Still, Mr. Wolfe remains cautiously optimistic. ''This country is so rich,'' he said. ''I don't see people cutting down much in New York City.'' 
 When I asked Mr. Wolfe about his comment on the floor of the stock exchange, he said, ''I didn't realize anyone would take me seriously.'' He says he has since made up an explanation of why he thought it could be the end of capitalism. 
 Citing Joseph A. Schumpeter, the economist, Mr. Wolfe said, ''Stocks and bonds are what he called evaporated property. People completely lose touch of the underlying assets. It's all paper -- these esoteric devices. So it has become evaporated property squared. I call it evaporated property cubed.''
 Then he cautioned, ''Of course, I'm not an economist.'' Maybe that's why he's gotten it so right.

HEADLINE: A One-Time Tax Break Saved 843 U.S. Corporations $265 Billion

BYLINE: By LYNNLEY BROWNING

 BODY:
More than 840 of the largest American corporations reaped a $265 billion windfall thanks to a one-time tax break aimed at bringing home profits stashed overseas, according to recent government data.
 The windfall resulted from a temporary tax deduction for big corporations, which were keeping billions of dollars in profits in overseas subsidiaries and out of the hands of the Internal Revenue Service.
 The total amount brought back to the United States was far above some estimates, according to the data, which provides new details on the tax break. 
 American companies can typically defer paying taxes on foreign profits as long as they keep that money outside the United States. When companies bring the money back, they usually pay the top corporate tax rate of 35 percent. 
 In recent years, the biggest and wealthiest companies in the United States have increasingly set up foreign subsidiaries and used them either as foreign operations or offshore repositories.
 The subsidiaries, many in offshore tax havens like the Netherlands, Ireland and the Cayman Islands, collectively held about $804 billion in foreign profits on which their American corporate parents had yet to pay any United States taxes, according to the I.R.S.
 A one-time tax holiday enacted by Congress in 2004 offered companies the chance to bring that money back at a reduced tax rate of 5.25 percent. 
 Some of the biggest names in corporate America decided to take advantage, in particular those in the pharmaceutical and technology industries. Pfizer brought back $37 billion, while Hewlett-Packard repatriated $14.5 billion. 
 In all, 843 corporations took advantage of the offer, according to recent I.R.S. statistics of income data, bringing back $362 billion in foreign profits, paid to the parent corporations as dividends. Of that amount, $312 billion qualified for the tax break, giving those companies total tax deductions of $265 billion claimed from 2004 through 2006. 
 Put another way, the tax break gave each company claiming it an average $370 million in tax deductions.
 Supporters of the tax break say it was a success because it brought about $18 billion into Treasury coffers that otherwise would have stayed overseas. The nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, a Congressional agency, had estimated that the tax break would bring in only $2.8 billion, a sixth the actual amount.
 ''The provision was generally successful in prompting the repatriation of vast sums of foreign profits,'' wrote Joseph Calianno, a tax partner at Grant Thornton, in a recent analysis of the data. 
 But the tax break would not produce income for the I.R.S. in later years in part because of associated foreign tax credit provisions set to kick in later, and in part because of the need to replenish capital in foreign subsidiaries.
 Edward D. Kleinbard, chief of staff of the committee and a tax authority, said that the government had privately estimated that companies would bring back only $200 billion, or a third less than the $312 billion that qualified. 
 Private-sector estimates from Wall Street investment banks, including Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, were closer to the mark.
 The tax break was included in a larger piece of legislation called the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, with the intention that the repatriated money would prompt investment in the United States economy and spur job growth. Companies had to promise to use the money to invest in their domestic operations. They could not use it to pay dividends, or compensate executives. 
 But the provision had wide definitions of the term investment and allowed corporations to use repatriated profits to shore up their domestic finances, pay legal bills and even bankroll advertising.
 Critics of the legislation say there is little convincing evidence that companies put the money into creating jobs or investing in United States operations and deride the tax break as corporate welfare.
 ''It basically worked out to be one big giveaway,'' said Robert Willens, a tax and accounting authority in New York. ''The law never took into account the fact that money is fungible.''
 Mr. Willens said while companies did make investments in their domestic operations, the repatriated money also freed up a corresponding amount of cash to pay out to shareholders or buy back stock -- moves that do not generate job growth or investments. ''We know that a lot of stock was retired during this time,'' he said. 
 A 2007 academic study by Roy Clemons, then a graduate student at Texas A&M University, that was based on earlier data, found that the tax break did not stimulate investment in the United States economy and that repatriated money was often used for disallowed purposes, like stock repurchases. 
 According to I.R.S. data and Grant Thornton, pharmaceutical manufacturers alone accounted for more than 30 percent of the repatriated total, with 29 corporations each claiming an average tax deduction of almost $3 billion on foreign profits brought home.
 Some 9,700 United States corporations had foreign subsidiaries in 2004, the latest year for which data is available. While only 843 corporations took advantage of the tax break, those companies are the biggest and wealthiest in America, Mr. Willens said. 
 Martin A. Sullivan, an economist and former member of the Joint Committee on Taxation, said, ''just use common sense.''
 ''If I'm going to give you $100 to buy lunch,'' he said ''but you spend $500 a year anyway on lunch, you then bring receipts showing you bought $100 in lunch -- it's a ridiculous fig leaf.''

HEADLINE: To Avoid Student Turnover, Parents Get Help With the Rent

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

DATELINE: FLINT, Mich. 

 BODY:
Because he has moved so often, 9-year-old Richard Kennedy has already attended four different schools in Flint. In his mother's latest rental house the other day, he described how it felt to enter an unfamiliar classroom. 
 ''My mind gets mixed up,'' he said softly. ''They're always starting with different stuff than what I know.'' 
 He could only nod, tears welling up, when asked if it was hard to make new friends. 
 The frequent dislocations may help explain why he is being held back in the fourth grade, and why his 11-year-old sister, who has attended eight different schools, can barely read. No one doubts that the constant turnover of students here is taking a huge educational toll on those who move too much and, less obviously, those who stay put, too. 
 In some of Flint's elementary schools, half or more of the students change in the course of a school year -- in one school it reached 75 percent in 2003. The moves are usually linked to low, unstable incomes, inadequate housing and chaotic lives, and the recent rash of foreclosures on landlords is adding to the problem, forcing renters from their homes. The resulting classroom turmoil led the State Department of Human Services to start an unusual experiment, paying some parents $100 a month in rent subsidies to help them stay put -- a rare effort to address the damaging turnover directly. 
 Such house-hopping, and school disruption, is common in low-income urban areas across the country, with annual turnover of students typically ranging from 30 percent to 50 percent, said David Kerbow, an education researcher at the University of Chicago who has studied student mobility, a problem sometimes overlooked by education planners. 
 As the federal government demands more accountability from schools, high turnover is increasingly recognized as a threat to education and has been a source of concern in districts from Baltimore to Denver. In New York, board of education officials said that while they did not have data on trends in student mobility, it had been a prime reason behind efforts to standardize curriculums, so students switching schools would not find their math classes, for example, far out of sync. 
 High turnover can undermine a multiyear improvement plan. ''It becomes a different school, because the core of the students you're educating has changed,'' Dr. Kerbow said. 
 Even the students who do not switch schools suffer, because teachers must spend more time reviewing materials for newcomers and tend to introduce less material, Dr. Kerbow said, citing what his research had found in Chicago. ''The learning trajectory over time is flattened,'' he added. 
 Some of the changes in Flint reflect the district's loss of 1,000 students a year as parents move out in search of work. But most involve families cycling through homes within the city. Children switch from school to school, even returning repeatedly to the same one, as their parents become overextended on rent in one place, try another rental, flee an unsafe block or move in with a relative or a new partner. 
 Flint has yawning concrete fields where auto factories once stood. Between the mass loss of factory jobs and middle-class flight, many streets are left with rental houses in various states of disrepair, punctuated by boarded-up houses. 
 Officials here, as throughout the reeling auto belt, acknowledge that higher education is the key to a new economy. But the churning of students in the early grades imperils their ability to complete high school, let alone college. 
 Linda Thompson, Flint's schools superintendent, said that when she was a principal a few years ago at Washington Elementary School, 300 of the 500 students changed in a single year. In response, Ms. Thompson has made it a priority to align the curriculum at all the district's schools more closely. 
 To fight the residential turmoil in two of the most afflicted schools, Washington and Bryant, the State Department of Human Services began an experiment in 2004 called the Genesee Scholars Program intended to keep a group of second graders intact for two years. Since the program began, two groups of about 40 families have participated, one in 2004 and the other in 2006; officials said they knew of no other program like it. 
 The central attraction is the $100-a-month rent subsidy, which is paid directly to landlords, who in turn agree not to raise rents and to keep the houses up to code. The money comes from state agencies. 
 Perhaps equally important, the students remain with the same teacher and the same classmates for second and third grade. 
 The families also benefit from a popular state offering in which two caseworkers are assigned to each selected school in what is known as a family resource center. These centers offer a convenient, friendly alternative to large, impersonal offices where parents can arrange for social services like food stamps. 
 Results from the 2004 group showed that participants in the rent-subsidy program moved less, and the third graders scored significantly higher on a statewide test. The 2006 phase of the program has just been completed, and the results are being evaluated. Officials hope that with more data, they can raise money to expand the program. 
 The program is popular with parents, and not just for the money. Sinceria Williams, 27, and her partner of 11 years, Marcus Turner, 37, had been living with their six children, ages 3 through 11, in a substandard house that was an unreliable bus ride from Bryant Elementary School. 
 When they signed up their son Marcus Jr., 9 and finishing third grade, officials helped them find a nicer house within walking distance of the school. 
 ''The extra hundred dollars was how we could afford this house,'' said Mr. Turner, who has worked in construction but is now laid up with gout. The family has been living on the Social Security survivor benefits from his dead father and food stamps.
 With the extra money, he added, ''we were also able to save up a little for a wedding,'' which the couple plans for August. 
 Ms. Williams, who plans to resume work this fall in a day care center, said the classroom continuity, and the sense of being in a special group, had made a big difference for her son, who no longer looked for excuses to stay home from school and whose grades had climbed. 
 Richard Kennedy, the struggling fourth grader who has attended four schools, did not arrive at his latest in time to enter the scholars program. 
 His mother, Jennifer Burnash, 30, has filled her living room with photos of Richard and his sister and their framed school certificates for citizenship and attendance. They live on her monthly disability check of $637, utility aid, cash assistance for the children, $247 a month in food stamps and the money her boyfriend makes doing odd jobs for their landlord. 
 They have been in their home for more than a year now, but in the last decade, she said, ''I've moved so many times that I've lost track.'' 
 At one point, they fled after a house was shot up by gang members angry with her brother. She tried living in Indianapolis but gave up after three months because the rent was too high. Even in Flint, where houses are available for $300 to $600 a month, ''rent is the main thing that hurts you,'' Ms. Burnash said. 
 As for Richard, he tried moving in with his father, but it did not work out. 
 ''I plan on staying here,'' Ms. Burnash said, despite the crumbling ceilings. ''I love this home.''
 There are signs that she means to stay this time. She and her boyfriend have planted grass in a corner of the barren backyard, and they plan to expand it into a lawn, one section at a time.

HEADLINE: Achieving Wellness, Whatever That Is

BYLINE: By ABIGAIL ZUGER, M.D.

 BODY:
There are so few good belly laughs in health care these days. What a pity I am likely to be the only person on the planet to enjoy the guffaw-laden, if slightly unnerving, experience of reading Dr. Nancy Snyderman and Dr. Nortin Hadler's new books in tandem, taking careful notes.
 Both are practicing physicians who have made second careers interpreting medical principles for a lay audience. Both consider themselves experts not only in illness but also in wellness, that shimmering grail of our time. Both have combed through all the latest studies and are now pleased to provide you, the average healthy adult, with guidelines for staying well. 
 Both muster science, statistics and a judicious smattering of personal experience to present, with no small fanfare, completely, utterly, diametrically opposite advice.
 Dr. Snyderman, a surgeon and longtime broadcast journalist who is the chief medical editor of NBC News, delivers no surprises. Her mission is to assure readers that enough attention to the principles of modern medical science will bring you a longer, healthier life. 
 With chirpy, can-do optimism she recapitulates the standard wisdom. Watch your diet, exercise, lose weight, stop smoking, be screened regularly for a variety of dire illnesses, rein in cholesterol and blood sugar, stay in touch with your doctor and be sure to check out those aches and pains pronto, just in case. So speaks the medical establishment.
 Everyone, perhaps, but Dr. Hadler, a rheumatologist and professor of medicine at the University of North Carolina who is a longtime debunker of much the establishment holds dear. Dr. Hadler may not actually keep a skull on his desk, but he might as well. We are all going to die, he reminds us. Holding every dire illness at bay forever is simply not an option. The real goal is to reach a venerable age -- say 85 -- more or less intact. And the statistics tell Dr. Hadler that ignoring most of the advice Dr. Snyderman offers is the way to do it.
 The statistics are the key here, and readers will need stamina to traverse the thicket of numbers and analyses Dr. Hadler provides. Reviewing the data behind many of the widely endorsed medical truths of our day, he concludes that most come up too short on benefit and too high on risk to justify widespread credence.
 Dr. Hadler sees no evidence that mild high blood pressure or mildly elevated blood sugar pose much of a risk to longevity -- certainly not enough to warrant the aggressive drug treatment often offered for them. The same goes for the extra 20 pounds that make you overweight but not obese, and the modest elevations in serum cholesterol that, these days, spell a statin drug for life for many healthy people.
 He deplores the careful attention we pay to the state of our coronary arteries. Angioplasties, stents, coronary artery bypass grafts -- all these procedures, he writes, ''should be consigned to the annals of good ideas that proved bad.''
 As for the screening that purportedly keeps us safe from cancer, mammography and the blood test for prostate cancer are, in his view, blunt cudgels that can harm as much as help. Nor does he want any part of routine colonoscopies: ''Let my polyps go.''
 I had a good time imagining these two authorities chatting at a cocktail party. Dr. S. would be nibbling salmon, tuna or trout and sipping her single daily alcoholic beverage. Dr. H. would be eating and drinking whatever he pleased (''You are not what you eat'') . 
 She would describe her daily multivitamin regimen. He would discuss the ''enormous North American vitamin scam.'' She would declare that ''having ourselves checked on a regular basis is a vital step we must take.'' He would reply that an annual physical exam is ''entirely useless.'' She would tell the story of the time she felt ''bone weary and pooped'' for a few days and so had a C.T. angiogram of her coronary arteries. He would have an apoplectic fit.
 Yet, these two books do raise serious questions. Dr. Hadler articulates one of them. What exactly does it mean to be well? Is it complete freedom from pain, creaky joints, dyspepsia and sleepless nights? Or is it instead, as he suggests, the ability to cope with all these common physical problems without transforming oneself from person to patient?
 What are the cumulative psychic and economic tolls (on a person, and on a nation) of conflating discomfort and disease? 
 Hold on, Dr. Snyderman might counter. If even one life is saved by the standard medical rigmarole -- and that life could be yours -- is it not all worthwhile in the end?
 By now, it should be obvious why no one but me is likely to be reading both these books. You, reader, have undoubtedly already decided which author is a sage and which one a lunatic, which advice is sound, worthy of reading and re-reading, and which is simply misguided. 
 And that is the final thought-provoking lesson. Our health beliefs are so deeply ingrained that data, admonitions, guidelines and oceans of ink on reams of paper will seldom dissuade us from believing what we want to be true.

HEADLINE: U.S. Supreme Court Refuses To Hear Atlantic Yards Case

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
The United States Supreme Court on Monday declined to hear an appeal by about a dozen New York City property owners and tenants whose homes and businesses are scheduled to be taken over by the government and demolished to make way for the $4 billion Atlantic Yards project in Brooklyn. 
 The justices, without comment, refused to hear the plaintiffs' argument that the seizure of their property would violate the United States Constitution. (The court's case list indicated that Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. noted that he wanted to hear the case; such notations are common.) In February, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld a trial judge's dismissal of the landowners' and tenants' suit.
 However, the plaintiffs, including Daniel Goldstein, the leader of Develop Don't Destroy Brooklyn, which opposes the Atlantic Yards project, vowed to continue their legal fight by pursuing other arguments in the state courts.
 Matthew D. Brinckerhoff, the lawyer for the plaintiffs, said in a statement, ''We are, of course, disappointed that the court declined our request to hear this important case. This is not, however, a ruling on the merits of our claims. Our claims remain sound. New York State law, and the State Constitution, prohibit the government from taking private homes and businesses simply because a powerful developer demands it. Yet, that is what has happened.'' 
 Mr. Brinckerhoff said that he planned to file a different suit in New York State court.
 The plaintiffs noted that Monday was the third anniversary of an influential Supreme Court decision, in the case of Kelo v. City of New London, which affirmed the power to use eminent domain for private economic development.
 The Supreme Court's decision on Monday was a victory for the developer Bruce C. Ratner and for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who supports the project. The centerpiece of the $4 billion plan, which includes 16 high-rise office and apartment buildings, is a basketball arena intended to house the New Jersey Nets. Brooklyn has not had a professional major league sports team since the Dodgers left for Los Angeles in 1957. 
 Mr. Ratner, whose company was a development partner in the Midtown headquarters of The New York Times Company, said in a statement, ''We are gratified that the Supreme Court has decided to put an end to this lawsuit. The opponents have now lost 20 court decisions relating to Atlantic Yards, and we are now one step closer to making these benefits a reality for the borough and the city.'' 
 Lawyers for the mayor and other governmental defendants in the case argued that the project ''serves multiple undisputed purposes,'' including the transformation of blighted areas in Brooklyn. But, in fact, the area has already been rapidly gentrifying. Moreover, the faltering economy could slow down the construction of the project, doing what opponents of the project have so far failed to achieve in court.

HEADLINE: On Coach's Turf, Lagat Aims for Olympic Gold

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore. 

 BODY:
Sunset last Monday seemed to bring a perfect ending to a perfect day in what so far had been a perfect year. Bernard Lagat had just finished a nine-mile trail run as his coach, James Li, followed along on a bike. They had escaped the desert heat of Arizona for cool shade to train for the Olympic track and field trials. Then the evening calm was shattered, along with two windows of the rental car in which they had ridden.
 Smash-and-grabbers made off with Lagat's cellphone and his wallet, which contained several hundred dollars, his driver's license, his credit cards and his young son's Social Security card. By the time Li and Lagat called the police and canceled the credit cards, the thieves -- two men and a woman, according to witnesses -- had added $2,000 worth of charges.
 Lagat's wife would have to send his passport from Tucson. Otherwise, he would have no identification to get through airport security to fly home for a few days. 
 The next afternoon, Lagat, 33, and Li, 47, resumed training on a secure track at Nike headquarters in nearby Beaverton, two longtime associates planning for the Beijing Olympics, one leaving his past behind, the other returning to a homeland of unimaginable change.
 The Olympic trials open Friday in Eugene, Ore. Having won medals for Kenya at the 2000 and 2004 Summer Games, Lagat is now competing as a United States citizen. Undefeated in seven indoor and outdoor races this year, he is the reigning world champion at 1,500 meters and 5,000 meters and a gold-medal favorite in Beijing.
 Li is Lagat's personal coach and the associate head coach at the University of Arizona. He is also the manager of the United States Olympic men's track team. There may not be a more vital member of the entire delegation.
 A handsome, soft-spoken man, Li was born in China and educated at its most prestigious sports institute. Many of China's top sports officials are his peers. When no one from the United States could get a sneak peek inside Beijing's Olympic Stadium, Li knew whom to call. One of the stadium managers slept on a bunk above him for four years in college.
 ''I believe this is my time,'' said Li, who became a United States citizen in 1998.
 His own road to the Beijing Olympics has been as winding as the running trails here. Li came of age during China's Cultural Revolution, an attempt by Mao Zedong to purify the Communist Party and purge it of intellectuals, which resulted in violent disorder from the mid-1960s through the mid-1970s.
 As a schoolboy, Li remembers organizing ''struggle parties'' in which students attacked teachers, wrenching their arms behind their backs. He remembers his mother being jailed briefly, accused of being a counterrevolutionary. He remembers sports being dismissed as frivolous and the hunger he felt in his stomach at school and the restrictions that kept him from watching all but a handful of movies from the time that he was 6 until he was 16.
 ''It was crazy, like you were brainwashed,'' Li said.
 Criticism and Pride
 The changes in China since then -- the economic rise, the emerging openness -- seem almost beyond comprehension to him. He finds much to criticize about China's record on human rights, Li said, but he also feels proud that Beijing will host the Summer Games.
 ''You cannot argue that the Olympics are completely independent from politics; it never has been,'' Li said. ''But you cannot make an argument the other way, by saying that the Olympics should be all about politics, that because your ideology is not right, you cannot have them. How far are you going to go? Are we going to bar athletes from some countries whose ideology we don't like?
 ''The ideal of the Olympic Games is we are there, through sports, to promote exchange, understanding and good will among young people in the world, regardless of their ideology.''
 The son of a father who is a retired metallurgical engineer and a mother who is a retired sports official, Li became a top collegiate 800-meter runner while attending the Beijing Institute of Physical Education in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Still, his journey toward this moment began serendipitously.
 In 1984, after China ignored the Soviet boycott and competed at the Summer Games in Los Angeles, Li was asked to examine a resume that landed on his desk at the Sichuan Sports Institute in Chengdu, China. The resume belonged to John Chaplin, a renowned track and field coach from Washington State who had met Chinese officials during the Olympics and a cultural exchange at the university.
 ''I got picked purely by chance,'' said Li, then a young coach. ''No one around me spoke any English, and I spoke some.''
 When Chaplin went to China later in 1984 on a sports exchange program, his interpreter struggled with the term starting blocks. Li took over and apparently made a great first impression. By 1985, he was a graduate assistant on Chaplin's staff at Washington State.
 Four years later, Li was completing work on a doctorate and was scheduled to return to China. Again, his career took an unplanned detour when the bloody crackdown on students occurred in Tiananmen Square. Li was left dispirited, and decided to remain in the United States.
 ''In that political atmosphere, I felt I would not have the kind of future I would have liked professionally,'' Li said.
 In 1990, he became head track coach at Mankato State University in Minnesota, and returned to Washington State in 1994. He was always on the lookout for a great miler. Upon arriving in the United States, Li had become engrossed in the performance of Britain's Roger Bannister, who had run the first sub-four-minute mile three decades earlier, in 1954.
 Li had been so isolated in China that he had never heard of Bannister's achievement. Even if he had, the mile would have meant little in a country that used the metric system. He first learned of Bannister from a tape of a discontinued television series, ''Numero Uno,'' produced in 1982 by the documentary filmmaker Bud Greenspan.
 ''It became my great motivation,'' Li said. ''Man versus machine. What the human body could accomplish. Not just the physical aspect but the spiritual side of it.''
 Finally, his own star miler arrived at Washington State in 1996. A Kenyan runner there named Eric Kamau kept urging Li to recruit one of his friends, Bernard Lagat, known as Kip.
 ''He is so good, his stride is so beautiful,'' Kamau told Li. ''I wish I had his stride.''
 When Lagat arrived in the summer of 1996, though, a knee injury left him with a limping gait. For more than two months, he trained for no more than 20 minutes at a time, Li said, always at a pace above five minutes a mile. Then, in the Pacific-10 Conference cross-country championships that fall, Lagat finished a surprising seventh, demonstrating what Li came to believe was his most impressive quality -- he raced at an even higher level than he trained.
 ''When the big meets come, he delivers,'' Li said.
 At the 2000 Sydney Olympics, Lagat won a bronze medal at 1,500 meters for Kenya. At the 2004 Athens Olympics, he took silver. With Hicham el-Guerrouj of Morocco, the reigning Olympic champion and world-record holder, now retired, Lagat is favored to complete the medal set with a gold for the United States in Beijing.
 ''I don't think Kip would totally agree, but in 2004 I'm not sure he really thought he was going to beat el-Guerrouj,'' Li said. ''Winning the world championship last year gave him a lot of confidence. Hopefully, that will prove crucial.''
 Unconventional Success
 Together for 12 years, a rarity for a track star and a coach in the United States, Lagat and Li have built their relationship on candor, respect, professional distance and a willingness to challenge sporting conventions. Many distance runners train twice a day and run 125 or so miles a week. Lagat has maintained his health and sharpness by training once a day and running about 65 to 70 miles a week.
 ''If I've been able to do one thing, it is to liberate myself from what is written in a book,'' Li said.
 After Lagat won his double victory at the 2007 world track and field championships, Li was named USA Track & Field's coach of the year. Chinese officials then asked him to train Xing Huina, who won a gold medal in the women's 10,000 meters at the Athens Olympics, but now had dead legs. Li worked with her futilely for several months, discovering that she was severely overtrained.
 ''I cannot turn rocks into gold,'' he told Chinese authorities.
 Extreme training has been a hallmark in China since at least 1993, when female runners coached by Ma Junren gave startling and suspicious performances. They ran a marathon per day in training and supposedly gained endurance from eating turtle soup and caterpillar fungus.
 In 2000, Ma was discredited when he and six of his runners were removed from China's team for the Sydney Olympics, after the runners showed questionable results on blood tests. It was a sign that Chinese officials were willing to adhere to international standards as they sought to host the Olympics. In that light, Li said, it seems extremely unlikely that Chinese runners would again come out of nowhere to win gold medals in Beijing.
 ''They know they can't get away with what they did before,'' Li said, adding that he believed that whatever doping now occurred in China was not state-sponsored. ''I could not have said that 10 or 15 years ago.''
 China's most eagerly anticipated event in Beijing will be the men's 110-meter hurdles. A countryman, Liu Xiang, is the defending Olympic champion and was the world-record holder until Dayron Robles of Cuba lowered the mark earlier this month. There is so much pressure on Liu that he seems ''like a prisoner in his own country,'' Li said.
 A loss by Liu would leave China devastated, Li said, adding half-jokingly that he may want to go into hiding so he would not have to witness the fallout. ''Not because I don't want anybody to see me, but because I don't want to see the look on people's faces,'' Li said. ''They may set his house on fire or throw rocks at it.'' 
 His most recent trip to China was last month, for Olympics business and to check on his aging parents, who live about 50 miles from the epicenter of the country's devastating earthquake. For 48 hours after the quake struck, Li said, he panicked until he learned that they were O.K. and that their apartment building had survived intact.
 Compared with an earthquake, vandalism of a rental car and stolen credit cards were a relatively minor annoyance. Still, an agitated Lagat had not warmed down properly after his workout that day, and 24 hours later his calves felt sore. Li took notice and eased up slightly on the next workout. Lagat said it was what he appreciated most about his coach.
 ''He understands where you are coming from and is willing to make adjustments,'' Lagat said of Li. ''He doesn't carry that title of Dr. Li around in his head.''

HEADLINE: Doctors Say Medication Is Overused In Dementia

BYLINE: By LAURIE TARKAN

 BODY:
Ramona Lamascola thought she was losing her 88-year-old mother to dementia. Instead, she was losing her to overmedication.
 Last fall her mother, Theresa Lamascola, of the Bronx, suffering from anxiety and confusion, was put on the antipsychotic drug Risperdal. When she had trouble walking, her daughter took her to another doctor -- the younger Ms. Lamascola's own physician -- who found that she had unrecognized hypothyroidism, a disorder that can contribute to dementia.
 Theresa Lamascola was moved to a nursing home to get these problems under control. But things only got worse. ''My mother was screaming and out of it, drooling on herself and twitching,'' said Ms. Lamascola, a pediatric nurse. The psychiatrist in the nursing home stopped the Risperdal, which can cause twitching and vocal tics, and prescribed a sedative and two other antipsychotics.
 ''I knew the drugs were doing this to her,'' her daughter said. ''I told him to stop the medications and stay away from Mom.'' 
 Not until yet another doctor took Mrs. Lamascola off the drugs did she begin to improve.
 The use of antipsychotic drugs to tamp down the agitation, combative behavior and outbursts of dementia patients has soared, especially in the elderly. Sales of newer antipsychotics like Risperdal, Seroquel and Zyprexa totaled $13.1 billion in 2007, up from $4 billion in 2000, according to IMS Health, a health care information company. 
 Part of this increase can be traced to prescriptions in nursing homes. Researchers estimate that about a third of all nursing home patients have been given antipsychotic drugs. 
 The increases continue despite a drumbeat of bad publicity. A 2006 study of Alzheimer's patients found that for most patients, antipsychotics provided no significant improvement over placebos in treating aggression and delusions.
 In 2005, the Food and Drug Administration ordered that the newer drugs carry a ''black box'' label warning of an increased risk of death. Last week, the F.D.A. required a similar warning on the labels of older antipsychotics.
 The agency has not approved marketing of these drugs for older people with dementia, but they are commonly prescribed to these patients ''off label.'' Several states are suing the top sellers of antipsychotics on charges of false and misleading marketing.
 Ambre Morley, a spokeswoman for Janssen, the division of Johnson & Johnson that manufactures Risperdal, would not comment on the suits, but said: ''As with any medication, the prescribing of a medication is up to a physician. We only promote our products for F.D.A.-approved indications.''
 Nevertheless, many doctors say misuse of the drugs is widespread. ''These antipsychotics can be overused and abused,'' said Dr. Johnny Matson, a professor of psychology at Louisiana State University. ''And there's a lot of abuse going on in a lot of these places.''
 Dr. William D. Smucker, a member of the American Medical Directors Association, a group of health professionals who work in nursing homes, agreed. Though the group encourages doctors to conduct a thorough assessment and prescribe antipsychotics only as a last resort, he said, ''Many physicians are absent without leave in the nursing home and don't take an active role in the assessment of the patient.''
 Some nursing homes are trying a different approach, so-called environmental intervention. The strategies include reducing boredom, providing intellectual and physical stimulation, exercise, calming music, bringing in pets for therapy and improving how the staff approaches and talks to dementia patients.
 At the Margaret Teitz Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Queens, social workers do life reviews of patients to understand their interests, lifestyle and former occupations.
 ''I had a patient who used to be in fashion,'' said Nancy Goldwasser, the director of social services. ''So we got her fabric samples. And she'd sit and look through the books, touch the fabric, and it would calm her.'' 
 But such approaches are time consuming, they do not help all patients, they can be prohibitively expensive and they will be more difficult to provide as Alzheimer's continues to increase. 
 ''Our health care system isn't set up to address the mental, emotional and behavioral problems of the elderly,'' said Dr. Gary S. Moak, president of the American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry.
 Nursing homes are short staffed, and insurers do not generally pay for the attentive medical care and hands-on psychosocial therapy that advocates recommend. It is much easier to use sedatives and antipsychotics, despite their side effects.
 The first generation of antipsychotics, like Haldol, carry a significant risk of repetitive movement disorders and sedation. Second-generation antipsychotics, also called atypicals, are more commonly prescribed because the risk of movement disorders is lower. But they, too, can cause sedation, and they contribute to weight gain and diabetes.
 Used correctly, the drugs do have a role in treating some seriously demented patients, who may be incapacitated by paranoia or are self-destructive or violent. Taking the edge off the behavior can keep them safe and living at home, rather than in a nursing home.
 If patients are prescribed an antipsychotic, it should be a very low dose for the shortest period necessary, said Dr. Dillip V. Jeste, a professor of psychiatry and neuroscience at the University of California, San Diego.
 It may take a few weeks or months to control behavior. In many cases, the patient can then be weaned off of the drugs or kept at a very low dose.
 Some experts say another group of medications -- antidementia drugs like Aricept, Exalon and Menamda -- are underused. Research shows that 10 to 20 percent of Alzheimer's patients had noticeable positive responses to the drugs, and 40 percent more showed some cognitive improvement, even if it was not noticeable to an observer.
 ''Sometimes, it's enough to take the edge off the behavioral problems, so the family and patient can live with it and you don't expose people to much risk,'' said Dr. Gary J. Kennedy, director of geriatric psychiatry at the Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx.
 Other experts cite a lack of research backing these drugs for behavioral problems.
 If patients begin showing behavioral symptoms of dementia, doctors said, they should have complete medical and psychiatric workups first, especially if symptoms develop suddenly.
 ''Just because someone is 95 does not mean one should not do a workup, especially if she's been healthy,'' Dr. Kennedy said. 
 Common causes of the symptoms include ministrokes, reparable brain hemorrhage from a mild bump on the head, hypothyroidism, dehydration, malnourishment, depression and sleep disorders.
 Some doctors point out that simply paying attention to a nursing home patient can ease dementia symptoms. They note that in randomized trials of antipsychotic drugs for dementia, 30 to 60 percent of patients in the placebo groups improved.
 ''That's mind boggling,'' Dr. Jeste said. ''These severely demented patients are not responding to the power of suggestion. They're responding to the attention they get when they participate in a clinical trial. 
 ''They receive both T.L.C. and good general medical and humane care, which they did not receive until now. That's a sad commentary on the way we treat dementia patients.''
 To family members looking at a nursing home for an aging parent, experts recommend seeking out homes with low staff turnover, a high ratio of staff members to patients, and programs with psychosocial components.
 The Medicare Web site has basic information on individual homes at www.medicare.gov/NHcompare. The National Citizens' Coalition for Nursing Home Reform, at www.nccnhr.org, offers a consumer guide to choosing a nursing home.
 If medications are necessary, a family member should communicate with the prescribing doctor, learn the goal of each medication and be involved in making the decision. 
 Dr. Moak, of the psychiatry association, emphasized seeking out the doctor. Family members, he said, ''often speak through the nursing staff, and that's a huge mistake.'' 
 Family members who are not convinced that a relative is receiving the best care should get a second opinion, as Ramona Lamascola did.
 The physician she consulted, Dr. Kennedy of Montefiore, stopped her mother's antipsychotics and sedatives and prescribed Aricept.
 ''It's not clear whether it was getting her hypothyroid and other medical issues finally under control or getting rid of the offending medications,'' he said. ''But she had a miraculous turnaround.''
 Theresa Lamascola still has dementia, but she went from confinement in a wheelchair -- unable to sit still and screaming out in fear -- to being able to walk with help, sit peacefully, have some memory and ability to communicate, understand subtleties of conversations and even make jokes.
 Or, as her daughter put it, ''I got my mother back.''

HEADLINE: New York Sees Big Potential in a New Wave of Chinese Tourists

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS; Sarah Abruzzese contributed reporting.

 BODY:
''New York looks a lot like Shanghai,'' said Fu Jiang Li, 47, as he studied the bronze peace sculpture with its knotted gun barrel on United Nations Plaza. He should know, because that's where he's from. ''But China has only one Shanghai -- and America has so many big, modern cities.''
 Mr. Li, an air-conditioning engineer, was here on business, but he was having a look around, too -- and that put him at the leading edge of a growing wave of prosperous Asian tourists who may soon enough be posing before New York City's trophy monuments, trooping in and out of buses and megapixeling everything in sight. 
 While once Japanese tourists were ubiquitous in New York City, the oncoming wave of visitors is from mainland China. City officials, hospitality merchants and culture executives see them quite simply as the golden future: a rare growth sector in a cooling economy. 
 Last year Chinese travelers spent $2,204 per visit in New York City, in contrast to $1,807 for some 283,000 visitors from Japan, according to NYC & Company, the city's tourism and marketing bureau. Though the number of visitors from Japan dwarfs the 160,000 visitors from China, a new agreement between China and the United States has, as of last Tuesday, permitted travel agencies for the first time to offer packaged tours to New York and other American cities, tourism officials say. Since previously only business and government travelers were approved, the accord is likely to significantly increase the flow of visitors. 
 ''All the Chinese want to come here,'' said Charlie Shao, president of Galaxy Tours, which brought in 1,082 business tour groups with more than 10,000 Chinese last year. ''We think it will be a very big market and the airlines will need to fly very big jets.'' 
 George A. Fertitta, the chief executive of NYC & Company, put it this way: ''Chinese tourists could absolutely become the new Japanese tourists, in sheer numbers, in the excitement they bring to discovering New York, and in their interest in purchasing things.'' 
 Growth in the Chinese economy and the falling United States dollar -- it dropped 7 percent against Chinese currency last year -- have made New York a buyer's market for Chinese tourists, who have their eyes on luxury brands unavailable in China because of supply and import restrictions.
 So far, not every hotelier and restaurateur is saying ''women hui jiang zhongwen,'' the words for ''Chinese spoken here.'' ''But we're beginning to see welcome signs in Chinese all over the city,'' said Nils Cho, 59, a guide with Gray Line New York Sightseeing who leads tours in Mandarin. ''You used to see that only in Chinatown.'' 
 After a monument-to-monument morning, Xinmin Wu, 57, an economics editor at Workers' Daily in Beijing, said she felt very welcome in New York. This may have had something to do with her tour guide -- her 24-year-old daughter, Yixi Lin, who goes to college in Chicago and was translating. 
 ''There really aren't words to describe it,'' Mrs. Wu said of Manhattan. 
 Many Chinese tourists encountered in recent days at Rockefeller Center, the United Nations, the New York Stock Exchange and other landmarks declined to be interviewed. ''So many are very shy and conservative -- millionaires and party officials who don't want publicity,'' said Jane Soong, 46, a guide who also leads tours in Mandarin for Gray Line.
 Chinese tourists sightseeing in Manhattan often ask about the property values in the neighborhoods they pass through, Ms. Soong said. ''They'll ask, 'How much would that building cost?' And when I give them an estimate, sometimes they say, 'That's not so expensive.' '' 
 So far, few of the Chinese tourists speak English, Mr. Cho said, ''but they have all seen New York on television and they all want to go to Wall Street first, to see the stock exchange.'' 
 This was true of Jeanne Lin and her husband, Tony, who had arrived the previous night. ''We're jet-lagged,'' Mrs. Lin said. ''But we were awake for our first stop -- Wall Street!''
 But some of the trailblazers caution about future waves of tourists. ''There is a good side and a bad side to new tourists from China,'' said Zhonghua Shao, 47, an engineer from Shanghai who was touring New York with two business associates. ''Many more people will be able to learn about the United States, which will benefit from their visits. But some of them will not be as knowledgeable as the previous tourists, and they might be littering -- and spitting.''
 The Chinese government has already mounted an etiquette campaign for its tourists -- printed brochures and government admonitions on placards and in tourist tutorials to warn them against such transgressions as being too noisy, cutting lines or loud throat-clearing, activities it has also condemned at home.
 To capitalize on the opportunity China presents, which it hopes will be a growing component of the city's $28 billion tourism industry, NYC & Company established an office in Shanghai in June 2007. On Saturday night, Mr. Fertitta said, about 200 Chinese tourists and dignitaries were greeted at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in a reception hosted by NYC & Company. The Metropolitan already offers audio guides and gallery tours in Mandarin, ''and we see more and more Chinese in our galleries,'' said Harold Holzer, senior vice president for external affairs at the museum. 
 On Thursday night, 260 jet-lagged visitors were given a cruise on the Potomac River in Washington to publicize the arrival of the first tour groups from Beijing. They posed for snapshots with Mickey and Minnie Mouse, photographed jets flying from Ronald Reagan National Airport and flourished long shopping lists of brand-name purchases they were singling out at bargain prices. 
 The celebration was the consequence of a memorandum of agreement signed in December, when the China National Tourism Administration in Beijing and the United States Commerce Department announced that leisure travelers may come to the United States in groups.
 Only two decades ago, mainland Chinese were all but prevented from leaving the country as tourists. But since 1997, the government has increasingly permitted travel abroad, though only for business and government officials. Last year, 539,000 visitors arrived in the United States from China, according to the Commerce Department. 
 This was far fewer than the 3.5 million visitors who came from Japan last year. In 1986, more Japanese visited New York than tourists from any other country, but by 1992, those numbers began declining as Japan entered a long recession. 
 But the new entente is hardly a laissez-faire arrangement. During the Potomac event, Carlos M. Gutierrez, the commerce secretary, said of Chinese visitors who might try to remain illegally under the new travel rules, ''Our immigration laws are going to be applied as they are with everyone else.'' Some tour guides said that travel operators are keeping the passports of mainland Chinese visitors during their trips.
 According to a study by the Travel Industry Association, New York is the top destination for Chinese. ''There is a tremendous amount of curiosity about New York in China,'' said Fred Teng, a vice president of Sino Television Inc., which is producing a new television show about New York that will air in Shanghai. ''Chinese know about New York restaurants and museums.'' 
 Mr. Fertitta said that in Shanghai, ''we get a lot of questions about 'Sex and the City,' '' adding, ''It's not impossible to imagine tours in Mandarin of 'Sex and the City' locales.'' 
 The welcome mat has long been out in Manhattan's Chinatown. ''There are more English-speaking people in China today than the whole population of the United States and Canada combined, and only a fraction of them have seen New York,'' said Wellington Z. Chen, executive director of the Chinatown Partnership Local Development Corporation, a nonprofit community group. 
 When more Chinese visitors arrive, ''they will want to have a warm Chinese meal, and here is where they will come.''
 Charles Lai, executive director of the Museum of Chinese in America at 70 Mulberry Street, said, ''We are hoping that a knowledge of our 200-year history would be useful to Chinese visitors, and we're hoping for more of them.'' 
 He added: ''For two centuries there has been a flow of people, goods and ideas between China and the United States, and the complex set of interconnections has benefited each country. Whether the Chinese who came went back or not, almost all of them sent money, which helped to build China and helped create a middle class that could travel here.'' 
 These days, many wealthy Chinese tourists ''love to walk down Fifth Avenue, shopping Chanel and Cartier,'' Ms. Soong said. ''And they all know about Woodbury Commons,'' she added of the high-end shopping mall in Central Valley, N.Y. ''Sometimes they'd rather go there for a day than go sightseeing.''

HEADLINE: The Police and Tasers

 BODY:
New York Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly is eager to make the use of firearms a last resort for his officers. Now, based on a recommendation from the RAND Corporation, he and his top lieutenants are considering arming more New York police officers with a less lethal but still controversial weapon, the Taser. Mr. Kelly has concerns about the device, which delivers a jolt of electricity meant to temporarily incapacitate the target. He is right to move with caution. 
 In 2007, after a Queens man, Sean Bell, was killed by police fire, Mr. Kelly asked RAND to recommend ways to minimize police shooting. The study, released earlier this month, made several suggestions, including training police to avoid indiscriminate firing. The Taser proposal has attracted the most attention. 
 About 345,000 Tasers have been sold worldwide, according to the manufacturer, and a growing number of police departments have added Tasers to their arsenals or are considering them. About 500 are deployed here, and the RAND study suggested that the New York Police Department consider using more of them. The study also recommended caution since there was a dearth of reliable information about their effectiveness. 
 Tasers fire electrified darts from as far away as 35 feet to immobilize the target. Some New York police officers say the devices are useful in subduing suspects who are on drugs or are mentally disturbed. New York police officers encounter some 80,000 such situations in a year. 
 There are also risks. Tasers can seriously injure, and even kill, their targets. Amnesty International says Tasers have caused 300 fatalities around the world. A California court earlier this month found the device maker, Taser International, shared blame in one death, a rare legal defeat for the company.
 If more Tasers are deployed in New York City, strict conditions would have to be imposed on who could use them and under what circumstances. They might make sense as a last-resort alternative to lethal force, but it would be folly to allow them to be used in more routine situations like crowd control or policing political demonstrations. Nor should they be seen as the full answer to the problem of police shootings.
 The RAND report suggested beginning with a pilot program in a few precincts. Mr. Kelly should give the matter the most careful study before taking even this limited first step.

HEADLINE: Congress Plans to Tighten Rules on Energy Speculation

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Lawmakers continued to contend Monday that large investors are propping up oil prices, saying that speculation in crude futures has nearly doubled since 2000.
 Pension funds, Wall Street banks and other large investors that have no intention of taking delivery of fuel have increasingly pumped money into contracts for oil and other commodities as a hedge against inflation when the dollar falls. 
 After more than a half-dozen hearings in Congress, Democratic House lawmakers said they intended to tighten restrictions on pension funds, investment banks and other investors that they say are driving up fuel prices.
 Many Republicans, analysts and regulators, however, say soaring oil prices are a reflection of macroeconomic factors, including the falling dollar, unrest in the Middle East and increased demand from countries like China and India.
 Oil prices rose $1.38, to settle at $136.74 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange on Monday, on disappointment about Saudi Arabia's modest production increase and concerns that output from Nigeria will decline.
 ''Make no mistake about it, the excessive speculation in commodity markets is having a devastating effect at the gas pump that is rippling through our entire economy,'' said Representative Bart Stupak, Democrat of Michigan, who was chairman of the hearing of a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee.
 Representative Joe Barton, Republican of Texas, said insufficient supply is the main driver behind rising energy prices. He called for increased domestic production of oil, natural gas and coal.
 Speculators have increased their share of oil futures contracts on the Nymex to 71 percent this year, from 37 percent in 2000, according to figures released by Mr. Stupak's office. At the same time, contracts held by traditional oil users have fallen to less than 30 percent from more than 60 percent.
 But that figure substantially overstates the upward price pressure of those speculative positions. For example, that percentage counts swaps dealers who are in the market both as buyers, who push prices up, and as sellers, who push prices down.
 According to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the futures market positions of swaps dealers, as a whole, are almost exactly balanced between purchases and sales of crude oil. The agency also reported that speculative purchase positions are currently near the lowest levels seen over the last year.
 The percentage may also overstate the amount of actual speculation, because it includes swaps dealers acting for clients who are not speculating.
 House Democrats suggested a range of remedies, including higher margin requirements and stricter position limits.
 The acting chairman of the commission, Walter Lukken, cautioned lawmakers that higher margin requirements could drive traders out of the United States markets.

PERSON: John Kao 

HEADLINE: Where the Whole Agenda Is Innovation

BYLINE: By CORNELIA DEAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
John Kao's ''non-career career'' began with the study of philosophy and social science at Yale and a summer as a keyboardist with Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention. Then there was Yale Medical School and a psychiatry residency at Harvard, interrupted by a fellowship at Harvard Business School that turned into 14 years of teaching about the integration of science, technology and entrepreneurship.
 This too was interrupted, by stints as a producer (and Tony nominee) for ''Golden Child,'' the David Henry Hwang play about tradition and change in China, and production work on films like ''Mr. Baseball'' and ''Sex, Lies and Videotape.'' 
 In 1997, he moved to San Francisco where, from an office in the Presidio, he advises corporations and governments on the subject that he now believes ties his life together: innovation. 
 He spoke here last month at a forum organized by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, where he was described as ''an evangelist for a national innovation agenda,'' the goal he advocates in a new book, ''Innovation Nation'' (Free Press, 2007). Reviewers have praised it as both insightful and ''scary.'' His ideas are further summed up in what he calls his ''little orange book,'' a pocket-size, 28-page manifesto he hands out freely to people who express an interest in his work. 
 He told attendees at the forum that innovation requires a rapprochement between science and policy, ''impresarios'' who can link scientific talent and capital, and an ability to integrate existing technologies so they can be used together in new and productive ways. 
 He is far from alone in calling for this kind of focus. In May the National Academy of Sciences issued a collection of studies, ''Innovation in Global Industries,'' an analysis of innovation in several important industries. In April the Brookings Institution produced a report, ''Boosting Productivity, Innovation and Growth Through an Innovation Foundation.'' And in March the British government issued its own assessment, also called ''Innovation Nation.'' 
 ''His theme resonates with what we are seeing in much of the rest of the scientific community,'' Alan I. Leshner, chief executive of the A.A.A.S., said in an e-mail message. ''There is a lot of competition around the world as more and more countries realize that investing in science fuels innovation over the long term and leads to economic growth.''
 At the A.A.A.S. meeting, however, some people wondered what kind of links could be forged between formal research policies and an activity as chaotic as innovation. ''Should it be let's see what bubbles up or do we need to have a more focused policy?'' one questioner asked him. Dr. Kao replied that unfortunately, there is no ''three-ring binder'' with instructions for integrating research policy with innovation policy. 
 But, he added in an interview after his talk, ''we have been under the impression that we could do pretty much anything or that we did not need a strategy or that our strategy was not to have a strategy. None of these approaches is particularly viable in the current era.''
 His book outlines several problems that hinder innovation in the United States, including immigration policies that restrict the entry of scientifically and technically adept foreigners, even as our home-grown science workforce ages; unhelpful restrictions on access to intellectual property; and an infrastructure that is decrepit, obsolete or, as with broadband, unavailable to many people.
 Without action, he said, ''we will have an elite class of educated, cosmopolitan, global citizens who have a ticket of entry to the major leagues,'' he said, ''and a much larger group of marginally employable people who have been sold a bill of goods by a consumption economy.''
 Innovation is his key for understanding his own work, which he said he had long viewed as a series of disparate episodes, not a career arc. ''It is only in the last 10 or 15 years that it's become clear to me that I was filling out a pattern,'' he said. ''The pattern allows me to do what I am doing now.''
 Dr. Kao, who is 57, was born in Chicago to parents who came from China for graduate study at Northwestern. Growing up in Garden City, N.Y., ''I'd wake up in a Confucian house and go to an American elementary school and play baseball and go back to the Chinese house,'' he recalled. ''I had to figure out how to balance two very different cultural references.''
 A serious student of piano, he continued music studies at Yale, where a professor introduced him to Frank Zappa. Dr. Kao recalled telling Zappa he ''revered'' his work and wanted a spot in his band. After an audition (''He asked me to improvise a waltz, but in the style of late Stravinsky'') and despite his parents' worries, the young keyboardist took to the road with the Mothers of Invention, until the Vietnam War and a low draft number sent him back to a sophomore year in New Haven.
 Responding to ''some family pressure,'' he entered Yale Medical School, but during his psychiatry residency at Harvard, he said, he realized that clinical or academic medicine held little appeal. So he obtained a fellowship to Harvard business school to study the industry of medicine.
 ''What I had learned about behavior and the cognitive realm was incredibly relevant,'' he said. Before long he had written dozens of the kinds of case studies that are the basis of the school's teaching and had organized a course on entrepreneurship, creativity and organizations. 
 Many of his cases were about failures -- individuals under pressure, partnerships unraveling, learning through trial and error and so on. Today, Dr. Kao says failure's relative lack of stigma is ''a unique aspect of U.S. culture'' that does not exist even in countries like Singapore or Finland, both clients and both, he said, ''relatively hip.''
 ''There's a saying in Silicon Valley,'' he said. ''If you haven't gone bankrupt a couple of times you are not trying hard enough. It's part of our national advantage.''
 And though he abandoned psychiatry, its ''mental framework'' pervades his work today, he said, even if his clients do not realize it. ''It goes into the way I think about things,'' he said. ''It's a kind of environmental sense of what it is like when you go into a company and there are certain kinds of decor in the lobby or the receptionist treats you in a certain way. Everything becomes text.''
 He helped found BioSurface Technology, a company that commercialized technology for growing skin cells for use in treating burns and was bought by Genzyme Corporation. This project had obvious ties to his theorizing. ''I got to practice a little of what I preach,'' he said. But he credits the theater and film ventures for offering useful insights into the management of creativity.
 For example, he said, the head of a movie studio defines and defends standards of quality, chooses projects, draws talent to the enterprise, runs interference ''and then gets out of the way'' until it is time to count the profits. A successful manager of innovation does much the same. 
 Today, he and his wife, Lauren, live in San Francisco with their three young children, and he preaches his message of innovation to audiences like that at the A.A.A.S. forum. Often, he said, it is a hard sell. ''Many people believe there is no problem because we are No. 1,'' he said. As long as there is ''no current pain,'' he said, advocating for an innovation agenda is like advising patients to eat a healthier diet, exercise and stop smoking. 
 He said that might explain the inability of a group of eminent scientists to interest presidential candidates in a debate on science issues, ''The conclusion I drew was it was not deemed important in drawing votes,'' Dr. Kao said. But, he said, he hoped the next presidential administration would draw together scientists, business leaders, designers and others and ask them to produce a practical agenda for improving innovation. ''And I would lock the door and make them work on it,'' he said. 
 The United States is never going to lead in areas like low-cost production, he said, but it can be a dynamo for devising new technologies and combining existing technologies in new ways.
 ''The world needs us, even if it does not believe it,'' he said. ''I don't believe in this 'post-America' world at all.''

HEADLINE: Wounds You Can't See

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
The U.S. has been at war for years now, but ordinary Americans have never been asked to step up and make the kind of sacrifices that wars have historically required.
 There is no draft. There are no shortages of food, consumer items or gasoline. We're not even paying for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. That multitrillion-dollar obligation has been shoved off to future generations. Incredibly, taxes have been lowered, not raised, since the wars began.
 On the home front, this is as pleasant a wartime environment as one could imagine. 
 That's actually an added danger for the young men and women who have volunteered to fight in those far-off lands. It's too easy for the larger society to put them out of sight and out of mind. I asked a college student in Bridgeport, Conn., the other night if she or her friends ever talked about the war in Iraq. She said no.
 Among the least-noted aspects of these two seemingly endless wars is the psychological toll they are taking on those who have volunteered to fight them. Increasingly, they are being medicated on the battlefield, and many thousands are returning with brain damage and psychological wounds that cause tremendous suffering and have the potential to alter their lives forever.
 A recent article that I thought would have gotten much more attention was the cover piece in Time magazine, ''The Military's Secret Weapon,'' which disclosed that ''for the first time in history, a sizable and growing number of U.S. combat troops are taking daily doses of antidepressants to calm nerves strained by repeated and lengthy tours in Iraq and Afghanistan.''
 Soldiers and marines are being sent into the war zones again and again because the pool of young people willing to join up and fight is so small. In addition to the obvious physical danger, repeated tours in combat are blueprints for psychological disaster.
 A study by the RAND Corporation found that the psychological toll of deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan may in fact be ''disproportionately high compared to the physical injuries of combat.''
 Post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injuries, major depression and suicide are exacting a fearful price from combat soldiers and marines. These matters are not even being talked about enough, much less dealt with adequately.
 Never before has such a strain been placed on the all-volunteer military. As the RAND study noted:
 ''Not only is a higher proportion of the armed forces being deployed, but deployments have been longer, redeployment to combat has been common, and breaks between deployments have been infrequent.''
 While most service members readjust to civilian life successfully after combat, the number who come home in some kind of psychological trouble is huge. The study found that approximately 300,000 individuals who served in Iraq or Afghanistan are currently suffering from P.T.S.D. or depression, and that 320,000 have most likely experienced a traumatic brain injury.
 These wounds, as the title of the report points out, are often the ''Invisible Wounds of War.'' They're as real as a bullet or a shrapnel wound, but they're not always as obvious. And for a variety of reasons, including the fear that exposure may harm their careers, many of these psychologically wounded warriors do not seek mental-health treatment.
 Studies have shown that fewer than half of the G.I.'s with psychological wounds of one sort or another are receiving treatment. And according to the RAND study, ''Even when individuals receive care, too few receive quality care.''
 Support the troops? Too often that's an empty slogan. Flag waving and bumper-sticker patriotism don't add up to much when there are many thousands of G.I.'s in need of first-class care who are not getting it. 
 ''This should be a top issue in the presidential race, and it should be a top issue in the news,'' said Paul Rieckhoff, executive director of the advocacy group Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. ''When you come home from Iraq, you feel like you're lost in the wilderness sometimes. You feel like you don't fit in.''
 Add to that burden the mental torture of depression or P.T.S.D. or the debilitating effects of traumatic brain injury, and you have the stuff that leads to alcoholism, drug abuse, family dissolution, homelessness, trouble with the law and sometimes suicide.
 ''The hardest part is getting the veterans in,'' said Mr. Rieckhoff. ''We have to make it much easier for them to access mental health services.''
 However one feels about the nation's war policies, we have an ironclad obligation to look out for the short- and long-term needs of the troops we send off to combat. In the absence of any general call for sacrifice, it's the least we can do.
 Right now we're not even doing that.

HEADLINE: Confronting Inflation On Separate Continents

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY

DATELINE: FRANKFURT 

 BODY:
In the view of a central banker, the worst thing about skyrocketing food and energy prices is not their rise, but that most people think higher prices are here to stay. 
 Both the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve are concerned that a psychology of inflation is setting in -- that consumers expect the long run of rising prices, something not seen since the 1970s, to continue. 
 Current rates of inflation are 3.7 percent in the year through May in Europe and 4.2 percent in the United States. If investors, executives and workers decide that the higher rates will remain, they will begin to bid up prices, wages and interest rates for the day-to-day lending that lubricates the economy. 
 ''They can't change current prices,'' Jacques Cailloux, chief European economist at Royal Bank of Scotland in London, said of the central bankers. ''What they are pretty convinced that they can do is dampen inflation expectations.'' 
 The European bank appears to be taking the lead in fighting the trend, and is likely to raise interest rates next week despite reports on Monday showing that growth prospects in Europe had slowed further. The Fed has also signaled that it will consider raising rates after cutting them as the American economy headed into a slowdown. 
 For much of the last year, central banks have played a wait-and-see game, betting that commodity prices, particularly oil, could rise sharply without setting off price increases. 
 But airlines have imposed fuel surcharges on tickets as oil neared the $140-a-barrel level. And companies that use crude oil as a raw material, like the giant multinational company Dow Chemical, have raised prices. 
 In Europe, unions, riled by the impact of high fuel prices on members' pocketbooks, are asking for higher wages, a cost that could be passed on to consumers. Because unions are much stronger in Europe than in the United States, the trend distinguishes the task of the European bank from that of the Fed, where worries are dominated by an economy flirting with recession.
 Lufthansa's employees are demanding a 9.8 percent increase in wages. In Britain, though it is not a part of the euro area, 600,000 British government workers voted Monday to strike over contract offers that did not reflect the rising cost of living. 
 After the experience of the 1970s, in which inflation seemed to spin out of control, central banks searched for early warning indicators that would signal when an inflationary psychology was taking hold. Economists responded with data intended to show what people were thinking. 
 One measure is the premium that bond investors demand to compensate for the risk of inflation over the life of the security. In Europe, markets have embedded an inflation premium in 10-year bonds. 
 That premium has risen in recent months to 2.5 percent, the highest level since the birth of the euro in 1999, according to Barclays, and above the central bank's inflation goal of less than 2 percent. 
 In the United States, the picture has been similar, with bond market indicators edging notably higher. A survey closely watched by the Fed, a University of Michigan poll of consumers, showed that inflation expectations in May rose to the highest level since February 1982. 
 The European bank president, Jean-Claude Trichet, cited inflation expectations as the main reason the bank would probably raise rates at its meeting July 3. 
 ''We have to be credible in this delivery of price stability,'' Mr. Trichet said, ''and that is the reason why we insist so strongly on inflationary expectations remaining well anchored.'' 
 Mr. Trichet hinted at one rate increase, by a quarter of a percentage point, to 4.25 percent, in July. Other officials have since damped speculation of a series of increases, and the European bank appears to be betting on a kind of psychological shock to financial markets -- a slap in the face to warn of more if inflation expectations do not subside. 
 ''What you want to do right now is short-circuit the transmission of these prices increases into future increases,'' Mr. Cailloux, the bank economist, said. 
 The shift in tone in Europe may already be having an effect in the United States, analysts said. With financial markets so tightly integrated, the expectations of higher inflation move quickly between the two continents. That is pressuring the Fed to confront the issue despite a slowdown. 
 Members of the Federal Reserve Bank ''are being pulled along in this process,'' said Ethan Harris, chief United States economist with Lehman Brothers in New York. ''I think they are reluctant to raise interest rates, but it is hard with such hawkish rhetoric from the E.C.B. and other Fed officials.'' 
 When Mr. Trichet talked about raising borrowing costs in early June, the euro strengthened. That pushed the dollar lower just as the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, and the Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., appeared to reverse their long-standing tolerance of a weak dollar, which had helped prop up American exports. 
 A slowing American economy can curb inflation as mounting job losses cut overall demand and limit companies' ability to raise prices. But if that does not cool inflation, the Fed will be in a bind.

HEADLINE: G.M. Plans Sale to Trim Inventory

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY and BILL VLASIC

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
General Motors, which has struggled to stop depending on big discounts to draw in customers, is pulling the sale banners out again.
 G. M. said on Monday that it would offer long-term, no-interest loans on most models through June 30. That is the last day of a dismal second quarter in which gasoline prices soared to $4 a gallon and dealer showrooms emptied out.
 In announcing the sales blitz, G. M. also said it would cut production of slow-selling pickups and S.U.V.'s by an additional 170,000 vehicles this year and increase by about 50,000 its output of fuel-efficient cars and crossovers, which are in short supply at many dealerships. 
 It was the second time this month that G. M. has announced plans to build fewer trucks and more small cars. The Ford Motor Company made a similar announcement a few days earlier.
 G. M. also said it would raise prices on 2009 models by an average of 3.5 percent to compensate for lower sales volumes and higher material costs.
 G. M.'s no-interest financing offers, which are good on loans of up to six years, begins Tuesday. 
 Inventories of trucks made by all of the automakers are piling up. G. M. had a 104-day supply of the half-ton Chevrolet Silverado in stock, and Nissan had a 132-day supply of its full-size pickup, the Titan, a record high, according to Edmunds.com
 ''We're really just trying to spark the market.'' said Mark LaNeve, G. M.'s vice president for North American sales and marketing.
 But Mr. LaNeve, though optimistic about how consumers will respond to G. M.'s new offer, conceded that such sales might not work as well in today's market as they had in the past, with fuel efficiency foremost in the minds of shoppers who used to focus on their monthly loan payment amount. Three years ago, the Detroit automakers generated huge demand by offering ''employee pricing'' discounts to everyone.
 Ford this month started an ''employee pricing'' sale on its F-series pickup truck after the Honda Civic displaced the F-series line to become the country's top-selling model in May. (The F-series, which had been the top seller on an annual basis for 26 consecutive years, was fifth last month.)
 Yet the F-series sale has not done enough to thin bloated inventories of the trucks, prompting Ford to delay the introduction of its new F-150 truck by two months to give dealers more time to sell off the current version.
 Analysts say G. M. has little choice but to try the sale strategy. J. D. Power & Associates estimates that overall industry sales through the first three weeks of June were equal to an annual rate of 12.5 million vehicles, making it the worst month in 15 years.
 ''I think it's the smart thing to do right now,'' said David Healy of Burnham Securities. ''They have to clean out these inventories. I think it will help. The fact that they have raised the prices on the 2009 models is a motivation for consumers to take advantage of these zero-interest deals.''
 G. M. is excluding some fast-selling models from its ''72-hour sale'' (most dealers are open for a total of about 72 hours during the seven days that the offers are available) including the Chevrolet Aveo, Cobalt and Malibu. 
 In past sales, those same models were among those that G. M. tried to clear out because they were slow sellers otherwise. But now their high fuel-economy ratings, along with a redesign for the Malibu, have made them far more desirable.
 Mr. LaNeve said he hoped that the market would improve toward the end of the year, although he said he did not believe it could recover as much as he once thought. He acknowledged that he was wrong in thinking that a recovery would have begun by now.
 ''I do believe,'' he said, ''at least we hope -- that Q2 was the bottom.''

HEADLINE: Rights Groups Assail U.S. for Withholding Aid to Haiti, Citing Political Motives

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY

 BODY:
An array of human rights groups has strongly criticized the United States government, saying it withheld money meant to provide clean drinking water to Haiti as leverage for political change in the country. 
 The activists, in a report released Monday, called the delay of $54 million in international loans to the Haitian government ''one of the most egregious examples of malfeasance by the United States in recent years.''
 The loans from the Inter-American Development Bank were intended to revamp the water and sanitation systems in Les Cayes and Port-de-Paix, two Haitian towns in dire need of the money to improve their infrastructure. Nearly 70 percent of Haitians lack regular and direct access to potable water, experts say. The lack of clean water contributes to intestinal parasites and amoebic dysentery.
 The development bank, over which the United States Treasury Department holds significant influence, approved the loans in 1998. Although payments began to be made several years later, the water projects have yet to be started, the report said, ''largely the result of aggressive attempts by the U.S. government to block the disbursement of these loans.'' 
 Haiti's own political turmoil and financial difficulties also contributed to the delays, the report acknowledged.
 The report was prepared by the Center for Human Rights and Global Justice at the New York University School of Law; Partners in Health, a Boston-based health care provider that does work in Haiti and other impoverished countries; and the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Center for Human Rights.
 The groups went to court to gain access to internal government correspondence saying why the United States sought to prevent the approved loans from reaching Haiti in the years after their approval. The Inter-American Development Bank's charter states that the bank should not interfere in the political affairs of member countries. 
 But the delays in disbursing the loans were linked by American officials to their concerns about the administration of Jean-Bertrand Aristide, whose first presidency was overthrown by a military coup in 1991 and whose return to power in 2001 was cut short three years later with the encouragement of the Bush administration.
 Dean Curran, who was the American ambassador to Haiti at the time, said publicly in 2001, ''There now are a certain number of loans of the Inter-American Development Bank that are not yet disbursed with the objective of trying to request of the protagonists of the current situation, in the current political crisis, to reach a compromise.''
 A top Treasury Department official then sent an e-mail message to staff members that called it a ''major screw-up'' for the ambassador to explicitly acknowledge a connection between the holdup in development loans and American political concerns in Haiti.
 A Treasury Department spokeswoman, Brookly McLaughlin, said on Monday that she had not yet seen a copy of the report but that the United States government and other international agencies had played a major financial role in the development of Haiti.

HEADLINE: How to Be a Leader in the Field From Two Leaders on the Field

BYLINE: By VINCENT M. MALLOZZI

DATELINE: PURCHASE, N.Y. 

 BODY:
In the cafeteria at the headquarters of MasterCard on Monday morning, Peyton and Archie Manning were the hottest items on the menu.
 Peyton, the Indianapolis Colts' quarterback, and his father, Archie, a former N.F.L. quarterback, huddled with nearly 3,000 MasterCard employees -- most of them watching via live Web cast -- to discuss leadership qualities and what it takes to become a champion. 
 Peyton, whose Colts won the 2007 Super Bowl, and Archie, a star who played a majority of his career with the New Orleans Saints, spoke to a crowd of about 400 that included everyone from the mailroom clerk to the chief executive. Some 2,500 others watched the two on the Web from MasterCard offices around the world, including England, France, China, Japan, Brazil, Singapore and Dubai. 
 ''I'm a quarterback, and I have my coaches,'' Peyton Manning said before his company pep talk. ''But really, on the field, the coaches can't be in the huddle and the quarterback is responsible for coaching and encouraging and trying to be the leader out there, so there are certainly a lot of connections you can make between the football field and the business world, especially during these tough economic times, when leaders have to step forward, step up their games and get the people around them to elevate their games.''
 In a role normally reserved for business and scholarly types -- past speakers have included Bill George, author of the book ''True North'' and the former chief executive of the medical technology company Medtronic; and Dr. Daniel Goleman, an author and former New York Times reporter -- the Mannings created the kind of buzz that a football Sunday can generate.
 ''I went into the cafeteria earlier and the summer interns were already there,'' said Gary Flood, president of MasterCard's products and services group. ''I didn't think they were going to leave because those seats are very valuable, but I guess they must have closed the cafeteria and forced them to go back to work for a while.'' 
 The Mannings did not disappoint, wowing the business crowd for an hour by offering them advice on how to succeed in business through stories of their football family's rise to greatness. Archie, who declined to be interviewed Monday, is also the father of Eli Manning, who led the Giants to an improbable Super Bowl victory over the heavily favored New England Patriots in February.
 ''I thought they were incredible,'' said Samantha Ross Saperstein, a senior vice president. ''I particularly liked Peyton talking about having to be flexible when it comes to being a leader. As a younger player, he had to establish leadership qualities by being strong, yet humble. As an older player, he had to recognize the strengths and weaknesses of the players around him and address those weaknesses in order to make the team better.'' 
 Steve Borzoni, a 34-year-old director in the product services group, was most impressed with the Mannings' formula for putting together a championship team: find men of good character, no matter size or stature, who are willing to give 100 percent.
 ''It's a great pearl of wisdom from a couple of football legends,'' Borzoni said. ''It's very similar to the way we do business here.'' 
 Peyton Manning, who called Eli's Giants ''the team everyone will be chasing this season, the way they chased us the season before,'' said that ''my father and I have a lot of experience between the two of us.''
 ''We have no earth-shattering secrets, but we do enjoy sharing our thoughts with people in the hope of motivating them to the point where they can go back to work and help their respective departments play their A game. 
 ''It's easy to be a leader when things are great,'' he continued. ''But when times are tough, when it's gut-check time, those are the times when real leaders need to step up.''

HEADLINE: Legislators Raise Pay, and a Governor Pays the Price

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS 

 BODY:
The reformist image of Gov. Bobby Jindal, considered by Republicans a top potential vice-presidential choice, has recently taken a beating after Mr. Jindal refused to veto a sizable pay increase that Louisiana legislators voted for themselves this month. 
 The increase would more than double the salary of the part-time legislators effective July 8, to $37,500 from $16,800, with considerably more money available once expenses are added in. It has touched a nerve in this impoverished state. 
 Conservative talk-radio show hosts and bloggers have denounced it, newspaper editorials have inveighed against it -- The Times-Picayune of New Orleans called the increase ''greedy'' and its main proponent ''shameless'' -- and the legislators themselves received floods of e-mail messages from angry constituents. 
 More confounding to many citizens here than the action by the lawmakers is the inaction of Governor Jindal, who came into office this year with promises to overhaul Louisiana's reputation for dubious ethics. 
 During his election campaign, he vowed to prohibit legislative pay raises. Once elected, he quickly pushed through a package of measures increasing the Legislature's transparency and stamping out conflicts of interest, basking in the subsequent glow of his image as a youthful Ivy League reformer doing battle in a shady subtropical outpost. 
 That image and his solid standing with the religious right helped propel Mr. Jindal, a 37-year-old former Rhodes scholar, into the front ranks of Senator John McCain's possible running-mate choices. But now some conservative critics are saying the pay-increase episode demonstrates weakness as well as Mr. Jindal's unreadiness for the prime time of the vice presidency. 
 ''This pay raise is devastating him,'' said Moon Griffon, a conservative talk-radio host with a wide following in northern Louisiana, the most Republican and evangelical part of the state. ''I've gotten over 5,000 e-mails from people who say they voted for him, and who say they would never vote for him again.'' 
 Mr. Griffon added, ''People don't like hypocrisy, and they like somebody with guts.''
 The legislative session ended Monday, and Mr. Jindal now has two weeks to veto the pay increase, though he has given no indication that he will do so. 
 Even while denouncing the money lawmakers are giving themselves, the governor has tried to depict the matter as an internal legislative affair that does not require his meddling.
 ''I will keep my pledge to let them govern themselves,'' the governor said in a statement last week after the State Senate passed the increase, backing off a rejection of the raise, though he also said he was ''very sorry'' about it. Editorialists and radio show hosts have since had a field day juxtaposing that ''pledge'' to the Legislature with the promise Mr. Jindal made when he was running last fall to ''prohibit legislators from giving themselves pay raises.''
 Jim Brandt, president of the Public Affairs Research Council of Louisiana, an independent good-government research organization in Baton Rouge, said voters did not appreciate a broken pledge. 
 ''It puts a real dent in any sort of reform credential of either the governor or the Legislature,'' Mr. Brandt said. 
 That theme of perceived weakness is echoed by other political experts. 
 ''No matter where I go, they certainly are disappointed, and they are using some very unkind words related to his spine,'' said Bernie Pinsonat, a pollster in Baton Rouge. ''It's pretty ferocious.'' He added, ''I'm quite positive his base is very upset with him.''
 The legislators have not had a base pay increase since 1980 and complain that with the governor frequently calling them into special session, their job is no longer part-time. The increase would put salaries in the upper tier for similar part-time legislatures, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
 Mr. Brandt agreed that some sort of modest raise could be justified -- an independent commission recommended a 12 percent increase several years ago -- but said the 123 percent rise, with additional increases pegged to inflation, was ''problematic.'' 
 Mr. Jindal's strategy was apparently based on a desire not to jeopardize the other elements he won in his legislative wish list, like a voucher program for private schools in New Orleans, or restoring spending cuts made by fiscal conservatives in the Capitol. 
 ''He was not about to give the Legislature any excuse to block his reform agenda,'' said the governor's spokeswoman, Melissa Sellers, adding: ''The governor has opposed the legislative pay increase loudly every step of the way.''
 But the furor over the pay raise has put in the shadows the rest of his program, and other bills pushed by conservatives sympathetic to him, like one the Legislature overwhelmingly approved allowing science teachers to use ''supplemental'' material that critics say is merely a stalking-horse for teaching creationism.

HEADLINE: Scores in Reading and Math Rise Sharply Across the State

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA; Robert Gebeloff and Elissa Gootman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Reading and math scores for New York students in grades three through eight showed extraordinary gains across the state since last year, with particularly striking leaps in the large urban areas, including New York City. 
 The gains were apparent for nearly every grade tested in both subjects, in some cases with double-digit increases in the percentage of students performing at grade level or above, according to the scores on the annual statewide exams released by education officials on Monday.
 The improvements were so substantial that several education experts expressed skepticism, noting that large gains were posted even by cities like Buffalo, whose schools have struggled for years. 
 They also said the statewide results were not in line with the relatively static performance of New York students in the most recent years on federal tests known as the nation's report card. 
 In New York City, this year's results had an added significance for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who has staked his legacy on improving the city's public schools and is likely to use the gains to argue next year that the State Legislature should reauthorize the law giving the mayor control of the schools.
 The scores also will affect nearly every level of the system, with teachers and principals eligible for financial bonuses based on test results, and individual schools assigned letter grades based on student improvement. 
 Across New York State, 81 percent of students tested were at or above grade level in math, up from 73 percent last year, state education officials said. In reading, which has proved more difficult to improve, about 69 percent of students met or exceeded state standards for their grade level, up from 63 percent last year. 
 At a news conference in Albany, the state education commissioner, Richard P. Mills, called the results ''encouraging and exciting,'' saying they were evidence that the state's emphasis on giving more money to poorer school districts and focusing on high standards was successful. ''The schools have delivered,'' he said. 
 The results in New York City have climbed steadily in the last two years. This year, 57.6 percent of students performed at or above grade level in reading, up from 50.7 percent in 2006, and 74.3 percent did so in math, up from 57 percent two years ago. 
 At Public School 175 in Harlem, Mr. Bloomberg declared that it was a ''wonderful day for New York'' and added that with a ''dramatic upward trend'' over the last six years, public schools in the city were now ''in a different league.''
 But the celebratory mood was tempered by the acknowledgment that 4 out of 10 students in the city were not reading at grade level. ''It's a time for celebration,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. ''It's also a clarion call to show what you can do, and to get us to be more determined and to get everybody behind us to keep going ahead and not to try to find out what's wrong, but to take what's obviously right and build on it.''
 But Andrew D. Ho, an assistant professor of educational statistics at the University of Iowa who has researched state and federal tests, said that while there was no question that students had improved substantially on New York's exams, such gains were not mirrored in the national tests. 
 ''They are on the order of what you might see in a 25-year trend on the national assessment,'' Mr. Ho said. ''Even the most pro-testing regime would have to admit there is a small component of inflation at the very least here.''
 Other critics raised questions about whether the tests were easier this year. Michael J. Petrilli, a researcher at the Thomas B. Fordham Institute in Washington, said patterns of significant gains ''can mean that they are teaching to the tests, and it's also certainly possible that the tests got easier.''
 Both Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Mills seemed to anticipate this kind of criticism. 
 Mr. Bloomberg emphasized the results over time, saying that the city had outpaced the rest of the state in improvement and that the gap in achievement between blacks and Latinos compared with whites had narrowed in the last several years.
 Mr. Mills said the testing system had been reviewed by the federal Department of Education and had also been vetted by a group of outside experts. State education officials also provided a letter from federal officials stating that New York had an ''assessment system that produces valid and reliable results.''
 ''For people who will say now that these results are going up, so it must be easier, look at the test yourself,'' he said.
 Mr. Mills also said the gains resulted from schools doing more to monitor student improvement throughout the year, like developing weekly tests or focusing on particular skills outlined in state standards.
 Despite the overall improvement, results varied widely at different grade levels. In seventh-grade reading, for example, 70 percent of students statewide performed at or above grade level this year, up from 57.8 percent last year. But in the eighth grade, 56.1 percent of students performed at or above grade level this year, slightly down from 57 percent last year. 
 Mr. Mills attributed the differences to the design of the tests, saying that in third, fifth and seventh grades, students were asked to answer more multiple-choice questions and give short written responses, rather than longer essays.
 There were similar differences in the city, where the percentage of seventh graders reading at or above grade level increased to 59.5 percent, from 45.4 percent last year. But in eighth grade, the percentage of students reading at grade level or above rose less than two points, to 43 percent from 41.8 percent. 
 The state also emphasized the decline in the level of students performing at the lowest levels, down to 4.1 percent in reading this year, compared with 8.1 percent in 2006. In math, the percentage of students at the lowest level dropped to 4.7 percent this year, from 11.1 percent in 2006.
 And while that pattern was also true in New York City, the percentage of students scoring at the highest level was far less drastic and, in fact, declined for the fifth, sixth and seventh grades in reading and in third-grade math.
 The city results were also inconsistent with the scores on the National Assessment of Educational Progress, given by the federal Department of Education. The federal scores, released late last year, showed little to no improvement in fourth-grade reading and eighth-grade math in both New York City and the state in the last several years. If the federal scores were stagnant, critics said, it seemed unlikely that the state scores would increase so much.
 Mr. Mills and Mr. Klein have both repeatedly said that the national test is less comprehensive because not all students are required to take it, and it is not aligned with state curriculums.
 But some education experts have suggested that national tests are important to provide a uniform standard and an independent assessment for states. 
 ''The difficulty of the test can bounce around from year to year naturally,'' Mr. Petrilli said. ''And certainly it is hard to do when the politics are that we want to see big improvements. When it's a state grading itself, there is always reason to be concerned.''

 2 U.S. SOLDIERS KILLED IN IRAQ,
 But Exact Details Are Disputed
 A security guard for an Iraqi politician grabbed his Kalashnikov automatic rifle and opened fire on at least a half-dozen American soldiers, killing two of them, during a meeting with Iraqi officials in a village southeast of Baghdad, an Iraqi official said. The gunman was killed in the firefight. Accounts were contradictory and the precise number of casualties was in dispute, but one witness was quoted by The Associated Press as saying that the assailant waited in his car for the Americans to emerge from a local council building.

 ARGENTINA'S ECONOMIC WOES GROW
 Argentina's Congress is expected to begin a thorny debate on an export tax issue that caused farmers to revolt more than three months ago. In a long-awaited concession, President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, her popularity plummeting in opinion polls, agreed to let Congress approve or reject the system of sliding export taxes she imposed in March. Still, the conflict has already struck a deep blow to Argentina's economy. PAGE A14 
 GROUPS ASSAIL U.S. OVER HAITI AID
 An array of human rights groups has strongly criticized the United States government, saying it withheld money meant to provide clean drinking water to Haiti as leverage for political change in the country. In a report, the activists called the delay of $54 million in international loans to the Haitian government ''one of the most egregious examples of malfeasance by the United States in recent years.''

 MEASURES ON IRAQ ARE FAULTED
 Beyond the declines in overall violence in Iraq, several crucial measures the Bush administration has been using to demonstrate economic, political and security progress are either plainly incorrect or far more mixed than the administration has acknowledged, according to a report by the Government Accountability Office. Over all, the report says, the American plan for creating a stable Iraq lacks a framework that meshes with the administration's stated goals, is falling out of touch with the realities on the ground and contains serious flaws in its operational guidelines.

 HOPES FADE IN FERRY RESCUE
 Hopes faded that more survivors would be found in what could be one of the Philippines's worst sea tragedies as rescuers failed to find signs of life inside a capsized ferry that had held more than 800 passengers and crew members when a typhoon struck. Rescue officials said only 57 survivors had been rescued, including 28 passengers and crew members who came ashore Monday after drifting at sea since Saturday. PAGE A14

 There's a lot of plurality in American religious life, and according to a new survey by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life, a lot of tolerance for that diversity, too.

Over a quarter have left the faith of their childhood to move to another faith -- or none at all. PAGE A15 
 A BLOW TO A RISING STAR'S IMAGE
 Members of the state legislature in Louisiana voted to double their pay this month, and the reformist image of Gov. Bobby Jindal -- considered a front-runner to be John McCain's running mate -- has taken a hit because of it. During his election campaign last year, Mr. Jindal vowed to prohibit legislative pay raises, and editorials and conservative talk radio hosts have been criticizing him for refusing to veto the measure. ''I'm quite positive his base is very upset with him,'' said a pollster in Baton Rouge. PAGE A21

 When Omar Shahid Khan, a senior at Tesoro High School in the tony enclave of Rancho Santa Margarita, Calif., asked school administrators for a copy of his transcript, they were shocked to see that his average grades had miraculously morphed into top marks. Now Mr. Khan and a friend, Tanvir Singh, have been arrested on charges that they embarked on a lengthy, high-tech effort to switch their C, D and F grades as well as those of 12 other friends to A's and A minuses.

 COURT OVERTURNS PENTAGON'S STANCE
 In the latest judicial setback to the Bush administration on Guantanamo policy, a federal appeals court ordered in a sealed ruling that a detainee be released or given a new military hearing.

 Amtrak is undertaking an around-the-clock, $83 million project over four days to replace a 90-year-old drawbridge across the Thames River in eastern Connecticut.

 A TAX BREAK LEADS TO WINDFALL
 For Many Major Corporations
 In an effort to entice some major American corporations to bring home some of the profits they had stashed overseas, Congress in 2004 offered companies a one-time holiday with a greatly reduced tax rate. And according to recent government data, that holiday resulted in a $265 billion windfall for 843 of the largest American corporations, as well as $18 billion into Treasury coffers that otherwise would have stayed overseas.

 CABLE CHANNELS GAIN ON BROADCAST
 Cable networks keep gaining on their broadcast rivals. Preliminary figures show that the cable networks will sell about $8 billion in airtime to advertisers this season compared to the broadcast networks, who sold about $9.1 billion to $9.2 billion. ''The natural shift of dollars to cable will continue,'' one expert said. ''It just makes sense. Why pay more for eyeballs on CBS when you can go out and buy eyeballs on Turner for half the price?''

HEADLINE: Government Study Criticizes Bush Administration's Measures of Progress in Iraq

BYLINE: By JAMES GLANZ

 BODY:
Beyond the declines in overall violence in Iraq, several crucial measures the Bush administration uses to demonstrate economic, political and security progress are either incorrect or far more mixed than the administration has acknowledged, according to a report released Monday by the Government Accountability Office.
 Over all, the report says, the American plan for a stable Iraq lacks a strategic framework that meshes with the administration's goals, is falling out of touch with the realities on the ground and contains serious flaws in its operational guidelines. 
 Newly declassified data in the report on countrywide attacks in May shows that increases in violence during March and April that were touched off by an Iraqi government assault on militias in Basra have given way to a calmer period. Numbers of daily attacks have been comparable to those earlier in the year, representing about a 70 percent decline since June 2007, the data shows.
 While those figures confirm the assessments by American military commanders that many of the security improvements that first became apparent last fall are still holding, a number of the figures that have been used to show broader progress in Iraq are either misleading or simply incorrect, the report says.
 Administration figures, according to the report, broadly overstate gains in some categories, including the readiness of the Iraqi Army, electricity production and how much money Iraq is spending on its reconstruction.
 And the security gains themselves rest in large part not on broad-scale advances in political and social reconciliation and a functioning Iraqi government, but on a few specific advances that remain fragile, the report says. The relatively calm period rests mostly on the American troop increase, a shaky cease-fire declared by militias loyal to the Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr, and an American-led program to pay former insurgents to help keep the peace, the report says.
 ''Clearly there are substantial changes in the security situation on the ground,'' said Nathan Freier, a retired Army officer who served in Iraq in 2005 and 2007 and is now a senior fellow in the international security program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
 The administration prefers to focus on those improvements, Mr. Freier said. But the accountability office report, which Mr. Freier read on Monday, and his own observations in Iraq contain a different message, he said. 
 ''Iraq remains a mixed bag and will continue to do so in perpetuity, to be quite honest,'' he added.
 Letters from the Treasury Department, the State Department and the Pentagon that were attached to the report all disagreed with many of its central findings. In the language common to such government exchanges, for example, the Pentagon said that it ''nonconcurs'' with the conclusion that a new strategy for stabilizing Iraq was needed.
 The unclassified version of the American plan, laid out by President Bush in January 2007 in what he called ''The New Way Forward in Iraq,'' is still the proper guideline, according to the Pentagon, whose response was written by Christopher C. Straub, acting deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East.
 ''The New Way Forward strategy remains valid,'' Mr. Straub wrote. ''We recognize, as with all strategies, updates and refinements occur at various intervals to take into account changes in the strategic environment.''
 But the president set out that plan as something that would take 12 to 18 months and would include achievements like enacting a law to regulate Iraq's oil industry and handing all of Iraq's provinces over to Iraqi control, the report says. As of this week, only 9 of 18 provinces had been handed over, according to the report, and the crucial oil law remains to be enacted.
 In other cases, what appeared to be promising political developments have faltered. Although the Iraqi Parliament enacted a law reforming the heavy-handed purge from government of former members of the Baath Party, no members have yet been named to the commission created to carry out the law.
 Still more important, the report asserts, the administration's plan is not a strategy at all, but more a series of operational prescriptions scattered among various documents reviewed by the accountability office.
 ''A strategic plan should be a plan that takes you not only through the short term,'' said Joseph A. Christoff, director of international affairs and trade at the accountability office. 
 ''If the New Way Forward only takes you through July 2008, then you don't have any guidance for achieving an Iraq that can do everything on its own,'' including dealing with the threat of terrorism and defending its own borders, Mr. Christoff said.
 Perhaps the most confounding element in the report is the sharp disagreement between the accountability office and the administration over the value of basic indicators of progress.
 For example, in an analysis based on a classified study of Iraqi Army battalions, the office concludes that just 10 percent of them are capable of operating independently in counterinsurgency operations and that even then they rely on American support.
 But the Pentagon, as stated in Mr. Straub's letter, maintains that 70 percent of Iraqi units are in the lead in counterinsurgency operations. The difference may be partly semantics: Are the Iraqi units in the lead, with Americans close at hand, or are they able to operate on their own? But the office essentially concludes that the Pentagon is claiming that units with far lower readiness grades are ready to lead than it did in the past.
 Similarly, by looking at official figures, the office was unable to substantiate American claims that Iraq had spent and committed more than 60 percent of its reconstruction budget in 2007. Instead, the number was 28 percent, the report said.

HEADLINE: McCain Proposes a $300 Million Prize for a Next-Generation Car Battery

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER; Michael Powell contributed reporting from Albuquerque, and Larry Rohter from New York.

DATELINE: FRESNO, Calif. 

 BODY:
In the 18th century the British offered a $:20,000 prize to anyone who figured out how to calculate longitude. More recently, Netflix offered a million dollars for improving movie recommendations on its Web site. Now Senator John McCain is suggesting a new national prize: He said here Monday that if elected president he would offer $300 million to anyone who could build a better car battery.
 The high cost of gasoline -- a gallon of regular was selling for $4.65 at a gas station near California State University, Fresno, where Mr. McCain spoke -- has made energy policy a big issue in this year's presidential campaign, and barely a day has passed recently without one of the candidates weighing in with new energy policies, proposals and attacks on opponents. 
 Mr. McCain, of Arizona, alienated some environmentalists last week during a speech in Houston when he dropped his opposition to allowing offshore drilling for oil; this week, in a swing through California, he spoke about trying to wean the nation from its dependence on oil. He called for improving the enforcement of fuel economy standards, building more cars that could run on alternative fuels, dropping the tariff on imports of sugar-based ethanol from Brazil and offering big tax credits for nonpolluting cars.
 ''I further propose we inspire the ingenuity and resolve of the American people,'' Mr. McCain said, ''by offering a $300 million prize for the development of a battery package that has the size, capacity, cost and power to leapfrog the commercially available plug-in hybrids or electric cars.''
 He said the winner should deliver power at 30 percent of current costs. ''That's one dollar, one dollar, for every man, woman and child in the U.S. -- a small price to pay for helping to break the back of our oil dependency,'' he said. 
 The Obama campaign countered by noting that Mr. McCain had voted against improving fuel efficiency standards in the Senate. Jason Furman, the Obama campaign's economic policy director, said in a conference call that Mr. McCain had been focused on ''meaningful relief for oil companies that are struggling with record profits.''
 In his speech in Fresno, Mr. McCain called for automakers to act more quickly to build so-called flex-fuel vehicles than can run on alternative fuel. He approvingly cited the example of Brazil, which he said had moved to building 70 percent of all new vehicles that way in just three years, and he issued a not-so-veiled threat to automakers. 
 ''Whether it takes a meeting with automakers during my first month in office, or my signature on an act of Congress,'' he said, ''we will meet the goal of a swift conversion of American vehicles away from oil.''
 And Mr. McCain emphasized one of his differences with Mr. Obama, without mentioning him by name, by restating his opposition to subsidies for corn-based ethanol, which Mr. Obama supports.
 ''As taxpayers, we foot the bill for the enormous subsidies paid to corn producers,'' he said. ''And as consumers, we pay extra at the pump because of government barriers to cheaper products from abroad.'' 
 Mr. McCain, who spoke against corn-based ethanol when he ran for president in 2000, said this time around that he became a supporter of it when oil grew too expensive, but he has said he still opposes subsidies for ethanol. 
 While the McCain and Obama campaigns were sparring over energy, Mr. Obama was in Albuquerque, where he focused on the economy and working women, a critical constituency. He journeyed deep into the prosaic land of gut-level economics at the Flying Star Cafe Commissary, where talk of globalization and vertical economies yields to ''how can I afford to make it through this week and the one after that?'' 
 Speaking to a group of women, Mr. Obama, of Illinois, was offered a glimpse into one of the realities of the American economy: that wages for the working-class have lagged far behind those of upper-income Americans. Some of the women at the commissary, like Carrie Hummel, 28, told of holding down multiple jobs and still barely being able to find the money to pay for gas, much less for her health insurance. ''You know, this life is pretty hard,'' she said.
 Ms. Hummel was followed by a woman who asked Mr. Obama if he would consider waiving taxes on tips, and another who asked about the cost of college tuition, which has risen at a rate far outstripping inflation.
 Mr. Obama offered a variety of proposals, including requiring employers t0 provide seven paid sick days for all employees (he has not specified the size of the employer) and extending the Family and Medical Leave Act to cover any company with 25 or more employees (the act now applies to those with 50 or more employees).
 He also criticized Mr. McCain over his opposition to legislative action to help bring wages of women up to those of men. The McCain campaign fired back, saying the legislation to do so would have been a boon to trial lawyers, who have supported Mr. Obama's campaign.

 ROCKETS FIRE FROM GAZA,
 Straining a Nascent Truce
 Three Qassam rockets fired from Gaza struck the Israeli border town of Sderot and its environs, causing no serious injuries but constituting the first breach of a five-day-old truce between Israel and Hamas, the Islamic group that controls Gaza. The crack in the calm came on the eve of a preliminary reading of a bill for the dissolution of the Israeli Parliament. The bill was expected to garner a majority of votes in the legislature, threatening to break up the country's governing coalition. PAGE A11 
 GERMANY COMMITS MORE TROOPS
 Under pressure from NATO, Germany announced that it would increase the number of soldiers available for duty in Afghanistan by almost one-third, to 4,500, but that it would maintain its policy of keeping the bulk of them away from the relatively violent southern provinces. The increase is subject to the approval of the lower house of Parliament, the Bundestag. Germany has resisted calls from several NATO allies to send its soldiers to southern Afghanistan. PAGE A8 
 JAPANESE WARSHIP VISITS CHINA
 A Japanese destroyer docked at a heavily guarded naval base in Guangdong Province for a five-day port call, the first by a warship from Japan in China since World War II. The visit by the 4,650-ton destroyer Sazanami, officially an earthquake relief mission, is seen by many military and diplomatic analysts as part of a broad and gradual reconciliation between the countries, which has quickened since President Hu Jintao of China visited Japan in May. ''We are considering the possible reaction of the Chinese people,'' said Takashi Sekine, a Japanese Defense Ministry spokesman, Reuters reported. ''We need to consider the situation.'' PAGE A11 
 A SURPRISE LAST WISH
 An octogenarian native of rural Pennsylvania who spent much of his life in Palm Beach, Fla., surprised everyone in his will by leaving millions to a foundation he had dreamed up in secrecy to aid the poor children of Panama, where he spent the final years of his life. The will of Wilson C. Lucom, who died two years ago at age 88, has set off a vicious legal battle that is playing out in at least four countries, and not a single Panamanian child has yet gotten access to the money. PAGE A6 
 DIVERS FIND FERRY VICTIMS
 Rescue teams from the Philippine Coast Guard penetrated the overturned ferry that was struck by Typhoon Fengshen on Saturday, and they found many bodies. The ferry disaster could turn out to be one of the worst in the Philippines in two decades, with more than 800 passengers and crew members believed to be dead. PAGE A7

 A DISPUTE OVER RELIGION'S ROLE
 In the Military Academies
 Students and staff members at West Point and the Naval Academy have complained that the schools have pushed religion on cadets and midshipmen. This follows new scrutiny on the role of religion in the military after a group of midshipmen asked the American Civil Liberties Union to petition the school to abolish daily prayer at weekday lunch. PAGE A14 
 BACK TO HER DAY JOB
 It was Senator Hillary Clinton's first day back at the Senate, and she was greeted by scores of well-wishing members of the public. It was also the only place world where so many people know what she's going through: there are 12 current senators and former presidential candidates who returned to the legislative body after unsuccessful White House bids. Senator John Kerry's advice to Ms. Clinton? ''Compartmentalize,'' he said. PAGE A16
 MCCAIN'S SECURITY BALANCING ACT
 One of the premises of John McCain's campaign against Barack Obama is that Mr. McCain is better suited than Mr. Obama to keep the nation safe from terror. So when Charlie Black, a senior adviser to Mr. McCain, was quoted as saying that a terrorist attack in the United States would ''be a big advantage'' for Mr. McCain in the coming election, it was a logical, if inartfully expressed, extension of that idea. It highlights a balancing act for Mr. McCain: selling himself as a candidate who will keep Americans safe without seeming to be exploiting their fears. PAGE A16 
 HOUSE BLOCKS CUTS IN DOCTORS' FEES
 The House overwhelmingly passed a bill to prevent a cut in Medicare payments to doctors that was scheduled to take effect next week, despite a veto threat from President Bush. In order to pay for a small increase in Medicare payments to doctors, the bill would lower payments to private Medicare Advantage plans. President Bush said that would ''reduce access, benefits and choices'' for older Americans. But Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the White House was defending ''bloated, unnecessary subsidies for private health insurance plans.'' PAGE A15 
 GROUP TO WEIGH IN ON DETAINEES
 A bipartisan group of former government officials, retired generals and religious leaders plans to issue a statement calling for a presidential order to outlaw some interrogation and detention practices used by the Bush administration. The order they want would commit the government to using only interrogation methods that the United States would find acceptable if used on American civilians or soldiers, and would also outlaw secret detentions. ''It's a good time to step back, take a deep breath and set a standard,'' a former government official said. PAGE A17

 HOLDING BACK YOUNG STUDENTS:
 Is Program a Gift or a Stigma?
 The 8,400-student East Ramapo school district in Spring Valley, N.Y., has brought back a controversial plan to hold back almost 12 percent of its first graders and teaching them in a separate classroom. School officials say 80 percent of the first graders and second graders enrolled this year in the special classes -- dubbed the Gift of Time -- now read at grade level. But parents and education experts say it stigmatizes low achievers by tracking and retaining them. PAGE B1 
 DUSTING OFF SPY CASE TESTIMONY
 The government consented to release most of the secret grand jury testimony taken in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were executed at Sing Sing in 1953 after being convicted of spying on behalf of Russia. Prosecutors said they would not oppose the release of testimony of most of the witnesses, but would not approve the release of testimony from witnesses who were still alive and had not consented or who could not be found.

 BUSINESSMAN CHARGED WITH LYING
 About Ties to the Vatican
 Raffaello Follieri, an Italian businessman who had dated the actress Anne Hathaway, was arrested in Manhattan and charged with fraud and money laundering. Court documents say he told investors that he had a relationship with the Vatican that allowed him to buy properties from the church at below-market prices, as well as right of first refusal on properties that the church sold in the United States. The government said he had no such relationship with the church. PAGE C3 
 SO, ABOUT THAT DEAL ...
 Citigroup introduced the slogan ''A deal is a deal'' last year to pledge to its credit card customers that it would no longer reserve the right to raise interest rates on cards at any time for any reason -- a move that won applause from even its harshest critics. But now that the company is facing financial troubles, it is quietly reconsidering its pledge -- and a reversal could be particularly embarrassing. PAGE C4 
 DOW RAISES CHEMICAL PRICES
 The Dow Chemical Company said it was raising prices by as much as 25 percent -- the largest increase in the company's history and the second time it has raised its prices in a month -- in order to offset a ''relentless rise'' in energy costs. Dow said it would also add freight surcharges and reduceproduction in some of its plants. Economists say the $664 billion chemical industry has been among the hardest hit by soaring energy prices.

 A MAN AT EASE WITH HIMSELF, BUT AT ODDS WITH HIS WORLD
 In French literature, two are regarded as supporting pillars: Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus. But while Sartre's heart and pen seemed to find ease in France, Camus seemed to be a perpetual outsider, a stranger even. Camus was lauded by Sartre and his fellow intellectuals as a marvel, but then condemned when he rebelled against the ideals that they seemed to thrust upon him. This contention comes across in the third and final volume of his notebooks, appearing 19 years after their release in French. A review by Richard Eder. Page E8 
 THE STAGE IS SET, PLEASE SCRUB IN
 The drama in ''Hopkins,'' a new documentary on ABC, unfolds to the blip of EKG's and rides upon six interwoven stories of patients and physicians. While television is no stranger to medical-based plots, this time the cameras are going into the operating rooms at Johns Hopkins Hospital. The show delves deep into the lives of both the surgeons and their charges. But this is real, and as one doctor is quoted as saying: ''This is not 'Grey's Anatomy.''' Page E3 
 A RECORD PRICE FOR WATERLILLIES
 Christie's in London opened their summer auction season in fine fashion. Monet's ''Le Bassin aux Nympheas,'' the rarest of his waterlillies paintings, went for $80.4 million after a six-way battle. The painting is one of four that experts view as among the most important works from his late period, and one of the few that was actually finished at the time of his death, signed and sold by the artist himself.

 RICHARD J. KOKE, 91
 He served as the curator of the New-York Historical Society for nearly 40 years, helping to transform the institution from a repository of documents and artworks into a space where visitors come face to face with relics of New York City and its place in American history. The museum's director said that Mr. Koke ''did a great deal to open up these collections to the broader public.'' PAGE A21
 SONNY OKOSUNS, 61
 A Nigerian singer and musician whose boyhood inspirations were Elvis Presley, Cliff Richard and the Beatles, he achieved international stature by aiming his music against human-rights abuses. His music was a catchy, rock-inflected cocktail of funk, reggae, Afrobeat and more, and among his songs, ''Fire in Soweto,'' was perhaps the best known. PAGE A21

 ENSURING A CUISINE'S APPEAL
 Isn't Lost in Translation
 The dish called mapo tofu in Chinese loosely translates to ''pockmarked old lady's tofu'' in English. So the Chinese government's official list of suggested English translations for Chinese dishes -- an effort to make sure the Western tourists in the country for the Olympics aren't spooked by the idiosyncratic nomenclature of the cuisine there -- probably makes sense. But now the vague and joyful Happy Family, is simply vague (''assorted stewed delicacies''). PAGE F8
 RELAXING WITH A NICE OLD BEER
 Unlike their beer-drinking counterparts in Europe, most Americans drink lagers, which tend to lose flavor over time. A growing number of Americans, however, are taking up beer cellaring, in which they're housing brews that become more tasty as they age. Aficionados take different tacks. One man does his beer cellaring in his garage. Another uses a cold, pitch-black basement. And another keeps thousands of his bottles of vintage beer in an abandoned gold mine. PAGE F5
 FROM WINE GLASSES TO FROSTY MUGS
 Eric Asimov temporarily shelves his oenophilia to turn his critical attentions toward root beer, a soft drink on which he says few people take neutral positions. For his assessment of 25 root beers, he was joined by a panel of colleagues, though they were not his first choices. ''I immediately thought of two well-known root beer lovers, but Snoopy and the Red Baron were unavailable,'' he writes. PAGE F6

 George Vecsey says that Euro 2008, this year's installment of the quadrennial European Football Championship, is the rare sporting event that lives up to its hype.

HEADLINE: For Sale in ... County Cork, Ireland

BYLINE: By VIRGINIA C. McGUIRE

 BODY:
WHAT
 A four-bedroom four-bath restored Victorian Gothic country house at the edge of Kinsale Harbor in the village of Summercove
 HOW MUCH
 4,500,000 euros ($6.9 million) 
 SETTING
 The house, set 40 feet above Kinsale Harbour, has 180-degree views to the southwest. Kinsale is a medieval town known for its seafood dining and recreational activities like golf, sailing and fishing. The inland side of the house faces a narrow village street.
 INSIDE
 High gothic windows bring in light and emphasize the views. The kitchen has a two-story ceiling, and on the mezzanine above is an office space with a wide view of the harbor. A conservatory looks out over the garden and the water. The ground floor is heated by hot water piped under the oak parquet floors. The bathrooms are tiled with limestone, and all four of the bedrooms have harbor views.
 OUTSIDE
 The house's terrace walls are all that remain of an old garrison that stood in this spot before the current structure was built in 1905. The walled garden has potted plants and a lawn bordered by granite paths. Below, at water's edge, are a private jetty and a small, rocky beach. A blocked-off smuggler's tunnel runs underneath the house. The lot is three-quarters of an acre.
 WHERE AND HOW TO GET THERE
 Twenty minutes by car from Cork International Airport
 WHO BUYS IN IRELAND
 During the recent housing boom, Ireland saw an influx of expatriates from Britain, Northern Europe and the United States. The Irish countryside attracts golfers, sailors, and others desiring an active lifestyle.
 MARKET OVERVIEW
 The country's property market has been climbing steadily since the mid-1990s, but recently economic pressure has pushed prices lower. In May, permanent tsb, an Irish bank, and the Economic and Social Research Institute reported in their monthly House Price Index that national house prices were down 9.2 percent in 2008 compared with the same period a year earlier.
 BUYING BASICS
 Buyers should hire an estate agent, or auctioneer, who is licensed by the Institute of Professional Auctioneers and Valuers. Fees for agents can vary widely, and should be agreed upon in writing in advance. Sellers' agents include their commissions, usually about 2.5 percent, in the price of the property.
 Mortgage lenders usually ask for a survey of the property, which is not as rigorous as the inspections required by homeowners' insurance companies in the United States. Buyers can commission a more detailed survey to look for structural defects and other problems. 
 Other expenses include stamp duty, or transfer tax. For properties worth more than 125,000 euros, stamp duty is 7 to 9 percent of the purchase price.
 When an offer is accepted, the buyer makes a refundable deposit of 2 to 3 percent. At closing, the buyer pays the balance of the deposit, typically at least 10 percent of the purchase price.

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence Declines to a 16-Year Low

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM; An earlier version of this article said that Los Angeles and Miami were the hardest hit in the last 12 months. It should have read Las Vegas and Miami.

 BODY:
Consumer confidence dropped to its lowest point in 16 years in June while home values fell in 20 metropolitan areas across the country, according to two economic reports released Tuesday. 
 The Conference Board, a private firm, said that its consumer confidence index fell to 50.4 in June, down from 58.1 in May, its lowest point since January and February 1992. 
 The data reinforced what many on Wall Street had already accepted as a given: the Federal Reserve will hold interest rates steady at its meeting that ends Wednesday. 
 ''Rate hike? You're kidding, right?'' Ian C. Shepherdson, the chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics, wrote in a note to investors, dismissing any chance that the Fed will increase interest rates in an effort to head off rising inflation. ''This is incredibly awful,'' he added of the reports.
 Mr. Shepherdson is noted for his bearish take on the economy. Still, Tuesday's data suggested a nation struggling with expensive gas and devalued homes, where people are fearful for their jobs and wary about where the economy is headed.
 The survey said that many Americans feared they might lose their jobs or be unable to find work. The proportion of respondents who described employment as ''plentiful'' fell to 14.1 percent in June, and more than 35 percent said they expected fewer jobs would be available in the next six months.
 Investors wondered whether a series of ominous warnings about rising inflation meant that the Fed might raise rates by the end of the summer to help choke off inflation.
 Tuesday's data only added to the reasons that the ailing economy might not react well to an increase in rates.
 Some of the pessimism most likely stemmed from the continued decline in home values, which has eroded the home equity that many Americans have tapped to pay bills. In April, home prices fell again, in the steepest annual decline since 1988, according to one widely watched measure.
 All 20 of the metropolitan areas surveyed in the Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller home price index, released Tuesday, recorded year-over-year declines in the value of single-family homes from April 2007 to April 2008. 
 Las Vegas and Miami were the hardest hit, with 12-month declines of more than 26 percent. Charlotte, N.C., which in March was the only city of the 20 surveyed to maintain a gain over the previous 12 months, slipped to a 0.1 percent decline. (Only single-family homes are included in the Case-Shiller survey.)
 There were a handful of positive signs in April. For that month alone, prices in eight cities, including Boston, Chicago and Dallas, rose slightly. Prices in Dallas grew 1.1 percent for the month, and prices in Cleveland increased 2.9 percent.
 But many economists said the housing slump was nowhere near its bottom.
 ''House prices still have room to drop a lot more,'' wrote Patrick Newport, an economist at Global Insight, a research firm in Lexington, Mass. 
 ''Given the current level of unsold homes on the market, the number of foreclosures already in or about to enter the pipeline and the run-up in prices over 2000-6, this index is likely to drop much more,'' he wrote.
 The average home price in all 20 regions fell 1.4 percent from March and 15.3 percent from a year earlier. That was worse than the 14.3 percent year-over-year drop recorded in March.
 A smaller survey, which measured only 10 metropolitan areas, dipped 1.6 percent from March and 16.3 percent from a year earlier.
 In the New York City area, prices fell 8.4 percent from April 2007 to April 2008. On a monthly basis, prices slipped 1.3 percent in April. 
 The housing market has been hard hit by foreclosures and squeezed by tighter standards at lending agencies, which have made it harder for even qualified homeowners to obtain mortgages.

HEADLINE: Hockey Not Easy To Sell in Texas

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BRICK

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex. 

 BODY:
Looking back on the whole marvelous caper, the high point was not so much the playoff runs or the bewildered crowds or even all those underdressed Texas sweethearts shivering around the hockey rink glass. No, the high point was probably Guaranteed Fight Night.
 Guaranteed Fight Night, possibly the most self-explanatory gimmick in all of sports promotion, seemed to bottle the essence of the Austin Ice Bats, the sweatiest, rowdiest, most bruising pack of transplanted Canadians ever to charm this river city.
 Charm they did, for one fleeting decade, and baffle and mystify and pander. Founded in 1996 to compete in the Western Professional Hockey League, the Ice Bats managed to win over a populace whose devotion to University of Texas football had cast all other sporting clubs in the role of false idols.
 ''One thing they really like down here is the fighting in the sport,'' said Brent Hughes, who finished his N.H.L. career as a forward with the Islanders and who served two stints as Ice Bats head coach. ''I don't know if it's something people were just in awe about, because any other sport you'd be ejected. I think people appreciate it's a rough, tough sport.'' 
 But it is also a rough, tough world, and time can do a number on novelty. This month, after years of declining attendance, the Ice Bats announced plans to shut down, at least for the 2008-9 season. The team has failed to find an arena suitable for rebuilding its fan base, said Randy G. Sanders, its owner and president.
 With the players released to free agency, some have gone home to Canada or points slightly less far north. Others have cast about for manual labor to pass the time while Sanders seeks an arena for future seasons.
 ''I'd love the team to stay here,'' said Darryl McArthur, 29, the captain, as he took a break from landscaping work to wander the Chaparral Ice arena last week. ''This is where I thought I'd end my career, and I don't want to end it with just the team folding.''
 Of course, the whole proposition had seemed unlikely from the outset. Minor league hockey does not come naturally in central Texas, where the low temperature in January averages 40 degrees. Ponds do not freeze here. There are not, strictly speaking, a whole lot of ponds. And great suspicion tends to fall on anyone who plays a sport that does not involve burnt orange Longhorns jerseys. 
 But heaven smiled on the timing. In the late 1990s, Austin was drawing newcomers to an economy propelled by tax incentives and the university's wildly successful dropouts, not least among them the computer titan Michael Dell. In response, the Keep Austin Weird movement was producing support for the kitsch value of roller derby, Midnight Tacos trucks and a transvestite vagrant mayoral candidate.
 Against that backdrop, the Ice Bats fit right in. Named for the flock of Mexican free-tailed bats living under the Congress Avenue Bridge, the team moved into an old rodeo barn, encouraged the wearing of sombreros and taunted goal-scoring opponents with deafening salvos of Tom Petty singing, ''Even the losers get lucky sometimes.''
 The players could skate well enough to impress anybody who looked right in cowboy boots, but their real talent was showmanship. On one occasion, the Ice Bats made their game the opening act for a Los Lonely Boys concert. One time they took 51 unsuccessful shots in a single contest. Another time their goalie fired a puck the length of the ice and scored. To fans learning hockey from these shenanigans, a certain level of incompetence even passed for cute.
 ''You'd see a hockey puck sitting in front of a goalie for what seemed like an eternity before a player got to it,'' said Paul Bruggeman, president of the Ice Bats Booster Club. ''That raises the anticipation level.''
 Then there was the fighting. Bench-clearing brawls summoned even the backup goalie. Once, a player was cited for head-butting. Penalty minutes were known to reach triple digits.
 For a while, the city was smitten. Games were shown on local television. Attendance sometimes exceeded 7,000, for a total of a million customers in five years. Boosters took the players home for warm meals. Fans called their arena the Bat Cave. And after a merger in 2001 that made the Western Professional Hockey League part of the Central Hockey League, the team even advanced to the championship series twice.
 But as the technology boom played out, average attendance dwindled to 2,000, among the worst in a league that includes such hockey outposts as Tulsa, Oklahoma City and Bossier City, La.
 In Austin, the facilities were to blame. For 10 years, home games were played at the Travis County Exposition Center, an out-of-the-way site that has, according to its Web site, ''hosted affairs such as formal banquets, arts and crafts shows, dog shows, livestock events, car shows, and even a circus.''
 After efforts to build a new arena in the growing suburb of Cedar Park failed, the Ice Bats played their final seasons at the Chaparral Ice arena. That rink, on Interstate 35 between a Whataburger restaurant and Cindie's Lingerie, did a strong business in children's figure skating lessons, but the Ice Bats were only able to draw 600 to 800 fans to their games.
 ''We knew we couldn't stay there,'' Sanders said in an interview. ''It just doesn't seat enough people to pay the bills, for one, and it just isn't conducive to professional sports.''
 Cedar Park did eventually agree to build a $55 million, 6,800-seat arena, but the Ice Bats were not invited. Instead, the city lured a higher-level minor league team, the American Hockey League affiliate of the Dallas Stars. The team, previously located in Des Moines, will become the Texas Stars and play in Cedar Park beginning in 2009-10.
 Frank Provenzano, assistant general manager of the Stars, said the move would help his team manage its salary cap, capitalize on a statewide TV market and reach a wealthy demographic group.
 Although Sanders has vowed to find his Ice Bats a new home, the move by the Stars has done little to raise hopes.
 ''There's room for minor league hockey in Austin,'' said Craig Way, the radio host known as the voice of the Longhorns. ''I don't think there's room for two minor league hockey teams in Austin.''
 So the Ice Bats called off their season. The team captain has not given up. McArthur, a defenseman from Oshawa, Ontario, first joined the Ice Bats in 2000, married a Houston girl and started a family. The fans took some getting used to.
 ''They always want to know, 'Do you have all your teeth?' '' McArthur said. ''Which I do. And, 'Are the fights real?' Which they are.''
 As he wandered the skating center a few days ago, McArthur could find few indications that the Ice Bats had ever existed. Their apparel was gone from the gift shops, their banners were stripped from the walls and their offices were stacked with child-sized plastic chairs. Clutching his jersey, No. 22, he walked from the 100-degree heat into the chill of the rink.
 ''People didn't know hockey, but they liked to watch it, and they truly thought we were as good as the Dallas Stars,'' McArthur said. ''You could have a 3-2 hockey game that's a real good game if you knew about hockey. For some people down here, they'd rather have four fights and a five-nothing game. They'd still tell you, 'Good game.' ''

HEADLINE: Low Mexican Gasoline Prices Draw Americans Across the Border

BYLINE: By ADAM B. ELLICK

DATELINE: CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico 

 BODY:
When George Terrazas was mugged at gunpoint in this Mexican border city several months ago, he vowed never to return.
 That, however, was before gasoline hit $4 a gallon in his hometown, El Paso, just across the border.
 On Saturday, Mr. Terrazas was back in Ciudad Juarez, wooed by its irresistibly low-priced gasoline -- around $2.66 a gallon -- even if not quite unfazed by the indiscriminate gunfire from dueling drug cartels that has contributed to a 2008 average of three killings a day in the city.
 ''I don't feel comfortable here,'' he said, ''but I can't even fill the tank on the U.S. side.'' 
 Mr. Terrazas, a 48-year-old maintenance worker, is among a flow of American ''gas tourists'' who, Mexican service stations near the border with El Paso estimate, account for a 50 percent surge in gasoline sales here over the last several months. (Similar increases are reported along the border all the way to Tijuana.) Even the Mexico Tourism Board is promoting the journey.
 At the Servicio Herrera service station here, the manager, Jorge Salinas, estimated that Americans were now 30 percent of his customers. They arrive at all hours, Mr. Salinas said, from 6 a.m. to midnight.
 On his visit Saturday, Mr. Terrazas saved about $20 filling his 1990 Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera. He said that when he returned to El Paso, he would monitor the bridge traffic from his house, and that once it waned, he would come back to fill his other vehicle, an S.U.V., for an even bigger saving.
 And while here he would pick up six-packs of Tecate beer and produce like passion fruit, and even visit an orthodontist. In all, he expected to save $200. The border, he said, flashing a mouthful of braces, is ''our advantage.''
 The low gasoline and diesel prices that draw Americans here are a result of subsidies provided by the Mexican government to curb inflation and make fuel affordable to the poor.
 The moment may not last. Severe gasoline and diesel shortages, caused by the increased demand from Americans and delivery problems as well, have been reported from here to Mexico's border with California. (On Friday the government-owned monopoly oil company, Petroleos Mexicanos, or Pemex, said that it would provide a one-time allotment of an extra 300,000 barrels of diesel fuel to meet increased demand along the border.)
 Moreover, experts question how long the government can continue providing gasoline subsidies, which will amount to more than $20 billion this year.
 For now, though, many South Texans are buying all the fuel they can south of the border, and little wonder. Four of the seven poorest urbanized counties in the United States are along the Texas border, including El Paso, according to a 2006 Census Bureau report.
 El Pasoan desperation shows in the leathery face of Jimmy Gann, 57. Mr. Gann's employer, a family trucking business, is on the verge of bankruptcy, he said, and to help the owners stay afloat, he makes three 32-mile round-trip sprints across the border each day. Once here, he fills a 100-gallon tank with diesel -- which is going for $2.20 a gallon on this side, compared with $4.55 on the other -- then returns north, unloads the tank at his employer's business and does it all over again.
 One Texan in the trucking industry, who declined to give his name for fear of being prosecuted for tax evasion, said he saved $12,000 a month by fueling his four-truck fleet in Mexico.
 On the El Paso side, service station employees say business is down about 40 percent, even at a Chevron station that may have the best deal in town: gasoline at $3.89 a gallon. Just two months ago, stations on the Texas side attracted many Mexicans, who crossed to buy what they considered higher-quality gasoline that was more expensive but still affordable. 
 ''We keep saying, 'Have you seen so-and-so?' and the answer is always no,'' said Rocio Salazar, 30, a station attendant in El Paso. ''It used to be like rush hour on the freeway in here.'' 
 The drop in business has made all the worse along the Texas border what were already hard times for many owners of American service stations. The spike in gasoline's price has caused many customers to cut back, and that, coupled with increased fees of credit card companies, has ''put an increasing number of retailers on the brink of bankruptcy,'' says the National Association of Convenience Stores, which represents convenience and petroleum retailers in the United States.
 Jose Alfredo has worked at a Chevron station in El Paso for 18 years. With no convenience store to cushion a 50 percent drop in business, the station has laid off five of its eight employees.
 ''Everyone knows Mexican gas is watered down, but customers don't care anymore,'' Mr. Alfredo said with a shrug.
 Managers of Mexican stations deny that accusation. They also say that most of the gasoline they sell is refined in the United States. But one American oil executive noted that the sulfur content allowed in gasoline by the Mexican government was higher than what is allowed in the United States, and said that over time, the higher level could compromise vehicle emissions systems. In addition, Mexican refineries lack a capacity to produce low-sulfur diesel, which is standard in the United States.
 The Mexican diesel is ''not a good thing for the air, but it's a good thing for people who want to save money,'' said Tom Kloza, a chief analyst at Oil Price Information Service.
 Edith Marquez is one American who has so far resisted buying Mexican gasoline, citing quality concerns. But she visits Juarez every Saturday for the $15 saving at a weight control doctor, whose office is attached to a Pemex station. ''I'm afraid for my car, but I'll let the doctor here put vitamins in me,'' Ms. Marquez said with a laugh. 
 For gas station attendants in Mexico, who earn $100 a week, the surge in sales has meant extra money to tuck into the pockets of their olive green overalls. To tip attendants is the custom here, and one of them, Alejandro Jurado, flashing a brick-size wad of pesos and dollars, said, ''Americans tip better.''

HEADLINE: To Find a Culprit

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
With Americans growing angrier by the day about high gasoline prices, nobody can accuse Congress of turning a deaf ear.
 On Wednesday lawmakers will hold their 40th hearing so far this year on the cause of high oil prices. Filing bills on Capitol Hill to combat the problem is becoming a cottage industry, with clever names like the Prevent Unfair Manipulation of Prices Act, or PUMP Act, and the No Excuses Energy Act.
 Until recently, lawmakers had focused on the traditional suspects: oil companies and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. But increasingly, they are casting a suspicious eye on the role of investors, including speculators, in driving up prices. 
 As the ninth hearing of the month gets under way on Wednesday, one of the nation's best-known energy experts, Daniel Yergin, is expected to tell Congress that the focus on speculation is largely misguided.
 Mr. Yergin will join numerous other energy experts who have declared that the rise in oil prices can be explained by basic economic factors, such as the limited growth in supplies in recent years, a weakening dollar, a global surge in energy demand and a string of production disruptions in countries like Nigeria. 
 ''When an issue is this hot, it would be so much easier if there was a single reason to blame,'' Mr. Yergin said in an interview on Tuesday, previewing his testimony before Congress.
 ''The oil shock is real and is about the hottest political issue right now,'' he said. ''So Congress feels the pressure to do something but there is not much it can do to promote peace in Nigeria or to get the value of the dollar to go up.'' 
 Mr. Yergin is the chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a consulting firm, and the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of ''The Prize,'' an authoritative history of the oil business. He will speak on Wednesday before the Joint Economic Committee, headed by Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York.
 Mr. Yergin said the market is relentlessly bidding up oil prices in response to deep-seated fears that the growth in demand will keep outpacing the growth in oil supplies in coming years.
 ''There is a shortage psychology in the financial markets and that is reflected in the price of oil,'' Mr. Yergin said in the interview. ''You are seeing a lot of people who have never invested in commodities who are now piling into the market. But calling it speculation is way too simplistic.''
 What role financial institutions -- pension funds, mutual funds, and hedge funds, among others -- are playing in driving up the price of oil to nearly $140 a barrel remains a key question. Regulators in Washington have acknowledged that they do not have enough information on speculative trading in commodity markets. Even though the evidence is incomplete, speculators have nonetheless become prime targets for legislative action.
 Gasoline prices now average $4.07 a gallon, up more than $1 a gallon in the past year, according to AAA, the automobile group. The price of oil -- the main reason behind the run-up in gasoline prices -- has doubled in the past year, settling Tuesday at $137 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, up 26 cents. 
 There is little doubt that investments in commodity markets have grown in recent years as investors sought assets offering better returns than stocks, bonds or currencies. Investors, faced with a weakening dollar, a slowing economy and rising inflation, found a hedge in crude oil. 
 Some analysts who testified before a House panel on Monday estimated that oil prices could fall to around $60 a barrel if speculators were driven out of the commodity market. 
 But others warned that assessing how much, if at all, investors have pushed up prices is an impossible task. Relatively little is known about oil investments in some lightly regulated markets, like the IntercontinentalExchange, an electronic exchange based in Atlanta that has gained prominence as an energy marketplace. 
 Facing mounting pressure to step up its oversight, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, in Washington, said that it had recognized the need for better information. Its acting chairman, Walter L. Lukken, said his agency was seeking more trading data from exchanges in both the United States and abroad.
 Senator Schumer's committee provided an advance copy of Mr. Yergin's prepared testimony. In it, Mr. Yergin did not discount the rising role of investors in energy markets. But he said their presence was more a consequence than a cause of the tight markets.
 ''Financial markets are today playing an increasingly important role in price formation -- responding to, accentuating, and exaggerating supply and demand, geopolitics, and other trends,'' Mr. Yergin says in the prepared remarks.
 But he pointed to a variety of other factors that have made the run-up possible. Nigeria, for example, is producing one million barrels a day less than its production capacity because of disruptions caused by attacks in the oil-rich Niger Delta. Production has stagnated in countries like Russia and Venezuela and is even plunging in places like Mexico. 
 All these factors have left the global oil industry with little capacity to boost supplies. There is now less than two million barrels a day of unused capacity, a safety cushion that has declined from about five million barrels a day in 2002.
 ''In a tight market, prices go up,'' Mr. Yergin said. ''And a tight market is also a market that is more crisis-prone, more vulnerable to the impact of disruptions.''
 Senator Schumer, in an interview, said he could see no easy answers to high oil prices.
 ''Everyone would like to believe that there is a silver bullet -- like a bubble or speculation -- that can solve our oil problem,'' he said. Instead, he said, it would be better for the nation to focus on conserving energy and reducing its oil consumption.

HEADLINE: Fuel Prices Shift Math For Life in Far Suburbs

BYLINE: By PETER S. GOODMAN

DATELINE: ELIZABETH, Colo. 

 BODY:
Suddenly, the economics of American suburban life are under assault as skyrocketing energy prices inflate the costs of reaching, heating and cooling homes on the distant edges of metropolitan areas.
 Just off Singing Hills Road, in one of hundreds of two-story homes dotting a former cattle ranch beyond the southern fringes of Denver, Phil Boyle and his family openly wonder if they will have to move close to town to get some relief. 
 They still revel in the space and quiet that has drawn a steady exodus from American cities toward places like this for more than half a century. Their living room ceiling soars two stories high. A swing-set sways in the breeze in their backyard. Their wrap-around porch looks out over the flat scrub of the high plains to the snow-capped peaks of the Rocky Mountains.
 But life on the edges of suburbia is beginning to feel untenable. Mr. Boyle and his wife must drive nearly an hour to their jobs in the high-tech corridor of southern Denver. With gasoline at more than $4 a gallon, Mr. Boyle recently paid $121 to fill his pickup truck with diesel fuel. In March, the last time he filled his propane tank to heat his spacious house, he paid $566, more than twice the price of 5 years ago. 
 Though Mr. Boyle finds city life unappealing, it is now up for reconsideration.
 ''Living closer in, in a smaller space, where you don't have that commute,'' he said. ''It's definitely something we talk about. Before it was 'we spend too much time driving.' Now, it's 'we spend too much time and money driving.' ''
 Across the nation, the realization is taking hold that rising energy prices are less a momentary blip than a change with lasting consequences. The shift to costlier fuel is threatening to slow the decades-old migration away from cities, while exacerbating the housing downturn by diminishing the appeal of larger homes set far from urban jobs. 
 In Atlanta, Philadelphia, San Francisco and Minneapolis, homes beyond the urban core have been falling in value faster than those within, according to an analysis by Moody'sEconomy.com.
 In Denver, housing prices in the urban core rose steadily from 2003 until late last year compared with previous years, before dipping nearly 5 percent in the last three months of last year, according to Economy.com. But house prices in the suburbs began falling earlier, in the middle of 2006, and then accelerated, dropping by 7 percent during the last three months of the year from a year earlier. 
 Many factors have propelled the unraveling of American real estate, from the mortgage crisis to a staggering excess of home construction, making it hard to pinpoint the impact of any single force. But economists and real estate agents are growing convinced that the rising cost of energy is now a primary factor pushing home prices down in the suburbs, particularly in the outer rings.
 More than three-fourths of prospective home buyers are now more inclined to live in an urban area because of fuel prices, according to a recent survey of 903 real estate agents with Coldwell Banker, the national brokerage firm. 
 Some now proclaim the unfolding demise of suburbia. 
 ''Many low-density suburbs and McMansion subdivisions, including some that are lovely and affluent today, may become what inner cities became in the 1960s and '70s -- slums characterized by poverty, crime and decay,'' declared Christopher B. Leinberger, an urban land use expert, in a recent essay in The Atlantic Monthly.
 Most experts do not share such apocalyptic visions, seeing instead a gradual reordering.
 ''It's like an ebbing of this suburban tide,'' said Joe Cortright, an economist at the consulting group Impresa Inc. in Portland, Ore. ''There's going to be this kind of reversal of desirability. Typically, Americans have felt the periphery was most desirable, and now there's going to be a reversion to the center.''
 In a recent study, Mr. Cortright found that house prices in the urban centers of Chicago, Los Angeles, Pittsburgh, Portland and Tampa have fared significantly better than those in the suburbs. So-called exurbs -- communities sprouting on the distant edges of metropolitan areas -- have suffered worst of all, Mr. Cortright found. 
 Basic household arithmetic appears to be furthering the trend: In 2003, the average suburban household spent $1,422 a year on gasoline, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. By April of this year -- when gas prices were about $3.60 a gallon-- the same household was spending $3,196 a year, more than doubling consumption in dollar terms in less than five years.
 In March, Americans drove 11 billion fewer miles on public roads than in the same month the previous year, a 4.3 percent decrease -- the sharpest one-month drop since the Federal Highway Administration began keeping records in 1942.
 Long before the recent spike in the price of energy, environmentalists decried suburban sprawl a waste of land, energy and tax dollars. Governments from Virginia to California have in recent decades lavished resources on building roads and schools for new subdivisions in the outer rings of development while skimping on maintaining facilities closer in. Many governments now focus on reviving their downtowns. 
 In Denver -- a classic Western city, with snarling freeway traffic across a vast acreage of strip malls, ranch houses and office parks -- the city has had an urban renaissance over the last decade. 
 A $6.1 billion commuter rail system has been in the works over the last four years, drawing people downtown without cars, while stimulating swift sales of densely clustered condos near stations. 
 Coors Field, the intimate, brick-fronted baseball stadium for the Colorado Rockies, has transformed the surrounding area from a desolate skid row into fashionable Lower Downtown, a neighborhood of restaurants and microbreweries in restored warehouses. Along the Platte River, new condos set on a park strip offer an arresting tableau of glass, steel, and futuristic geometry, attracting throngs of buyers at rising prices. 
 ''This is a city where it's fun to be in the center,'' said Tim Burleigh, 56, who sold his house in the suburbs and now walks to Rockies games from his downtown condo.
 To Denver's mayor, John W. Hickenlooper, $4 gasoline offers a useful incentive for such plans.
 ''It can be an accelerator,'' he said during an interview inside the imposing column-fronted City Hall. ''It's not going to be the dagger in the heart of suburban sprawl, but there's a certain inclination, a certain momentum back toward downtown.''
 Dollars spent at the gas station leave fewer for mortgage payments. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Economy.com, calculated that the jump in gas prices from $2 a gallon to $4 has taken $50 a month from the typical suburban commuter driving 25 miles a day. 
 ''The fuel price change should be capitalized into the cost of houses,'' Mr. Zandi said. ''Prices in the outer suburbs will get clobbered.''
 Elizabeth is the archetype of a once-rural community sucked into the orbit of the expanding metropolis, its ranch lands given over to porches, picket fences and two-car garages.
 Megan Werner, 39, a mother of three, moved here five years ago from a dense suburb closer to Denver. She and her husband bought a home set on a 1.5-acre lot in the Deer Creek Farm subdivision. The space justified her husband's 40-minute commute.
 ''We wanted more than a postage stamp,'' she said, as her 5-year-old daughter walked barefoot across the driveway.
 It used to cost her about $30 to fill her Honda minivan with gas. Now, it is more like $50, and she coordinates her trips -- shopping in town, combined with dance lessons for her children. But she has no thoughts of leaving. 
 ''I can open up my door and my kids can play,'' Ms. Werner said.
 For others, though, new math is altering the choice of where to live. Houses are sitting on the market longer than in years past. ''The pool of buyers is diminishing,'' said Jace Glick, an agent with Re/Max Alliance in Parker, Colo., next to Elizabeth.
 Juanita Johnson and her husband, both retired Denver schoolteachers, moved here last August, after three decades in the city and a few years in the mountains. They bought a four-bedroom house for $415,000.
 Last winter, they spent $3,000 on propane for heat, she said. Suddenly, this seemed like a place to flee. ''We'd sell if we could, but we'd lose our shirt,'' Ms. Johnson said. Recently she counted 15 sale signs. One home nearby is listed below $400,000.
 ''I was so glad to get out of the city, the pollution the traffic, the crime,'' she said. Now, the suburbs seem mean. ''I wouldn't do this again.''

HEADLINE: Top Engineers Shun Military; Concern Grows

BYLINE: By PHILIP TAUBMAN

 BODY:
When Paul G. Kaminski completed his graduate work in 1971 with degrees from M.I.T. and Stanford, he started building advanced airplanes for the Air Force. By the time he stopped several decades later, he had played a pivotal role in producing a flock of new weapons, including radar-evading stealth aircraft.
 If Mr. Kaminski were coming out of school today, chances are he would be going to work for the likes of Microsoft or Google. 
 Over the last decade, even as spending on new military projects has reached its highest level since the Reagan years, the Pentagon has increasingly been losing the people most skilled at managing them. That brain drain, military experts like Mr. Kaminski say, is a big factor in a breakdown in engineering management that has made huge cost overruns and long delays the maddening norm. 
 Mr. Kaminski's generation of engineers, which was responsible for many of the most successful military projects of the 1970s and '80s, is aging, and fewer of the nation's top young engineers, software developers and mathematicians are replacing them. Instead, they are joining high-tech companies and other civilian firms that provide not just better pay than the military or its contractors, but also greater cachet -- what one former defense industry engineer called ''geek credit.'' 
 Precise numbers are scarce, but one measure of this shift can be found at the Air Force: Through a combination of budget cuts, the demands of fighting two wars and the difficulty of recruiting and retaining top engineers, officials say, the number of civilian and uniformed engineers on the Air Force's core acquisition staff has fallen 35 percent to 40 percent over the last 14 years. 
 The downsizing ''has taken a toll in our inability to refresh our aging acquisition work force,'' said the Air Force's engineering chief, Jon S. Ogg. 
 When Mr. Kaminski and Mr. Ogg talk about military spending and the decline of engineering management, they tend to use measured, military tones. But with the Pentagon planning to spend $900 billion on development and procurement in the next five years, including $335 billion on major new weapons systems, according to the Government Accountability Office, the depth of their concern is reflected in a rising alarm among many in Washington. 
 At a recent hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee, the chairman, Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, said cost overruns on military projects, while long a problem, had ''reached crisis proportions,'' and he called for the creation of an internal Pentagon office to oversee costs. A recent Government Accountability Office study of 95 military projects worth $1.6 trillion reported projected cost overruns totaling $295 billion, or 40 percent, and an average delay of 21 months. A prime culprit was often deficient engineering management. (By comparison, the study found that the Pentagon's 75 major programs in 2000 were 27 percent over budget and 16 months behind.) 
 ''We're having awful problems with the execution of defense programs,'' said Mr. Kaminski, who was the Pentagon's top acquisition executive from 1994 to 1997. ''It's absolutely critical to start becoming more efficient, more effective.''
 Mr. Kaminski is devoting much of his time as a private citizen to that goal, leading a high-level task force and visiting university campuses and military contractors to proselytize for better engineering management. 
 As he and other experts explain it, the central problem is a breakdown in the most basic element of any big military project: accurately assessing at the outset whether the technological goals are attainable and affordable, then managing the engineering to ensure that hardware and software are properly designed, tested and integrated. 
 The technical term for the discipline is systems engineering. Without it, projects can turn into chaotic, costly failures. 
 Increasingly, that has become the case. What is more, the loss of government expertise has magnified the difficulties associated with another trend: In recent years, the Pentagon has transferred more and more oversight responsibility to its contractors, who themselves often lack sufficient systems-engineering skill and the incentives needed to hold down costs.
 Mr. Kaminski's task force, organized by the National Research Council, an arm of the National Academy of Sciences and National Academy of Engineering, was composed of 18 military experts, working with the Air Force Studies Board, another high-level group. 
 Their report scolded the Air Force as haphazardly handling, or simply ignoring, several basic systems-engineering steps: considering alternative concepts before plunging ahead with a program, setting clear performance goals for a new system and analyzing interactions between technologies. The task force identified several programs that, hobbled by poor engineering management, had run up billions of dollars in overruns while falling behind schedule. Among them were these: 
 A military satellite system designed to detect foreign missile launchings that Mr. Kaminski said was inexplicably designed with two sensors that cannot operate simultaneously on the same spacecraft without extensive, costly shielding to prevent electromagnetic interference generated by one from disabling the other.
 An ambitious Army modernization project, Future Combat Systems, that moved into development before performance requirements were resolved.
 A complex network of communications satellites that the Pentagon started building without a coherent plan for integration with an existing system or a consistent set of requirements to accommodate the needs of the four military services. 
 Mr. Kaminski and other experts see no easy fix, noting that high-level reports and recommendations have piled up over the years with little remedial action by the Pentagon.
 Gen. Bruce Carlson, commander of the Air Force Materiel Command, said he agreed with the panel's recommendations. Responding to questions by e-mail, General Carlson said that every Air Force program was now required to develop a systems engineering plan. In addition, the service has established educational programs for its systems engineers and created a new degree in systems engineering at the Air Force Academy.
 Similarly, naval officials are working with the National Academy of Engineering on a plan to encourage more interest in the sciences in school and improve the Navy's recruitment and retention of engineers, mathematicians and other specialists. And colleges like Georgia Tech and Purdue, responding to the kinds of concerns raised by Mr. Kaminski, are expanding their systems-engineering programs. 
 Still, the military is hard-pressed to compete with the corporate stars of the high-tech era. 
 ''Ten to 20 years ago, many mechanical engineers went into a limited number of industrial sectors, automotive and aerospace -- including defense -- among the largest,'' James D. Jones, associate head of the School of Mechanical Engineering at Purdue, said by e-mail. Recent surveys of Purdue graduates, Mr. Jones said, show engineering students heading into a much broader array of jobs, including finance, management and medicine.
 At M.I.T., a 2007 survey showed that 28.7 percent of undergraduates were headed for work in finance, 13.7 in management consulting and just 7.5 percent in aerospace and defense. The top 10 employers included McKinsey, Google, Morgan Stanley, Lehman Brothers, Bain, JPMorgan and Oracle -- but not a single military contractor or government office. 
 The survey showed that the average annual starting salary in finance and high-tech was more than $70,000, compared with $37,000 at the Defense Department. The average in themilitary industry was $61,000.
 M.I.T. does not have comparable survey data for 10 or 15 years ago, but officials there say the trend is unmistakable. 
 ''Google calls me every other week looking for systems engineers,'' said Donna H. Rhodes, a systems engineering expert at M.I.T. 
 The dean of the College of Engineering at Georgia Tech, Don P. Giddens, noted an additional factor limiting the recruitment of highly trained engineers into military jobs: more than half the engineering doctoral candidates at American universities are from abroad and so are ineligible for most jobs requiring security clearances. 
 Stuart V. Kerr, a software developer with advanced degrees in mathematics and electrical engineering, left the defense industry in 1999 after 10 years to work for a high-tech company. Mr. Kerr said the protracted development time for military projects ''amounts to a professional death sentence'' for scientists and engineers who want to keep up to date with technological advances.
 Mr. Kerr, who now directs computer systems research at the Aerospace Corporation, a federally financed research organization that supports national security space programs, said young engineers were also put off by the multilayer bureaucracies associated with military projects. 
 Gilbert F. Decker, a member of Mr. Kaminski's task force and a former assistant secretary of the Army for research and development, said he, too, understood the appeal of nonmilitary work. In 1999, after retiring from government, he became the top engineering executive at Walt Disney Imagineering, which designs and handles the engineering work at Disney theme parks.
 ''We did the rides, shows, hotels, the whole works,'' Mr. Decker said. 
 Mr. Kaminski has not taken that route. 
 A graduate of the Air Force Academy, he spent most of his career running big military projects, including development of the F-117 fighter and B-2 bomber, the first stealth aircraft. These projects are now regarded as models of technological audacity and successful management. Now 66, he serves as a consultant and is a director of General Dynamics and several other military contractors. He also advises the F.B.I. and the National Reconnaissance Office on technology issues. 
 In his role as an engineering Johnny Appleseed, he uses the history of the F-117 as his gospel. He appeared at the University of California, Los Angeles, in March and at M.I.T. this month and will speak this year at Aurora Flight Sciences, a military contractor in Virginia.
 ''Defense acquisition problems should be the subject of acute concern to Americans,'' Mr. Kaminski said in a recent interview at his home office in Northern Virginia, an array of miniature models of the aircraft he helped develop on the bookshelf. 
 ''This is an area in which our country has enjoyed a fundamental advantage,'' he said. ''It has been vital to our great economic strength, and our strength in national security. If we don't address the problems, those strengths are going to erode. In fact, they are eroding.''
 Mr. Kaminski said that while he was encouraged by the Air Force's response to the task force report and recommendations, he knew even before the service's two top leaders were recently dismissed that some commanders would probably not be around long enough in a new administration to make changes stick.
 ''You can be sure I'll be knocking on the doors of their successors,'' he said.

HEADLINE: He'll Hold His Breath Until You Call Him a Man

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
Spending 80 minutes with Alby Cutrera (Matt McGrath), the insufferable protagonist of ''Full Grown Men,'' a serious road comedy about arrested development, is excruciating enough. But it is hard to imagine why any sane woman would actually marry and have a child with this unemployed 35-year-old cartoonist, who has the emotional maturity of a 10-year-old.
 When first encountered, Alby has a wife, Suzanne (Katie Kreisler), and a little boy, Josh, with whom he likes to play on the floor as if they were the same age. Eventually Suzanne loses patience and throws her husband out of the house, telling him not to come back until he grows up. Alby retreats to the home of his strangely catatonic mother; while there he decides to make a road trip to his childhood mecca, Diggityland, a Florida theme park that suggests Disney World with another name. 
 Alby's rationalization for the trip is his plan to sell his collectible action toys en route. With the thousands he expects to make from the sale, he will show Suzanne that he is a responsible breadwinner.
 This candy-colored movie, whose soft hues match the colored cereal loops that Alby devours at his mother's house, is a post-Freudian fable that wants to be a kind of anti-''Wizard of Oz'' for a culture inundated with toys and toons. Directed by David Munro, who wrote the screenplay with Xandra Castleton, it takes a harder look at the infantilized American male than might appear on the surface. But how true is its guiding assumption that childhood is paradise? 
 Alby travels with his boyhood best friend, Elias Guber (Judah Friedlander), a dour, chubby special education teacher who is headed for Diggityland to accept an award for his work. Along the way they meet bizarre, sometimes sinister variations of Dorothy's traveling companions on the road to Oz. But only one, a gun-toting, disgruntled former employee of Diggityland (Alan Cumming), whom they briefly pick up, actually enters the car. 
 Alby's flight into childhood becomes a paradoxically surreal journey into reality; the more juvenile his behavior, the more savagely the grown-up world slaps him down. As Alby and Elias compare shared boyhood pranks, what was blissful for Alby turns out to have been torture for Elias, whom Alby relentlessly bullied and made the butt of cruel practical jokes. 
 Thematically, the movie parallels Miguel Arteta's 2000 film, ''Chuck & Buck,'' whose screenwriter, Mike White, played another young man afflicted with arrested development who drives across the country in the crazy expectation of resuming the homoerotic relationship he enjoyed with his best friend, now married, when they were boys. 
 Besides the hitchhiker, the scariest person Alby encounters on the trip is Trina (Amy Sedaris), a bartender and aspiring circus clown, who enlists a group of midgets to beat him up when he can't pay his bar bill. Deborah Harry has a cameo as a former professional mermaid living a solitary existence in an Airstream trailer and is a sad image of what Alby might become if he doesn't snap out of his fantasy. 
 The most hopeful sign that Alby can save himself is his touching relationship with Rollie (Benjamin Karpf), a student of Elias, with whom Alby intuitively empathizes. But there are not enough such redemptive moments to make Mr. McGrath's Alby any less grating a screen presence than one of Jim Carrey's maniacs. And Alby isn't even funny.

HEADLINE: White House Refused to Open E-Mail on Pollutants

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

 BODY:
The White House in December refused to accept the Environmental Protection Agency's conclusion that greenhouse gases are pollutants that must be controlled, telling agency officials that an e-mail message containing the document would not be opened, senior E.P.A. officials said last week.
 The document, which ended up in e-mail limbo, without official status, was the E.P.A.'s answer to a 2007 Supreme Court ruling that required it to determine whether greenhouse gases represent a danger to health or the environment, the officials said. 
 This week, more than six months later, the E.P.A. is set to respond to that order by releasing a watered-down version of the original proposal that offers no conclusion. Instead, the document reviews the legal and economic issues presented by declaring greenhouse gases a pollutant. 
 Over the past five days, the officials said, the White House successfully put pressure on the E.P.A. to eliminate large sections of the original analysis that supported regulation, including a finding that tough regulation of motor vehicle emissions could produce $500 billion to $2 trillion in economic benefits over the next 32 years. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter. 
 Both documents, as prepared by the E.P.A., ''showed that the Clean Air Act can work for certain sectors of the economy, to reduce greenhouse gases,'' one of the senior E.P.A. officials said. ''That's not what the administration wants to show. They want to show that the Clean Air Act can't work.'' 
 The Bush administration's climate-change policies have been evolving over the past two years. It now accepts the work of government scientists studying global warming, such as last week's review forecasting more drenching rains, parching droughts and intense hurricanes as global temperatures warm (www.climatescience.gov). 
 But no administration decisions have supported the regulation of greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act or other environmental laws.
 Tony Fratto, a White House spokesman, refused to comment on discussions between the White House and the Environmental Protection Agency. Asked about changes in the original report, Mr. Fratto said, ''It's the E.P.A. that determines what analysis it wants to make available'' in its documents. 
 The new document, a road map laying out the issues involved in regulation, is to be signed by Stephen L. Johnson, the agency's administrator, and published as early as Wednesday.
 The derailment of the original E.P.A. report was first made known in March by Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. The refusal to open the e-mail has not been made public. 
 In early December, the E.P.A.'s draft finding that greenhouse gases endanger the environment used Energy Department data from 2007 to conclude that it would be cost effective to require the nation's motor vehicle fleet to average 37.7 miles per gallon in 2018, according to government officials familiar with the document. 
 About 10 days after the finding was left unopened by officials at the Office of Management and Budget, Congress passed and President Bush signed a new energy bill mandating an increase in average fuel-economy standards to 35 miles per gallon by 2020. The day the law was signed, the E.P.A. administrator rejected the unanimous recommendation of his staff and denied California a waiver needed to regulate vehicle emissions of greenhouse gases in the state, saying the new law's approach was preferable and climate change required global, not regional, solutions.
 California's regulations would have imposed tougher standards.
 The Transportation Department made its own fuel-economy proposals public almost two months ago; they were based on the assumption that gasoline would range from $2.26 per gallon in 2016 to $2.51 per gallon in 2030, and set a maximum average standard of 35 miles per gallon in 2020. 
 The White House, which did not oppose the Transportation Department proposals, has become more outspoken on the need for a comprehensive approach to greenhouse gases, specifically rejecting possible controls deriving from older environmental laws.
 In a speech in April, Mr. Bush called for an end to the growth of greenhouse gases by 2025 -- a timetable slower than many scientists say is required. His chairman of the Council of Environmental Quality, James Connaughton, said a ''train wreck'' would result if regulations to control greenhouse gases were authorized piecemeal under laws like the Clean Air Act and the Endangered Species Act.
 White House pressure to ignore or edit the E.P.A.'s climate-change findings led to the resignation of one agency official earlier this month: Jason Burnett, the associate deputy administrator. Mr. Burnett, a political appointee with broad authority over climate-change regulations, said in an interview that he had resigned because ''no more constructive work could be done'' on the agency's response to the Supreme Court. 
 He added, ''The next administration will have to face what this one did not.'' 
 The House Select Committee for Energy Independence and Global Warming, led by Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, has been seeking the discarded E.P.A. finding on the dangers of climate change. 
 After reading it last week, Mr. Markey's office sent a letter to Mr. Bush saying, ''E.P.A. Administrator Stephen Johnson determined that man-made global warming is unequivocal, the evidence is compelling and robust, and the administration must act to prevent harm rather than wait for harm to occur.''
 Simultaneously, Mr. Waxman's committee is weighing its response to the White House's refusal to turn over subpoenaed documents relating to the E.P.A.'s handling of recent climate-change and air-pollution decisions. The White House, which has turned over other material to the committee, last week asserted a claim of executive privilege over the remaining documents. 
 In an interview on Sunday, Mr. Fratto, the White House spokesman, said the committee chairmen did not understand the legal precedent underlying executive privilege. ''There is a long legal history supporting the principle that the president should have the candid advice of his advisers,'' Mr. Fratto said.

HEADLINE: NYSE Buys 25% Stake In Exchange In Qatar

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
NYSE Euronext agreed on Tuesday to buy a 25 percent stake in the Qatar securities market, gaining a lead in the race against its British and German rivals to become a truly global stock exchange at a time when growth has slowed in their home markets. 
 NYSE, which is based in New York and owns several European exchanges, will pay $250 million in cash for the stake in the Doha Securities Market and gain a foothold in the fast-growing Middle Eastern economy. NYSE Euronext beat the London Stock Exchange, which counts Qatar's investment authority among its shareholders, and Deutsche Borse in a six-month takeover competition. 
 ''There is no doubt that in the medium to long term, the Middle Eastern markets will grow faster than the West, and the idea to buy into it is a good one, but it also has to make economical sense,'' said Colin Morton, a fund manager at Rensburg Fund Management in Leeds, England. 
 NYSE shares rose 60 cents, to $56.72.
 Stock markets are combining or buying stakes in one another to meet clients' demands to trade shares anywhere and at a faster pace. The recent turmoil in the credit markets increased the pressure to look for growth in less-developed markets as trading in many of the more established markets slowed and fewer companies sold shares in initial public offerings.
 NYSE announced in January that it would pay $115 million for 5 percent in the National Stock Exchange in India, and Dubai ended up with minority stakes in Nasdaq OMX and the London exchange as part of the takeover battle.
 As part of the investment in the Doha exchange, NYSE Euronext will help Qatar build an internationally integrated cash and derivatives exchange and provide technology and management know-how. 
 The investment is intended to help Qatar compete with Dubai in the battle to become the financial center of the region as countries in the area look to reduce their dependency on natural resources. The Qatari government plans to sell a minority stake of the Doha exchange in an initial offering in the next three years.
 ''This partnership lays the foundations for us to build Doha into a world-class financial center,'' Sheik Hamad bin Jasim bin Jabir al-Thani, the Qatari prime minister and minister of foreign affairs, said in a statement.
 NYSE Euronext will get 3 of 11 seats on the Doha exchange's board and Doha will become a business hub for NYSE Euronext in the Middle East, the exchange said.
 ''It is a great privilege to align NYSE Euronext with Qatar and Doha's financial marketplace, whose role is increasingly important in the Gulf region and globally,'' the chief executive of NYSE Euronext, Duncan L. Niederauer, said in a statement.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Dealing With Solar Policy's Success

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

 BODY:
With oil prices skyrocketing, demand for solar power is booming. And New Jersey, which has used a rebate program to help install more solar panels than any other state but California, is getting burned by its own success. 
 There is a backlog of more than 700 applications for the rebates, and property owners have to wait months, even years, to get solar panels installed. The program, which is paid for by surcharges on all utility bills, has been shut down several times over the last three years because applications far outpaced rebate money. Some solar installation companies have had to lay off workers while they waited for rebate checks to be sent.
 All this has convinced New Jersey regulators that it is time to wean solar energy from public subsidies altogether. The state plans to replace rebates with energy credits that can be bought and sold on the open market. 
 As it works out the details of the transition, New Jersey -- not the place most people associate with solar innovations -- finds itself at the forefront of a growing national debate about the role of government in helping stimulate this sector of the energy economy. 
 New York, Colorado, Maryland and several other states with incentive programs are considering whether to scale back public subsidies so solar power can compete more extensively in an open market. And they are confronting another difficult question: Is that best done by turning to a few large companies, or sticking with smaller businesses that can create more local jobs?
 ''Obviously, big systems get us to our goals much faster, but we want everybody to participate,'' said Jeanne M. Fox, president of New Jersey's Board of Public Utilities, which proposed the changes and is expected to give them final approval next month. 
 Ms. Fox said she believes it will be possible to phase out rebates, create a secure market for trading energy credits, welcome large solar system operators and still protect many -- if not all -- small installers. 
 But some of those smaller operators think the proposed transition will replace a proven success with an untested experiment from which they -- the entrepreneurs who started the solar boom with the help of rebates -- will be excluded. 
 ''The state wants to build a market to suit big companies that have access to huge sources of capital,'' said Bill Hoey, managing member of N.J. Solar Power L.L.C., a $10 million company. ''They could just crush the mid- and small-size market.'' 
 At SunEdison, one of the largest installers in the state and the nation, Mark R. Culpepper, the vice president for strategic marketing, enthusiastically supports New Jersey's transition. He called it ''a pretty normal market evolution'' in which ''very small players will probably go away, while small to mid-sized companies will be acquired by others or go into specific niche markets where they can specialize.''
 Similar conflicts are arising all over the country, but the battle is most clearly drawn in New Jersey, where state officials feel compelled to act decisively. 
 Under a state energy master plan, solar power should account for 2.12 percent of New Jersey's electricity by 2020. But even though more than 3,100 residential and commercial solar systems have been installed during the six years the state has offered rebates, they generate only 0.07 percent of current energy needs.
 To reach even that, New Jersey has handed out more than $170 million in rebates. The Board of Public Utilities has estimated that if rebate rates remained unchanged, it would cost nearly $11 billion to get to the 2020 goal. According to state calculations, that would add about 7.5 percent to New Jersey electricity rates, which are already among the highest in the country.
 ''We need to do things differently because ratepayers can't keep paying for rebates indefinitely,'' Ms. Fox said. 
 Rebates, which have averaged $20,000 for residential projects and more than $1 million for large commercial installations, would virtually end this year under the state's plan. A limited number for small residential projects producing less than 10 kilowatts would be phased out over the next four years.
 In their place, the state would turn to a program it started several years ago that issues energy credits. The concept is simple: Solar projects generate energy credits every year, and the state requires utility companies like PSE&G to buy them to offset carbon emissions from their power plants and to help meet renewable-energy targets. By purchasing credits, the utilities do not actually generate solar power, but they offset the cost of installing and operating solar equipment.
 New Jersey plans to greatly expand the program by allowing the credits to be bought and sold like commodities, with long-term contracts and prices set by the open market. 
 Regulators say that will be fairer to ratepayers and help the state reach its renewable-energy goals faster. They also say the plan provides safeguards for small installers and ensures competition by prohibiting any company from capturing more than 20 percent of a utility's yearly credits. 
 But the small companies fear that large businesses are poised to take particular advantage of the credit system. Being bigger, they can handle more credits, cover more long-term commitments and secure more advantageous financing than mom-and-pop operations. 
 SunEdison, based in Maryland, has already made inroads in New Jersey using a new approach -- called power purchase agreements -- that smaller companies do not have the capital to duplicate. 
 Under those agreements, which the state first allowed in 2004, property owners do not have to buy or operate their solar projects, or handle the sale of energy credits. Instead, they avoid all up-front costs by contracting with SunEdison or other large companies, and bill property owners at fixed rates that are lower than utility company rates. 
 SunEdison has put up more than 22 solar systems in New Jersey, along with dozens in others states, mostly for large retail companies like Kohl's.
 Experts say these purchase agreements can promote the move to solar power. And regulators hope that a vibrant market for energy credits will speed that growth to the point where solar power can compete with conventionally generated electricity.
 But Lyle K. Rawlings, president of Advanced Solar Products, in Hopewell, N.J., and vice president of the Mid-Atlantic Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group, said those attempts to make the solar market more competitive could backfire, actually hindering competition by squeezing out smaller companies.
 He said that the state's proposed safeguards did not go nearly far enough. While a portion of new projects would be subject for a few years to caps on how many credits one company can control, he said, those caps would not apply to existing solar installations. 
 ''The model they're creating is overcomplicated, fraught with uncertainty and really doesn't protect the small installers who've created this industry,'' Mr. Rawlings said. He said his own company had laid off 4 of its 15 workers in the last few months, and several New Jersey solar companies had gone out of business. ''This is going to lead to a kind of unhealthy market concentration and chaos, like what's already happened in other states.''
 Blake Jones, president of Namaste Solar Electric, in Boulder, Colo., and a board member of the Colorado Solar Energy Industries Association, said his state was considering changes similar to New Jersey's.
 He said a major goal of solar incentive programs is creating green jobs. ''On a per-kilowatt basis, more jobs, more local business and more rural economic development is created by small projects and small businesses than medium or large ones,'' he said. 
 In Maryland, installers hope to persuade regulators to raise the value of energy credits in order to provide more income for small companies.
 New York is several steps behind the other states in developing its solar market because of regulations that have limited solar installations to small-scale residential projects. Installers there are watching what happens in New Jersey because they expect to enter a similar debate in the next few years.

HEADLINE: Citigroup Considers Repealing a Pledge, And the Slogan With It

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH; Jenny Anderson contributed reporting.

 BODY:
LAST year Citigroup made a promise to millions of people who flex its credit cards: ''A deal is a deal.'' The slogan was used to trumpet an announcement that the financial giant would no longer reserve the right to raise interest rates on cards at any time, for any reason. 
 But Citigroup's deal is only a deal until it isn't. The company is quietly reconsidering its pledge as it confronts a host of financial troubles, according to Citigroup executives. A decision could come this week. Samuel Wang, a spokesman for Citigroup, declined to comment. 
 Several Citigroup executives emphasized the ''deal is a deal'' slogan before members of Congress and to consumer groups. The pledge helped Citigroup fend off greater regulation of the card industry and distinguished the company as an industry leader. 
 As part of the promise, Citigroup said it would abandon a practice known as ''universal default,'' in which card issuers raise a holder's rate when that person is late paying any bill, even one unrelated to the credit card account. Citigroup also said it would no longer reserve the right to raise rates at any time, although it retained the right to raise them every two years, when cards are renewed. The pledge was never intended to be good for the life of an account.
 Citigroup said the only reason it would raise rates or fees would be if customers paid late, exceeded credit limits or bounced checks when paying. The bank received public kudos from its harshest critics and lawmakers.
 Senators Christopher J. Dodd and Barney Frank, both Democrats, applauded Citigroup. Senator Norm Coleman, a Republican, said Citigroup ''deserves praise for its announcement . . . that, in its words, 'A deal is a deal.' ''
 Longtime rivals like Chase Card Services followed Citigroup in announcing they would abandon universal default. No banks, however, joined it in eliminating the ''any time, for any reason'' clause. 
 But now Citigroup, with the entire financial industry, is struggling to shore up its finances. The company has taken more than $40 billion in write-offs during the last year, largely because of investments linked to mortgages. The credit card business, meantime, is starting to stumble because of the slack economy. Americans are falling behind on card bills in growing numbers. And after years of staving off federal banking regulators and Congress, credit card lenders are facing tough new rules that are intended to protect consumers but would also limit the money they could make from customers deemed bigger risks.
 Last year's pledge put Citigroup in a bind. The company missed out on revenue that it would have gained from raising rates for certain customers. And new rules recently proposed by the Federal Reserve and the Office of Thrift Supervision would further limit the bank's flexibility to increase rates of riskier customers.
 Traditionally, credit card lenders could increase the interest rate on both an existing balance as well as on any new debt. The proposed rules would limit rate increases to customers late by 30 or more days, and the new rates would apply prospectively to newly accumulated debts.
 In any case, the ''Deal Is a Deal'' policy did not give Citigroup the edge it hoped for. Most customers did not recognize the benefit, in part because of the difficulty deciphering the fine print among offers from different banks. 
 ''We hoped and expected that these two points of differentiation would lead customers to vote with their feet,'' John P. Carey, the chief administrative officer for Citigroup's credit card unit, told a Congressional panel in April. ''We have been disappointed with the results we have seen so far.''

HEADLINE: Illinois Suit Set Against Countrywide

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
The Illinois attorney general is suing Countrywide Financial, the troubled mortgage lender, and Angelo R. Mozilo, its chief executive, contending that the company and its executives defrauded borrowers in the state by selling them costly and defective loans that quickly went into foreclosure. 
 The lawsuit, which is expected to be filed on Wednesday in Illinois state court, accused Countrywide and Mr. Mozilo of relaxing underwriting standards, structuring loans with risky features, and misleading consumers with hidden fees and fake marketing claims, like its heavily advertised ''no closing costs loan.'' Countrywide also created incentives for its employees and brokers to sell questionable loans by paying them more on such sales, the complaint said. 
 In reviewing one Illinois mortgage broker's sales of Countrywide loans, the complaint said the ''vast majority of the loans had inflated income, almost all without the borrower's knowledge.''
 The civil lawsuit asks for an unspecified amount of monetary damages and requests that the court require Countrywide to rescind or reform all the questionable loans it sold from 2004 through the present. The attorney general, Lisa Madigan, also asked that Mr. Mozilo contribute personally to the damages and that the court give her office 90 days to review loans serviced by Countrywide that were in foreclosure or soon would be. 
 ''People were put into loans they did not understand, could not afford and could not get out of,'' Ms. Madigan said. ''This mounting disaster has had an impact on individual homeowners statewide and is having an impact on the global economy. It is all from the greed of people like Angelo Mozilo.'' 
 The lawsuit adds to the considerable legal risks facing Bank of America as it prepares to absorb Countrywide in a takeover announced in January. Countrywide and its executives have been named as defendants in shareholder lawsuits, and the company's practices are the subject of investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the F.B.I. and the Federal Trade Commission, which oversees loan servicing companies. 
 The United States Trustee, a unit of the Justice Department that monitors the bankruptcy system, has also sued Countrywide, contending that its loan servicing practices represent an abuse of the bankruptcy system.
 Countrywide did not respond to an e-mail message seeking comment. A Bank of America spokesman declined to comment. 
 Countrywide, once the nation's top mortgage lender, has watched its fortunes plummet as the housing crisis has spread across the country. In the last three quarters, the company reported $2.5 billion in losses, and in the first quarter of 2008, total nonperforming assets reached $6 billion, almost five times that of the same period last year.
 When Bank of America announced its stock-for-stock deal to buy Countrywide, the acquisition was valued at more than $4 billion. Because shares of both companies have fallen, the transaction is worth $2.8 billion. 
 The Illinois complaint was derived from 111,000 pages of Countrywide documents and interviews with former employees. It paints a picture of a lending machine that was more concerned with volume of loans than quality. 
 For example, former employees told Illinois investigators that Countrywide's pay structure encouraged them to make as many loans as they could; some reduced-documentation loans took as little as 30 minutes to underwrite, the complaint said. 
 The lawsuit cited Countrywide documents indicating that almost 60 percent of its borrowers in subprime adjustable rate mortgages requiring minimal payments in the early years, known as hybrid A.R.M.'s, would not have qualified at the full payment rate. Countrywide also acknowledged that almost 25 percent of the borrowers would not have qualified for any other mortgage product that it sold.
 Even more surprising, Ms. Madigan said, was her office's discovery of e-mail messages automatically sent by Countrywide to its borrowers offering complimentary loan reviews one year after they obtained their mortgages from the company. 
 ''Happy Anniversary!'' the e-mail messages stated. ''Many home values skyrocketed over the past year. That means that you may have thousands of dollars of home equity to borrow from at rates much lower than most credit cards.''
 Ms. Madigan said, ''I was just struck that on the first anniversary of these people's loans they would get these e-mails luring them into a refinance, into another unaffordable product to generate more fees and originate more loans.''
 The complaint also described dubious practices in Countrywide's huge servicing arm, which oversees $1.5 trillion in loans. For example, an Illinois consumer whose Countrywide mortgage was in foreclosure came home to find that the company had changed her locks and boarded up her home, the suit said, although no judgment had been entered and no foreclosure sale conducted. It took a week for the homeowner to regain access to her home, the complaint said. 
 Ms. Madigan began investigating Countrywide after her office sued One Source Mortgage, a Chicago mortgage broker that shut down last year. Countrywide was One Source's primary lender, according to that lawsuit. Ms. Madigan also said that her office had received 200 customer complaints about Countrywide.
 For 2004 through 2006, Countrywide was the largest lender in Illinois, selling about 94,000 loans to consumers in the state, the complaint said. The company operated about 100 retail branch offices in Illinois and its loans were offered by many mortgage brokers licensed to do business there. Countrywide also purchased loans through a network of 2,100 correspondent lenders in the state.

HEADLINE: Obama and McCain Joust Over Oil Drilling

BYLINE: By MICHAEL POWELL and MICHAEL COOPER; Michael Powell reported from Las Vegas, and Michael Cooper from Santa Barbara, Calif.

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS 

 BODY:
Senator Barack Obama took a poke at his Republican opponent on Tuesday, saying that for Senator John McCain to talk of a ''psychological benefit'' from expanded offshore drilling is to define that policy as a gimmick.
 Mr. Obama was responding to remarks that Mr. McCain made on Monday in Fresno, Calif., when he observed that even though the nation might take years to benefit from offshore drilling, ''exploiting those reserves would have psychological impact that I think is beneficial.'' 
 Mr. Obama seized on those comments while speaking at a town hall-style meeting here.
 '' 'Psychological impact'?'' Mr. Obama said. ''In case you're wondering, that's Washington-speak for 'It polls well.' '' 
 He added, ''It's an example of how Washington politicians try to convince you that they did something to make your life better when they really didn't.'' 
 Asked in Riverside, Calif., about his remarks on the psychological effects of lifting the moratorium on offshore drilling, Mr. McCain said: ''I think Americans want hope. They want some trust and confidence.''
 The electoral energy wars have raged from Florida -- where Mr. McCain has proposed offshore oil drilling -- to California and now Las Vegas. The candidates are trying to define how they would tackle the sharp spiral upward in gasoline prices and its ever more severe impact on the economy, and so far their policy proposals are poles apart.
 Mr. McCain emphasizes greatly expanded drilling, offshore and on public lands. And he would revitalize the nearly moribund nuclear power industry, noting that France draws much of its energy from nuclear plants. 
 He suffered a bit of an embarrassment on Tuesday in Santa Barbara, Calif., as he heard his own invited panelist, Michael Feeney, executive director of the Land Trust for Santa Barbara, worry aloud about offshore drilling. ''It makes me nervous to think about those who are proposing to drain America's offshore oil and gas reserves as quickly as possible in the hopes of driving down the price of gasoline,'' Mr. Feeney said.
 Mr. McCain noted that Republican governors were divided on his proposal, with Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California opposed and Gov. Charlie Crist of Florida in favor. 
 Mr. Obama illustrated the gap between the candidates by giving a speech at a water plant in Las Vegas that laid heavy emphasis on $150 billion worth of alternative energy, including wind and solar power and hoped-for clean coal technology (Mr. Obama acknowledged, in response to a question, that he was not ruling out nuclear power, but he strongly suggested it was a distinctly lower priority). He asserted that these investments in technology would yield five million new jobs.
 He also proposed to charge oil companies an undefined fee for every acre that they lease but fail to drill on. Oil companies now lease but are not drilling on about 68 million acres, according to the Obama campaign. 
 ''If that compels them to drill, we'll get more oil,'' Mr. Obama said. ''If it doesn't, the fees will go toward more investment in renewable sources of energy.''
 The goal, Mr. Obama said, would be to catch and replicate the success of the world leaders in this field.
 ''Germany, a country as cloudy as the Pacific Northwest, is now a world leader in the solar power industry and the quarter-million new jobs it has created,'' Mr. Obama said. ''To truly harness its potential, we urgently need real leadership from Washington -- leadership that has been missing for decades.'' 
 He also poked fun at Mr. McCain's proposals, specifically his suggestion to establish a $300 million prize for the scientist who could come up with a long-lasting car battery. ''When John F. Kennedy decided that we were going to put a man on the Moon, he didn't put a bounty out for some rocket scientist to win,'' he said. ''He put the full resources of the United States government behind the project.''
 Mr. McCain lashed back at Mr. Obama when speaking in Riverside. 
 ''On this energy issue, yeah, it's easy to say 'no' to everything,'' Mr. McCain said. ''That's what Senator Obama is doing. We've got to come forward with bold proposals, innovative ones, and ones that will bring this nation to energy independence for national security reasons as well as others.''

HEADLINE: South Korea Close to Allowing U.S. Beef Imports to Resume

BYLINE: By REUTERS

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea 

 BODY:
-- South Korea will allow the resumption of beef imports from the United States starting Thursday, the governing party said on Wednesday, carrying through with an unpopular deal that set off weeks of street protests and caused a crisis for the government. 
 Analysts expect South Korea to proceed with caution in resuming the imports because any misstep by President Lee Myung-bak could lead to a sharp backlash and further delay his pro-business economic reforms.
 South Korea and the United States last weekend said they had reached a deal to restrict trade in American to cattle under 30 months old and forbid exports of parts that are thought to pose a higher risk of mad cow disease.
 Once the legal notice for the resumption is published on Thursday, beef from the United States that has been in frozen storage in South Korea for months can be inspected and then head to stores.
 South Korean officials said the reworked pact would increase safety checks on American beef, but hours after it was announced a violent rally erupted in central Seoul with protesters smashing police buses blocking the way to the presidential Blue House.
 Mr. Lee, who took office in February, suffered a plummet in his popularity when his government signed a deal in April to allow the import of American beef from cattle of all ages. 
 The deal was intended to end a five-year-old ban prompted by South Korean concerns after a case of mad cow was found in the United States.
 The government sought to rework the deal to allay public concerns about the threat from mad cow disease, which can cause a rare but fatal brain-wasting disease in humans.
 Last week, Mr. Lee apologized for the original agreement, promised a fresh start for his four-month-old government and fired most of his top aides.
 On Tuesday, he ordered tough action against protesters who break the law.

HEADLINE: America's Next Chapter

BYLINE: By GARY HART. 
Gary Hart, a former Democratic senator from Colorado, is the author, most recently, of ''Under the Eagle's Wing: A National Security Strategy of the United States for 2009.''

DATELINE: Kittredge, Colo. 

 BODY:
 THE novelties of race and gender have largely distracted the nation from the more profound aspect of the 2008 presidential election: This campaign presents the potential for a new cycle of American history.
 The idea that American politics moves in cycles is usually associated with the historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr., but it has an even longer currency. Ralph Waldo Emerson noted the political oscillations between the party of memory and the party of hope, the party of conservatism and the party of innovation. Henry Adams believed that ''a period of about 12 years measured the beat of the pendulum'' during the era of the founders. Schlesinger, borrowing from his historian father, estimated that the swings between eras of public action and those of private interest were nearer to 30 years.
 What matters more than the length of the cycles is that these swings, between what Schlesinger called periods of reform and periods of consolidation, clearly occur. If we somewhat arbitrarily fix the age of Franklin D. Roosevelt as 1932 to 1968 and the era of Ronald Reagan as 1968 to 2008, a new cycle of American political history -- a cycle of reform -- is due. 
 The Republican coalition -- composed of the religious right on social issues, the radical tax cutters or ''supply-siders'' on economic issues, and the neoconservatives on foreign policy -- has produced only superficial religiosity, a failed war and record deficits. Traditional conservatives, who are dedicated to resistance to government intrusion into private lives, fiscal discipline and caution on military interventions, have yet to re-emerge, and may not. The character of the next Republican Party will result from an intraparty debate that has yet to begin and might occupy a decade or more.
 Democrats, meanwhile, have yet to produce a coherent ideological framework to replace the New Deal, despite an eight-year experiment in ''triangulation'' and an undefined ''centrism.'' Once elected, Barack Obama would have a rare opportunity to define a new Democratic Party. He could preside over the beginning of a new political cycle that, if relevant to the times, would dominate American politics for three or four decades to come.
 Senator Obama has two choices. He can focus on winning the election to the exclusion of all else and, like Robert Redford in ''The Candidate,'' ask, ''What do we do now?'' after it is over. Or he can use his campaign as a platform for designing a new political cycle and achieve a mandate for starting it. 
 Noting the power of ''custom and fear,'' and ''of orthodoxy and of complacency,'' Schlesinger believed that ''the subversion of old ideas by the changing environment'' would give a new leader the best chance to create a new cycle of reform and innovation.
 No individual can entirely determine the architecture of a historical cycle. But much of the next one will be defined by how we grapple with a host of new realities, ones that reach beyond jihadist terrorism. They include globalized markets; the expansion of the information revolution into places like China; the emergence of new world powers including India and China; climate deterioration; failing states; the changing nature of war; mass migrations; the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; viral pandemics; and many more.
 Senator Obama's attempt to introduce the next American cycle should include, at minimum, three elements. National security requires a new, expanded, post-cold-war definition. America must transition from a consumer economy to a producing one. And the moral obligations of our stewardship of the planet must become paramount. 
 These themes and the policies that flow from them, if made the centerpiece of the 2008 election (perhaps along with alternatives that others might suggest), could produce the mandate required to begin a new historical cycle. This post-New Deal, post-Morning in America era would be more in tune with the current century and its realities than the continued political circling that confuses most Americans, who repeatedly and overwhelmingly report that they know America is adrift. 
 They are right. And they are right because they instinctively realize that old politics, old parties and old policies are increasingly irrelevant to our lives, to our revolutionary times and to our country's future. The next cycle of American history is as yet unframed, awaiting a national leader who can define a new role for government at home and a new role for America in the world of the 21st century.

HEADLINE: Bronx Groups Demand a Voice in a Landmark's Revival

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

 BODY:
Residents of the northwest Bronx have long taken a proprietary interest in the Kingsbridge Armory, a huge city-owned Romanesque-style fortress that looms over the elevated subway tracks on Jerome Avenue. 
 Hundreds of people mobilized against a redevelopment plan in 2000 because it did not include classrooms to alleviate severe overcrowding in the local schools. The plan eventually died. 
 Then, local groups helped persuade the city to spend $31 million replacing the roof and making other repairs to the red brick structure, which has not been used for more than a decade.
 Now community organizers in the area, one of the city's poorest neighborhoods, are seeking a private contract with the Related Companies, the developer chosen by the city in April to transform the Kingsbridge Armory into a shopping mall with 575,000 square feet of retail space, including a department store, a multiscreen movie theater and restaurants. 
 The Kingsbridge Armory Redevelopment Alliance, a coalition of 19 community, church and labor groups, said it would withhold its support for the $310 million project unless Related guaranteed specified wage and hiring standards for workers and tenants. The groups are also seeking athletic and recreational space, room for cultural programs and social services and opportunities for local entrepreneurs. 
 ''We know how much the stores are going to make off this community,'' said Ronn Jordan, an alliance leader and a vice president of the Northwest Bronx Community and Clergy Coalition, a group formed in 1974. ''We want to make sure they are not exploiting us.'' 
 In recent years, a growing number of private pacts, known as community benefits agreements, or C.B.A.'s, have smoothed the way for developments around the country, including Related's Grand Avenue project in downtown Los Angeles.
 But only a few such agreements have been forged in New York. In 2005, the Bloomberg administration publicly applauded a private agreement between housing advocates and Forest City Ratner, the developer of Atlantic Yards in Brooklyn, but now it no longer supports the concept. 
 ''When you do a C.B.A., the decision may be made in a vacuum, and that's what we're looking to avoid,'' Seth W. Pinsky, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, said in an interview last week. ''We're not opposed to benefits for the community, and we're not opposed to community involvement. But we just think it should be part of the larger process.''
 He said the city's land-use process ''gives ample opportunity for the community's voice to be heard.'' Proposals are reviewed by the local community board, whose members are appointed by the borough president and the City Council member representing the district. The board's powers are only advisory.
 The city's stance is shortsighted, said Julian Gross, a San Francisco lawyer who directs the legal program of the Partnership for Working Families, an advocacy organization. ''They should see a private benefits agreement as a way to give a project a huge boost in terms of public perception and community support,'' said Mr. Gross, who advised the Kingsbridge alliance.
 Mr. Pinsky said that members of the Kingsbridge alliance have been included in discussions about the armory from the outset, and their concerns were reflected in the 2006 document asking for proposals from developers. 
 The document said, for example, that the city would ''look favorably'' on proposals that maximized the number of jobs paying $10 an hour or more, and developers were ''strongly encouraged'' to make space available at reduced rents for community uses.
 But Mr. Jordan said the Kingsbridge alliance, known as KARA, needs guarantees. ''For KARA to support this project, we need to have an enforceable agreement between KARA and the developer,'' said Mr. Jordan, who has been involved with the armory since 1995. 
 Completed in 1917, the armory occupies a full block from Jerome Avenue to Reservoir Avenue and West 195th Street to Kingsbridge Road. The main drill hall measures 300 feet by 600 feet and is spanned by vaulted steel trusses that rise 110 feet above the floor. 
 The building, which also contains a grand 35,000-square-foot entrance with a vaulted ceiling known as a head-house, is a federal, state and city landmark.
 Though the nearby schools are still so crowded that parking lots are used as playgrounds, the armory is unsuitable for a school, city officials say. Two new schools could be built next to the armory if two state-owned auxiliary buildings along 195th Street that are now used by the National Guard were torn down. Mr. Pinsky said the city was trying to find new quarters for the Guard, but classrooms are not part of the Related project.
 Related has already negotiated one community benefits agreement in the Bronx, for its Gateway Center at Bronx Terminal Market, a big-box shopping center that is under construction. But that agreement -- like a handful of others that have been made in New York -- has drawn criticism from advocates and scholars for being weaker than those in other states. At Gateway Center, only three local groups were parties to the agreement and few obligations were actually imposed on Related, Mr. Gross said. 
 Glenn Goldstein, the president of Related Retail, bristled at the criticism. ''I'm not sure there has been another project that has been as responsive to the needs and desires of the community,'' he said. He pledged that Related would be just as responsive to the armory community, whether or not there is a benefits agreement. ''We'll be spending a lot of time with the community board,'' he said. ''That's just part of how we develop projects.'' 
 Gregory Faulkner, the chairman of the Community Board 7, whose area includes the armory, said it was now up to his board to assume a leadership role. ''There are more voices than KARA,'' he said.
 Mr. Faulkner said many people in the community want the new mall to include a ''top notch'' food market, something that is not on the alliance's agenda. 
 Jeffrey Eichler, a coordinator for the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union/UFCW, said one of the alliance's objectives was to avoid harming existing businesses, including the Associated Supermarket on Jerome Avenue, opposite the armory, which is unionized.
 Disagreement over a single issue should not rule out a benefits agreement, said Patricia E. Salkin, the director of the Government Law Center of the Albany Law School. ''Some of the things that could be the subject of a C.B.A. may not wind up being in the C.B.A.,'' she said. ''But that doesn't mean you can't have a C.B.A.'' 
 The Kingsbridge alliance will not be the only group in New York resisting the city's opposition to benefits agreements. In East Harlem, Community Board 11 was asked to approve a plan for a mixed-use development on East 125th Street without knowing who the developer would be and, therefore, without having a chance to negotiate for benefits, including wage and hiring guarantees, said Robert Rodriguez, the board chairman. The board recently rejected the plan.
 Mr. Pinsky said the developer for that project would soon be selected.
 ''I think there's definite value to having a C.B.A.,'' Mr. Rodriguez said. ''The city is not going to be the best negotiator for community benefits. The community needs to negotiate its own agreement independently.''

HEADLINE: approval is near for bill to help u.s. homeowners

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; Robert Pear contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
With sinking home values continuing to drag down the economy, Congress is poised to approve a huge package of housing legislation, including a refinancing program aimed at rescuing hundreds of thousands of homeowners in danger of foreclosure and the most sweeping government overhaul of mortgage financing since the New Deal. 
 Lawmakers moved with increasing urgency on Tuesday after a closely watched housing index showed prices nationally had declined in April by more than 15 percent from a year earlier. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, threatened to keep the Senate in session through the Fourth of July holiday to finish the housing measure, if needed. The House has already approved similar legislation. 
 The centerpiece of the Senate package is a rescue-refinancing plan aimed at stemming the tide of more than 8,000 new foreclosures a day that lenders are filing across the country. The plan would allow distressed borrowers and their lenders to stem losses by allowing qualified owners to refinance into more affordable, 30-year fixed-rate loans with a federal guarantee. 
 The legislation would also provide benefits for first-time buyers, who would receive a refundable tax credit of up to $8,000, or 10 percent of the value of a home, on purchases of unoccupied housing. 
 As part of a regulatory overhaul of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage finance giants, the bill would permanently increase to $625,000, from $417,000, the limit on loans they can purchase from lenders in expensive housing markets, making it easier for borrowers to obtain mortgages at discounted rates. Despite a presidential veto threat, the package received overwhelming bipartisan support, clearing by 83 to 9 a crucial procedural vote in the Senate on Tuesday morning. 
 Final passage of the bill was snagged temporarily in the Senate Tuesday evening because of a fight over renewable energy tax credits. Still, major supporters of the bill said they hoped it would be completed before for the holiday. 
 ''There's a great desire to act,'' said Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, the bill's main author in the House. ''We're just not there yet.'' 
 The bill would provide $150 million to expand counseling for borrowers to prevent foreclosure and would establish stricter disclosure rules to require lenders to make plain the maximum monthly payment for a borrower with an adjustable rate loan.
 The bill also establishes an Affordable Housing Trust Fund, to be financed by $500 million to $900 million in fees from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The fund will cover any expenses related to the foreclosure rescue plan for three years, and will be used to create affordable rental housing. 
 Under the refinancing plan, only borrowers seeking to remain in their primary home would be eligible. Lenders would first have to agree to cut the principal balance of loans to roughly 85 percent of each property's current value.
 Still, with the closely watched Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller index showing home prices in 10 major metropolitan areas down 16.35 percent in April from a year ago -- the worst annual decline in two decades -- lawmakers and some housing experts said the refinancing plan was becoming increasingly attractive to lenders. 
 According to industry benchmarks, lenders lose as much as 40 to 60 percent in foreclosure. 
 Even as Senate negotiators raced to finish the package ahead of the recess, talks were already under way with Mr. Frank and the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, to reconcile differences between the Senate bill and similar legislation approved by the House. 
 At the White House, the press secretary, Dana Perino, softened some of the Bush administration's criticism. 
 ''We do think that there are some really good aspects of that Senate bill,'' she said. 
 Still, Ms. Perino reiterated the veto threat citing concern over a provision that would allocate nearly $4 billion in grants to communities with high foreclosure rates to buy and rehabilitate vacant properties. 
 Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, the chairman of the banking committee, said that he was willing to negotiate with the White House over the proposed grant money. 
 And Mr. Dodd said he believed lawmakers wanted to finish the bill before heading home for Independence Day: ''People I don't think want to leave here, hanging bunting around and eating hot dogs and hamburgers knowing that every day thousands of Americans are falling into an abyss, losing their housing.'' 
 Skeptics say the plan is a handout for irresponsible borrowers and lenders, who would be able to get rid of their worst-performing mortgages, putting taxpayers on the hook for billions of dollars in risky loans. 
 But in a contested election year, with Americans losing billions of dollars in home equity, officials in both parties seem reluctant to be seen as sitting on their hands. 
 And a close look at the fine print of the bill shows that lenders who want to use the program to refinance troubled loans into new, federally insured mortgages will have to take substantial losses. They will also have to make carefully calculated decisions about whether it makes more sense to foreclose and resell or action a property or to help a struggling borrower refinance and remain in the home. 
 At the same time, homeowners seeking to use the program will have to prove that they have enough income and creditworthiness that they can afford to pay their new loans. 
 ''The mortgages aren't just being given out on willy-nilly random basis,'' said Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts. 
 Borrowers will have to pay a hefty fees to further insulate taxpayers from losses. As a result, the biggest risk may be that because the program is complicated -- and voluntary -- few lenders or borrowers will make use of it. 
 The delay Tuesday night exposed a rare rift between two senators from the same state, Mr. Reid, and Nevada's junior senator, John Ensign, a Republican who was pushing renewable energy tax credits. 
 Mr. Reid, in a speech on the Senate floor did not refer to Mr. Ensign by name, but was angry. 
 ''We're going to stay here and finish the housing bill,'' he said. ''It may knock a few people out of parades on July Fourth or whatever, however long it takes us to do this.'' 

GRAPHIC: CHART: POSSIBLE OUTCOME: The Senate housing legislation would allow lenders to refinance troubled loans into new, federally insured mortgages. Lenders have to decide, based on local market conditions, whether it makes more sense to foreclose or to help a struggling borrower refinance. One possible outcome: (Original lending agreement: Price of house $222,222 10% down payment 22,222 Initial mortgage at 8% rate $200,000 Home owner's monthly payment $ 1,470 Calculating the lender's loss Initial loan amount $200,000 Refinanced loan amount 170,000 Loss from the refinancing $ 30,000 Insurance fees to the Federal Housing Administration + 5,667 Total loss to lender $ 35,667 If the lender chooses to help the borrower refinance: (The lender would have to agree to cut the principal balance to no more than 90 percent of a home's current value) New mortgage at 6% rate (90 percent of 189,000) $170,000 Home owner's new monthly payment* $ 1,232 Price of house after a 15% drop in value $189,000 *Includes a 1.5 percent F.H.A. insurance premium per year based on the loan balance.The premium would decline with the mortgage balance and would stop all together once the loan-to-value ratio hits 78%.

HEADLINE: High Costs, Courtesy Of Congress

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
On Wal-Mart's Web site, you can buy a walker for $59.92. It is called the Carex Explorer, and it's a typical walker: a few feet high, with four metal poles extending to the ground. The Explorer is one of the walkers covered by Medicare.
 But Medicare and its beneficiaries aren't paying $59.92 for the Explorer or any similar walker. In fact, they're not paying anything close to it. They are paying about $110.
For years, Congress has set the price for walkers and various medical equipment, and it has consistently set them well above the market rate, effectively handing out a few hundred million dollars of corporate welfare every year to the equipment makers. 
 But as of July 1, this system is set to change. Companies will instead have to submit bids -- to compete with one another, just as Wal-Mart competes with Target -- if they want to continue selling products to Medicare. Based on a pilot program, the price of walkers, delivery and setup included, will fall to about $80.
 Now, would you like to guess how the equipment makers feel about this?
 Right. 
 With the changeover looming, they have increasedtheircontributions to Congress. They have also started publicly claiming that competitive bidding will, among other things, deprive some patients of oxygen equipment they need.
 The industry seems to be having some success, too. On Tuesday, the House overwhelmingly passed a sprawling Medicare bill that would throw out the initial bidding results. Pete Stark and John Dingell, two Democratic committee chairmen, and John Boehner, the House Republican leader, all pushed for the provision. The Senate will soon take up a similar bill.
 This little fight deserves more attention than it's been getting for two reasons. One, it's a great example of how a small group of constituents can potentially beat back a policy that's clearly in the public interest but has no similarly committed group of supporters. And, two, it shows just how difficult health care reform is going to be. 
 In the abstract, fixing the health care system sounds perfectly unobjectionable: it's about reducing costs (and then being able to cover the uninsured) by getting rid of inefficiency and waste. In reality, though, almost every bit of waste benefits someone. 
 Doctors who perform spinal fusion surgeries, despite decidedly mixed evidence that they're effective, are making a nice living. Hospitals that order $1,000 diagnostic tests, even when a cheaper one would work just as well, are helping their bottom line. Medical equipment makers selling walkers for $110, while Wal-Mart sells them for $60, are fattening their profits.
 The current fight to protect those profits is a microcosm of what you can expect to see if a larger effort to rein in health costs ever gets going. The defenders of the status quo won't say that they are protecting themselves. Instead, they'll use the same arguments that the medical equipment makers are using -- that a change will destroy jobs, bankrupt small businesses and, above all, harm patients. 
 ''This is small compared to what broad health care reform would look like,'' Kerry Weems, the top official at the agency that runs Medicare, told me, ''and you can see the reaction.''
 The current system of overpaying the manufacturers dates back to 1989, when Congress adopted a ''fee schedule'' for durable medical equipment and allowed any company to sell the equipment at the official price. Soon after, the fee schedule became a target of would-be budget cutters, including officials in Bill Clinton's administration and promarket Republicans like Representative Joe Barton of Texas. 
 This year, Medicare officials began accepting bids for 10 different products in 10 metropolitan areas. Starting with the low bidder and moving up the list -- with a separate list for each product in each area -- the officials selected enough companies to meet local demand and then some. The median bid among those winning companies became the final price. It was 26 percent lower on average than the current price, suggesting that competitive bidding could ultimately save Medicare $1 billion a year and patients $200 million or so in co-payments. 
 Unless the House bill becomes law -- it would delay the start of any new bidding program for 18 months -- the system will spread to 70 more areas next year.
 So what about the equipment makers' various complaints? 
 On close inspection, they're pretty flimsy. My favorite is the notion that the new rule will force some companies to go out of business -- which, indeed, it may. That's sort of the point. After all, should taxpayers really be propping up any equipment makers whose survival depends on artificially inflated prices?
 The most sensational charge is that a reduction in the number of suppliers will leave patients without access to oxygen machines, wheelchairs and other equipment. Certainly, Medicare will have to keep an eye on this. But remember that the government will still require that each metropolitan area have numerous suppliers for every product. 
 In fact, the Government Accountability Office, a federal watchdog, examined two early bidding programs from a few years ago and found that they didn't reduce access in any significant way. AARP, similarly, has said it didn't hear complaints from its members, and it supports the bidding program. 
 On the telephone the other day, Cara Bachenheimer -- the senior vice president for government relations at Invacare, which makes walkers, beds and the like -- laid out her company's criticisms. Many of them relate to the program's bureaucratic imperfections. So I asked her what kind of bidding system Invacare would support, and she replied that she didn't think there was such a system.
 ''I'm not sure I would argue the system needs to be radically changed,'' Ms. Bachenheimer said.
 That's really the nub of what's going on here. A small number of companies, including Invacare, Pride, Praxair and the Scooter Store, want to keep the billion-dollar subsidy that they're receiving every year. Or at least they want to keep as much of it as possible -- which explains their strong support for the current House bill, even though it includes a 10 percent fee reduction. They recognize that the alternative -- competition -- would be worse for them 
 The industry has been able to win over some Congress members by warning of job losses. Other members are naturally -- and, in some cases, rightly -- skeptical of the workings of the free market. 
 But this is a case in which the market can clearly do a better job than a government-mandated fee schedule. Just look at Wal-Mart's Web site or, for that matter, the bids that Medicare has already received. 
 By standing in the way of this competition, Congress is really standing up for higher health care costs.

HEADLINE: Dow Chemical Raises Prices For Second Time in a Month

BYLINE: By ABHA BHATTARAI; Louis Uchitelle and David Jolly in Paris contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The Dow Chemical Company said Tuesday that it was raising prices for the second time in a month to offset a ''relentless rise'' in energy costs, a sign that companies may increasingly have to pass on price increases to their customers.
 The increase of as much as 25 percent -- the largest in the company's history -- comes after a 20 percent rise last month that the company said did not go far enough given the continuing surge in energy prices. 
Dow, which makes products ranging from pesticides to plastic wraps, also said it would impose freight surcharges of $300 for each truck shipment and $600 for each rail shipment beginning Aug. 1 in the United States. In addition, it will scale back production in plants across North America and Europe.
 Andrew N. Liveris, the company's chairman and chief executive, said the changes were ''extremely unwelcome but entirely unavoidable'' as oil and natural gas continue to set records. Oil prices are up more than 40 percent this year and have risen $9 a barrel since Dow's earlier price increase. Natural gas is up more than 70 percent this year.
 ''There came a point where the surge became so ridiculous that we had to raise prices,'' Chris Huntley, a company spokesman, said, adding that the latest price increase would affect everything from fabric and cushions to CD cases, Styrofoam and car parts.
 Analysts said they expected other companies to follow suit. When Dow announced last month's increases, it spurred a series of similar increases by other chemical manufacturers, including DuPont and BASF.
 Dow's announcement is the latest indication that companies are beginning to pass along the burden of high energy prices to consumers. Until now, those prices had largely been absorbed by company profits because market competition prevented retailers from increasing prices at their stores even as skyrocketing costs continued to strain earnings. But extreme pressure is building in the production chain.
 For example, Lowe's, the home improvement company, has been receiving ''unprecedented requests'' for price increases from its suppliers, Robert F. Hull Jr., the chief financial officer, said at a conference. Mr. Hull added that the company had been absorbing price increases itself ''to maintain the supply of product,'' which has put a strain on gross margins, but he forecast that some of that increase would be passed along later this year.
 In addition to soaring energy costs, companies are also having to deal with the increase in the cost of raw materials.
 Posco of South Korea, one of the world's largest steel producers, said Tuesday that it was raising prices by more than 20 percent. That followed an agreement Monday between the global mining company Rio Tinto Group and the biggest steel maker in China, Baosteel, to raise the price Baosteel pays for Australian iron ore by as much as 97 percent.
 ''It's clearly a global trend that the higher costs of raw materials are being passed on along the production chain,'' said Holger Schmieding, chief European economist at the London office of Bank of America. ''Companies have no alternative but to pass that along to their customers.''
 Producer prices in the United States rose 7.2 percent in May from a year earlier, while comparable euro zone prices rose 6.1 percent in April, the latest month for which data were available. Chinese producer prices are rising at nearly a 12 percent annual rate. 
 The rise in prices also partly reflects the weakness of the dollar, as producers outside the United States demand more of the currency for their goods as its buying power declines. In addition, a ripple effect has been created in which the rise in crude oil costs has carried over into other sectors.
 Economists say the $664 billion chemical industry has been among the hardest hit by soaring energy prices. Every $1 increase in crude oil prices costs the industry $660 million a year, said Kevin Swift, chief economist at the American Chemistry Council. 
 For Dow Chemical, its feedstock and energy costs, which are up more than 40 percent since last year, have increased fourfold in the last five years, to more than $32 billion this year. Dow, whose shares fell nearly 3 percent on Tuesday, has been steadily increasing prices for the last several years, but it is only in the last month that consumers have been directly hit.
 ''These costs have surged so much that the middle guys say they can't absorb any more,'' Mr. Liveris said in an interview this month. ''There is no reason the middle of the supply chain should have to absorb it.''

 STUDY SAYS CAREER PROGRAMS
 Give Students a Leg Up
 A long-term and rigorous evaluation of nine career academies -- high school programs that combine job placement, college preparation and classes beyond the vocational trades -- has found that eight years after graduation, participants had significantly higher employment and earnings than students in a control group. Poverty experts called the findings encouraging because few interventions with low-income teenagers have shown significant and lasting effects. PAGE A14 
 ECONOMY'S TOLL ON PETS
 Home foreclosures are taking a toll not just on families, but also on their pets. No-kill shelters and rescue groups are running above capacity, forcing them to turn some pet owners away, which can leave owners with the county animal shelter as a last option. And those shelters typically euthanize animals when space runs out. PAGE A14
 COMPUTER SEARCHES FAULTED
 Advocacy groups and legal experts told Congress that it is unreasonable for federal officials to search the laptops of United States citizens when they re-enter the country from abroad. Civil rights groups have complained that certain ethnic groups have been selectively profiled in the searches by border patrol agents and customs officials. But the federal government says the searches are necessary for national security. PAGE A17
 EXPLAINING A LOPSIDED MARS
 Three teams of scientists are reporting that the lopsided shape of Mars may well be a result of a cataclysmic impact of a Pluto-size meteor billions of years ago, adding strength to a theory first proposed in the 1980s. If true, that would suggest that the lowlands of Mars's northern hemisphere are a single gigantic impact crater, the largest crater in the solar system. PAGE A16
 MAN KILLS 5 AT FACTORY

 HOUSE APPROVES RIGHTS EXPANSION
 The House overwhelmingly passed a major civil rights bill that would expand protections for people with disabilities and overturn several Supreme Court decisions issued in the last decade.

HEADLINE: Sales of New Homes Decline a Fifth Time in Six Months

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
Sales of new homes fell again in May, the fifth decline in six months, as buyers stayed on the sidelines despite lower prices. 
 In other economic news, sales of big-ticket items stayed steady in May, an indication that businesses were still struggling with the economic slowdown and high oil prices. 
 New-home sales dropped 2.5 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 512,000, the Commerce Department said in a report on Wednesday. The government also revised its April estimate higher, to a 4.8 percent increase, rather than 3.3 percent.
 The median price of a new home fell to $231,000 as builders tried to lure customers, in many cases unsuccessfully. Prices were 5.7 percent lower than they were in May 2007. 
 Inventories rose as well; at the current rate, it would take just under 11 months to sell the current supply. Sellers were discouraged, and some took their homes off the market to wait out the current slump.
 ''The primary narrative inside the new homes series continues to be a troubling rise in inventories,'' Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at Merk Investments, wrote in a note. ''Prices have not fallen sufficient to begin to clear the excessive stock in the housing sector.''
 Sales dipped 7.9 percent in Northeastern states and fell 11.6 percent in Western states. They rose 5.1 percent in the Midwest and increased 0.4 percent in the South.
 In a separate report, the Commerce Department said that manufacturing orders were virtually unchanged last month, at a seasonally adjusted $213.6 billion. The estimate for April was revised down to a 1 percent decrease, rather than 0.6 percent decline.
 The government report measures orders of durable goods, products like washing machines and automobiles that are meant to last three years or more. The report is considered relatively volatile from month to month.
 Orders of computers were up 10 percent and electronic equipment was up 2 percent. Orders of civilian and military aircraft were also elevated for the month. Transportation equipment recorded a 2.6 percent rise in new orders.
 But outside of transportation goods, the index fell 0.9 percent. And there were some signs of softness that may give businesses pause moving forward.
 A closely watched indicator of business spending, which measures orders of civilian capital goods but excludes sales of aircraft, dropped 0.8 percent. That followed a 3.1 percent rise in April, which was sharply revised down from an initial estimate of 4.2 percent. 
 ''While export demand is solid, domestic economic activity and corporate profits are under substantial pressure,'' Joshua Shapiro, an economist at the research firm MFR, wrote in a note. ''It is likely that a weak trend for underlying orders will be in place for some time.''
 Heavy machinery orders dipped 5.3 percent after rising 5.1 percent in April.

HEADLINE: Mississippi's Misplaced Priorities

 BODY:
Congress is finally asking hard questions about Mississippi's handling of $5 billion in emergency federal aid that was supposed to help victims of Hurricane Katrina. 
 As the poorest state in the nation, Mississippi should have had no problem with spending a respectable part of that money on much-needed housing for low- and moderate-income families. But according to a scalding letter to the House Appropriations Committee, signed by a dozen members of Congress, the state designed a recovery program that shortchanges affordable housing in general and that ''leaves renters and low-income families out in the cold.'' 
 The members are rightly outraged by a state plan that will siphon off more than a half-billion dollars in disaster aid for the redevelopment of the port of Gulfport, which local boosters have long envisioned as a hub for cruise ships and gambling. That is not what Congress intended when it voted to distribute the Katrina aid through the Community Development Block Grant program, which was set up in the 1970s to improve housing, economic opportunities and quality of life for the poor. 
 The original law requires states and localities to spend 70 percent of the money they receive on projects that clearly benefit low- and moderate-income people. Recognizing that the disaster had affected people of all incomes, Congress lowered that requirement to 50 percent after Katrina and allowed the Gulf Coast states to waive the income tests for certain projects.
 Mississippi was quick to take advantage of that flexibility. 
 Alphonso Jackson, the former secretary of Housing and Urban Development, believed that he had to approve the Gulfport project because of the way the funding law was written. But in a letter to Mississippi's governor, Haley Barbour, he warned ''that this expansion does indeed divert emergency federal funding from other more pressing recovery needs, most notably affordable housing.'' 
 Congress must use its power to ensure that any remaining Katrina money goes to low-income households. It can start by barring Mississippi from using the block-grant funds for the Gulfport project. It must also close the loopholes in the block-grant law to ensure that future disaster aid goes to those who truly need it.

PERSON: Leonid Hurwicz 

HEADLINE: Leonid Hurwicz, 90, Nobel Economist

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:
Leonid Hurwicz, who shared the Nobel Prize in economics last year for his work on mechanism design theory, which helps explain the interaction among individuals, markets and institutions, died Tuesday. He was 90 and lived in Minneapolis. 
 The death was confirmed by Mark Cassutt, a spokesman for the University of Minnesota, where Mr. Hurwicz (pronounced HER-wich) was an emeritus professor of economics. He had been undergoing dialysis in a Minneapolis hospital, The Associated Press reported. 
 ''Before Leo, people said, 'Let's just ask people to achieve outcomes, such as how much steel to produce or how many shoes to make,' '' Varadarajan V. Chari, a professor of liberal arts and economics at the University of Minnesota, told the university's alumni magazine. 
 An early champion of game theory as it applies to mechanism design, Mr. Hurwicz proposed that desired outcomes can be achieved only if people are provided with the right kind of incentives. 
 ''That was a fundamental breakthrough in thinking about economics policy and economic reform,'' Mr. Chari said.
 An example of incentives applied to a mechanism is a second-price auction, in which the seller wants bidders to offer their true estimates of the value of the item being auctioned. The highest bidder wins, but pays only the amount offered by the second-highest bidder. This is an incentive for bidders to tell the truth without being penalized.
 Mr. Hurwicz's ideas were further developed by two 56-year-old economists who shared the prize: Roger B. Myerson, a professor at the University of Chicago, and Eric S. Maskin, a professor at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J. Their work gave economists and policy makers a new way of thinking about how to structure economic incentives and institutions to enhance social welfare.
 Mr. Hurwicz was born in Moscow to Jewish parents who had fled from Poland after World War I. The family moved back to Warsaw, where Mr. Hurwicz earned a law degree at Warsaw University. 
 It was a course in economics that fired his imagination, however, and he went to the London School of Economics, where his teachers were Nicholas Kaldor and Friedrich Hayek. In 1939 he moved to Geneva, where he studied at the Graduate Institute of International Studies and attended the seminar of Ludwig von Mises. 
 His parents and a brother, who had fled the Nazis and been interned in Soviet labor camps, rejoined him in the United States, where he had emigrated in 1940. He was a research assistant to the economist Paul Samuelson, who won the Nobel Prize for economics in 1970, and to Oskar Lange at the University of Chicago. He never actually earned an economics degree. 
 During the war, Mr. Hurwicz was a member of the faculty of the Institute of Meteorology at the University of Chicago and taught statistics in the department of economics. He also worked for the Cowles Commission for Research in Economics, which sought to link mathematics and economics by creating mathematical models of the economy.
 In 1944 he married Evelyn Jensen, who survives him, as do their four children, Sarah, Michael, Ruth and Maxim.
 In 1951 he became a professor of economics and mathematics in the School of Business Administration at the University of Minnesota. He became chairman of the university's statistics department in 1961, Regents' Professor of Economics in 1969 and the Curtis L. Carlson Professor of Economics in 1989. 
 Mr. Hurwicz was the oldest person ever to receive a Nobel Prize, which seemed to be eluding him with each passing year. 
 ''There were times when other people said I was on the short list, but as time passed and nothing happened, I didn't expect the recognition would come because people who were familiar with my work were slowly dying off,'' he said at a news conference after he won.

HEADLINE: Parties Split on How to Expand Offshore Drilling

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS; David M. Herszenhorn contributed reporting from Washington.

DATELINE: HOUSTON 

 BODY:
The two political parties have settled on markedly different strategies for improving domestic oil supplies to help lower gasoline prices.
 Republicans want to end the 27-year ban on offshore drilling along much of the nation's coastline, while Democrats want to force companies to speed up exploration in certain offshore areas that they already control. A version of the Democratic plan may come to a vote in the House of Representatives as early as Thursday.
 But oil experts say that neither approach will give drivers any relief in the short run from prices that stood Wednesday at nearly $4.07 a gallon, on average. They say the simple reality is that no one knows how much oil is to be found offshore, how difficult producing it would turn out to be or how many years that might take. 
 And oil companies, amid a global drilling frenzy, are stretched so thin they will be hard-pressed to take on big new projects anytime soon. More than 400 major drilling and production projects are competing for engineers, rigs, seismic equipment and steel to build platforms, and the costs of doing the work have skyrocketed. 
 ''All the partisan ideas that are being offered fall short of producing the huge amount of barrels of oil we need,'' said Amy Myers Jaffe, an oil expert at Rice University. ''There's no guarantee to drilling, but it could make a contribution eventually the same way alternative energy and conservation may help.''
 Oil companies, while acknowledging the short-run limitations on their industry, say that more drilling capacity will be available eventually and that the time to have the political debate over expanded offshore drilling is now. 
 Republican legislators have argued in Congress this week that the United States is pleading for more oil from foreign producers while keeping most of its own coastal territory off limits to drilling. Democrats are trying to trump that argument by pointing to existing leases in the Gulf of Mexico that they believe companies have been slow to exploit.
 It is far from clear, however, that expanded coastal drilling would produce any drastic change in the American oil situation, even over the long haul.
 The biggest problem is that much of the coastal United States, subject to a drilling ban since the early 1980s, has not been thoroughly explored for oil. Neither the industry nor the government has any definitive idea how much could be recovered. In order to hazard a guess for some areas of the Eastern Seaboard, the government has had to inspect geological maps from Morocco, which was connected to North America more than 100 million years ago.
 The Republican argument is based on the assumption that drilling in areas that are now under moratorium -- the Atlantic coast, almost all of the Pacific coast and Gulf of Mexico waters adjacent to the Florida coastline -- could prove to be as productive as in offshore areas where leasing and drilling have been going on for decades. 
 Only about 20 percent of the continental shelf is open for drilling, providing about 27 percent of domestic oil production and 14 percent of natural gas production. Republicans say that modern seismic work and drilling in deep waters in the central Gulf of Mexico have meant a sixfold increase in estimates of the oil there, and they believe that would happen again if exploration were expanded.
 Representative John E. Peterson, Republican of Pennsylvania, is leading the House forces in favor of offshore drilling. He said opening more areas would cut down on fear and speculation in the oil markets.
 Most oil companies support the Republican position and are particularly eager for access to the eastern gulf, noting that the water in some parts of it is shallow and drilling would be easy.
 ''These areas have potential, and we really need to find out what is out there,'' said Stephen J. Hadden, senior vice president for exploration and production at Devon Energy, a major gulf producer. ''We're encouraged the dialogue is now occurring, and people are asking the hard questions as to why this is off limits.'' 
 Supporters of the Republican position put estimates for potential oil production from new areas at 1 million barrels a day or more. That would be a notable improvement in domestic production, of about 5 million barrels a day. The United States consumes more than 20 million barrels of oil a day, importing most of it.
 Democrats call the Republican estimates inflated, and some independent analysts agree.
 David Kirsch, an oil analyst at PFC Energy, a consulting firm, said that if the most promising areas off Florida and California were opened for drilling, their peak production in a decade could be as little as 250,000 barrels a day -- less than a quarter of what the gulf produces now.
 ''It's almost a desperate attempt to take advantage of the political climate brought on by high energy prices to steamroll through legislation that won't fundamentally address those high energy prices,'' Mr. Kirsch said.
 Whatever the offshore potential, Democrats argue that the country cannot drill itself out of its energy bind. At hearings this week, they blamed oil speculation rather than lack of supplies for the recent run-up of energy prices, though little hard evidence has emerged to support that position. 
 Democrats also argue that only 10.5 million acres of the 44 million acres leased offshore are producing oil or gas. Why, they ask, give the oil companies any more territory?
 The House is scheduled on Thursday to consider a Democratic proposal that would rescind federal leases if companies are not actively using them. The Democrats say the companies are saving up leases both onshore and offshore while demanding access to more federal territory.
 ''Big Oil is stockpiling these leases, as they enjoy record profits, while Americans feel the pain at the pump,'' charges Representative Nick Rahall, Democrat of West Virginia and chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee. 
 But oil company executives say the roughly 34 million offshore acres the Democrats are talking about are hardly idle. They note that it can take several years of work after a lease is signed before companies decide to invest $100 million in a deep-water well to determine how much oil or gas is below.
 Once drilling starts, a dry hole in one field may make a company reconsider drilling in adjacent waters with a rig that could be used more profitably elsewhere. Typically, companies give up their leases after either five years or 10 years if the area does not produce anything.
 Those who favor an end to the offshore ban argue that opening more shoreline would give the companies more options.
 ''With more targets available, there would be more drilling opportunities that meet the economic hurdles,'' said Jerry Jeram, a managing director and head of petroleum engineering at CIT Energy, a firm that finances energy projects. 
 Estimates of oil offshore are largely the work of the Minerals Management Service, a government agency that oversees production on federal lands. 
 In areas where drilling is banned, mostly off California, it lists proven reserves that are quite modest, 1.5 billion barrels of oil and 1.56 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. 
 If thorough exploration were undertaken, the agency estimates that areas now subject to the drilling ban could turn out to contain 17.8 billion barrels of oil and 76.5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Areas of the continental shelf already open to drilling are estimated to contain five times as much oil and natural gas. 
 Chris C. Oynes, a senior administrator at the Minerals Management Service, cited a ''distinct possibility'' that when modern seismic work and drilling are done, the estimates will go up. 
 But he added, ''I want to be cautious because there have been a lot of people who have explored for oil over the years and bought leases and then drilled 10 straight dry holes.''

HEADLINE: A Spate of Ads Gives Vent to That Howard Beale Feeling

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
IN the age of $5-a-gallon gas, $15 baggage fees on airlines and toxic tomatoes, plenty of people probably feel ready to stick their head out the window and yell, ''I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore.'' 
 Madison Avenue understands.
 Thirty-two years after the indignant news anchor played by Peter Finch in the movie ''Network'' shouted his way into the Fed-up Hall of Fame, advertisers are trying to capture the spirit of his outrage in campaigns that reflect and capitalize on the angry mood of the American consumer. 
 The tone and attitude of the ads are part rant, part battle cry, part manifesto and part populist appeal. They emulate how the Finch character, Howard Beale, sounded during an era not unlike today's when, as he put it, ''everyone's out of work or scared of losing their job'' and ''the dollar buys a nickel's worth.''
 The Beale voice -- with echoes of comedians like George Carlin and Denis Leary, plus a dash of a real-life anchor, Keith Olbermann of MSNBC -- is being heard in campaigns for numerous advertisers. Here are some examples:
 Southwest Airlines is attacking the fees that rival airlines charge their customers.
 Harley-Davidson is proclaiming that ''freedom and wind outlast hard times.''
 The Versus cable network is rallying fans of the Tour de France bicycle race to ''Take back the Tour.''
 Jackson Hewitt is showing taxpayers who did not use its tax-preparation services angrily smashing or throwing things.
 Eastman Kodak tells printer owners that ''pricey ink stinks'' and camera owners that it will ''take a stand'' against companies that ''treat people's most precious images as if they were nothing more than file formats.'' 
 Consumers ''are very serious about what's going on,'' said Gary M. Stibel, chief executive at the New England Consulting Group in Westport, Conn., which recently started a practice devoted to pricing and profit in a recession.
 Mr. Stibel said marketers were finding that consumers would pay attention to ''common sense, direct approaches, not ads that are silly or gimmicky.''
 He praised the Southwest campaign for tapping into the sentiment of consumers ''without stepping over the line by insulting the loyal customers'' of its competitors. The campaign, by GSD&M Idea City in Austin, Tex., carries the theme ''Fees don't fly with us.''
 A chart in a print ad shows how fares are lower on fee-free Southwest than on other airlines. ''What have they been smoking?'' the headline asks, referring to the rivals. ''Apparently, your rolled-up $20s.''
 The goal was ''to do something disruptive'' that reflects the frustrations of fliers, said Derek Pletch, vice president and group creative director at Idea City, part of the Omnicom Group.
 The campaign has an edge to it, Mr. Pletch acknowledged, but it also has ''an empathetic tone that tells them, 'We understand what you're going through.' ''
 That edge is also seen in a Harley-Davidson campaign, created by Carmichael Lynch in Minneapolis, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies. ''We don't do fear,'' asserts a headline on a print ad, which is laid out to resemble the American flag.
 ''Over the last 105 years in the saddle, we've seen wars, conflicts, depression, recession, resistance and revolutions,'' the ad begins, referring to the founding of Harley-Davidson in 1903. ''We've watched a thousand hand-wringing pundits disappear in our rearview mirror.''
 ''But every time, this country has come out stronger than before,'' the ad goes on, before concluding that the right response to the national mood ought to be, ''Let's ride.''
 The genesis of the ad was ''listening to our rider,'' said Scott Beck, director for advertising and promotions at Harley-Davidson in Milwaukee, particularly those who have bought motorcycles recently.
 ''Clearly, there's a history of an unconventional attitude that is core to us as a brand,'' he added. ''That's why we felt so strongly about it.''
 The response to the campaign has been ''tremendous,'' Mr. Beck said, listing examples like the more than 21,000 comments left on the Harley-Davidson Web site (harley-davidson.com) and the distribution by dealers of bandanas and T-shirts bearing the text of the ad.
 The campaign for Versus, a cable network owned by the Comcast Corporation, is intended to draw viewers to the network's coverage of the Tour de France bicycle race, which starts July 5.
 The ''Take back the Tour'' campaign, by a New York agency named the Concept Farm, addresses the damage to the race from scandals that involved performance-enhancing drug use by leading cyclists. After dismissing ''the dopers, politics and critics'' because ''they ripped the soul out of this race,'' the ads -- in print, online (takebackthetour.com) and on T-shirts -- declare the tour belongs not to them but to the fans.
 The campaign ''makes a blunt statement,'' said Griffin Stenger, partner and creative director at the Concept Farm, to persuade viewers to ''identify with that attitude of 'Yeah, I feel that, too; I'm sick of all the negativity.' ''
 Ray Mendez, also a partner and creative director at the Concept Farm, said he did not believe the campaign was too angry, especially at a time when ''on some fundamental level everyone's sick of everything, economically, politically.'' 
 That point was echoed by Andrew Brief, director for client services at DeVito/Verdi in New York, the agency for Jackson Hewitt.
 ''When times are bad, people are looking at their tax refunds as their biggest payday of the year,'' Mr. Brief said, ''so they can really relate to that feeling'' of anger displayed in the commercials. They include a musician smashing his guitar and an office worker shattering a glass cabinet.
 DeVito/Verdi also creates a campaign for the Sports Authority retail chain, owned by an investor group led by Leonard Green & Partners, that aims to reassure shoppers worried about rising prices.
 In one commercial, as a golfer loses a ball in the water, an announcer asserts: ''You're a golfer. You've paid enough already,'' then promises that Sports Authority is ''dedicated to the dedicated.''
 Some advertisers that seek to address the national mood are delivering pitches in a less intense, more whimsical manner than marketers like Southwest or Harley-Davidson.
 For instance, a campaign for Absolut vodka, which carries the theme ''In an Absolut world,'' seems as mad as, well, heck. Ads by TBWA/Chiat/Day in New York, part of the TBWA Worldwide division of Omnicom, depict a politician with a Pinocchio nose, a nice apartment in Manhattan that costs $300 a month and a factory with smokestacks that emit bubbles.
 ''Absolut is different in that we're about presenting a more idealized world,'' said Tim Murphy, vice president for marketing at the Absolut Spirits Company in New York, part of the V&S Group division of V&S Vin and Sprit, the Swedish company that distills Absolut.
 ''The brand stands for sociability, celebration,'' he added, so the campaign is ''meant to be a more positive light, not in a way that's confrontational or negative or disparaging anyone else.''
 And some marketers are finding they cannot always channel their inner Howard Beales.
 Among the ads in the Southwest campaign was one featuring a mock coupon that read, ''Don't #$*!% me over,'' which appeared above a declaration that ''Southwest is the only airline that accepts this coupon.'' That ad, however, was withdrawn.

 Ads for Southwest Airlines, left, and the Versus cable network reflect decisions by agencies to tap into consumers' anger.

HEADLINE: Exploring What Lies Beyond Manifest Destiny

BYLINE: By JOHN STEELE GORDON. 
John Steele Gordon is the author of ''An Empire of Wealth: The Epic History of American Economic Power'' (HarperCollins, 2004).

 BODY:
HABITS OF EMPIRE 
 A History of American Expansion 
 By Walter Nugent 
 Illustrated. 387 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $30. 
 Confined at its birth to the area east of the Mississippi River, by 1867 the United States reached all the way to the Bering Strait. Never has a nation grown so large so quickly. 
 The United States is today the third-largest country in the world, behind only Russia and Canada. More than that, its territory could hardly be richer, more diverse or more advantageously placed on the globe. While much of the land of Russia and Canada is arctic or subarctic, most American territory is in the Temperate Zone. The United States is the only great power with coasts on both the Atlantic and Pacific, placing it effectively at the center of the world. 
 How this immense and fecund national territory came to be assembled is the story of ''Habits of Empire'' by Walter Nugent, a professor for many years at Notre Dame and earlier at Indiana University. He divides this history into three phases. The first, which he calls Empire I, takes up most of the book and is concerned with what is now the lower 48 states. While most people remember maps from school and the occasional catchy phrase, like ''Fifty-Four Forty or Fight!'' and ''manifest destiny,'' the details are probably hazy at best. And these details are often fascinating and well delineated by Professor Nugent.
 The United States acquired much of its present territory by aggressive means, notably what is now the Southwest, when it defeated Mexico in a war and forced it to cede a huge chunk of its almost empty northern reaches (although to be sure America paid Mexico more than it had paid France, in an arm's-length deal, for the Louisiana Purchase). But United States aggression also failed in some cases, notably Canada. Thomas Jefferson thought that its acquisition would be ''a mere matter of marching'' and that the Canadians would greet the Americans with open arms. They did not, and the United States was very lucky to get out of the War of 1812 with a burned capital and a draw. 
 In other cases, like those of Florida and Texas, the land was acquired by the simple expedient of American settlers pouring into largely unsettled areas. Spain, facing incipient revolt in both Mexico and South America, realized that it could not hold Florida anyway and sold it. Mexico, a few years later, tried to hold Texas but, led by a remarkably incompetent general, Santa Anna, lost it at the Battle of San Jacinto, where Santa Anna was captured and his army soundly defeated by Sam Houston and his Texas militia.
 By 1853 the continental United States was complete and what Professor Nugent calls Empire II began. Empire I had been acquired with the idea of settlement, which occurred in the American West with astonishing speed. Empire II, however, was not meant for settlement, at least at first. The biggest part of Empire II was Alaska, which became American for much the same reason that Louisiana had about 60 years earlier: a European empire wanted to be rid of it and didn't want Britain to get it.
 The rest of Empire II was added in the late 19th century and, except for the Philippines, consisted mostly of small islands in the Pacific, like Guam, American Samoa and Hawaii. Puerto Rico and, finally, the Virgin Islands, bought from Denmark in 1917, rounded out this overseas empire.
 But a major part of Empire II was the control the United States exercised over foreign countries that were nominally independent. American protectorates were established in many countries in the Caribbean basin, with the Marines sent to keep peace (and, of course, safeguard American commercial interests). But with the end of World War I the American taste for foreign empire began to evaporate. By the middle of the 1930s the Marines were out of places like Nicaragua, and the Philippines was self-governing and on its way to independence. 
 Up to this point ''Habits of Empire'' is both a readable and valuable work in American history. Unfortunately the author felt compelled to add a postscript, ''The Global Empire,'' on the United States in the post-World War II world. He calls this phase of American history Empire III, and his depiction of it is somewhere between highly tendentious and simply, well, silly. 
 For one thing, he covers 63 years of enormous global change in a mere 12 pages, which doesn't leave much room for explaining extremely complex events or providing context. For instance, Professor Nugent writes, quoting with obvious approval another historian (Robert Kagan), that globalization is simply '' 'a process whereby American-style market economics engulfed nearly the entire world' in a manner similar to how white Americans put Indians' land 'to better use' in the 1800s.'' To describe globalization as nothing more than American economic imperialism is ludicrous. He might at least have noted that globalization has enormously enriched the entire world, not just the United States.
 For another, he is often wrong on his facts. He writes that ''there was no significant peace dividend'' after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of communism, and that there were no military base closings. In fact the total Department of Defense budget, in constant dollars, fell by more than 30 percent between 1989 and 1998, and there have been five rounds of base closings, enacted despite considerable political pain.
 In short, he buys completely into the visceral anti-Americanism, seeing American self-aggrandizing imperialism everywhere while scarcely noting that the free world was engaged in a decades-long, worldwide struggle against a ruthless tyranny.
 In all, ''Habits of Empire'' is an excellent book as long as one ignores the historical claptrap of the postscript, which is an embarrassment to the author and publisher and an insult to the reader.

HEADLINE: California Will Offer Plan To Cut Harmful Emissions

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

 BODY:
California will introduce a detailed plan on Thursday to cut greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels in 12 years by requiring more energy-efficient appliances and buildings, lowering vehicle emissions and generating 33 percent of its energy from renewable sources. 
 But the greatest source of reductions would come from capping emissions from utilities, industrial facilities and other businesses, while allowing them to use permits to emit authorized amounts of pollutants. The companies could buy and sell these permits with their counterparts in seven Western states and three Canadian provinces.
 These are the broad details of the plan by state regulators to meet the goals of California's groundbreaking 2006 law requiring reductions in carbon dioxide and other emissions that contribute to climate change. 
 Since the probable death of national climate-control legislation after a brief Senate debate this month, the California plan is the most comprehensive effort in the country to devise an economy-wide program to reduce heat-trapping gases.
 The plan does not , however, offer details about some politically delicate questions, including the costs it will impose on various industries, among them automobile manufacturers and electric utilities, which together contribute 61 percent of these emissions.
 Rather than assessing the costs that will be borne by industry, Mary D. Nichols, who heads the California Air Resources Board, said the agency's ''macroeconomic analysis'' had shown that the state's gross domestic product would increase by 1 percent when the plan was fully put into place.
 The plan also assumes that the federal Environmental Protection Agency will reverse itself and allow the state to impose stringent emission standards on cars.
 A final version of the plan, which makes a 28 percent cut in the 596 million tons of greenhouses gases the state would emit in 2020, is scheduled for adoption by California regulators by the end of the year. 
 The plan does not propose a formal mechanism for distributing the emissions permits, although it speaks favorably of an auction system.
 In general, those companies that produce or use energy largely generated by burning coal have greater emissions and would need more emission allowances than competitors that use different energy sources. 
 Auctions tend to favor the low-emission companies, while free distribution favors those with substantial greenhouse gas emissions. 
 California utilities are divided among those that use little coal, like Pacific Gas and Electric in Northern California, and those heavily dependent on it, like the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, and the coal-dependent municipal utilities have been strongly opposed to a plan that seemed likely to favor their investor-owned counterparts.
 H. David Nahai, chief executive of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, said Wednesday: ''What we've said is the considerable investments we're making in reducing our greenhouse gas emission footprint should be allowed to continue. We should not be put in the position of having potentially hundreds of millions of dollars'' diverted to pay for allowances in a cap-and-trade market.
 ''This document recognizes that and recognizes that utilities such as ours are doing the right thing by increasing their renewable energy investments.''
 About 46 percent of his utility's output is fueled by coal and 30 percent by natural gas; renewable sources now provide 8 percent of the energy, up from 3 percent when California's climate-change law was passed two years ago.

HEADLINE: Shares Advance Modestly As Fed Leaves Rates Alone

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Wall Street ended an erratic day with a modest gain after the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged and issued a mixed assessment of the economy.
 The Fed pointed to a few positive signs in the economy, including ''some firming in household spending.'' But it also said persistently rising energy prices were likely to limit growth, and not just quicken inflation, which also remained a major concern for the central bank. 
 The central bank said after a two-day meeting it was keeping the benchmark federal funds rate at 2 percent. The hold was expected after several speeches by Fed officials suggesting that inflation was becoming a bigger worry for policy makers. 
 It was the first time in 10 months that the central bank did not cut rates. Last summer, the rate was above 5 percent.
 The Fed is at a critical turning point, said Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist for the Hartford. There are still big credit troubles at the nation's major banks, the job market has been deteriorating for several months, and home prices are still tumbling; to raise rates prematurely could cause these trends to worsen.
 Barring another sharp rise in unemployment or a severe drop in gross domestic product, the Fed seems to be leaning toward raising rates again, Mr. Krosby said. ''Nonetheless, they've left the window open for a cut if need be.''
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 4.40 points, or 0.04 percent, to 11,811.83, after rising more than 100 points shortly after the Fed announcement.
 Broader stock indicators managed to log stronger gains than the blue chips. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index increased 7.68 points, or 0.58 percent, to 1,321.97, and the Nasdaq composite index jumped 32.98 points, or 1.39 percent, to 2,401.26.
 Trading is often uneven after a rate decision as the market parses the central bank's statement.
 ''One of the other factors complicating trading today is that we're close to the end of the quarter,'' said Michael Sheldon, chief market strategist at the RDM Financial Group in Westport, Conn. 
 Volatility can arise when managers shift their portfolios' holdings before presenting them to shareholders at the end of the quarter.
 Moreover, a sharp drop in Boeing dragged on the Dow. Shares of the aircraft manufacturer fell to their lowest level in more than two years, declining $5.15, or 6.9 percent, at $69.64.
 Government bond prices pared their losses after the rate decision. The 10-year Treasury note fell 4/32, to 98 6/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.10 percent, from 4.08 percent late Tuesday.
 Crude oil fell $2.45, to $134.55 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
 Gold prices also fell, while the dollar weakened against most other major currencies.
 On Thursday, the technology sector is likely to come into focus. After the market closed Wednesday, Research in Motion, the BlackBerry maker, reported rises in quarterly profit and revenue that fell short of the expectations of analysts. Shares of Research in Motion fell as much as 8 percent in after-hours trading. They ended regular trading at $142.34, up $1.86.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 27, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An article on Thursday about the Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates unchanged included an outdated statement from the Fed on the status of the economy. The article quoted from an earlier Fed statement, issued April 30, rather than the June 25 statement, the text of which accompanied the article. The text can also be found at nytimes.com/business.

HEADLINE: Homeless Pets Crowd Shelters as Families Hit Hard Times

BYLINE: By BRENDA GOODMAN

DATELINE: ATLANTA 

 BODY:
''Desperate Pets!'' read the headline of an online classified ad posted from Lee County, Fla., which is ranked first in the nation in home foreclosures. 
 ''Please Help!'' begged a post from a pet owner in Carroll County, Ga., who said she had two dogs that would be homeless when her mother's home was foreclosed on in a few weeks. ''Our shelter has something like an 80 percent kill rate,'' the post said. ''I have exhausted every effort I know to find them a good home. No one wants a pregnant dog.''
 As mounting layoffs and foreclosures have caused many middle-class Americans to lose their economic footing, some are parting with their pets, a trend that has sent a tide of displaced dogs and cats to rescue groups and county animal shelters around the country, officials said. 
 ''One lady was crying to me today and said: 'I've either got to feed my kid or feed my dog. What would you do?' '' said Shari Johannes, owner of Dog Pack Rescue, a ''no kill'' shelter in Kingston, Ga., that keeps animals until they are adopted. 
 Like most such no-kill rescue groups in areas where foreclosures are high, Ms. Johannes, who is keeping 180 dogs on five acres, is over capacity. She will not accept any more animals, though people beg her daily to take their pets. 
 When no-kill rescue groups turn pets away, the last option for owners is usually a county animal shelter, which will typically euthanize animals when space runs out.
 In Georgia, which ranked sixth in the nation in foreclosures in May, directors of county animal shelters reported that the number of pets surrendered by their owners spiked in the first part of the year. 
 The number of pets left at Henry County Animal Care and Control in McDonough, Ga., was up 71 percent for the first four months of 2008 compared with the same period in 2007, said Gerri Dueringer, the shelter's director.
 In Clayton County, 22 percent more pets were surrendered in the first part of the year compared with 2007, said Mark Thompson, a police captain and director of the animal shelter in Jonesboro, Ga.
 Other areas of the country hit hard by foreclosures are seeing similar increases, said Wayne Pacelle, president and chief executive of the Humane Society of the United States.
 ''In terms of relinquishment, I'd say this is the most serious circumstance that I can recall,'' Mr. Pacelle said. And as more pets are being turned in, he noted, cash donations to animal rescue groups have declined and fewer people are adopting pets. 
 ''It's a bit of a triple whammy,'' he said.
 The Humane Society recently started a foreclosure fund, which offers grants of $500 to $2,000 to help nonprofit animal rescue groups weather the crisis. Since late March, when the fund was announced, 133 groups have applied for aid and 11 have been given grants.
 ''Obviously, it's a crisis for local shelters; I worry about what it means for our society,'' said Betsy Saul, a founder of Petfinder.com, a Web site that showcases animals for adoption at 11,000 sites in the United States. 
 Ms. Saul recently polled her member organizations to gauge the problem and found that half of her respondents had seen pets turned in because of home foreclosures in the last six months.
 After months without construction work, Roger West of Jasper, Ga., began to miss mortgage payments. In May, he and his wife, Tammy, and their 6-year-old daughter, Macy, became the third family on their street to lose their home to foreclosure.
 ''The way things have fell off, we're just praying our way through it,'' Mr. West said.
 Though they were able to move to a much smaller rental home, they decided that they could not afford to keep two of their three dogs, a German shepherd and a boxer. 
 ''It's like losing a member of the family,'' said Tammy West, who is trying to find the dogs a home on the Web site Craigslist. ''They're not bad or mean or anything. They are just dogs that are going through a bad situation like we are.'' 
 The Wests, who said they had $11 in the bank after they paid their bills recently, were able to persuade their new landlord to give them some time to find new homes for the dogs, but they know that other pet owners, and their pets, have not been so lucky.
 Tracy Thompson, facility manager of the Paulding County animal shelter in Dallas, Ga., said: ''We are a fast-growing county, or we were. And it kind of came to a screeching halt. We have a lot of empty construction and vacant homes around here.''
 Ms. Thompson said the flood of new animals because of foreclosures had already led to an increase in euthanizations at her facility. 
 ''Last month, we euthanized 151 animals for space,'' she said. ''In June, we're already up past that.''
 ''We see people who are at the end of their rope,'' Ms. Thompson said. ''We've had some bring their animals in who are living in their cars, and we're all in tears then.''
 Ms. Dueringer, the Henry County shelter director, said: ''You pick up the young, adult, healthy dog and its only crime is that it's alive. And you have to put it to sleep. It's torturous to staff. It's heartbreaking.''

HEADLINE: MasterCard Will Pay $1.8 Billion To a Rival

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
MasterCard Worldwide agreed on Wednesday to pay $1.8 billion to its credit card rival American Express to settle claims related to a 2004 antitrust lawsuit. 
 Seven months ago, Visa paid more than $2.1 billion to American Express to put similar claims behind it as it raced ahead with plans for an initial public offering in March. MasterCard, which went public two years ago, had been under pressure to resolve the suit because uncertainty surrounding the litigation was one of the few clouds hanging over its rapidly rising stock. 
 The agreement brings the total that American Express has collected to more than $4 billion, one of the richest settlements in corporate history. With losses rising and the economy in a slump, American Express can use the cash. 
 ''Business conditions continue to weaken in the U.S., and so far this month we have seen credit indicators deteriorate beyond our expectations,'' the chairman and chief executive of American Express, Kenneth I. Chenault, said. He said the settlement would provide a multiyear source of funds that would ''lessen the impact of this weakening economic cycle and, when conditions improve, give us the ability to step up investments in the business.''
 Investors sent American Express shares down as they absorbed the news that even its customers, who tend to have strong credit histories, are falling behind on their payments. Its shares fell $1.16, or 2.8 percent, to close at $40.94. Shares of MasterCard, which processes payments but does not directly lend customers money, rose $9.42, or 3.4 percent, to $289.79. 
 MasterCard's chief executive, Robert W. Selander, said in a separate statement that the settlement eliminated ''the uncertainty, time commitment, and expense of a prolonged court case'' and kept the company's balance sheet intact. 
 The Supreme Court ruled in 2004 that Visa and MasterCard violated antitrust rules by barring their member banks from offering credit cards that could be used on rival payment networks. 
 American Express and Discover Financial quickly filed suit, seeking billions of dollars in damages based on the revenue they thought that they had lost. 
 The settlement is likely to put pressure on both Visa and MasterCard to strike similar deals with Discover Financial. Discover is seeking as much as $6 billion from the two companies, according to court filings that were unsealed this month. 
 Analysts expect any settlement with the card companies to be far lower than the $4 billion collected by American Express because Discover's user fees are much lower than those of American Express and the partnerships that it arranged with outside card issuers are less lucrative. 
 Leslie Sutton, a Discover spokeswoman, said it remained ''confident in the strength of our claims against Visa and MasterCard.'' Shares of Discover fell 71 cents, or 4.7 percent, to $14.33. The industry has changed since the antitrust ruling. Bank of America and Citigroup, two of the largest credit card issuers, have signed a deal to offer their customers American Express-branded cards, and HSBC and General Electric's financial service arms have reached agreements with Discover.
 The talks between American Express and MasterCard had gone on for years, and negotiations picked up steam after the Visa settlement was announced in November. In April, Kenneth R. Feinberg, who headed the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund and served as a mediator in the Visa-American Express case, was brought in, but it still took several additional months to arrive at a settlement. 
 ''Everybody was conscious that the number we were talking about could well be a record settlement,'' said David Boies, of the law firm Boies, Schiller & Flexner, who led the negotiations for American Express. ''When you are in that range, it sometimes takes longer.''
 Under the terms of the deal, MasterCard will make quarterly payments to American Express for three years. It will book an after-tax charge of approximately $1 billion for the settlement costs in the second quarter.
 In November, Visa agreed to pay American Express $945 million, followed by quarterly payments of about $70 million until the full amount was paid. 
 Together, the Visa and Master Card payouts will bring American Express about $880 million a year for the next three years.

HEADLINE: Hoboken, an Economic Success That Can't Pass a Budget

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

DATELINE: HOBOKEN, N.J. 

 BODY:
 This is a great place. Just ask Mayor David Roberts.
 ''If there's a category above great, that's where we are,'' he said on Wednesday. ''We're an exciting city. We're a forward-looking city. The governor lives here. A United States senator lives here. We have famous athletes; Eli Manning lives here. We have some of the top people in the theater. Show me an urban center anywhere that has come as far as we have, and I'll buy you a steak dinner.''
 And its governance is an unholy mess. Just ask the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs, which announced on Tuesday that it was moving to place Hoboken under state supervision and take control of its budget process. 
 Joseph V. Doria Jr., the commissioner, said that after almost a year, Hoboken was not close to being able to approve a plan to pay for its own spending -- the last municipality in New Jersey without a budget. 
 ''This is not a cooperative situation, it's an adversarial one,'' he said. ''They're refusing to do what they're required to do.''
 It's not as if anyone should be stunned that a local government in Hudson County, N.J., is something less than a model of efficiency and transparency.
 Hoboken has done its share over the years to live up to the image of Hudson County as something between ''Let's Make a Deal'' and ''On the Waterfront.''
 It was just four years ago that Anthony J. Russo, who was mayor of Hoboken from 1993 to 2001, was sentenced to 30 months in federal prison after pleading guilty to accepting $5,000 in bribes in exchange for his help in securing city contracts.
 But Hoboken, with its waterfront condominiums and downtown boutiques, is perhaps the biggest economic success story in New Jersey. Maybe the state has had to oversee the finances of Camden and other distressed cities that were trying to find the resources to operate. 
 Hoboken? It's like the State of Connecticut deciding to take over Greenwich.
 Hence the sound and fury from all quarters here over who gets blamed, who doesn't and what lessons to learn. First, people are still trying to figure out how a place increasingly full of affluent New York City emigres, where the value of property has increased to $9 billion from $3 billion in 2001, is in such fiscal straits. Had the state not stepped in, the city would have needed to pass along a mammoth tax increase to pay its bills.
 ''I talk to a lot of people around town -- barbers, crossing guards,'' said Perry Belfiore, a Hoboken native long active in civic affairs. ''And they all say the same thing: How can we have all this development and no money? It's the most closely guarded secret other than where they sequester Dick Cheney.''
 It's not as if it sneaked up on anyone. The mayor and Council have fought over revenue and spending projections for almost a year, culminating in the realization that the city was -- whoops! -- $11.7 million short in financing a roughly $100 million budget.
 Council members said the mayor's budget was based on such wispy and unverifiable figures that there was no way to go forward with it. 
 ''You can't vote on something when you don't have access to accurate information,'' said Elizabeth A. Mason, one of the council members who refused to approve a budget. She cited a $4 million estimate for income from the sale of a municipal garage that is hung up in court. ''You could pull numbers out of the air, but that's not a reasonable way to conduct business.''
 As for Mr. Doria, a former mayor of Bayonne, and the state of New Jersey's stepping in to ensure fiscal prudence, she said: ''I find it ironic to have a state monitor when the state needs a monitor for itself.''
 Mr. Roberts said that, sure, the city's budget was underfunded, and he deserved some of the blame. But, like a blast from Hudson County's brass-knuckles past, the budget impasse is mostly political, he said. Part of the charm of Hoboken politics is that the mayor is elected in different years than most of the Council, so what's bad for him is good for council members who want his job.
 ''My grandmother had a great expression,'' he said. ''Beware of the person that rocks the boat and then warns everyone else that there's a storm at sea. The council members were too busy trying to destroy me politically to do what was right for the city.''
 Still, most indications are that Mr. Roberts is the biggest loser so far in a process certain to include sizable tax increases next year. When he took office in 2001, the city had a $52 million budget; it figures to be somewhere over $100 million next year. Much of that, he says, reflects assorted mandates and the city's robust growth.
 But in the county most synonymous with government dysfunction, a lot of people figure it reflects the New Jersey disease, too -- government that is too big and too opaque, that feeds too many people in too many ways. Maybe not quite the Soprano State, as a recent book on New Jersey politics has it, but maybe not so far away, either.

HEADLINE: A Hedge Fund and Its Nonprofit Twin

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS; Jenny Anderson contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Christopher Cooper-Hohn and his wife, Jamie, follow a simple economic formula: he makes money, and she gives it away.
 Mr. Cooper-Hohn runs the Children's Investment Fund, or T.C.I., a successful -- and controversial -- hedge fund that has become a gadfly to corporate giants like CSX, the American railroad. Ms. Cooper-Hohn leads an affiliated charity, the Children's Investment Fund Foundation, which uses some of the profits that T.C.I. earns to finance programs for underprivileged children. 
 The partnership has made the Cooper-Hohns the most generous philanthropists in Britain. Last weekend, their foundation reported a $:439 million ($856 million) jump in funds for fiscal 2007, reflecting $:324 million in donations from T.C.I. and the Cooper-Hohns. 
 In an interview, Ms. Cooper-Hohn dismissed the notion that the charity is a ploy to soften Mr. Cooper-Hohn's hard-charging image. Creating a foundation linked to the fund was ''not about putting a warm and fuzzy face'' on T.C.I., Ms. Cooper-Hohn said. Instead, it was ''very much about keeping Chris motivated'' to produce the highest returns possible, she said. 
 ''Look at what we could spend on marketing,'' she added with a laugh. ''We could be putting a warmer and fuzzier face on Chris.'' 
 The couple met at a party while they were attending Harvard. Mr. Cooper-Hohn was smitten immediately, but Ms. Cooper-Hohn was openly uninterested in a man whose goal in life was to become wealthy. Mr. Cooper-Hohn, displaying skills he would later use to shake up boardrooms around the world, eventually won her over. The foundation, and T.C.I.'s role in financing it, sprung out of a spirit of compromise between the two. The couple have four children, including triplets.
 T.C.I. and the Children's Investment Fund Foundation were set up simultaneously in 2003 with an unusual fee structure. Investors pay T.C.I. a 1 percent fee, about half the industry average, as well as a 0.5 percent fee to the foundation. If the fund earns more than 11 percent profit, investors pay another 0.5 percent to the foundation. T.C.I.'s profits are funneled back to the foundation, not to Mr. Cooper-Hohn. 
 Investors who have been with the fund since the beginning say it has a 42 percent annual internal rate of return, and earned 37 percent in 2007. So far this year, the fund is flat, they say -- not bad, given the economic environment. 
 Ms. Cooper-Hohn, meanwhile, runs the foundation like a business. 
 Many foundations ''write their check and wait for the reports to come in,'' said Ms. Cooper-Hohn. But the foundation is bringing in tools from what she calls the ''best of the private equity world'' to re-evaluate projects and help the organizations running the projects make course corrections. 
 The notion of treating charitable giving like a business has been growing in recent years, as executives who have made fortunes look to give them away. While T.C.I. isn't the first hedge fund to give donations with strings attached -- calling for accountability -- it has certainly built the largest such hedge fund endowment. 
 The Children's Investment Fund Foundation has racked up a series of successes. It worked with the Clinton Foundation to cut prices of H.I.V. drugs for children in a housing project, and it shepherded economic and nutritional programs for children and families affected by H.I.V. and AIDS in India. With the new money come even more ambitious goals. 
 ''We're no longer satisfied by just getting a large number of children covered'' by an existing program, Ms. Cooper-Hohn said. One such push, in tandem with the Gates Foundation, is a project to make enriched food standard in countries where poverty and malnutrition are common -- fundamentally changing the way that billions of people eat.
 The Children's Investment Fund Foundation's total funds in Britain total about $:802 million, or $1.6 billion, according to filings over the weekend with the Charity Commission. The foundation maintains a separate, smaller presence in the United States, which has about $156 million.
 About 90 percent of the Children's Investment Fund Foundation's assets are reinvested with T.C.I., which charges no fees and allows the foundation to withdraw funds at any time. ''It is hard to match those returns with any other investment,'' Ms. Cooper-Hohn said. ''I may have a biased perspective, but we have one of the best investment firms in the world taking care of our capital.'' 
 Dr. Bitra George, of Family Health International, met the Cooper-Hohns in 2003, when they were considering projects to support. He is the India director of family health, which runs the H.I.V. and AIDS program the foundation supports, in the state of Andhra Pradesh. 
 ''It was a new area for them, but they were passionate about what they wanted to do and they wanted ideas,'' Dr. George said. ''Jamie was the one driving most of the conversation, the one who made the site visits,'' he said, adding that both seemed knowledgeable and involved. ''It's not as if they were both coming out with a check,'' he said. ''I had no idea her husband was this big multimillionaire.''
 Despite Mr. Cooper-Hohn's interest in the foundation's work, his wife said, he is not likely to follow in Bill Gates's footsteps in the near future by resigning from the fund to pursue foundation work. ''He is best as an investor,'' she said. ''While I like to think of us both silver-haired and working hand in hand, that isn't around the corner.''

HEADLINE: Fed Shifts Its Concern To Inflation

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE; Steven R. Weisman in Washington contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve's policy makers ratcheted up their worries about inflation on Wednesday without abandoning their view that the American economy is weak.
 They left the key short-term interest rate they control unchanged, ending a streak of rate cuts stretching back to last summer, when the bursting of the housing bubble and the ensuing credit squeeze brought economic growth almost to a halt. 
 At the end of a two-day meeting, the Fed officials voted to hold at 2 percent the short-term federal funds rate, which affects what consumers pay for mortgages, car loans and other credit. In a statement, the 10 policy makers made inflation more of a concern than economic weakness, the first time they had done so in months. 
 ''Although the downside risks to growth remain,'' the statement said, ''they appear to have diminished somewhat, and the upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations have increased.''
 The futures markets interpreted that statement to mean the Fed would raise rates later this year, or early next year. The goal would be to make credit more expensive and thus reduce the odds that sharply rising oil and food prices would spread to a broad array of goods and services. So far, that has not happened.
 ''There are too many risks to the economy for the Fed to raise rates now,'' said Albert M. Wojnilower, an economic consultant to Craig Drill Capital. ''What this statement does is get the policy makers to their next meeting -- on Aug. 5 -- without committing themselves.''
 The policy makers themselves declared that they expect inflation to moderate later this year and next year. The fear is that consumers and companies will respond to sharply rising prices by stepping up their purchases in the expectation that goods and services will be even more expensive in the future. That process would drive up prices even more. 
 Many saw the Fed's statement as a compromise with inflation hawks who are intent on a rate increase now to prevent such a situation. In the 9-to-1 vote, Richard W. Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, alone voted for a rate increase. 
 At the two previous meetings, in April and March, Mr. Fisher and Charles I. Plosser, president of the Fed Bank in Philadelphia, had voted either to raise the federal funds rate or to hold it steady, rather than cut it, as the policy makers did. This time Mr. Plosser voted with the majority.
 ''We'd be willing to bet Plosser wanted to hike too,'' said Ian Shepherdson, chief domestic economist for High Frequency Economics, in an e-mail message to clients. ''But at this point the hawks have settled for one public dissent and a ratcheting-up of the language in the statement.''
 The policy makers have cut the federal funds rate to 2 percent from 5.25 percent last August, chipping away at it every time they met and at emergency sessions between meetings in the early days of the housing and credit crises.
 The rate reductions have clearly helped to keep the economy afloat. It has so far avoided the outright contraction that typically marks a recession. In addition, the Fed's new lending practices, hastily put together last fall, have channeled loans not only to banks, to encourage them to continue lending, but to investment houses that otherwise might have foundered. 
 ''The substantial easing of monetary policy to date,'' the statement said, ''combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity, should help to foster moderate growth over time.''
 The Fed's view of the economy was slightly more optimistic than when the policy makers last met, on April 30. A key finding then -- ''economic activity remains weak'' -- was upgraded in Wednesday's statement to ''activity continues to expand, partly reflecting some firming in household spending.'' 
 There was no mention of the $107 billion in stimulus checks that have been mailed to millions of taxpayers in recent weeks, and whether they might have given a boost to the economy. Fed economists seemed to indicate that the improvement was independent of the rebates, a conclusion that outsiders challenged.
 ''Without the stimulus of the tax rebate package,'' said Brian Sack, an economist at Macroeconomic Advisers, ''we would have relatively flat growth over the middle of the year.''
 Whatever the improvement, the Fed's statement paid attention to the persistent weaknesses justifying a federal funds rate that is less than zero when adjusted for inflation. ''Recent information indicates that economic activity remains weak,'' the Fed's statement said. ''Household and business spending has been subdued and labor markets have softened further.'' What's more, ''the deepening housing contraction is likely to weigh on economic growth for coming quarters.'' 
 The Fed's latest public assessment came as reports this week showed that home prices and consumer confidence continued to decline while foreclosures multiplied. A rising unemployment rate and shrinking payrolls have reinforced the impression of an economy still in need of help.
 In the midst of this rescue process, however, surging oil prices have threatened to raise prices not just for fuel and travel but throughout the economy. Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, recognized this inflationary pressure in a recent speech, in which he suggested that the Fed might raise rates to curb spending and thus keep in check inflation or the expectation of it. 
 There was an outcry on Wall Street, which has benefited from low rates, and the policy makers backed off, signaling that there would be no rate increase at this latest meeting.
 In standing pat on rates, the Fed is parting company with the European Central Bank, which has indicated it intends to raise rates in July to combat inflationary pressures resulting from the surge in oil prices. The Europeans are not dealing with an economy as weak as in the United States, although for some American economists national differences are no longer the issue, not when surging energy prices are the cause.
 ''For the first time in 35 years,'' said Richard Berner, co-head of global economics at Morgan Stanley, ''inflation is a global phenomenon, not a local one. That is really important in dealing with it.''

HEADLINE: In Milan, All Masculinity, No Pretense

BYLINE: By GUY TREBAY

DATELINE: MILAN 

 BODY:
 ''FASHION needs to generate dreams,'' Roberto Cavalli said before his show here on Sunday. Figuring in the dreams of the always optimistic Mr. Cavalli this season, according to his show notes, was an ''extravagant man who explores, a hippie, a nomad who wears his memories from safari on himself.''
 The designer then went on to further list his inspirations: ''Africa's savage and sublime atmosphere, Magnificent colors of Morocco, Paul Bowles' Berber fascination in 'The Sheltering Sky,' Devendra Banhart's neo-hippy bohemian attitude.''
 Fashion, in one's experience of it lately, generates many things, but dreams ... not so much. Certainly it is a reliable source of amusement, particularly when you consider the gap between what is going on in designers' minds and how that translates to what men wear. Pajamas, for instance, were seen all over the runways in the collections for spring and summer 2009, shown here through Wednesday. 
 ''I don't know what they're thinking,'' said Tom Kalenderian, the vice president for men's wear at Barneys New York. Hardly anyone wears pajamas to bed, Mr. Kalenderian added, let alone to work. 
 This critic's personal inspirations for the season here, should anyone wish to know, included the savage, sublime atmosphere along the via Pietro Verri on Monday when Tom Ford opened his new five-floor Temple of Testosterone, nearly inspiring a riot as party guests clamored to get past guards in order to ogle the $5,000 suits, $1,700 shoes and crocodile weekend bags. 
 Tucked away in a top-floor sanctum, like the idol in a Hindu temple, perma-bronzed and sweat-dewed (Italy is still coming to terms with newfangled inventions like air-conditioning), was the Texan himself. Recently hired to dress Daniel Craig in the new James Bond film, ''Quantum of Solace,'' Mr. Ford has remarked lately that he is his own customer. 
 He is equally his own fantasy creation, one who, like the early -film Bond, cultivates an aura of suave tastes and manly appetites that have been lifted from a pop cultural grab bag-- Savile Row, old Hollywood, comic strips. 
 Unlike a Bond martini, the ones served at smart Milanese fashion parties this week came in shot glasses and with a single anomalous raspberry crowding the precious thimbleful of gin and vermouth. The music at those parties, and at many shows, was similarly bastardized, a combination of remixed dance tracks from the 1970s that sampled the spooky ethereal voice of Minnie Riperton in her whistle register, or that mined the tinny effects and pretentious lyrics of the Brooklyn-based band MGMT. 
 AFFECTATION can be charming, it's true, but so can things that make no pretense at being other than what they are. The new Gommino loafers Tod's introduced this week look stitch for stitch like the old Gommino loafers, except that they are rendered in luscious jewel colors. 
 There is something instructive about a label's refusal to alter, beyond the occasional aesthetic tweak, a business formula based on a simple $395 driving shoe that has driven Tod's to billion-dollar profitability. The spring collections for next year are primarily about bottom-line calculations, with fashion houses showing clothes that were mainly conservative, mostly monotone, and if a mite commercial and bland, appropriate for tough economic times.
 There isn't a lot of latitude these days to indulge controversy or ideas in fashion, and so even Miuccia Prada in her strong collection seemed far less intent than usual on engaging in what Carlo Antonelli, the editor of Italian Rolling Stone, termed ''the discourse about gender.''
 In other words, Prada ditched the peplums and other feminizing elements of her last, determinedly noncommercial collection and sent out a tightly organized presentation that combined elements of sports and formal wear and that eroticized men without rendering them drones.
 She placed straps inside coats so the wearer could shrug the garment off his shoulders as one would a backpack. She toyed with long shirts worn over shorts in a way that suggested one was abroad in his skivvies. She used proportions that bared slivers of skin between shirt and waistband. She avoided ties and collars and left chests bared to create a kind of male decolletage. 
 She also made finely proportioned trousers that were full in the leg without becoming hip-hop clownish and whose waistbands sat just at the pelvic bone; and coats of translucent rubber that gave one the shivers, not because they seemed like the usual designer allusion to fetish wear but because they referenced nature with tender artistry. More than anything, they looked like cloaks of kelp. 
 Somewhere Ms. Prada said something about her collection combining elements of fragility and power. Somewhere Donatella Versace said that her collection was either inspired by or dedicated to Barack Obama. Somewhere (The International Herald Tribune, actually) Alexander McQueen said his collection was ''smoke and mirrors translated into clothes.'' Somewhere the designer Raf Simons said his Jil Sander collection was ''a determined abstraction of nature and life.''
 Sometimes it seems that the only way to survive a week of austere but anatomically implausible designs (Sander); Cirque du Soleil illusion effects (McQueen); chirpy Miss America assertions (Versace); and generally vaporous claims on the part of designers about the meanings behind what, after all, amount to racks of trousers and shirts, is to keep a supply of tiny martinis at hand. Hold the raspberry, please. 
 Among the folks one rarely hears waxing poetic about inspiration are Tomas Maier, Angela Missoni and Christopher Bailey. What these three designers seem to have in common is an aversion to showboating and a deep understanding of what corporate types call brand DNA. 
 Season after season, Mr. Maier refines a vocabulary and a look that have been more influential than people let on. His snug jackets, taut armholes, roped (formerly pagoda) shoulders and ostentatiously plain but luxurious materials recall the John Held 1920s as they were reinterpreted in the gay 1970s, as do the voluminous trousers with deep crumb-catcher cuffs. 
 If it was an adman, Peter Rogers, who first coined the Bottega Veneta slogan, ''When Your Own Initials Are Enough,'' it is Mr. Maier who carried the idea forward, branding a look without a logo in sight. 
 It is no small accomplishment to have created an unmistakable brand identity out of a handful of patterns in yarn, as did Tai and Rosita Missoni, the founders of the knitwear label that bears their family name, and which is designed by their daughter Angela. And it requires considerable humility to work from a template created by one's mom and dad. Yet Ms. Missoni's collection of shorts and safari jackets in sharp, almost acid colors, detailed in patterns of broken stripes, had a confident feeling, like a quirky riff on a jazz standard, something minor key but endearing, like a Blossom Dearie song. 
 Christopher Bailey's Burberry show evoked another kind of music and a different breed of musician, the chicken-chested rockers you might see in Hoxton or Williamsburg. It is probably high time for those guys to lose the wallet chains and corduroy Levis and take some of the money from lucrative deals every garage band seems to be making and put it toward one of Mr. Bailey's elongated scoop-neck cardigans, narrow trousers in mossy colors or skim-weight three-quarter length coats. 
 Cooler still would be a band dressed up in the Day-Glo suits that Italo Zucchelli sent out on Tuesday in a Calvin Klein collection that was cleanly proportioned, cut to suit a body type that, while not steroid-muscled, is clearly athletic, this in itself a break from the trend of recent seasons to show men's clothes on underfed boys. 
 Before Calvin Klein (when it was being designed by Calvin Klein himself) became an extended porn loop passing itself off as a mass-market label, Mr. Klein's clothes made a persuasive case for showcasing the newly toned male physique. Clothes were required to suit the broad shoulders, narrow waists and levels of aerobic fitness many guys worked so hard to attain. Mr. Klein provided them. Mr. Zucchelli does again. 
 The Nordic waifs favored by casting agents for other designers would look pretty pitiful in the knee-length fencing trousers or cleanly squared suits by Mr. Zucchelli. So would anybody who'd slacked off on treadmill and let himself to go to pot. Tailoring, as Mr. Ford recently told me, is great for concealing one's anatomical flaws. A little shoulder padding helps offset a large head. Wide lapels narrow a bull neck. A deep suit vent adds length to a torso.
 But there is only so much a designer can do about a widening middle except provide inspiration to stave it off. As much as anything else, Mr. Zucchelli's fine collection was a manifesto against the muffin top.

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan 

 BODY:
 The dirty little secret of the Iraq war isn't in Baghdad or Basra. Rather, it's found in the squalid brothels of Damascus and the poorest neighborhoods of East Amman.
 Some two million Iraqis have fled their homeland and are now sheltering in run-down neighborhoods in surrounding countries. These are the new Palestinians, the 21st-century Arab diaspora that threatens the region's stability.
 Many youngsters are getting no education, and some girls are pushed into prostitution, particularly in Damascus. Impoverished, angry, disenfranchised, unwanted, these Iraqis are a combustible new Middle Eastern element that no one wants to address or even think about. 
 American hawks prefer to address the region's security challenges by devoting billions of dollars to permanent American military bases. A simpler way to fight extremism would be to pay school fees for refugee children to ensure that they at least get an education and don't become forever marginalized and underemployed.
 We broke Iraq, and we have a moral responsibility to those whose lives have been shattered by our actions. Helping them is also in our national interest, for we'll regret our myopia if we allow young Iraqi refugees to grow up uneducated and unemployable, festering in their societies.
 ''My husband and I have decided to pull our three children out of school,'' said Yussra Shaker, a college-educated English teacher who fled Iraq and went to Jordan when her 15-year-old son was shot in the leg in a kidnapping attempt. Ms. Yussra deeply believes in education, and her eyes welled with tears as she described the decision to withdraw her children because of school fees and beatings by Jordanian students.
 ''My children are very good students, and the teachers like them,'' Ms. Yussra explained, ''and so the local children beat them up even more.''
 Ms. Yussra's family is Christian, but most of those fleeing Iraq are Sunni Muslims -- and some of them may have shot at Americans or brutalized Shiites in the ongoing sectarian conflict. One Sunni family I visited came from Falluja after their house was blown up, possibly by Americans, and they have decorated their leaking apartment with a huge poster of Saddam Hussein. 
 This family was composed of two wives of one man (who was back in Iraq, living in a tent) and their five children. The eldest son was a surly young man in his 20s who looked as if his preferred interaction with Americans might have involved an AK-47 in his arms.
 Yet the family also has four small children and was nine months behind in its rent and in danger of being thrown out on to the street. I visited them at 2 p.m., and nobody in the house had eaten anything so far that day.
 Iraqi refugees don't get help in part because this is a problem that almost everybody wants to hide. Syria and Jordan worry that if the refugees get assistance, then they will stay indefinitely. The U.S. doesn't want to talk about a crisis created by our war, and Iraq's Shiite leaders don't much care about Sunnis or Christians displaced by Shiite militias.
 ''It's among the largest humanitarian crises in the world today,'' said Michael Kocher, a refugee expert at the International Rescue Committee, which recently published a report on the crisis. ''It's getting very little attention from the Security Council on down, which we feel is scandalous and also bad strategy.''
 It's easy to blame the surrounding countries, such as Jordan and Syria, for not being more hospitable to Iraqis. But those countries have, however grudgingly, tolerated the influx despite the burden and political risk.
 Iraqi refugees are hard to count but may now amount to 8 percent of Jordan's population of six million. The average Jordanian family, which opposed the war in the first place, is now bearing a cost that may be as much as $1,000 per year for providing for the refugees.
 In contrast, last year the United States took in only 1,608 Iraqis. European countries have done better, but they believe that America created the refugee crisis and should take the lead in resolving it.
 ''Apathy towards the crisis has been the overwhelming response,'' Amnesty International said in a report last week.
 We have already seen, in the case of Palestinians, how a refugee diaspora can destabilize a region for decades. If Jordan were to collapse in part from such pressures, that would be a catastrophe -- and the best way to prevent that isn't to give it Blackhawk helicopters, but help with school fees and school construction.
 If we let the Iraqi refugee crisis drag on -- and especially if we allow young refugees to miss an education so that they will never have a future -- then we are sentencing ourselves to endure their wrath for decades to come. Educating Iraqis may not be as glamorous as bombing them, but it will do far more good.

HEADLINE: In India, a New Detroit

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER; Bill Vlasic contributed reporting from Detroit.

DATELINE: ORAGADAM, India 

 BODY:
On a dusty sun-baked field, in a ceremony presided over by a chanting Brahmin priest tossing water and rice, the Japanese carmaker Nissan Motor made a bold step into the Indian auto market.
 The traditional Hindu ritual this month, attended by a half-dozen sweating Japanese and European executives, blessed the site where Nissan will build its first passenger vehicle factory in India, a sprawling $1.1 billion complex where rice paddies once stood. The plant, built jointly with its French partner Renault an hour outside the southern city of Chennai, will turn out 400,000 cars a year when completed in two years.
 Japan's Big Three -- Toyota, Honda and Nissan -- led the world in factory automation and eco-friendly technology, but until now they have been cautious about venturing far from the roads they know: the mature markets of North America and developing markets closest to home, particularly China and Thailand. Now, in a radical shift, Japan's staid Big Three are plowing into exotic terrain, from Saharan Africa to the former Soviet Union to the scorching plains of southern India. 
 They are determined not to repeat the mistakes of a decade ago, when they were late to the party in China, and where they have since trailed rivals like Volkswagen and General Motors. They have been particularly quick to expand in India, a nation of 1.1 billion that is just beginning its automotive revolution, and that many call the world's next megamarket after China. 
 The aggressive moves by traditionally cautious automakers are the latest signpost that the epicenter of the global auto industry is shifting increasingly from California to somewhere between Canton and Calcutta. The shift is also yet another sign of the waning centrality of the United States to the global economy.
 Speaking at an annual shareholders meeting on Wednesday in Yokohama, Nissan's chief executive, Carlos Ghosn, said that surging prices for raw materials would force car companies to raise prices -- but that the economic malaise afflicting the United States and Japan would make it harder to increase sales in the face of higher prices. 
 So places with rapidly escalating demand -- like India, Brazil, Russia and China -- will be more important than ever. ''We intend to take full advantage of growth in emerging markets,'' Mr. Ghosn said.
 ''These developing markets used to be an afterthought'' for Japanese automakers, said Hirofumi Yokoi, an analyst in Tokyo for CSM Worldwide, the auto market research company. ''Now they are the industry's future.''
 According to CSM, vehicle sales in developing regions are expected to rise by about 10 million units over the next six years, contributing 76 percent of the industry's entire global growth.
 In the last seven years, Nissan's vehicle sales in all developing nations have nearly tripled to 1 million units, out of the company's 3.7 million vehicle sales last year.
 ''It used to be that Honda relied on its U.S. business, maybe too heavily,'' said Honda's president in India, Masahiro Takedagawa. ''Nowadays, we are trying to spread the sources of profits more globally, beyond just one market.'' 
 To be sure, the United States will remain the world's biggest and richest market for the foreseeable future, contributing some 70 percent of the profits at most Japanese automakers. But Japan's automakers need to offset what is shaping up to be one of the worst years for United States auto sales in more than a decade. 
 Breaking into far-flung emerging markets comes with its own hazards, especially when the Japanese carmakers' most lethal competitive weapon is world-leading quality. This is especially true as they build factories in places where local parts suppliers are accustomed to lower standards -- and where even electricity is unreliable. 
 In India, for instance, Nissan faces challenges from ensuring timely delivery of parts via half-finished roads clogged with trucks and bullock carts, to teaching its new workers and local suppliers exacting Japanese precepts like kaizen, or ''constant improvement.'' ''The hardest part will be teaching the mindset and culture of kaizen,'' said Shouhei Kimura, a former factory manager who now heads Nissan's operations in India.
 Still, in recent months, the big Japanese automakers have announced a slew of new factories in the Middle East, South Asia and Latin America.
 Toyota, the biggest of the three -- eyeing rapid deployment in less developed markets in its bid to unseat General Motors as the world's largest carmaker -- has opened a factory in Russia, is building a second Indian plant, and recently announced a new small car for India. 
 Honda is building a plant in Argentina and expanding production in Brazil and India. Honda, which has long sold motorcycles in India, has also expanded its automobile production capacity from 30,000 units a year three years ago to a planned 160,000 units by the end of next year. 
 Nissan is erecting factories in Russia, Morocco and China, as well as a second plant in Chennai to make commercial vehicles. It has teamed up in India with Bajaj Auto to build a $2,500 entry-level car, which will also compete with the Nano by Tata Motors. 
 Sales of cars and trucks are expected to double in India to 3.92 million by 2012, according to a forecast by the market research group Global Insight. India's burgeoning middle class has embraced the automobile with such fervor that cars now clog the nation's crumbling roads and outdated infrastructure, vying for space with taxis, scooters, wandering cows and even an occasional elephant.
 The Japanese are not alone. Just in Chennai, Ford, BMW and Hyundai Motors of South Korea have all built factories, leading some locals to call the city the ''Detroit of India.'' 
 General Motors sells Chevrolet-branded vehicles in India. It has just one plant with a capacity of 85,000 vehicles a year, and a second plant with capacity for an additional 140,000 vehicles is scheduled to start production at the end of this year. Ford recently announced plans for a $500 million investment to double production at its Indian plant to 200,000 vehicles annually by 2010.
 The large Japanese automakers also find themselves in the unaccustomed position of trying to catch their much smaller Japanese rival Suzuki, which became the largest car company in India by being one of the first to arrive, a quarter-century ago.
 Concerns of falling behind are felt keenly at Nissan, which last year sold only 500 vehicles at its five dealerships in India. By 2012, the company hopes to increase that to more than 200,000 at 55 dealerships. In April, Nissan created a six-person marketing team for India that is considering steps like hiring Bollywood actors to appear in ads.
 To head its push into India, Nissan tapped Mr. Kimura, a 29-year veteran who had been running the company's model factory in Oppama, two hours outside Tokyo. 
 A thin man with a quick smile and an engineer's habit of speaking with careful precision, Mr. Kimura says his main mission is to bring the highly efficient and flexible manufacturing methods that Nissan has perfected in places like Oppama to Chennai.
 He plans to send Indian workers to Oppama for training in everything from how to tighten a bolt to the principles of quality control. 
 With Indian wages only about a tenth of wages in Japan, the Chennai factory will rely more on human labor than Oppama, where robots staff many assembly lines.
 Mr. Kimura, who worked five years at Nissan's plants in Tennessee, said he expected personal adjustments as well in Chennai, where he will movein September. He noted that the city had only 2 Japanese restaurants, versus 10 near Nissan's Tennessee plants.
 ''There's a big difference between Tamil Nadu and Tennessee,'' said Mr. Kimura, referring to Chennai's state.
 The other big challenge has been finding Indian parts suppliers the Japanese can raise to their quality standards. One is Caparo India, the Indian unit of a British auto parts maker that manufacturers steel body panels and other metal parts. 
 Under the guidance of teams of engineers from Honda and Nissan, Caparo has built new assembly lines near Chennai using the latest Japanese and Taiwanese factory equipment. Caparo has also adopted kaizen management, with its colorful bar charts posted on factory walls showing individual employees' goals for raising production and reducing errors, and whether those goals were met -- for all to see.
 ''We are not as good as Japan. Far from it,'' said Caparo's chief executive in India, Deb Mukherji. ''But the Japanese hold our hand, work with us on the shop floor, help us develop.'' 
 Many here see enormous potential for the Japanese brands among Indians, many of whom became used to driving Nissans and Hondas while living abroad, and became accustomed to their quality and reliability.
 ''Expectations are getting higher here when it comes to cars,'' said Sudhir Natarajan, who runs Nissan's sole dealership in Chennai. ''This is a chance for the Japanese.''

HEADLINE: California Sues Countrywide Over Lending

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
California joined Illinois on Wednesday in suing Countrywide Financial, claiming the company had practiced deceptive mortgage lending. The embattled company's shareholders, meanwhile, approved its takeover by Bank of America. 
 The civil lawsuits, which also name Countrywide's chief executive, Angelo R. Mozilo, as a defendant, accuse the lender of engaging in unfair trade practices that encouraged homeowners to take out risky loans, regardless of whether they could repay them.
 The lender, based in Calabasas, Calif., became the company most closely associated with the American housing boom, in which mortgages with low teaser rates were seemingly handed out to anyone who asked, as well as the real estate market's subsequent collapse when mortgage rates rose and shaky borrowers lost their homes to foreclosure.
 ''Countrywide exploited the American dream of homeownership and then sold its mortgages for huge profits on the secondary market,'' California's attorney general, Jerry Brown, said in a statement.
 The lawsuit was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court. It also names the company president, David Sambol, as a defendant.
 A Countrywide representative was not available to comment.
 Countrywide shareholders voted in a meeting Wednesday to approve the lender's takeover by Bank of America, a deal spurred by the company's mortgage market woes. The stock deal, first announced in January and now valued at about $2.8 billion, is expected to close by July 1.
 Holders of more than 69 percent of eligible Countrywide shares voted in favor of the deal, Countrywide said.

PERSON: Richard A. Grasso 

HEADLINE: Ex-Big Board Chairman Wins Round in Pay Fight

BYLINE: By JENNY ANDERSON

 BODY:
On Wall Street, there are stars that fade and stars that fight. Richard A. Grasso is one of the latter. 
 On Wednesday, Mr. Grasso, the former chairman and chief executive of the New York Stock Exchange, won another round in his almost five-year battle to keep the $187.5 million of pay he amassed during his eight years at the helm of the Big Board. 
 The New York State Court of Appeals upheld a lower court ruling dismissing four of six counts originally brought by Eliot Spitzer, then New York's attorney general, against Mr. Grasso. The decision leaves Mr. Spitzer's successor, Andrew M. Cuomo, two claims to pursue. 
 Since 2004, the attorney general's office has argued that Mr. Grasso's pay was unreasonable under New York's nonprofit laws and that his compensation was not properly disclosed to the exchange's board. (The exchange became a public, profit-making corporation in 2006, after Mr. Grasso had been awarded his pay.) 
 But the Court of Appeals ruled that state law did not give the attorney general the authority to bring major parts of the case.
 ''Mr. Grasso is gratified by the court's decision,'' said Gerson A. Zweifach, one of Mr. Grasso's lawyers along with Mark C. Zauderer. ''He always had faith in the justice system.'' A spokesman for the attorney general did not return calls for comment. 
 While the decision is certainly a win for Mr. Grasso, the war is not over. In 2006, Justice Charles E. Ramos of State Supreme Court in Manhattan ruled that Mr. Grasso had breached his fiduciary duty to keep the board informed about his pay and ordered Mr. Grasso to pay back at least $100 million. ''Mr. Grasso's duty is to be fully informed and to see to it that the board was fully informed,'' Justice Ramos wrote. ''He failed in this duty.''
 Mr. Grasso is appealing that decision. 
 ''Both sides have something to look forward to,'' said Richard J. Schulman, a securities lawyer for Bryan Cave. ''The attorney general has a decision from the lowest court saying there has been a breach of fiduciary duty. But Grasso has slimmed down the case against him.'' 
 Mr. Grasso's fight to keep his pay has drawn widespread attention, partly because of his rags-to-riches story. He grew up in a working-class neighborhood in Queens, dropped out of Pace University and started his career as a clerk at the exchange. But he rose through the ranks, ultimately securing the chairman's title and ringing the exchange's famous bell with business and political luminaries. He was even featured on an episode of ''Sex and the City,'' ringing the bell with Sarah Jessica Parker.
 He protected the exchange's open-cry auction system, which many deemed outdated and rife with human error, against the near universal move to all-electronic trading. 
 After the terrorist attacks in September 2001, Mr. Grasso helped get the exchange open again and reveled in his role as a high-profile cheerleader for the United States economy and its markets. 
 As his star rose, so did his pay. His annual compensation, including special payments, bonuses and base salary, soared from $3 million in 1996 to more than $30 million in 2001, when he was awarded a hefty bonus for his stewardship of the exchange through Sept. 11, according to an internal report conducted by the exchange's lawyers and Winston & Strawn. 
 In 2003, in a move that would lead to his undoing, Mr. Grasso sought to cash out some of his retirement benefits. Some directors say he expressed concern that a future board would be less willing to give him the money, a charge he contests. The compensation committee devised a contract to award him an immediate lump sum payment of $139.5 million and an additional $48 million to be paid over four years for past and future work. 
 A storm of controversy followed. Some directors, including Henry M. Paulson Jr., then the head of Goldman Sachs, argued against paying out Mr. Grasso's retirement benefits before retirement. Others said Mr. Grasso was entitled to money he had earned. By Aug. 7, 2003, when the board was scheduled to meet, some directors seemed to believe the lump sum payment would not be awarded since it was not on the agenda for a board meeting. 
 But the issue was presented and after a debate, those present voted to pay Mr. Grasso the lump sum. The amount was disclosed to the public. Two days later, the exchange revealed that Mr. Grasso was owed an additional $48 million. As the uproar over his pay continued to ripple around the world, the board voted 13 to 7 in favor of asking Mr. Grasso to resign. 
 Mr. Grasso will now wait to see what happens with his appeal of the two remaining charges, while Mr. Cuomo will have to decide how to proceed with the remaining claims. According to the appellate court's ruling, the attorney general must prove that Mr. Grasso knew the compensation was unreasonable and that he ''violated his fiduciary duties to the New York Stock Exchange by accepting awards of excessive compensation'' while in the job. 
 Mr. Grasso's recent victory could push the attorney general to seek a settlement. ''The dismissal of these claims may ignite renewed talks of settlement,'' said Robert A. Mintz, a former federal prosecutor and a lawyer at McCarter & English. ''It's a win for Grasso but the war is far from over.''

HEADLINE: Much Left Undone, Again, As Session Ends in Albany

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: ALBANY 

 BODY:
Gov. David A. Paterson took one more chance this week to distance himself from the strategy of his predecessor, Eliot Spitzer, the man he ran alongside nearly two years ago.
 ''Trying to embarrass people, trying to intimidate people, trying to expose people in the newspapers, this has been tried before, and I think you know what the results of that are,'' he said at a news conference on Monday.
 But when one of the most unusual legislative sessions in state history came to a close in the wee hours of Wednesday morning, it was not clear that the accommodating strategy of Mr. Paterson was any more effective than the slashing style of Mr. Spitzer. 
 The fundamental financial problems that beset New York remain in place. The state and local tax burdens are among the highest in the nation, much of upstate New York is economically depressed and the eroding returns on Wall Street, the state's main economic engine, portend a financial crisis in years to come, with the state facing a cumulative deficit of $21.5 billion over the next three years.
 A little more than three months into his new job, Mr. Paterson is probably best known for admitting to several extramarital affairs and for ordering state agencies to recognize gay marriages performed in other states. In the capital, he struck a truce with Senate Republicans, volunteering not to campaign for Democrats against Republican incumbents this fall, though the resignation this week of the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, could shift that dynamic. 
 Clearly, the governor and the Legislature are getting along far better than they did under Mr. Spitzer, and reached agreements on a range of issues in recent days. The governor, in an interview on Monday, said he was most relieved about the overhaul of a state program to clean up toxic sites known as brownfields. He said the program had evolved into a billion-dollar boondoggle for real estate developers.
 ''I do not know a way to cut into future budgets as much as what we did today,'' he said, adding that the program was growing ''like a runaway train.''
 Other agreements included legislation to avert foreclosures, establish a waste-transfer station on Gansevoort Street on the West Side of Manhattan, bolster background checks for buyers of firearms, tighten disciplinary action against doctors who make mistakes and increase the supervision of violent felons released from state custody. 
 ''Usually, the last day of session, the leaders are able to announce about five or six agreements on issues that have been floating around,'' the governor said. ''We've surpassed that threefold, so we're very happy about that.''
 But some of the weightiest issues remain unresolved.
 Two months ago, the governor said he would push to reopen the budget by the end of the legislative session and start attacking next year's $5 billion deficit early. Such talks were never seriously initiated. He also proposed to cap property taxes, but made limited headway in the Legislature. And he has been hammered by good-government groups for abandoning measures that would overhaul the state's campaign finance laws.
 ''After a uniquely chaotic session, this has been Albany at its most typical,'' said Blair Horner, the legislative director of the New York Public Interest Research Group.
 ''Lots of bills have passed, big-ticket items like property taxes and energy costs are ignored, and they kicked the can on the state's fiscal crisis,'' he added. 
 Among those striking a skeptical note on Wednesday was the new Senate majority leader, Dean G. Skelos of Long Island, who said, ''It would be easy to declare this session a success, but I will stop short of doing that because our unfinished business includes the most important issue facing New Yorkers: skyrocketing property taxes.''
 Edmund J. McMahon, the director of the Empire Center for New York State Policy, a conservative research group, said the governor should be given time.
 ''His success so far has been in framing the issues,'' said Mr. McMahon, a former adviser to Gov. George E. Pataki. ''You have to start by framing these issues on your terms, and he's done that.''
 Complicating matters is the enormous clout of labor unions; Mr. Paterson said he was particularly disturbed that they pronounced his proposal to impose a property tax ceiling dead on arrival earlier this year. 
 ''I would even have been upset if Shelly Silver or Joe Bruno said that,'' he said, ''but for advocates to be announcing that they have the kind of power that they can just shut down bills makes Albany dysfunctional.''
 The governor said elected officials had to reassert their authority over the political process, adding, ''That's the real reform we have to make in Albany.''
 Reflecting labor's clout, a union-backed bill that recently passed would impose a one-year moratorium on municipalities that would bar them from cutting spending on retirees' medical benefits, even if they find a better deal for delivering the same care or prescription drugs. The legislation would also create a 12-person state task force on retirees' health care that would include three people from the A.F.L.-C.I.O. but no representatives from local governments.
 Stephen J. Acquario, the executive director of the New York State Association of Counties, said the bill was aimed at solving a problem that did not exist.
 ''We are not aware of any widespread action by counties to substantially reduce retiree health insurance,'' he said.
 Assemblyman Peter J. Abbate Jr., a Brooklyn Democrat and one of labor's allies, sponsored the legislation. He agreed that there were no signs that counties were moving to cut retirees' health benefits, but said he was worried that they might do so in the future.
 ''You're afraid they might go off and do something without thinking,'' he said.
 Mr. Paterson's office said the governor had not decided whether to sign the bill.

HEADLINE: From Campaign 2.0 to Governing 2.0

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
Much has been made this year of how the presidential candidates have expanded their use of the Internet, particularly for raising money, organizing supporters and sharing videos.
 But what happens when the campaign is over? Whether Senator Barack Obama or Senator John McCain wins or loses, do their online operations cease and just close up shop the day after the election?
 A conference of Internet experts and devotees just met in New York for two days to consider, among other things, how to switch the focus of campaign Internet activity from partisan politics to governing.
 Is it possible to translate the online expertise developed during campaigns into running the federal bureaucracy? To take the energy that goes into manipulating voters to win elections and convert it into listening to voters and being transparent, accountable and accessible? 
 The subject matter explains the title of the conference, ''Rebooting the System,'' which was held by the Personal Democracy Forum, a group that focuses on how technology affects politics. 
 ''Looking over the horizon, we think it's time to start giving more attention to how networked people are starting to change governance,'' Andrew Rasiej and Micah Sifry, the moderators of the forum, wrote in an introductory pamphlet.
 ''For all the attention we pay to the Web's impact on the process of electing people to office and running advocacy campaigns,'' they added, ''we're seeing real changes beginning to happen in how public officials interact with citizens and in how both groups are using social software and the social Web to try new approaches to addressing big problems.''
 Changes are already happening on the local and state levels, but perhaps the greatest challenge remains with the United States government, one of the biggest bureaucracies, and biggest disseminators of information, in the world.
 If those at the conference have their way, pressure will increase on Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain to make ''e-commitments'' before the election about things like opening up federal data, making federal agencies more responsive and making broadband access a priority. (Most perceive Mr. Obama as miles ahead of Mr. McCain on this score; read here about how the matter came up at the conference.)
 The conference included reports of some interesting developments in other countries. In Britain, for example, it is easy to keep track of what is said in Parliament through theyworkforyou.com, which provides transcripts that allow readers to click and see video of that part of each speech. One of the most popular sites, petitions.pm.gov.uk, allows citizens to petition the prime minister directly.
 Even little Estonia has made several advancements. Citizens there can slide their state I.D. card into a computer, for example, and see the private data held about them in 75 different data bases and when it was last accessed, according to Steven Clift of e-democracy.org.
 ''Maybe 50 years of Communism made them realize they needed to give their citizens these rights,'' Mr. Clift said. 
 In a true democracy, he said, everything should be online ''unless the law says otherwise.'' 
 The United States government certainly has Web sites -- more than 24,000 of them, with 24,000 different designs. They grew like topsy over the last decade, without any kind of Web strategy. Some are downright bizarre. The Department of Defense, for example, has a site about herding cats on military ranges.
 ''This calls into question whether we're really managing what we have out there,'' said Sheila Campbell, the manager of best practices at usa.gov, which tries to help citizens navigate the federal bureaucracy. 
 She questioned whether herding cats was ''a core government task.''
 As a government emissary, especially one with a sense of humor, Ms. Campbell was a popular speaker on various panels at the conference. Many attendees were surprised that the government was putting much effort into the Web at all, and she was swamped with questions.
 In addition to overseeing best practices, she is co-chair of the Federal Web Managers Council, made up of more than two dozen senior Web managers from the government who are trying to improve federal Web sites and who serve as the steering committee for the Web Content Managers Forum, a group of nearly 1,300 government Web managers.
 We sat down with Ms. Campbell and with another representative from the government, Sam Gallagher, who is the departmental Web manager at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, to find out a bit more about what they do.
 Ms. Campbell, 41, came to her job after serving in the Peace Corps, in Togo, and then working on an internal Web site for Peace Corps employees.
 Mr. Gallagher, 43, was involved in print publishing for a non-profit group in Washington. Neither of them had technical backgrounds.
 The chief things that people want from government Web sites, Ms. Campbell said, are to get a passport, apply for a business loan, find affordable housing, find ways to reduce energy costs and get a government job.
 ''There is a real cost to not being able to get these things done, in trust and productivity,'' she said. ''If it takes you 20 minutes to download a student financial aid form, that's a real cost to our economy.'' 
 But there are several hurdles to improving the sites and keeping up with new technologies. These include legal and policy restrictions as well as security concerns and a lack of resources (and difficulty in planning ahead, given the federal budget process). 
 Another problem is in using video, which they desperately want to do. But the American Rehabilitation Act, regarding people with disabilities, means all government video has to be captioned, which takes time and money. 
 ''We want to speak to the public in the places they are,'' Mr. Gallagher said. ''Our Web site gets 2 million visitors a month; YouTube gets 75 million. If we're going to talk to people about home ownership, we have to go to YouTube. The audience is there.''
 Another delay in putting up videos, he said, is in finding the right tone for them and ''not sounding like a bureaucrat.''
 Some sites are becoming more consumer-oriented instead of being organization-oriented. One surprise, at least to us, was the Web site at the Transportation Security Administration.
 The government had been inundated with so many complaints about airport security measures and the T.S.A. was so unpopular that the agency started a blog to try to address the anger. It also made a video explaining why it had started the blog. (Officials say in the video that they want to explain what they're doing so that passengers will trust them more and they can spend their time maintaining security rather than arguing.)
 ''This epitomizes the future of open government,'' Ms. Campbell said. ''Many agencies are looking to the T.S.A. as a model of success.''
 The T.S.A. even uses Twitter, which raises another challenge: figuring out what technology to use in what circumstance.
 ''This is why we have 24,000 Web sites, because we all rushed out and made them, and there were no standards and no strategies,'' Mr. Gallagher said. ''We don't want to go through that again. The public is not served by 50,000 public blogs.''
 Some of the Web managers just had a conference call about the task of boiling down government information so it can be accessed by mobile technology.
 Ms. Campbell and Mr. Gallagher said their immediate goals include streamlining information and creating common urls on various agency sites so that they all give out the same information on, say, the recent tomato recall or the California wildfires or a hurricane.
 More broadly, they hope to help people complete common tasks efficiently, get rid of redundant, outdated and trivial information, and ensure access to underserved populations, including those with disabilities and limited proficiency in English.
 In their introduction to the conference, Mr. Rasiej and Mr. Sifry seemed to sense the scope of the undertaking ahead. 
 ''It may be too soon to talk about the rise of Government 2.0,'' they wrote, ''but it's time to start that conversation.''

HEADLINE: The President, Right or Wrong?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''The Bush Paradox'' (column, June 24):
 David Brooks waxes eloquent about President Bush's ''self-confidence'' leading to the surge in Iraq, arguing that ''every personal trait that led Bush to make a hash of the first years of the war led him to make a successful decision when it came to this crucial call.'' 
 Even if one were to accept the premise that the surge is working, this is scant compensation for the tattered state of our economy, our Middle East policy and our reputation in the world. 
 If the president in his stubbornness was correct about the surge, well, I can only point out that even a stopped clock gives the correct time twice a day.
 Jack Drescher
 New York, June 24, 2008
 To the Editor:
 I was surprised to see David Brooks call Democrats to task for not supporting the surge. The problem that thoughtful people have with George W. Bush is not that he is always wrong, or even that the surge was wrong, but that he makes decisions with a stubbornness and a lack of desire for debate that makes it likely he will be wrong frequently and disastrously. Matt Stolbach
 New York, June 24, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Kudos to David Brooks for having the courage to stand up for President Bush when the commander in chief's approval ratings are near their lowest. 
 While I generally do not support President Bush's policies (nor am I a Republican, for that matter), let's give credit where credit is due. If a policy advocate cannot admit when an adversary's ideas were, in point of fact, perceptive, then the prospects of our democracy's continuing success are grim indeed.
 Brian Gilson
 Memphis, June 24, 2008
 To the Editor:
 David Brooks summed up my problem with President Bush in the last paragraph: ''The reason we have democracy is that no one side is right all the time. The only people who are dangerous are those who can't admit, even to themselves, that obvious fact.''
 I believe that George W. Bush is one of those people who can't admit, even to himself, that obvious fact.
 Douglas J. Fleckner 
 Las Vegas, June 24, 2008
 To the Editor:
 David Brooks does not mention something significant in his defense of President Bush's support for the 2007 military surge in Iraq. If President Bush had listened to Gen. Eric K. Shinseki's advice on the initial troop levels in Iraq, a surge might never have been necessary four years after the initial invasion.
 Paul Czarnecki
 Georgetown, Ky., June 24, 2008
 To the Editor:
 ''The Bush Paradox'' brings to mind another uncertainty. Is our occupation in Iraq a mere postponement of an all-out civil war whenever we decide to leave?
 Prolonging the error of our decision to go to war, compounded with our decision not to withdraw, only adds fuel to the discontent of factions destined to pursue their claims to power. Remaining there as referees will only delay the inevitable. Priscilla Shaheen
 Methuen, Mass., June 24, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Everyone seems to think that the surge is working. David Brooks takes that as a fact, and praises George W. Bush for sticking to his guns in the face of much criticism. 
 But I can't see where the surge has worked at all. Sure, violence is down, but that's because ethnic cleansing has taken place in many of the more violent regions of Iraq. There simply aren't many mixed neighborhoods, and thus there simply aren't as many targets for violence. 
 As well, from news accounts, the violence has dropped to 2004 levels. In 2004, we thought that 2004 levels were intolerable. 
 I will acknowledge that the surge has worked only when the violence is down to 2002 levels in ethnically mixed neighborhoods. Margie Parko
 Crossville, Tenn., June 24, 2008
 To the Editor:
 David Brooks gives credit to George W. Bush's stubbornness because the surge in Iraq is apparently working. I certainly hope that things are better, and will continue to be so. But it was also Mr. Bush's stubbornness at work when he did not listen to his generals early on when they wanted an ''upfront surge'' of far more troops than were eventually deployed. 
 How much better things would be for all if he had listened to the people who were better able to know what was needed. Cynthia Hair Herrmann
 Phoenix, June 24, 2008
 To the Editor:
 David Brooks credits the president's stubbornness to fight on and on forever as some kind of wisdom due our acknowledgment. That's like praising a baseball manager for sticking with a rag-arm pitcher who, after allowing 10 runs to cross the plate, finally gets out of the inning with a strikeout.

HEADLINE: Strong Sales Of Software Lift Oracle's Net Income

BYLINE: By LAURIE J. FLYNN

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
Oracle sounded a warning bell that growth was likely to slow in the first quarter as the company absorbed its latest major acquisition, BEA Systems.
 Oracle, the second-largest independent software company after Microsoft, did however ease investors' concerns about weaker corporate sales by reporting that net income in its fourth quarter, which ended May 31, rose 27 percent, to $2.04 billion or 39 cents a share on strong software sales. 
 The company said that revenue climbed 24 percent to $7.2 billion, from $5.8 billion in the quarter a year ago. Sales of new software licenses rose 27 percent to $3.1 billion, from $2.5 billion. Oracle's growth improved in the United States, with new license sales rising 22 percent.
 ''These strong results indicate that Oracle's hard-charging sales culture and diversified product lineup are paying off, even in challenging economic times,'' said Andy Miedler, an analyst with Edward Jones.
 Analysts had not expected Oracle to do as well as it did. Shares of Oracle fell 78 cents, or more than 3 percent in after-hours trading Wednesday, after the report was released. Earlier in the day, its shares rose 32 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $22.55. 
 Investors were reacting to the company predicting that because it had strong growth in the first quarter a year ago, by comparison, growth in the current quarter may look weak. 
 Safra A. Catz, Oracle's chief financial officer and co-president, told investors in a conference call Wednesday that she expected software license growth in the current quarter of only 10 to 20 percent, but that over all she was ''confident about Oracle's prospects.'' She said that in last year's first quarter, new license growth jumped 35 percent. 
 ''We are aware of the broader economic environment in which we operate, and we can't predict the economy from one quarter to the next,'' Ms. Catz said.
 Total revenue should rise 18 percent to 20 percent in the first quarter, compared with the same period a year earlier, Ms. Catz said. Oracle expects first-quarter earnings of 26 cents to 27 cents a share, before one-time items, Ms. Catz said.
 Charles E. Phillips, co-president of Oracle, said the company was taking market share from its competitors, particularly SAP, the big German software maker and Oracle's chief rival. ''This is the third consecutive year we've taken applications market share from SAP,'' he said.
 During the fourth quarter, the company closed its $8.5 billion acquisition of BEA Systems, a move that expands Oracle's software offerings and makes Oracle one of the largest publishers of corporate software known as middleware, one of the industry's fastest growing segments. Middleware programs operate between a company's database system and its payroll, inventory and other business management systems that use the data.
 Oracle has spent $35 billion buying rivals during the last four years in an effort to broaden the range of industries it can sell to. The strategy has been largely successful as corporate buyers increasingly look to buy multiple components from the same vendor.

HEADLINE: Nader on Obama II

BYLINE: By JULIE BOSMAN

 BODY:
Ralph Nader on Wednesday defended the comments he had made to a newspaper suggesting that Senator Barack Obama has not devoted enough time to poverty in inner cities and rural areas and ''wants to talk white.'' 
 In an interview with The Rocky Mountain News in Denver, Mr. Nader, who is running as an independent for president, said of Mr. Obama: ''There's only one thing different about Barack Obama when it comes to being a Democratic presidential candidate. He's half African-American. Whether that will make any difference, I don't know. I haven't heard him have a strong crackdown on economic exploitation in the ghettos. Payday loans, predatory lending, asbestos, lead. What's keeping him from doing that? Is it because he wants to talk white? He doesn't want to appear like Jesse Jackson?''
 In a telephone interview, Mr. Nader elaborated on his criticisms, saying that Mr. Obama had not discussed poverty in the inner cities enough, and that as an African-American he should.
 ''What difference it should make is that he would be more sensitive and determined to bring elevated visibility and concrete programs to deal with these issues,'' Mr. Nader said. ''Wouldn't a woman president be expected to be more responsive to women's rights? It's just more natural.''
 He said Mr. Obama ''obviously made a tactical decision that he's not going to campaign politically as Jesse Jackson did.'' 
 ''He wants to come across that he's not politically threatening to the white power class and the liberal intelligentsia,'' Mr. Nader said. ''It's been a brilliant tactic.''
 Asked about the comments at a news conference in Chicago on Wednesday, Mr. Obama said Mr. Nader had not been paying attention to his campaign, where ''I've devoted multiple speeches, town-hall meetings to'' the issues Mr. Nader raised.
 He added: ''Ralph Nader is trying to get attention. It's a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protection, it's an extraordinary one.''
 ''But his campaign has not been able to get traction,'' Mr. Obama said, adding, ''It is what it is.''JULIE BOSMAN

HEADLINE: In May, Housing Market Rallied With Small Gain

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
The ailing housing market got a bit of a bump last month, as steadily falling home prices led to a small increase in sales, a realty group said Thursday.
 Sales of previously owned homes, which make up most of the nation's housing market, increased 2 percent in May, reversing two months of declines. Sales ran at an annualized pace of 4.99 million, up from 4.89 million in April, according to a report from the National Association of Realtors, an industry group. 
 Though sales were up for the month, economists said that May was an anomaly amid a broader downward trend. 
 ''We do not expect residential real estate markets to turn around soon,'' Stuart G. Hoffman, the chief economist of PNC Bank, wrote in a note to clients. ''Buyers still face significant disincentives as home prices continue to drop in most markets.''
 Seasonal factors were cited by economists as an impetus for the rise in sales. Some warned that conditions had deteriorated since the data for the report was recorded.
 ''Unemployment and mortgage rates have risen further, and consumers have moved closer to a breakdown,'' Dimitry Fleming, an economist at ING Bank in London, wrote in a note. ''We doubt a further recovery is at hand.''
 Sales of single-family homes were up 1.6 percent, and sales of apartments and condominiums increased by 5.5 percent. Sales rose 5.5 percent in the Midwest, 4.6 percent in the Northeast and 2 percent in the West. In the South, sales dropped 0.5 percent.
 Values rose as well, with the median price rising to $208,600, from $201,200 in April. Prices moved higher for both single-family and multifamily dwellings. 
 The high level of inventories still poses a problem for sellers; at this pace, it would take about 11 months to work off the current housing inventory, according to the report.
 ''The large supply of homes on the market clearly favors buyers, and it should take several months to draw the inventory down,'' Lawrence Yun, the Realtors' chief economist, said in a statement. 
 While the increase in home sales came in slightly ahead of economists' expectations, a comparison with May 2007 reveals the extent of the damage done to the housing market. 
 Sales were down nearly 16 percent from a year ago, and condominium sales were off by 25 percent. Median prices were 6.3 percent lower than in May 2007.
 Mr. Yun said that while foreclosures continue to hurt the market, sales in some distressed markets had improved. He cited Sacramento, the San Fernando Valley and Monterey County in California; Sarasota, Fla.; and Battle Creek, Mich.
 In a separate report on Thursday, the government slightly raised its estimate for the nation's economic activity in the first quarter. The growth in the gross domestic product was revised up to 1 percent, from a preliminary estimate of 0.9 percent, the Commerce Department said. The government originally estimated that the economy grew by a sluggish 0.6 percent. 
 The Labor Department said in a report Thursday that the number of new applications filed for unemployment benefits was unchanged last week, holding steady at 384,000.
 Despite the better-than-expected data, stock markets traded sharply lower Thursday after several prominent companies received downgrades from Wall Street analysts. Shares of Citigroup dropped 6 percent, and General Motors fell 11 percent after Goldman Sachs said the companies would face new problems in coming months.

HEADLINE: Not Your Mother's Original-Cast Albums

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
A surge of oxygen pours through the original cast albums of ''In the Heights'' and ''Passing Strange,'' two musicals that have shown Broadway how to revitalize a somnolent form this season. 
 You can also feel that breeze in the cast album of the Off Broadway show ''Adding Machine'' and a faint puff of fresh air in the quiet cast album of ''A Catered Affair.'' There are no plans for a ''Cry-Baby'' recording, but its witty rock 'n' roll parody lyrics give the last twist of the knife to ''Grease''-era nostalgia; it is now irredeemably camp. 
 An album of the revival of ''Gypsy,'' with a performance by Patti LuPone for which there is only one word -- volcanic -- is due in August. It will include several never-before-recorded songs that were cut from the original production, with new orchestrations by Jonathan Tunick. 
 Until recently I imagined the Broadway musical locked inside a museum, at which a superannuated curator in a seersucker suit, bow tie and horn-rimmed glasses politely welcomed guests to the tea party. But not anymore. Once that curator extended a trembling hand to eager new faces, fresh air wafted in; the tea and cucumber sandwiches were supplanted by beer and pizza, and the music blasted all night. 
 That doesn't mean that patriarchs like Rodgers and Hammerstein, haughtily gazing down from the museum walls, no longer speak to us. You can't listen to the cast album of the Lincoln Center revival of ''South Pacific'' without becoming misty-eyed for an era of cockeyed postwar optimism when all America sang Rodgers and Hammerstein hits and absorbed the moral instruction in their songs. 
 Cockeyed optimism may not describe today's climate. But the giddy euphoria that has always been a hallmark of Broadway musicals explodes on the two-disc cast album of ''In the Heights.'' Although expressed in a different musical vocabulary, this bilingual show (more English than Spanish) is as secure as ''South Pacific'' in its faith that a better future lies ahead.
 This show's true believers are not white, middle-class sailors and nurses fighting a just war in the Pacific. They are economically struggling Dominican, Puerto Rican, Cuban and African-American residents of Washington Heights, the melting pot idealized in the show. For ''In the Heights,'' which just won a Tony Award for best musical, embodies a compelling argument that immigration is the lifeblood of America. 
 Lin-Manuel Miranda, the blazingly talented 28-year-old who wrote the music and lyrics and stars as the Dominican storekeeper Usnavi, respects popular music traditions. Early in the show he interpolates quotations from Duke Ellington (''Take the 'A' Train'') and Cole Porter (''Too Darn Hot'') into the partly rapped title song, an ensemble number that introduces most of the characters. Throughout, the score echoes (but doesn't quote outright) ''West Side Story,'' especially ''America'' and the great mambo dance sequence. 
 But for all its nods to old-school Broadway ''In the Heights'' is truly an uptown musical. The score is a fluid, authentic mix of salsa, rap and reggaeton. For a show set in a heavily Dominican neighborhood with a Dominican character as its official greeter, the absence of merengue is puzzling. But as a broadly sketched overview of Latin musical cultures that collide and merge in the melting pot, the score is still wildly exhilarating. 
 The rap lyrics, however sanitized for Broadway, carry pungent streetwise inflections, and Mr. Miranda delivers them with an aggressive swagger that illustrates the power of rap as a storytelling medium. 
 The influence of rap is the underlying story of the past Broadway musical season. Words, either rapped or sung in variations of the traditional patter song, are loosening the grip of traditional melody on Broadway. Lament it if you will, but stand-alone songs have a way of interrupting the narrative. Even in musicals without hip-hop, recitative and songs flow into each other more smoothly nowadays; the story is the thing, and language the vehicle. 
 Mr. Manuel and his orchestrators Alex Lacamoire and Bill Sherman twirl various styles of Latin music into a fabric that is continually changing color and pace. The sprawling ensemble numbers, ''96,000,'' ''Blackout'' and ''Carnaval del Barrio,'' in particular, portray a whole community of disparate voices, speaking as one and at the same time as individuals. Words that go by too quickly to be picked up in the theater can be studied while listening to the cast album with the booklet at hand. These virtuosic numbers suggest denser elaborations of the pre-rumble ''Tonight'' sequence from ''West Side Story.'' 
 A binding ingredient of Mr. Miranda's score is tuneful Broadway pop that coalesces into a plaintive 11 o'clock number, ''Everything I Know,'' in the second act. Though not a great song, it serves effectively as the show's emotional grounding wire. 
 Because ''Passing Strange'' has no sugar coating, in some ways it is almost anti-Broadway. The songs, with music by Stew and Heidi Rodewald (he plays guitar, and she plays bass onstage) and lyrics by Stew, describe the personal odyssey of a rebellious middle-class African-American musician who goes from Los Angeles to Europe in a search for his identity. 
 The galumphing rock score in which a song can suddenly change character without warning reflects the character's uncertainty about who he is. The Narrator (the grown-up Stew) observes the life of his younger self, Youth (Daniel Breaker), with an affectionately critical eye. When Stew riffs on electric guitar and declaims his lyrics in a gruff holler, you hear echoes of Jimi Hendrix. Later on he morphs into a punk rocker. There is a broad, sarcastic parody of ''Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds'' when the young Stew ingests psychedelics. 
 The young man's naive infatuation with Europe, where he dives into a bohemian paradise of sex and drugs, inspires an amusing rock parody of ''A Man and a Woman'' and a sarcastic Kander and Ebb spoof, ''The Black One,'' which is a scathing response to his being fetishized as an angry black militant by a group of German cultural revolutionaries: 
 ''Who lends the club that speak-easy air?/The black one, the black one!/Who dances like a god and has 'wunderbar' hair?/Der Schwarze.'' In conclusion he wonders if he is ''the postmodern lawn jockey sculpture.''
 The term postmodern indicates the intellectual seriousness of the show, which won the Tony for best original score. As the character matures and becomes bored with easy pleasure, his search carries him into a philosophic realm rarely visited by the Broadway musical. ''What's Inside Is Just a Lie/And Now I'm Ready to Explode'' describes a psychic earthquake in which Youth decides ''our feelings and our dreams have actually been put there by a system.'' In desperation he determines to turn his life into a work of art, that work being ''Passing Strange.''
 The show's final song, ''Love Like That,'' offers the closest thing to a comfortable answer to his questions: ''Cuz the Real is a construct.../It's the raw nerve's private zone/It's a personal sunset .../You drive off into alone.'' ''Passing Strange'' is too true to its own vision to culminate in an explosion of joyful affirmation. It ends with a sigh. 
 Joshua Schmidt's score for ''Adding Machine'' is just as harsh and darkly funny. The protagonist of this musical adaptation of Elmer Rice's 1923 expressionistic play is a repressed number-crunching boor, Mr. Zero (Joel Hatch), who hates his job and his shrewish wife.
 Mr. Schmidt's music is percussive, mechanistic and frequently discordant as characters robotically chant lists of numbers, the monotony broken by bursts of rage and frustration. The score, at once hypnotic and corrosive, goes beyond Brecht-Weill in evoking a dystopic world. The one catchy tune, ''I'd Rather Watch You,'' sung by Daisy (Amy Warren), Zero's office mate who has a secret crush on him, is a slowed-up 1920s-style barroom waltz. 
 The fiendish cosmic joke occurs when Zero, executed for the murder of his boss, lands in Elysian fields, where he discovers that freedom in the afterlife is unbearable because there is no morality. A mocking chorus sings, ''And we must each/Believe, believe/Our lives will all/Add up to something in the end.''
 Although wistfulness and anger crop up in John Bucchino's music and lyrics for ''A Catered Affair,'' the kind of nihilism trumpeted by ''Adding Machine'' is nowhere to be found. The main characters, Aggie (Faith Prince) and her husband, Tom (Tom Wopat), are softened, realistic descendants of the careworn working people in ''Adding Machine'' and they're observed tenderly instead of harshly. 
 ''A Catered Affair'' is a delicate, 1950s kitchen-sink chamber piece. Mr. Bucchino's score, his first for Broadway, is true to the mood of the show, which has finely shaded performances by Ms. Prince and Mr. Wopat and an irritatingly outsize one by Harvey Fierstein, who can barely sing. Ms. Prince's touching big number, ''Married,'' is delivered with appropriate Shirley Booth-meets-Edith Bunker plainness. The score's one moment of high drama, Mr. Wopat's ''I Stayed,'' is an eloquent swatch of narrative songwriting that breaks the mood of weary resignation at exactly the right moment. It is a modest, touching male answer to ''Rose's Turn'' in ''Gypsy,'' a perfect moment.
 The biggest impediment to falling in love with the new cast album of ''South Pacific'' is the memory of the 1949 original with Ezio Pinza and Mary Martin. The orchestra for this Lincoln Center Theater production, even beefed up, sounds smaller. That 1949 recording begins with a thunderous overture that sweeps into ''Bali Hai'' like a tidal wave. The supercharged sense of inevitability that permeates the original is only fleetingly captured in the Lincoln Center production. 
 Paulo Szot, who looks like a younger Pinza, sings wonderfully but without the same rock-bottom authority. Kelli O'Hara's Nellie Forbush is irresistible to watch, but less so to hear on the album, because her voice lacks the personality of either a Mary Martin or a Reba McEntire, who sang the role in concert with Brian Stokes Mitchell. Ms. O'Hara is perfectly fine but not definitive.
 The wonder is how fresh the score still sounds. ''South Pacific'' caught a wave of American history at Broadway's high tide, like no other show has since. The museum that opened it doors to Stew and Mr. Miranda was built around musicals like it.

HEADLINE: When an Eloquent Voice Was Stilled in Hollywood

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
Peter Askin's stirring documentary ''Trumbo'' gives you reasons to cheer but also to weep. It makes you lament the decline of the kind of language brandished with Shakespearean eloquence by Dalton Trumbo, the blacklisted Hollywood screenwriter, in his witty, impassioned letters excerpted in the movie. 
 Some of those letters, collected in the 1999 volume ''Additional Dialogue,'' are delivered as forceful dramatic soliloquies by a battery of distinguished actors including Joan Allen, Brian Dennehy, Michael Douglas, Paul Giamatti, Nathan Lane, Liam Neeson, David Strathairn, Josh Lucas and Donald Sutherland. 
 Another cause for lament is the shortness of historical memory in today's climate of infinite distraction. Why chew on the unhappy events of six decades ago when you can drool over pictures of Brangelina or get lost in the latest video game? Anyway, who cares what happened way back then? 
 But we should care. If the story of the Hollywood blacklist and the lives it destroyed has been told many times before, it still bears repeating, especially in the post-9/11 climate of fearmongering, of Guantanamo, of flag pins as gauges of patriotism. 
 ''Trumbo,'' which Dalton Trumbo's son, Christopher, adapted from his own 2003 Off Broadway play of the same name, is much richer than its source, which originally starred Nathan Lane as Trumbo. It is a portrait of this notoriously cantankerous and combative writer as a noble champion of free speech who was willing to lose everything to defend his principles.
 Beginning in 1950, Trumbo spent 11 months in prison for defying the House Un-American Activities Committee three years earlier by refusing to identify colleagues in the movie business who, like him, had dabbled with Communism. Trumbo joined the American Communist Party in 1943. 
 Before his blacklisting, Trumbo, who died in 1976 at age 70, was one of the most successful Hollywood screenwriters of the 1940s, with credits that included ''Kitty Foyle,''''A Guy Named Joe'' and ''Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo.'' With the blacklist, he became the most famous member of what came to be called the Hollywood Ten: writers and directors who had flirted with Communism during the Depression and World War II, when the Soviet Union was an ally and the horrors of Stalinism were yet to be revealed. 
 The movie's clips of the Congressional tribunal in which the elite of Hollywood were publicly interrogated by a sneering kangaroo court are as shocking as ever. After the hearings, producers and studio heads met at the Waldorf-Astoria to draw up the Waldorf Statement, which banned the Hollywood Ten from working in movies; henceforth they were pariahs. 
 A devastating Trumbo letter read by Mr. Neeson blames the producers more than Congress for the effectiveness of the blacklist, because they could ''apply the only lash that really stings -- economic reprisal.'' Their livelihood denied them, the Hollywood Ten were financially ruined and socially ostracized.
 One of the saddest letters (read by Mr. Strathairn) is Trumbo's outraged protest to a teacher at his daughter Mitzi's school when Mitzi found herself shunned by her peers after word circulated about her father's history. The funniest letter (read by Mr. Lane), addressed to Christopher, is a hilarious high-flown disquisition on masturbation, an activity that Trumbo pursued as a youth with terrible guilt and fear of the consequences.
 Interwoven among the letters are clips from television interviews with Trumbo, including one in which he calls the verdict ''contempt of Congress'' a just one because contempt was exactly what he felt. There are also home movies; personal reflections by Christopher and Mitzi; and revealing scenes from postblacklist movies like ''Papillon,''''The Sandpiper,''''The Fixer'' and ''Spartacus'' in which Trumbo used his characters as explicit moral and political mouthpieces. 
 Trumbo emerges as a fervently resolute, highly literate man of principle who, along with the other members of the Hollywood Ten, cited the First Amendment, protecting free speech, and not the Fifth, protecting self-incrimination, as his defense.
 After his release from prison, Trumbo and his wife, Cleo, moved with their children to Mexico, where he soon exhausted his reserves. He returned to California, living as anonymously as possible, and resumed screenwriting for low pay, using pseudonyms (13 in all). 
 Two of those screenplays won Oscars: ''The Brave One,'' in 1957, for best writing of a motion picture story, was awarded to the fictional Robert Rich and went unclaimed. (Trumbo was finally given his award in 1975.) In 1954 he won in the same category for ''Roman Holiday,'' under the name of a friend, the British screenwriter Ian McLellan Hunter, who had fronted for him. The Oscar was presented posthumously to Cleo Trumbo in 1993.
 In 1960 Trumbo finally received screen credit for his work again when Kirk Douglas, the star and a producer of ''Spartacus,'' and Otto Preminger, the director of ''Exodus,'' overrode the blacklist. The documentary's biggest lapse is its failure to show exactly how they did it and the risks they took. 
 If only the movers and shakers of Hollywood 13 years earlier had stood together like the slaves in ''Spartacus'' and all claimed to have been Communists, the blacklist might have been averted. But they didn't. Fear can make people instant cowards and informers. Resisting it may be the ultimate test of character. 
 Today few would dispute Trumbo's assessment of that very dark period: ''The blacklist was a time of evil, and no one who survived it on either side came through untouched by evil.''

HEADLINE: Union Says It and Con Edison Are Far Apart on Contract

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON and STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Consolidated Edison and the union that represents nearly 9,000 of its workers appear to be making little headway in negotiations to renew their four-year contract before its expiration at 12:01 a.m. on Sunday. 
 Workers from Local 1-2 of the Utility Workers Union of America, who have not gone on strike in a quarter-century, voted overwhelmingly two weeks ago to allow their leaders to call a strike if no agreement is reached by the deadline.
 As the two sides plan to continue negotiations this weekend in Secaucus, N.J., a spokesman for Con Edison said it would mobilize managers if necessary to keep its electrical grid working. It serves virtually all of the five boroughs and most of Westchester County.
 The union is opposed to company proposals to phase out a defined-benefit pension plan and to deduct workers' compensation awards from employee pensions.
 ''If they continue to press the issue, we will walk,'' promised Joe Flaherty, a spokesman for the union, which represents Con Edison workers everywhere but on Staten Island. ''It seems to us that they want to force us out.''
 Mr. Flaherty said his union was asking for wage increases because of rising prices for fuel, food and other basics. He noted that many cable splicers, meter readers, engineers and others must drive to work because they often travel among several locations.
 Mr. Flaherty said that unlike previous negotiations, when only a handful of details remained unresolved so close to the contract's expiration, this time the two sides had yet to agree on a host of significant issues.
 ''I've never seen it at this stage, when there's absolutely nothing resolved,'' he said. ''I would say their position is stonewalling.''
 A spokesman for Con Edison, Michael S. Clendenin, declined to respond to the union's claims, saying: ''We don't negotiate in the press.'' 
 Mr. Clendenin said that managers were ready to maintain service and respond to emergencies in the event of a strike, noting that more than half of the company's managers came up through the ranks. Over all, Con Edison employs about 13,000 people.
 Several Con Ed officials who were well informed about the talks, and who explained that they did not want to alarm the public unnecessarily, said they thought a strike was unlikely, especially when many workers were being squeezed or hurt by the nation's economic slowdown. They said that the union often turns up the rhetoric to pressure the company.
 The last time Con Edison workers went on strike was in 1983. It lasted nine weeks, after which the union won wage increases of 14.5 percent over two years, as well as improved fringe benefits.
 The only major incident affecting service during the strike was a three-day blackout in the garment district in Midtown Manhattan. A broken water main started an underground electrical fire and knocked out power in a 12-block area. Managers and supervisors spliced cables and made repairs.

GUNNIN' FOR THAT
 #1 Spot
 Opens on Friday in Manhattan. 
 Directed by Adam Yauch 
 1 hour 30 minutes
 On Sept. 1, 2006, two dozen of America's top-ranked high school basketball players converged on Rucker Park in Harlem for an unprecedented event. Regardless of age, experience or sneaker-company affiliation, these athletes would play for no other reason than love of the game.
 The musician and filmmaker Adam Yauch (of the Beastie Boys) was there with his camera, and the result is ''Gunnin' for That #1 Spot,'' an on-the-fly record of a memorable moment in basketball history. Focusing on eight players from a wide variety of socioeconomic backgrounds -- like Kevin Love, the nephew of Mike Love of the Beach Boys, and Donte Greene, whose grandfather works as a janitor to support him -- the movie travels to hometowns and sketches personal histories. Coaches, experts and members of the media all have their say, but this disarmingly unaffected, rough-hewn film lives and dies on the court itself. 
 As guileless and eager as the most avid fan, ''Gunnin' '' is neither cautionary nor analytical, allowing its insights to occur organically and without fancy camera moves. Behind the bone-crunching collisions and impossible jump shots lurk the pitfalls and pressures faced by increasingly young athletes -- the ever-changing rankings, the circling recruiters, the dangling endorsements -- but right now these kids are happy with just a ball, a team and a crowd. We should all be so lucky. JEANNETTE CATSOULIS
 ''Gunnin' for That #1 Spot'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Baskets are shattered and expletives lobbed.
 ALL IN THIS TEA
 Opens on Friday in Manhattan. 
 Directed by Les Blank and Gina Leibrecht
 1 hour 10 minutes; not rated 
 An old Indian legend tells of how, after several years of intense meditation, the Buddhist monk Bodhidharma began to grow sleepy. His goal being spiritual awakening, this just wouldn't do, so he removed his eyelids and flung them to the ground. From the spot where they landed grew the first tea leaves. 
 This story is told in ''All in This Tea,'' which is, yes, a documentary about a beverage. A delicious documentary, as it turns out, and one that manages a harmonious blend of themes and subjects in its brisk running time. 
 Directed by Les Blank and Gina Leibrecht, the movie finds an amiable guide to the world of tea and its cultivation in David Lee Hoffman, an American importer dedicated to securing the freshest teas in China. Committed as well to buying directly from local farmers, Mr. Hoffman runs smack into China's notoriously complex bureaucracy, leading to comedic scenarios. (How do you say ''worm droppings'' in Chinese?) 
 ''All in This Tea'' dips effortlessly into a half-dozen modes -- travelogue, biography, nature ode, business story, nerd profile -- sustaining a flexibility of tone that allows for both keen insights into the rapidly evolving Chinese economy and drunken raptures on the ability, in one especially prized blend, ''to taste the mountain.''

 ELSA & FRED
 Opens on Friday in Manhattan. 
 Directed by Marco Carnevale 
 In Spanish, with English subtitles
 1 hour 46 minutes
 As increasing numbers of baby boomers march noisily into late middle age and early dinners, the wrinkly romance (a genre generally ignored by youth-obsessed Hollywood unless the wrinkles belong to Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson) could become a multiplex staple. Look out for softer popcorn and larger subtitles.
 One early adapter is the Argentine director Marcos Carnevale, whose ''Elsa & Fred'' is both a movie about love and a love letter to movies. Meeting cute over a fender bender, Elsa (China Zorrilla, firing on all cylinders) and Fred (Manuel Alexandre) begin an awkward, prickly affair. She's an inveterate liar of indeterminate vintage; he's a 78-year-old widower ready for a quiet life. Though appalled by his new squeeze's carpe diem behavior and contempt for cholesterol, Fred is easy meat for a woman whose libidinous preferences once leaned toward male strippers.
 Engagingly acted and more than a little corny (Elsa's lifelong wish is to re-enact the Trevi Fountain scene from ''La Dolce Vita''), ''Elsa & Fred'' is best enjoyed as a sampling of Ms. Zorrilla's combustible energy and still dazzling screen presence. There are also moments of credible intimacy, like the ease between Fred and his young doctor as they discuss the physical boundaries of the affair. In movies like this expect medication to deliver the most vital -- and least celebrated -- supporting performance. JEANNETTE CATSOULIS
 ''Elsa & Fred'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). Characters flirt, frolic and fabricate.
 RED ROSES AND PETROL
 Opens on Friday in Manhattan. 
 Directed by Tamar Simon Hoffs
 1 hour 37 minutes 
 Leave it to the Irish to turn misery and recrimination into an art form. In ''Red Roses and Petrol,'' a soused, post-funeral postmortem on a dysfunctional Dublin family, the misery seeps from the screen in cold, damp waves; by the end you'll be grabbing for the bottle yourself.
 The epicenter of all this wretchedness is the patriarch, Enda (Malcolm McDowell, appearing solely in flashback and on home video), now deceased, a college librarian and self-regarding poet. Reluctantly reuniting for the mysteriously deserted wake, his broken offspring settle in for an evening of booze and bickering: the aimless, 20-something daughter (Heather Juergensen); the self-punishing older sister (Susan Lynch); and the prodigal son (Max Beesley), a wounded wastrel emptying most of his emotional baggage on meaningless sex and controlled substances.
 While Ma (Olivia Tracey) tipples wearily in the kitchen, and Da incriminates himself in a video diary, the secrets and lies emerge as both unsurprising and uninvolving. The director, Tamar Simon Hoffs, never liberates the material from its confined theatricality (the film is based on Joseph O'Connor's play), and the principals -- who are all excellent -- continually battle her stilted framing and excessively gloomy lighting. All in all, this is a movie best enjoyed with a snoot full and a morbid disposition. JEANNETTE CATSOULIS
 ''Red Roses and Petrol'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Cocaine is snorted, a stewardess is groped, and alcohol is inhaled.
 WICKED LAKE
 Opens on Friday in Manhattan. 
 Directed by Zach Passero 
 1 hour 35 minutes; not rated 
 It's not the water that menaces in ''Wicked Lake,'' an inept, nasty and absolutely irredeemable entry in the stale torture-porn subgenre of horror that more often than not features bloodthirsty clans residing in the backwoods. The lake serves only as a skinny-dipping site for four vacationing lesbians, who eventually reveal themselves as more villainous than the assorted deranged males who follow them to a secluded cabin, where at midnight they transform into some sort of cannibal witches. (That this is someone's idea of female empowerment is by far the most frightening thing about the film, besides, perhaps, the universally atrocious acting.) 
 Anyone thinking that this premise will offer a healthy dose of camp will be sorely disappointed; intelligence would be required for that. Seemingly made by randy Rob Zombie fanboys, this super-low-budget shocker by Zach Passero contains passable effects (with a standout brain-sucking sequence), awkwardly employed slow-motion and female nudity galore. It plays like an extended music video for Cinemax After Dark that is too long by 90 minutes. Not even appearances by horror royalty -- Angela Bettis (''May,'' ''Toolbox Murders'') and Tim Thomerson (''Dollman'') -- can salvage this one. LAURA KERN

HEADLINE: Giants Will Charge Fans for Personal Seat Licenses at New Stadium

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
Less than five months after winning the Super Bowl, the Giants said Thursday that they would charge their fans one-time fees, called personal seat licenses, for every seat in the stadium that they were building with the Jets.
 John Mara, the president and co-owner of the Giants, said fans would have to pay $1,000 to $20,000 each for the licenses -- the rights to purchase season tickets at the stadium, which was scheduled to open in 2010. 
 The Jets have not decided on their seat license plan.
 The licenses have been marketed since the mid-1990s as a way to let fans feel a sense of ownership in their N.F.L. teams, and as investments that can be sold for a potential profit on the secondary market. Seat licenses have never been used in the New York market and could represent an onerous expense for fans who have been paying increasingly higher ticket prices. Now they are faced with deciding whether they want to pay the extra cost of the licenses in a difficult economy or lose their seats.
 ''I'd have no problem with $5,000, but $20,000 would be steep,'' said John Moss, of Roseland, N.J., who has four tickets in the first row of an end zone at Giants Stadium. ''I'm guessing mine would be $5,000.''
 Mara said the team was still working out the prices for licenses between $1,000 and $20,000. But he said only 5,000 licenses would sell for $20,000 -- half of them club seats -- and that 90 percent of the licenses in the upper bowl of the $1.6 billion stadium would sell for $1,000 each.
 ''We wanted to have a plan that we thought was reasonable and fair and gave us the opportunity to keep everybody from Giants Stadium in the new building and meet our payment requirements,'' Mara said during a conference call. ''We didn't go into this to maximize the proceeds.''
 The team hopes to bring in between $300 million and $400 million from the licenses. ''Roughly half goes to taxes,'' Mara said.
 Kyle Burks, the president of seasonticketrights.com, a secondary market site that brokers seat licenses, said the Giants were smart to set their prices below market value. ''On average, they're $2,000 to $3,000 less than they could have been, and a lot less in certain areas,'' he said.
 Mara said that ''it would have been impossible'' to finance the Giants' half of the stadium without selling seat licenses. Not only are the Giants and the Jets splitting the cost of the most expensive stadium in the N.F.L., but the league is requiring that they repay their debt faster than even their banks required. Each team received $150 million from the league's stadium-financing program to defray construction costs.
 After proceeds from the seat licenses and the N.F.L. loan, Mara said that about $500 million would remain to be financed from other sources such as revenues from tickets, concessions, sponsorships, naming rights, luxury suites and club seats.
 The Jets are at least a few weeks from announcing their plan. Unlike the Giants, the Jets have surveyed season-ticket holders, fans and others on their waiting list about proposed license prices ($500 to $150,000 each), sample payment terms and possible benefits (like membership in a Jets golf club).
 Barry Javeline, a Jets fan with a season ticket in the upper deck, said he would not pay $1,000 for a license unless he was assured that his ticket price, once $25 and now $80, would not rise in the new stadium. ''If you're in the football business, you should fund the stadium,'' he said. ''It's not my responsibility. Now I have to pay for the right to keep a seat I already pay for?''
 The Giants and the Jets, if they advance a plan, would be far from the first teams to use seat licenses to fund their stadium construction. They have been preceded since 1993 by a dozen N.F.L. teams, which together have raised nearly $900 million by selling licenses.
 The price has ranged from a few hundred dollars to $10,000 each at the renovated Soldier Field in Chicago. That was topped last year when the Dallas Cowboys started charging up to $150,000 each for the right to lease elite club seats at their new stadium in Arlington, Tex., which is scheduled to open in 2009. 
 The Cowboys subsequently exempted about 20 percent of the seating bowl from seat licenses and priced the remaining ones at $2,000 to $5,000. No Giants season-ticket holder will be able to escape the purchase of a license.
 Bobby Stiso, a Giants fan from Airmont, N.Y., said he was glad to learn that his two upper deck seat licenses would likely cost him $1,000 each. ''It's a doable number,'' he said. ''But zero would have been better.''
 Stiso and all other Giants' season-ticket holders will soon receive brochures with four seating options and the prices of their licenses and tickets.

HEADLINE: Suit Claims UBS Misled Investors

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
The top securities regulator in Massachusetts has sued UBS on the grounds of fraud, saying that the firm misled clients when it sold them auction-rate securities and that it pushed the increasingly risky instruments on individual investors to reduce its own potential losses.
 The roughly $300 billion market for auction-rate securities ground to a halt last February when buyers all but vanished. Existing holders were locked into shares and notes issued by municipalities, tax-exempt institutions, student loan companies and closed-end funds. Many of these investors say they were told that the securities were as safe and liquid as cash and had no idea that their holdings could be tied up indefinitely. 
 In the complaint, William F. Galvin, secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, cited numerous and sometimes urgent e-mail messages indicating that as early as last August UBS executives knew the market was imperiled. As sellers began to outnumber buyers, the messages show, UBS executives urged the sales force to promote the notes and shares as aggressively and widely as possible.
 ''The thing that is most amazing to me is what a comprehensive and deliberate strategy this was by UBS,'' Mr. Galvin said. ''They wanted to reduce their inventory, so they decided to gear up their sales campaign using cashlike arguments deliberately.'' 
 Mr. Galvin wants UBS to buy investors out at the prices they paid for the securities and to make up any losses for clients who have sold their stakes. 
 A UBS spokeswoman expressed disappointment that the lawsuit had been filed Thursday and said the firm was working on solutions to the frozen market for auction-rate securities. ''We will defend the specific allegations of the complaint,'' the firm said in a statement. ''Contrary to the allegations, UBS is committed to serving the best interests of our clients.''
 Many Wall Street firms sold auction-rate securities to clients and acted as underwriter to issuers that needed capital. Recently, some of the issuers, including Eaton Vance and John Hancock, have bought investors out of their frozen holdings. But the only relief offered by Wall Street firms like UBS has been to allow their clients to borrow against the value of their holdings. 
 Auction-rate securities are debt obligations whose interest rates are set at auctions every 7 to 35 days. The bonds typically have maturities of 30 years, but the preferred shares have no maturity dates. 
 A true auction, however, involves a meeting of buyers and sellers to determine the price and yield of the securities. But Wall Street firms in charge of the auctions had stepped in with their own capital in recent years; it was easier than locating thousands of buyers to meet up with sellers every week or so.
 As the credit crisis deepened last year, the firms no longer had as much capital to devote to keeping the auctions going. Investors were stuck.
 According to a Dec. 15 e-mail message attached to the complaint, UBS underwrote $43 billion of the securities, or about 14 percent of the total market. That message also estimated that the wealth management unit of UBS, which includes individual investors, held $33 billion of auction-rate securities. 
 The Massachusetts complaint identified David Shulman, UBS's global head of fixed income distribution, as a major participant in the firm's effort last fall to unload its inventory of auction-rate securities. But in August, even as he was urging employees to drum up clients to buy the securities, Mr. Shulman began selling his personal stake in the instruments, the complaint said. By Dec. 12, Mr. Shulman had sold his entire position in the securities. 
 In testimony before Massachusetts investigators, Mr. Shulman said that his ''risk tolerance'' drove him to sell. He said he replaced the securities with issues that were more liquid and that seemed to offer ''more protection,'' according to the complaint. 
 UBS said Mr. Shulman would not be available for comment.
 The internal UBS documents released by Mr. Galvin show that the stress in the market for auction-rate securities began last August and continued through the fall as the firm's institutional customers moved to sell their holdings. This required UBS to find buyers for the securities or to take them onto its books. 
 ''It is critical that we reach out on a wholesale basis away from our traditional buying base to recognize this value and similarly understand the credit dynamics,'' a Sept. 12 e-mail message stated. ''I want to broaden our distribution base and need us to better market this product and educate our groups.'' 
 The firm's individual investor clients were a target, the complaint contends. An August e-mail message said: ''We have encouraged'' wealth management partners ''to mobilize the troops internally to focus on value so that we can move more product through the system.''
 But as the year was ending, the problem was unresolved. Asking for a sales force call on the matter on Dec. 11, Mr. Shulman wrote: ''We need to move this paper and have to explore all angles possible. ... we need to do this as quickly as possible. ... please work on this priority.'' 
 So far, almost 100 investor arbitration cases have been filed against UBS and other firms that sold these securities. Stuart D. Meissner, a New York lawyer, represents a handful of investors who have brought such cases. He said the messages attached to the Massachusetts complaint should help investors who have sued UBS. ''What they released today opens up the window toward punitive damages in any arbitrations filed against UBS,'' he said. ''There are smoking guns in this report that UBS will have a difficult time circumventing.''

HEADLINE: Fuels on the Hill

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Congress has always had a soft spot for ''experts'' who tell members what they want to hear, whether it's supply-side economists declaring that tax cuts increase revenue or climate-change skeptics insisting that global warming is a myth. 
 Right now, the welcome mat is out for analysts who claim that out-of-control speculators are responsible for $4-a-gallon gas. 
 Back in May, Michael Masters, a hedge fund manager, made a big splash when he told a Senate committee that speculation is the main cause of rising prices for oil and other raw materials. He presented charts showing the growth of the oil futures market, in which investors buy and sell promises to deliver oil at a later date, and claimed that ''the increase in demand from index speculators'' -- his term for institutional investors who buy commodity futures -- ''is almost equal to the increase in demand from China.''
 Many economists scoffed: Mr. Masters was making the bizarre claim that betting on a higher price of oil -- for that is what it means to buy a futures contract -- is equivalent to actually burning the stuff. 
 But members of Congress liked what they heard, and since that testimony much of Capitol Hill has jumped on the blame-the-speculators bandwagon.
 Somewhat surprisingly, Republicans have been at least as willing as Democrats to denounce evil speculators. But it turns out that conservative faith in free markets somehow evaporates when it comes to oil. For example, National Review has been publishing articles blaming speculators for high oil prices for years, ever since the price passed $50 a barrel.
 And it was John McCain, not Barack Obama, who recently said this: ''While a few reckless speculators are counting their paper profits, most Americans are coming up on the short end -- using more and more of their hard-earned paychecks to buy gas.''
 Why are politicians so eager to pin the blame for oil prices on speculators? Because it lets them believe that we don't have to adapt to a world of expensive gas.
 Indeed, this past Monday Mr. Masters assured a House subcommittee that a return to the days of cheap oil is more or less there for the asking. If Congress passed legislation restricting speculation, he said, gasoline prices would fall almost 50 percent in a matter of weeks. 
 O.K., let's talk about the reality.
 Is speculation playing a role in high oil prices? It's not out of the question. Economists were right to scoff at Mr. Masters -- buying a futures contract doesn't directly reduce the supply of oil to consumers -- but under some circumstances, speculation in the oil futures market can indirectly raise prices, encouraging producers and other players to hoard oil rather than making it available for use.
 Whether that's happening now is a subject of highly technical dispute. (Readers who want to wonk themselves out can go to my blog, krugman.blogs.nytimes.com, and follow the links.) Suffice it to say that some economists, myself included, make much of the fact that the usual telltale signs of a speculative price boom are missing. But other economists argue, in effect, that absence of evidence isn't solid evidence of absence. 
 What about those who argue that speculative excess is the only way to explain the speed with which oil prices have risen? Well, I have two words for them: iron ore. 
 You see, iron ore isn't traded on a global exchange; its price is set in direct deals between producers and consumers. So there's no easy way to speculate on ore prices. Yet the price of iron ore, like that of oil, has surged over the past year. In particular, the price Chinese steel makers pay to Australian mines has just jumped 96 percent. This suggests that growing demand from emerging economies, not speculation, is the real story behind rising prices of raw materials, oil included.
 In any case, one thing is clear: the hyperventilation over oil-market speculation is distracting us from the real issues.
 Regulating futures markets more tightly isn't a bad idea, but it won't bring back the days of cheap oil. Nothing will. Oil prices will fluctuate in the coming years -- I wouldn't be surprised if they slip for a while as consumers drive less, switch to more fuel-efficient cars, and so on -- but the long-term trend is surely up.
 Most of the adjustment to higher oil prices will take place through private initiative, but the government can help the private sector in a variety of ways, such as helping develop alternative-energy technologies and new methods of conservation and expanding the availability of public transit.
 But we won't have even the beginnings of a rational energy policy if we listen to people who assure us that we can just wish high oil prices away.

HEADLINE: All About Families, Generation After Generation

BYLINE: By ROBERT STRAUSS

 BODY:
IT was clear from the day he got his driver's license where Louis Cerone was going to hang out at the Jersey Shore.
 ''My sister is six years older than me, and she and her girlfriends had found Sea Isle,'' said Mr. Cerone, who grew up in the Italian heart of South Philadelphia. ''She beat it into me: 'Sea Isle. Sea Isle. Sea Isle.' So that's where I came.''
 Some two decades later, Mr. Cerone and his sister, Vicki Angelos, are still in Sea Isle City. They own side-by-side businesses now -- Uncle Oogie's Pizzeria and Sweet Pete's, an ice-cream parlor, near 61st Street and Landis Avenue on this skinny barrier island 20 miles south of Atlantic City.
 Their businesses are typical of Sea Isle's family nature, said Mr. Cerone, in his 13th year as Uncle Oogie -- the name coming from a nephew's mispronunciation of ''Uncle Louie.'' 
 ''The baby boomers are retiring and bringing their grandkids down extra weekends,'' he said. ''Sea Isle is perfect for that. Everyone is friendly here. I think people get an artificial Xanax when they take the bridge over from the mainland and just chill out here.''
 A bit less expensive and a bit more congested than its barrier-island neighbors to the north (Ocean City) and south (Avalon and Stone Harbor), Sea Isle City was founded in 1882 by Charles Landis, who envisioned his beach city as an American Venice of canals and fountains. He eventually downscaled his dream, and by the mid-20th century Sea Isle City had become the getaway of choice for Philadelphia row-house owners who had a few extra dollars.
 ''There has always been an Italian-American club in Sea Isle, and a V.F.W. and Irish bars that welcome everybody,'' said Nick Bozine, who lives in Sewell, N.J., about 50 miles west. He has owned homes in Sea Isle City for 25 years and been visiting since his teens. 
 ''Years ago, teenagers would call it Senile City because it was just slower than Ocean City or Wildwood, where there were boardwalks and rides and all that stuff,'' Mr. Bozine said. ''But Sea Isle has always been for families.''
 Like John Delfini, his wife, Tanya, and their three daughters. They rented a house for five years in Sea Isle, where both older Delfinis had gone when they were younger. In 2006, though, the house's owner said he was building a new property there and would no longer rent it.
 ''We figured it was time to buy, even if we had to rent it out part of the time,'' said Mr. Delfini, who owns a construction business in Ottsville, Pa. They bought a four-bedroom home, five houses in from the beach, for $850,000. 
 The house is rented for half the summer this year, Mr. Delfini said. ''Despite what you hear about the economy, rental has been easy,'' he said. ''We take vacations in the winter, too, but like us, people from Philadelphia just love the Jersey Shore.''
 The Scene
 Instead of a boardwalk, Sea Isle has a promenade, which extends for about two miles along the beach. A small amusement park, Fun City, was replaced by condominiums in 2001, but there are still arcades and bars that have outdoor seating. 
 ''I did all the bar scene when I became legal,'' said Steve Trevelise, a comedian and Philadelphia radio reporter and producer. ''Now I have twin 1-year-olds and I do the family stuff: the promenade, the beach, just hanging out. 
 Mr. Trevelise and his wife, Deneen, opened a coffeehouse/Internet cafe, Coffee dot Comedy, near the center of town five years ago and expanded it into a comedy club, mostly to accommodate his stand-up buddies who wanted a place to crash and entertain in summer. 
 With the arrival of their twins, though, the Trevelises decided to sell, and found a ready buyer in one of their charter employees, Megan O'Neill, who grew up a few miles away in South Seaville. 
 Ms. O'Neill said she never shied away from Sea Isle's bar scene, but she likes the idea of providing an alternative. ''The reputation that this is a party town is a bit overblown,'' she said, noting that the town's bars and clubs are within about a five-block area on a five-mile-long island. ''Most of it is families, and middle-class families at that.''
 Benjamin Balsama, who lives in Williamstown, N.J., and has deep roots in Sea Isle City, bought a 2,200-square-foot town house earlier this year for $725,000
 ''Sea Isle still has some of the old shops that I remember from when I first came down here in the 1970s to stay with my uncle,'' he said, referring to places like the Lobster Loft restaurant. ''My wife and our three kids go biking on the promenade or go to some little festival in the middle of town or have a pizza. The kids don't scream at me that they want to go to the boardwalk, like they might in Ocean City. We just go to the beach and throw a football.''
 Pros
 Homes are about 25 percent cheaper than in Sea Isle's northern neighbor, Ocean City, and 40 to 50 percent less than in Avalon and Stone Harbor to the south. The beach is wide and flat, with plenty of room, even on crowded days. 
 Cons
 Congestion. The primary housing style is side-by-side duplexes, which, especially with driveways added, make for almost no room between properties. Two-lane Landis Avenue is the only major north-south street, and it can be backed up at any time of day on summer weekends. 
 The Real Estate Market
 Over the last decade, the Sea Isle City market has had three phases, said Drew Fasy, a broker at NJ Realty on the island. ''Prices started going up in the late 1990s, but until 2001, it was mostly people buying second homes to use them,'' he said. Then, as the bubble developed, from 2001 to 2004, more buyers were investors, often looking to flip properties. 
 ''Things stopped for a couple of years,'' he added, ''and now the market is finding its legs again, with real second-home buyers coming back.''
 Mr. Fasy said current prices, down about 10 percent from the peak, range from about $1.7 million, for a recently sold 2,000-square-foot house on the beach, to $350,000 for a two-bedroom condo. The middle of the market features four-bedroom halves of side-by-side duplexes at $600,000 to $800,000.
 Brian Adamson is both second-homer and investor. Mr. Adamson, a financial manager for a Philadelphia law firm, saw the lull in the market as the time to buy. He bought an old house, tore it down, then built a side-by-side duplex. Each side is 1,900 square feet, with four bedrooms and ocean-view decks.
 ''It seemed like the way I could make the most for my investment,'' Mr. Adamson said. He spent $715,000 for the original property, and estimated that demolition and building costs totaled $500,000. He said that he got $35,000 in rent from one side and that he and his family use the other from May to October.
 LAY OF THE LAND
 POPULATION 2,949, according to a 2006 Census Bureau estimate.
 SIZE 2.3 square miles.
 WHERE Sea Isle City sits off New Jersey's coast, 20 miles south of Atlantic City.
 WHO'S BUYING Mainly people from Philadelphia and its suburbs.

HEADLINE: Foreign Investment in City Is Growing, Report Finds

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
More than one-tenth of all the goods and services produced in New York City and 1 of every 20 jobs are supplied by companies controlled by foreign investors, according to a report scheduled to be released on Friday by the Partnership for New York City.
 Those contributions have been growing in the past several years as companies from emerging markets like China and India have expanded and as the American dollar has weakened, the report's authors found. 
 Proponents of free trade, like the large corporations that the partnership represents, say that foreign investment is good for the city because it creates high-paying jobs and attracts skilled workers. But they also say that those gains could be threatened by a rising tide of protectionist sentiment that has led to tighter immigration policies in Washington and opposition to some takeover attempts by foreign companies. 
 ''Everybody complains about offshoring and outsourcing and the negative side of globalization of the economy,'' said Kathryn S. Wylde, the partnership's president. ''We're trying to quantify the benefits of globalization. New York is a great example of how our economy can flourish if we welcome and use foreign investment.''
 Opponents like the United States Business and Industry Council counter that acceptance of foreign investment is short-sighted and will ultimately lead to the loss of American jobs as companies shift operations out of the country.
 Ms. Wylde said she believed the report, prepared by a consultant hired by the partnership, was the first attempt to measure the economic impact of direct investment in the city by foreigners. It counted only controlling investments in job-generating enterprises, excluding minority stakes in companies and passive investments in real estate.
 The report estimated that businesses in the city that were controlled from abroad accounted for about $58 billion of the city's total economic output of $570 billion in 2006. Those enterprises employed nearly 200,000 workers, or more than 5 percent of the city's total employment, the report said.
 Ms. Wylde cited as an example the purchase last year of Key-Span Energy, the Brooklyn-based utility, by National Grid, a British company that now owns power companies across the Northeast. Another is the Plaza Hotel, which is owned by companies from Israel and Saudi Arabia and managed by a Canadian company.
 The flow of foreign money into the city has risen by almost 50 percent since 2002 up to 2006, according to the report. It estimated that direct investment in the city by foreign companies had climbed at a rate of more than 10 percent annually from $39 billion in 2002. In that time, the foreign-financed share of the gross city product rose to 10.2 percent from 9.2 percent, the report said.
 At that level, the role of foreign-owned companies would be significantly bigger in New York City than in the rest of the country, said Matthew J. Slaughter, an associate dean of the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth. Mr. Slaughter said foreign investment accounted for about 5.5 percent of the nation's gross domestic product.
 Mr. Slaughter said he would expect New York to attract a lot of foreign companies that wanted to be close to Wall Street or to compete in other professional services that are concentrated in the city. Its international reputation as a center of American business gives it more to gain from globalization, but potentially more to lose if the United States tries to stem the flow of foreign capital. 
 Supporters of free trade have been troubled by a growing backlash against cross-border trade agreements and acquisitive foreign companies. In Washington, some members of Congress have opposed a proposed buyout of Anheuser-Busch, the brewer based in St. Louis, by a Belgian company.
 There was also some opposition to the recent shoring up of Citigroup and other big New York-based banks by state-owned investment funds from Asia and the Middle East, infusions that the city says totaled about $40 billion. 
 ''I just don't get that,'' said Robert C. Lieber, the deputy mayor for economic development, referring to the opposition to foreign investments in New York banks. ''The money that's coming in is coming in big bags and is taking very passive positions. We should be much more welcoming of this kind of an investment and not fearful of it.''
 The Bloomberg administration has supported foreign investment in the city and the country, both through the creation of American subsidiaries and the injections of capital into domestic companies.
 Mitchell L. Moss, a professor of urban policy and planning at New York University, said the city ''depends on the free flow of people, ideas, goods and money.'' Referring to Barack Obama's statements that he might support opting out of the North American Free Trade Agreement under certain circumstances, Mr. Moss added, ''Any effort to impose protectionism hurts us.''
 Mr. Slaughter said that federal data showed that on average, foreign-owned companies paid wages about one-third higher than their American-owned competitors. He said foreign-owned companies provided more than five million jobs in the country.

HEADLINE: Retirees Find the Time May Be Right to Buy

BYLINE: By SUSAN STELLIN

 BODY:
THE euphoria is past. The era of rampant house flipping is gone. What was once a seemingly unstoppable climb in home prices has given way to a plunge in value in many areas.
 Yet, there is a bit of good news: This might be the right time to find a bargain, especially for buyers approaching their retirement years who can afford to take their time. 
 Not only are home prices down more than 25 percent in some parts of the country, there remains a glut of inventory on the market in traditional retirement destinations like Florida, Arizona and Nevada.
 Of course, anyone looking to buy can also find good reasons to take a wait-and-see attitude, like the fact that good deals may not exist in every location, and no one really knows if prices will continue to decline. 
 ''It's like missing the top of the market -- it's the same thing with the bottom,'' said Maurice Veissi, president of Veissi and Associates in Miami. ''Generally you know it's happened because you're looking in the rearview mirror and it's passed you by.''
 According to the latest Standard & Poor's Case-Shiller Home Price Indices, the average price for a single-family home is down nearly 27 percent in Miami compared with a year ago, versus a 25 percent decline in Phoenix and a 27 percent drop in Las Vegas. 
 All three markets were at the forefront of the recent run-up in home prices and are now leading the decline -- a pattern reflected to varying degrees in other markets in all three states. But that means there are deals to be found in places where buyers previously felt priced out of the Sunbelt lifestyle.
 One beneficiary of the bust is Franke Watson II, a 69-year-old retiree from New Orleans who purchased a home in Prescott, Ariz., in February for more than $100,000 below its initial list price. 
 ''The house had originally been listed for $430,000,'' he said in a phone interview after a morning hike. ''When I looked at it, it was $349,000. I offered them $300,000 and we finally settled at $309,000.''
 Mr. Watson first discovered Prescott, a city of around 40,000 people 100 miles north of Phoenix, on a road trip to California. After scouting out options near San Diego and Long Beach, he returned to Prescott, preferring its climate, proximity to hiking and small-town feel. (The city's motto is ''Everybody's Hometown.'')
 But when he relocated to Prescott last July he decided to rent at first rather than buy. ''I didn't think the real estate market was where I wanted it to be,'' he explained. He finally purchased a three-bedroom brick ranch once prices came down to what he expected to pay.
 That is the same approach Mercedes Gutierrez and her husband, Alex, are taking in looking for a second home where they will eventually retire. They currently live with their 9-year-old daughter in Cooper City, Fla., but would like to buy a home in the Keys to use as a weekend getaway until Mr. Gutierrez, a police officer, retires in a few years.
 But so far, prices haven't fallen into the $500,000 to $520,000 range they hope to pay for a three-bedroom home on the ocean side of the Keys -- ideally on a canal, since Mr. Gutierrez plans to spend some of his free time fishing.
 ''We've found a few things, but at the same time we're not in a hurry because we have time on our side,'' Ms. Gutierrez said. ''We're playing the waiting game to see how much people will drop their prices.''
 Although she said brokers haven't balked at the couple's expectations, most of the properties that fit their criteria are currently listed in the $650,000 to $700,000 range, which means they may have to compromise if prices don't decline. 
 ''At some point, we're going to have to sit down and say what's more important and what can we live without,'' Ms. Gutierrez said. ''Because if the prices are still high, we're going to have to give in on something.''
 Wayne Archer, executive director of the Bergstrom Center for Real Estate Studies at the University of Florida, said many buyers were still waiting on the sidelines to see where prices settle, but he emphasized that the state's housing market was more complex than general statistics -- and some news reports -- might suggest.
 ''Florida is not over, as far as we can tell,'' Mr. Archer said. While acknowledging challenges like the oversupply of condos in Miami and the decline in people moving to the state, he pointed to the wide variation in the housing markets in different areas.
 According to data from the Florida Association of Realtors, although the median sales price for an existing single-family home declined 28 percent in the Fort Pierce-Port St. Lucie area in the first quarter compared with last year, prices declined only 1 percent on Marco Island during the same time period. Statewide, prices dropped an average of 15 percent. 
 Aside from the ups and downs of the real estate market, what may end up becoming more of a factor in Florida and other retirement destinations is broader demographic trends, particularly as baby boomers approach retirement age -- or delay those plans.
 An April survey by AARP looking at how people 45 and older are managing the economic slump found that 19 percent of respondents aged 55 to 64 were postponing their retirement, which underlines a long-term trend of people planning to stay in the workforce longer, at least part-time. 
 When they do finally retire, 9 out of 10 people stay either in the same home or the same county -- a pattern that is expected to continue, if not increase, with the baby boomer generation. 
 ''People are looking to stay where they are -- they're closer to family, they're closer to friends, they're closer to the life that they built,'' said Jim Dau, an AARP spokesman. 
 But turmoil in the housing market has certainly played a role in some people's decision to stay put. William H. Frey, a demographer with the Brookings Institution who studies migration patterns, said the most recent census data showed a slowdown in the number of people flocking to Florida, Arizona and Nevada, all previously hot destinations.
 For instance, Florida gained 35,000 residents in the last year measured, through July 2007, versus an average of 230,000 per year for the previous three years. Mr. Frey attributed that change partly to the tightening credit market and the difficulty of selling a current home in order to relocate somewhere else.
 He expects that baby boomers will further affect migration patterns as they head into their retirement years and settle in a wider range of places than previous generations of retirees.
 ''It will be a much more varied group of destinations -- they're going to sprinkle out all over the place,'' Mr. Frey said. ''Some will go to the city, others will go to high-amenity places in the West and Southeast, others will be going to the classic retirement communities in Florida and Arizona. So it's hard to pigeonhole this generation.'' 
 Although not a boomer at age 73, Hank Wintczak fits the profile of a retiree who has no intention of moving far from home. He and his companion, Kelly Guyett, live in Elgin, Ill., west of Chicago and recently purchased a two-bedroom home for $330,000 in the nearby Sun City Huntley development. It is one of 60 Del Webb active adult communities open for new home sales in 20 states, an expansion that reflects the diversity of destinations appealing to buyers, who must be 55 or older.
 Mr. Wintczak said he and Ms. Guyett both have children, grandchildren and lots of friends in the area, so never considered relocating far away, but were attracted by Sun City Huntley's activities and amenities, which include a fitness center, swimming pool,softball field, tennis courts, a restaurant and many classes and clubs. 
 ''We've just heard from a lot of people that they love it there,'' he said, mentioning the daily poker games friends reported as a particular draw.
 That hobby may explain why Mr. Wintczak was willing to take a gamble and go ahead with the purchase, even though he still has to sell his own home, which is listed for $269,000.
 ''I know I'm taking a chance, but eventually it's going to sell,'' he said. ''It's time to get on with our lives in a different situation where we can have a lot more fun.''
 For those who are thinking about relocating, Las Vegas may be a good place to take a gamble. Patty Kelley, president of the Greater Las Vegas Association of Realtors, said more than 50 percent of closed sales in May were foreclosures, and prices in some areas are down more than 30 percent compared with a year ago.
 But the median price of a single-family home increased 0.3 percent between April and May, an early if tentative sign that prices may be stabilizing.
 Acknowledging the impossibility of determining a market bottom ''until we look back six months after the statistics have come out,'' Ms. Kelley said she is blunt about that point with prospective buyers.
 ''I say, I don't know when the bottom is going to hit,'' she said. ''But we've got great buys here right now -- you decide.''

HEADLINE: Remembering the Travel Scandal at the Port Authority

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL

 BODY:
So the E-ZPass is even easier than anyone thought -- good for a lifetime and free, as long as you are, or ever were, a board member of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. But if you're shocked -- shocked! -- at that perk, which was scaled back on Wednesday by the embarrassed authority, consider the freebie-travel scandal that shamed the agency's more imperious cousin, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, some 30 years ago.
 What is it, anyway, about public transportation officials and their travel perks?
 In the case of the Port Authority, the abuses by unpaid commissioners and high-earning executives mounted into the millions of dollars and ended badly. In the spiral of ensuing investigations, two officials took their lives. 
 The pattern first emerged in June 1977, when this reporter sought to reach the M.T.A.'s chairman and longtime Port Authority and New York City Transit potentate, Dr. William J. Ronan, who was reportedly about to resign after a long and distinguished public career under the wing of former Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller.
 He had been the first chairman of the M.T.A., which became known, not for nothing, as the Wholly Ronan Empire, and the sobriquet could later be applied to Dr. Ronan's Port Authority, operator of the region's three major airports, six river crossings, PATH trains, bus and marine terminals and, until 9/11, the twin towers of the World Trade Center.
 Dr. Ronan was not available, his office said; he was preparing for a trip. 
 It turned out that he was leaving the next day on a monthlong, round-the-world, first-class air tour -- on official Port Authority business, of course. And Mrs. Ronan was going along, of course. 
 It soon emerged that another Port Authority commissioner, Milton A. Gilbert, and his wife, as well as the agency's director of world trade, Guy F. Tozzoli, were also making the trip. The declared mission: talking to Japanese automakers about situating a plant in the port area. The itinerary also included stops at trade offices in Hong Kong; Singapore; Melbourne and Sydney, Australia; Bangkok; and London, at a cost per ticket of around $4,600 a person.
 The Port Authority spokesman, John Tillman, said that paying for the spouses was a valid public expense because ''the wives are important as hostesses at various social functions.'' But the next day the Ronans' trip was postponed for a few day amid a swirl of questions by Gov. Hugh L. Carey of New York, and the state's comptroller, Arthur Levitt, who said that in his 23 years of public service, ''I don't think a comparable situation has come to my notice.''
 Gov. Brendan T. Byrne of New Jersey, on the other hand, was mum. The previous October, he and a legislative counsel had flown to Tokyo with Mr. Gilbert.
 The Port Authority said such trips had been going on for years -- so frequently, in fact, that Mr. Tillman could not immediately tally them all. Then it turned out there were no trade center offices to visit in Bangkok and London. Instead, Mr. Tillman explained, those were ''rest stops.'' 
 Meanwhile, Mr. Levitt's auditors found that while Port Authority commissioners and their wives often flew first class, at least 11 other executives -- including Mr. Tozzoli's brother, Anthony, the director of marine terminals -- flew economy but were reimbursed at first-class rates. With the difference, they paid for their wives' travel.
 The auditors also found that the Ronans and Gilberts were accompanied on their trip by a high-level Port Authority staff member, Carl Kleeberg, who had drawn a $10,000 cash advance to help his bosses with travel expenses. 
 The investigations soon discovered that the Port Authority had paid for Anthony Tozzoli's golf club rental on Curacao; a baby sitter for Guy Tozzoli's children on Barbados; and even a Tokyo massage parlor's services for Mr. Kleeberg. Not just the toll-paying public paid the way for officials' travels. Trips were also sometimes paid for by foreign hosts like the Princess Towers Hotel in Freeport, the Bahamas; the Melbourne Harbor Trust; and the Israeli government. Sometimes expenses were billed twice to the Port Authority. 
 One Port Authority executive, Thomas F. Donovan, assistant general manager of development and rentals, investigators found, had traveled with his wife to an evidently less-than-urgent business meeting in London. They sailed there on the Queen Elizabeth 2.
 In August, Dr. Ronan appeared before a New York State Assembly committee to defend the connubial travels. He said an official traveling solo was handicapped: ''he has only his own eyes and ears -- his spouse would provide two more and all the additional coverage that implies.''
 Assemblymen were incredulous. One asked, ''Does an unmarried person have a disadvantage?''
 The inquiry by the Assembly committee charged that Dr. Ronan, Governor Byrne and other officials used the Port Authority's three helicopters as a ''private air force'' for family trips to places like East Hampton and were driven around in the agency's cars. Meanwhile, Mr. Tillman, the spokesman, was found to have padded his expense account, falsely claiming to have entertained reporters, and was suspended. (He was later reinstated and demoted after repaying $1,600.)
 The investigation quickly spread to the M.T.A., where the chief spokesman and another executive were suspended for similar ''irregularities,'' and the chief spokesman of New York City Transit said ''it's entirely possible'' some of his expense accounts may also have been doctored.
 The next day, Nov. 5, 1977, that spokesman, Jacques Nevard, 52, who had worked as a reporter and foreign correspondent for The New York Times from 1955 to 1967, jumped to his death from a 13th-floor balcony of transit authority headquarters in Brooklyn. He left a note, officials said, disclaiming wrongdoing but expressing fear that ''the media and today's atmosphere would tarnish'' his career.
 Two months later, on Jan. 16, 1978, the recently retired treasurer of the Port Authority, Alexander Leslie, 59, who had been suspended for expense-account irregularities and reinstated after repaying the agency about $2,000, jumped to his death from the window of his eighth-floor apartment at 203 East 72nd Street in Manhattan.
 The tradition of perks was hard to live down, officials acknowledged about 15 years later when an examination of Port Authority records found executives still spending millions on parties at the since-lost Windows on the World and on a pared-down fleet of automobiles and helicopters.
 One employee was put aboard a $970-an-hour helicopter flight to Manhattan to file his retirement papers. And other workers were similarly accommodated on flights from one Port Authority facility to another. An authority spokesman, Peter Yerkes, was told to explain it this way: ''It can take up to an hour and a half to reach Kennedy Airport at rush hour.''

HEADLINE: Complex Ties Lead African Ally To Avoid Condemning Mugabe

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER and BARRY BEARAK

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG 

 BODY:
President Robert Mugabe's enforcers had already begun to rampage across Zimbabwe, beating his political opponents, when television cameras captured a startling image of Mr. Mugabe holding hands with the smiling South African president, Thabo Mbeki, a professed champion of African democracy.
 It was April 2000. And Mr. Mbeki, leader of the continent's most powerful nation, spoke no evil of Mr. Mugabe's repressive ways. 
 Eight years later, in April 2008, much the same scene repeated itself. For two weeks, Zimbabwean election officials had refused to release the results of an election Mr. Mugabe had lost, and a new wave of violence was beginning. Again, the despot and the democrat genially clasped hands as Mr. Mbeki declared that there was no political crisis in Zimbabwe.
 The complex relationship between these men, stretching back almost 30 years, is crucial to fathoming why Mr. Mbeki, picked last year by regional leaders to officially mediate Zimbabwe's conflict, does not publicly criticize Mr. Mugabe, nor use South Africa's unique economic leverage as the dominant nation in the region to curb his ruthless methods despite years of rigged elections. 
 The world's puzzlement with Mr. Mbeki's approach -- walking softly, carrying no stick -- has turned into deep frustration these past two months as state-sponsored violence in Zimbabwe has become so sweeping that the opposition's candidate, Morgan Tsvangirai, who outpolled Mr. Mugabe in the first round, quit the race five days shy of the presidential runoff on Friday.
 Mr. Mbeki's policy, typically called ''quiet diplomacy,'' is built on the staunch conviction that his special bond with Mr. Mugabe can resolve the crisis in Zimbabwe through patient negotiations, his colleagues and chroniclers say. 
 Mr. Mbeki's biographers, his colleagues, even his brother debate why he has stuck with his approach despite years of bad faith by Mr. Mugabe. Mr. Mbeki's consistency is variously attributed to a hubristic resistance to admitting failure, a worldview deeply suspicious of Western interference in African affairs, a hard-nosed calculation of political interests and a realistic assessment of the limits of South Africa's power when confronted with an unrelenting autocrat.
 For years, South Africa has sought to block international action against Mr. Mugabe's government and, as recently as June 19, refused to join an American effort at the United Nations to condemn the political attacks in Zimbabwe. Only after the clamor against Mr. Mugabe grew even louder did South Africa agree on Monday to support the Security Council's condemnation of the ''campaign of violence'' afflicting the nation. 
 With Zimbabwe's economy in ruins and millions of its people having fled to South Africa and other nations, quiet diplomacy is now widely regarded as a tragic blot on the legacy of the region's leading politician, an ambitious, high-minded man who stepped energetically into Nelson Mandela's shoes in 1999. It also stands in contrast to the much more critical stance of many African leaders past and present, including Mr. Mandela, who this week cited a ''tragic failure of leadership'' in Zimbabwe. 
 Mr. Mbeki and his team are even now scrambling to salvage a negotiated political settlement, and on Wednesday South Africa's deputy foreign minister, Aziz Pahad, told reporters, ''We can only say the mediation has failed if we reach a situation where Zimbabwe totally gets engulfed in a state of civil war.''
 South African officials contend that Mr. Mbeki's mediation led to a relatively fair election in the first round of voting in March, with tallies posted at polling stations, a plurality of votes for Mr. Tsvangirai and a majority in Parliament for the opposition Movement for Democratic Change.
 ''His approach has produced results,'' said Themba Maseko, the spokesman for the South African government. 
 But Mark Gevisser, who wrote a biography of Mr. Mbeki, ''Thabo Mbeki: The Dream Deferred'' (Jonathan Ball Publishers, 2007), offered the prevailing view of the president's Zimbabwe policy: ''It's his great diplomatic failure. And it's all the more significant because of the incredibly high bar he set for African democracy.''
 Mr. Mbeki, now 66, began his career with a strong sense of a destiny. The son of Govan Mbeki, an icon of South Africa's liberation struggle, he was anointed as a leader early and sent abroad to study at the University of Sussex, where he earned a master's degree in economics. His mentor was Oliver Tambo, the exiled leader of the African National Congress, and he was trained to use his mind more than his muscles, a student of global economics rather than armed struggle.
 Mr. Mbeki struck up a friendship with Mr. Mugabe in 1980, soon after the Zimbabwean came to power, Mr. Gevisser said. Over time, he developed a filial relationship to the elder leader. ''Mugabe is the father, but not a beloved father, a troublesome one, the kind the son wishes would just listen to him once in a while,'' Mr. Gevisser said.
 While Mr. Mbeki had no illusions about Mr. Mugabe, Mr. Gevisser and others say, he felt a kinship with the hero of Zimbabwe's liberation struggle against white supremacist rule.
 ''He believes, 'Even if the rest of the world thinks I am an appeaser -- that I'm just as bad as Mugabe -- I have to keep doing what I'm doing because I have this special relationship,' '' the biographer said of Mr. Mbeki. ''He thinks he is the only one who can talk to Mugabe, and the only way to get Mugabe out is quietly and through his acquiescence.'' 
 Mr. Mbeki's younger brother, Moeletsi, 62, who worked for nine years in the 1980s as a journalist in Zimbabwe, says the alliance between the men springs more from a political than a personal affinity: Mr. Mugabe and Mr. Mbeki view the trade union movement as a common threat. 
 Mr. Mugabe's nemesis, Mr. Tsvangirai, is a former trade union leader. And Thabo Mbeki, whose fiscally conservative economic policies alienated the powerful Congress of South African Trade Unions, lost the leadership of the African National Congress last year to Jacob Zuma, who had the unions' backing.
 Thabo Mbeki and Mr. Mugabe are highly educated politicians who feel they were trained to govern, Moeletsi Mbeki contends, arguing that Mr. Mugabe sees Mr. Tsvangirai, who did not attend college, as ''the riffraff.''
 ''It's a class thing,'' he said. ''The same with my brother: master's from Sussex.'' 
 Moeletsi, a frequent critic of his brother, said he believed South Africa's protection of Mr. Mugabe -- the blind eye to rigged elections, the shielding from international censure -- would likely end if Mr. Zuma became president next year, as expected, ''not because of Zuma,'' but because the unions ''will demand it stop.'' 
 It was the dock workers in South Africa who refused to unload a Chinese arms shipment intended for Zimbabwe in April, a shipment the South African government was facilitating.
 But some who have long known Mr. Mbeki find the trade union explanation unconvincing, arguing that his approach to Zimbabwe grows instead from a belief in African solutions to African problems, and to acting only with unanimity among the nations of southern Africa.
 George Bizos, Nelson Mandela's lawyer and one of his oldest friends, visited Mr. Mbeki when Mr. Bizos was defending Mr. Tsvangirai in 2003 and 2004 against treason charges that he said grew out of a frame-up concocted by Mr. Mugabe. At the time, Mr. Mbeki's critics contended he could quickly topple Mr. Mugabe by blocking landlocked Zimbabwe from gaining access South African ports, or by cutting off its electricity, among other steps, but the president found these options unappealing.
 ''He said, 'I can't cut the electricity because the grid goes to other countries,' '' Mr. Bizos said. '' 'I can't shut the frontier gates because we require passage to countries northeast and northwest of us through Zimbabwe.
 '' 'Please tell me what to do.' ''
 While Mr. Bizos said quiet diplomacy had failed, he doubted anything else would have worked. ''You can't put meaningful pressure on a person who's an egomaniac, who doesn't care about his people and only cares about staying in power,'' he said.
 Others who have known Mr. Mbeki over the years worry that Mr. Mugabe ran circles around him and say Mr. Mbeki should have shifted tactics years ago, been more forthright in condemning egregious human rights abuses and sought a broader role for the international community.
 Mr. Gevisser and others who know Mr. Mbeki, with his ideological commitment to African self-determination, say that he digs in when under fire, especially from Western powers like the United States and Britain, which have been pushing South Africa to act more forcefully.
 In April, after Jendayi E. Frazer, the American assistant secretary of state for Africa, visited the region, Mr. Mbeki sent President Bush a letter that a senior American official called rambling and aggressively defensive.
 Ms. Frazer had openly condemned Mr. Mugabe for the delay in releasing the election results and said the evidence pointed to a Tsvangirai victory.
 The American official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the letter was never made public, said Mr. Mbeki strongly objected to Americans coming to southern Africa to talk about Zimbabwe without consulting him, the region's appointed mediator, and attacking an election that he said had by and large respected the rule of law.
 By then, American diplomats in Harare had begun venturing into the Zimbabwean countryside and collecting evidence of the brutal attacks on opposition supporters, and, the official said, ''It seemed very out of touch with reality and with what was unfolding on the ground.''
 This month, these resentments surfaced when Mr. Mbeki addressed South Africa's National Assembly, criticizing those who describe South Africa as a rogue democracy because ''we refuse to serve as their subservient'' stone throwers against Mr. Mugabe.
 Mr. Mbeki has told the government and the opposition that the violence needs to stop, Mr. Maseko said. And the violence has now created a need for yet more quiet diplomacy.

HEADLINE: Worries About Banks Send Shares Tumbling

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM; Vikas Bajaj contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Once more, gloom is descending over Wall Street.
 After rallying for a few hopeful months this spring, the stock market is sinking to its lowest level in years. Cracks are reappearing in the credit markets. The price of oil is rising from one record to another. And the analysts who seemed so confident a few weeks ago are predicting another round of steep losses at big financial companies like Citigroup.
 On Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 358 points, its steepest decline in nearly three weeks. The blue-chip index closed at 11,453.42, its lowest since September 2006. One longtime member of the Dow industrials, the General Motors Corporation, plunged to its lowest since 1974. 
 Downgrades in the financial industry and fear over the deteriorating health of the auto sector were the immediate causes of Thursday's sell-off. But the abrupt reversal in the markets -- only five weeks ago the Dow was flying above 13,000 -- reflects the realization among investors that the troubles plaguing the economy may be worse than initially feared.
 While many regarded the Bear Stearns implosion in March as the moment of maximum pessimism in the financial markets, some analysts say bigger problems now lie ahead for the broader economy.
 The price of oil has skyrocketed, gaining $5 a barrel on Thursday and briefly rising above $140 for the first time. The Federal Reserve, worried inflation will accelerate, strongly suggested this week that its long campaign of cutting interest rates is over. Americans feel worse about their economic prospects than at any time in the last 40 years, as measured by the Conference Board.
 ''Most analysts were looking for the economy and corporate earnings to rebound strongly in the second half of the year,'' said Bruce A. Bittles, who oversees investment strategy at Robert W. Baird & Company. ''That certainly does not appear to be the case.''
 For some companies, the pessimistic turn has been punishing. General Motors fell 11 percent after its stock was downgraded on Thursday on speculation that auto sales would suffer from high oil prices. The closing price of G.M., $11.43, was the company's lowest in 34 years. Chrysler, which is now privately held, was forced to deny rumors that the company was considering filing for bankruptcy. 
 Financial companies tumbled after Goldman Sachs predicted they would face a new batch of credit-related hurdles. Shares of Citigroup, stamped with a sell rating by Goldman, fell 6.3 percent to $17.67 a share, the lowest price since the company was formed in a 1998 merger.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 2.9 percent, to 1,283.15, just above its low for the year. All 10 industry groups in the S.& P. 500 fell at least 1 percent. The Nasdaq composite index, which lost 3.3 percent, took its biggest tumble since January.
 All three major stock indexes are now down more than 12 percent for the year. 
 The pain hit financial firms across the board. Lehman Brothers slipped 8.4 percent, and Bank of America lost 6.8 percent after announcing it would lay off 7,500 workers. Goldman itself received a downgrade from analysts at Wachovia, which said the bank faced a poor outlook over the summer. Goldman shares closed down 4 percent at $176.26.
 A closely watched measure of expected volatility in stocks jumped 13 percent to its highest level since March. The 24-stock KBW Bank Index fell to its lowest level in almost a decade.
 Weaknesses also appeared in the credit market. Spreads on credit default swaps have widened greatly in the last month, as investors feel less confident that Wall Street's top names will honor their debt obligations.
 Some analysts said that the renewed anxieties about investment banks stemmed from a feeling that the Fed had done all it could do to quell the crisis. ''Most of us were rooting for the Fed to save us by lowering interest rates and providing liquidity,'' said Edward Yardeni, the investment strategist. ''They did that, and we still have a significant problem in the credit system.''
 In recent weeks, the prices of some mortgage-backed securities have slid back to their low levels of March as default rates on home loans continue to worsen, said Donald Brownstein, chief executive of Structured Portfolio Management, a hedge fund based in Stamford, Conn.
 ''I don't think that there are many souls out there who think that we are out of the woods in terms of housing prices,'' Mr. Brownstein said. ''And since that is such a big, big part of the picture, it's still not a pretty picture.''
 Crude oil settled at $139.64 a barrel. The euro gained against the dollar.
 Yields fell on the major Treasury notes, a sign that investors are moving to the relative safety of government bonds. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 17/32, to 98 23/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 4.03 percent, from 4.10 percent. Following are the results of Thursday's Treasury auction of five-year notes:

 Re ''Home Not-So-Sweet Home'' (column, June 23):
 A renting retiree who used to be a homeowner, I can appreciate Paul Krugman's point that home ownership is not for everyone. Indeed, rock music is not for everyone (I prefer Mozart), nor is eating meat, using public transportation or having a pet. Everyone's situation is unique, requiring thoughtful decisions based on what we believe is best for us and our families. 
 I would have said it a bit differently: it is not so much home ownership that we need to look at, but rather the crowd mentality that seems to have afflicted us. When a particular way of being is deemed ''better'' by the media, too many of us get sucked into going along rather than expending the effort necessary to think things through. David Zinkin 
 Princeton, N.J., June 23, 2008
 To the Editor:
 As a 59-year-old woman who has owned a home for the last seven years but rented in the San Francisco Bay area for two decades before that, I read Paul Krugman's column with interest. 
 Yes, yes, yes, I completely agree that the stigma should be removed from renting. But for renting to be just as good as ownership in other ways, real conditions in which renters are forced to live would have to improve as well.
 Neighborhoods would have to be safer, and some sort of controls that would protect tenants from arbitrary rent increases and forced evictions for the landlord's convenience and/or profit would have to be in effect. 
 As an owner, I now know what my monthly mortgage payment will be for the next 25 years, and I know that as long as I make that payment, nobody will decide for me when I have to move.

 To the Editor:
 Homeownership is the safety net for the middle class. We no longer have job security. Increasingly, we worry about keeping our health insurance and sending our children to college. 
 Until we as a country can find better ways to assist dislocated workers, ensure access to health care and send our children to college without impoverishing ourselves in the process, people will continue to aspire to own their own homes, even though -- as Paul Krugman points out -- it may not always make sense to do so. Karen FitzGerald
 Silver Spring, Md., June 24, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Paul Krugman vastly overstates the financial risk of becoming a homeowner. 
 The peak of the housing bubble from 2005 through early 2007 was a wildly atypical period for home buyers, many of whom jumped into the market because of rapidly rising home values, low interest rates and lax mortgage underwriting. Whether those buyers end up losing their entire financial stake in those homes that many, especially in the hottest markets, were able to buy with little or no money down depends upon when they sell them.
 Today's downturn will eventually come to an end, and prices will once again begin to rise. 
 It's always a mistake to compare housing with the stock market. First and foremost, the vast majority of Americans buy a home as a place to live even though they can also expect their home equity to grow into their most important financial asset. As a confessed homeowner himself, Mr. Krugman must know the difference.
 Mr. Krugman is right to suggest that renting opens up a healthy range of housing options, and he is to be commended for advocating on behalf of the nation's renters. But even in a difficult housing downturn, Americans do aspire to become homeowners, and now more than ever, they deserve the continuation of policies that enable them to realize that goal. Jerry Howard

 How does one ''own'' a home, or a car, for that matter, if he is still paying for it, and it will be taken away if he stops?

 To the Editor:
 Paul Krugman's observations about our uncritical bias in favor of home ownership and the resulting widespread attitude toward home renters as second-class citizens calls to mind an exchange I had several years ago while ordering a pizza. 
 When I told the delivery dispatcher my address, she asked, ''Is that an apartment or a home?'' 
 I still don't know what the right answer would have been, though the pizza did arrive. James Bloom

HEADLINE: The Sam's Club Agenda

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
Among the many dark tidings for American conservatism, there is one genuine bright spot. Over the past five years, a group of young and unpredictable rightward-leaning writers has emerged on the scene.
 These writers came of age as official conservatism slipped into decrepitude. Most of them were dismayed by what the Republican Party had become under Tom DeLay and seemed put off by the shock-jock rhetorical style of Ann Coulter. As a result, most have the conviction -- which was rare in earlier generations -- that something is fundamentally wrong with the right, and it needs to be fixed.
 Moreover, most of these writers did not rise through the official channels of the conservative or libertarian establishments. By and large, they didn't do the internships or take part in the young leader programs that were designed to replenish ''the movement.'' Instead, they found their voices while blogging. The new technology allowed them to create a new sort of career path and test out opinions without much adult supervision. 
 As a consequence, they are heterodox and hard to label. These writers grew up reading conservative classics -- Burke, Hayek, Smith, C.S. Lewis -- but have now splayed off in all sorts of quirky ideological directions. 
 There are dozens of writers I could put in this group, but I'd certainly mention Yuval Levin, Daniel Larison, Will Wilkinson, Julian Sanchez, James Poulos, Megan McArdle, Matt Continetti and, though he's a tad older, Ramesh Ponnuru. 
 Ross Douthat and my former assistant, Reihan Salam, are two of the most promising. This pair has just come out with a book called ''Grand New Party: How Republicans Can Win the Working Class and Save the American Dream.''
 There have been other outstanding books on how the G.O.P. can rediscover its soul (like ''Comeback'' by David Frum), but if I could put one book on the desk of every Republican officeholder, ''Grand New Party'' would be it. You can discount my praise because of my friendship with the authors, but this is the best single roadmap of where the party should and is likely to head.
 Several years ago, Tim Pawlenty, the Minnesota governor, said the Republicans should be the party of Sam's Club, not the country club. This line is the animating spirit of ''Grand New Party.'' Douthat and Salam argue that the Republicans rode to the majority because of support from the Reagan Democrats, and if the party has a future, it will be because it understands the dreams and tribulations of working-class Americans.
 They open the book with a working-class view of recent American history. Douthat and Salam write admiringly about the New Deal. They mention Roosevelt's economic policies, but they also emphasize the New Deal's intense social conservatism. Self-conscious maternalists like Eleanor Roosevelt and Frances Perkins ensured that New Deal programs were biased in favor of traditional two-parent families. 
 Liberals write about economic inequality and conservatives about social disruption, but Douthat and Salam write about the interplay between values and economics and the way virtue and economic security can reinforce each other.
 In the 1950s, divorce rates were low and jobs were plentiful, but over the next few decades that broke down. The social revolutions of the 1960s and the economic revolution of the information age have emancipated the well-educated but left the Sam's Club voters feeling insecure.
 Gaps are opening between the educated and less educated. Working-class divorce rates remain high, while the mostly upper-middle-class parents of Ivy Leaguers have divorce rates of only 10 percent. Working-class kids are unlikely to complete college, affluent kids usually do.
 Liberals have a way to address these inequalities -- the creation of a Denmark-style welfare state. Conservatives have offered almost nothing. The G.O.P. has lost contact with its own working-class base. This is the intellectual vacuum that ''Grand New Party'' seeks to fill. 
 The heart of the book is the last third, where Douthat and Salam lay out a series of policy ideas to help working-class families cope with economic, health care, neighborhood and family insecurity. 
 ''What all these ideas, from the sober to the speculative, have in common is a vision of working-class independence -- from bosses, from bureaucracy, from entrenched interests of all kinds,'' Douthat and Salam write. This is not compassionate conservatism (which flattered the mind of the compassionate donor), it's hard-work conservatism, which uses government to increase the odds that self-discipline and effort will pay off. 
 I'm not sure how quickly the G.O.P. can swing behind this working-class focus and this vision of government-enhanced social mobility. But the McCain campaign really needs to. So far, McCain's platform is like an omnibus spending bill -- lots of decent ideas thrown together with no larger social vision. 
 It may take a few defeats for the G.O.P. to embrace a Sam's Club agenda, but sooner or later, it will happen. Trust me.

HEADLINE: The Sad, Proud Elegies Start in Bruno's District

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

DATELINE: SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. 

 BODY:
On Tuesday evening, as the State Senate rose in the Capitol in Albany to applaud Joseph L. Bruno, a few middle-aged men gathered at the Park Lane Tobacconist here in downtown Saratoga Springs, smoking cigars the size of bratwursts as the sun sank in the sky.
 ''This area's going to lose an advocate that brought a lot of jobs and money,'' said Michael Karam, who lives nearby. His friend, Bill Kerr, said that with Mr. Bruno, ''You always knew where he stands on an issue.''
 ''Like Spitzer!'' chortled another friend, Jason Hubbard, referring to former Gov. Eliot Spitzer, who is not popular in these parts. 
 The mood soon grew wistful. 
 ''It's like Massachusetts losing Ted Kennedy,'' Mr. Kerr noted. Mr. Bruno was just as likely to show up at an American Legion pancake breakfast as at the cocktail parties held during the racing season here by Marylou Whitney, the famed local philanthropist, he added. 
 ''Nobody called him 'Mr. Bruno,' '' Mr. Kerr added. ''He was 'Joe.' '' 
 There are few places in New York where a state legislator seems quite so outsized as the 43rd Senate District, which runs north along the Hudson from Albany's eastern suburbs through blue-collar Glens Falls, where Mr. Bruno grew up in a cold-water flat. In more than 30 years representing the capital region, the last 14 of them as the Senate majority leader, Mr. Bruno became a presence in virtually all aspects of daily life in his district.
 Families fly to vacations from the Albany International Airport, which was expanded with $50 million in grants that Mr. Bruno helped arrange and which now displays his bust. Those who like the horses lay their wagers at the Saratoga Race Course, to which Mr. Bruno has steered millions in state money over the years. Couples frolic in the Joseph L. Bruno Community Park in Hoosick Falls. A generation of boys and girls have attended their first baseball game at Joseph L. Bruno Stadium in Troy, a facility known locally as the Joe. 
 ''For us, he's everywhere,'' said Tom Roohan, a Saratoga real estate agent and Republican activist. ''There's just nowhere where his influence and his support of our area isn't evident.'' 
 There is hardly a Little League team in the area that has gone without money for uniforms from Mr. Bruno, nor a social service agency, business association, or Elks Club that has not felt his golden touch. His name is on not just parks and stadiums, but a local theater, a public television broadcast center and the lobby of what may be the most opulent Y.M.C.A. in the state, in East Greenbush.
 ''The small projects,'' said Assemblyman Roy McDonald, a Saratoga Springs Republican, ''are just as important as the big ones.'' 
 Even at the age of 79, his fans noted, Mr. Bruno was so often at banquets, parades and community meetings that constituents rarely needed to meet him in his office.
 ''There were so many opportunities when he was out and about, you could have that kind of conversation right there,'' said F. Michael Tucker, president of the Center for Economic Growth, a local development group. For many here, Mr. Bruno was a visible champion of the upstate region, a bulwark against the forever encroaching power of downstate swells.
 ''He said, 'I'm not going to let my people get lost in the shuffle,' '' Mr. McDonald said. 
 Mr. McDonald is one of at least two Republicans and three Democrats -- including the mayor of Saratoga Springs -- who appear interested in succeeding Mr. Bruno, whose decision to retire has caused a scramble among politicians lower on the food chain. Mr. McDonald appears to be Mr. Bruno's preference to succeed him; key local Democratic committees have already endorsed Brian Premo, a local defense lawyer. But it is not lost on any candidate that whoever replaces Mr. Bruno will be among the least senior members of the State Senate.
 ''Whoever takes that job is going to be starting out at Step 1,'' Mr. McDonald said. ''The likelihood of us having the president of the New York State Senate be from the capital region in the next 10 or 20 years is remote.''
 Unlike some lawmakers, Mr. Bruno did not build his reputation around new government programs or landmark legislation, though as majority leader he had a hand in every bill that became law in the last decade and a half. Ask his constituents what political issue Mr. Bruno was most associated with in his career and you may well be met with an awkward pause.
 ''That's a tough one,'' said Harry J. Tutunjian, the mayor of Troy and one of Mr. Bruno's many political proteges. Senator Bruno, Mr. Tutunjian said, will ''always be known for bringing funding home for the capital region.''
 In truth, there are probably few places in the state, or the country for that matter, where people can so easily name their state senator, or are so alert to the relationship between pork and power.
 Richard Freeman, a retired banker who was strolling through downtown Saratoga Springs on Tuesday with his wife, Evelyn, noted that with Mr. Bruno's departure, none of the state's top elected officials would hail from farther north than, say, Chappaqua.
 ''Saratoga Springs is losing a great supporter, financially,'' Mr. Freeman elaborated.
 According to a tally prepared by The Buffalo News earlier this year, Mr. Bruno has helped steer more than $3 billion in state aid to the Albany region during the last dozen years, including hundreds of millions in capital financing and tax incentives for businesses. That money has helped make the area a center for high-technology businesses and one of the few economically thriving regions upstate, to the occasional jealousy of Rochester and Buffalo.
 ''If you look at where the investment went, it was education, it was infrastructure, it was economic incentives,'' Mr. Tucker said. ''It wasn't gratuitous. It was strategic investment of state resources to allow the region to build on that foundation.''
 Even as he was announcing his retirement on Tuesday, Mr. Bruno could not resist letting slip a little more good news: Further progress was being made, the senator told reporters at his farewell news conference, on a deal to bring a $3.2 billion computer chip manufacturing plant to Malta, in Saratoga County.
 Mr. Tutunjian and many others credit Mr. Bruno for rescuing Troy from the brink of insolvency during the mid-1990s, winning financing from a program for distressed cities and directing school aid to the area to enable Troy to keep property taxes low. Nearly every nonprofit organization in the city has received one grant or another from Mr. Bruno over the years, as have at least a dozen or so businesses.
 ''People won't realize how important he was until years from now, when they find that things don't get done as quickly or as easily without him,'' Mr. Tutunjian said.

HEADLINE: An Inexhaustible Energy Source: Heated Words. But Can It Be Tapped?

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Fourth of July fireworks came early on Capitol Hill. 
 With angry constituents waiting for them back home, lawmakers clashed fiercely on Thursday over how to address high gasoline and oil prices. But with all sides recognizing that there is virtually nothing Congress can do to lower fuel prices any time soon, Democrats and Republicans focused as much on finger-pointing as on policy making. 
 In the House, where Democrats held a series of four votes on energy policies before a weeklong Independence Day recess, Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, declared, ''After today's vote, the G.O.P. now officially stands for the Gas and Oil Party.'' 
 In the Senate, where Republicans introduced a bill called the Gas Price Reduction Act of 2008, Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, said: ''Most Democrats still insist on trying to repeal the law of supply and demand. It's a new economic theory. You might call it Obamanomics.'' 
 On both sides of the Capitol, lawmakers were dreading the prospect of a week at home with constituents sure to harangue them about Washington's inability to lower gas prices. And that led to an escalation of the battle over energy policy that has Republicans emphasizing what they say is the need for an expansion in domestic oil drilling and Democrats complaining that oil companies are not using millions of acres of federal lands that have already been approved for energy exploration. 
 In the House, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Representative David R. Obey, Democrat of Wisconsin, angrily adjourned a hearing after he was ambushed by Republicans with an amendment to allow drilling on the outer continental shelf off both coasts. 
 Republicans said they were convinced that Mr. Obey would not hold a hearing on the budget for the Interior Department, which has authority over leases for oil and gas exploration on federal lands. So they threatened to take over a session on the labor, health and education budgets with a raft of amendments, including one by Representative Jerry Lewis, Republican of California, on oil drilling. 
 Mr. Obey was furious and said Republicans were responsible for decades of failed energy policy. ''This is a con job,'' he said. ''It's a diversion. These guys ought to be given a Mandrake the Magician permanent title, for pretending that this has anything to do with solving gas prices today.'' 
 Explaining his decision to call off the hearing, he said: ''We can spend our time on real things or we can spend it in a playpen with Jerry Lewis. The latter does not interest me.'' 
 The Republican leader, Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, accused Mr. Obey and Democrats of cowering from a debate over Republican energy proposals. ''Today's display is yet another example of Democratic leaders ducking a real debate on common sense energy reforms to help increase American-made energy and help lower gas prices,'' he said in a statement. 
 House Democrats had hoped to use the last day before the Fourth of July break to portray themselves as taking action on gasoline prices. But their series of votes had mixed results. 
 A bill that Democrats had hailed as a response to Republican calls for expanding domestic oil and natural gas exploration failed to achieve the two-thirds majority needed for passage on an expedited basis, with 223 voting in favor and 195 voting against. 
 The ''use it or lose it'' bill would have required energy companies to make use of existing leases for exploration on federal land or face a threat of losing the leases or paying fines that would increase over time. 
 Representative Rahm Emanuel, Democrat of Illinois, has likened the bill to the rule he says he has set for his three children at dinner time. ''My middle one loves chocolate,'' he said. ''You don't get your dessert until you finish everything on your plate.'' 
 Republicans, however, derided the legislation as a symbolic and empty gesture because under existing law the leases on federal land expire after 10 years if unused. 
 Representative Rob Bishop, Republican of Utah, suggested that perhaps Americans should be told about other things they must use or lose, including their right to free speech. ''Maybe a brain,'' he added. ''You can use it or become a member of Congress.'' 
 In a rather dramatic show of force, 22 Senate Republicans attended a news conference in a grassy park outside the Senate office buildings to trumpet the Gas Price Reduction Act of 2008. Most of them did not get a chance to speak, underscoring their dedication to the issue, since most senators do not relish playing a backdrop role. 
 The bill calls for vastly expanding off-shore energy exploration, and for lifting a ban on the development of oil shale, a rock found in several Western states that can be converted to liquid oil when exposed to extremely high heat. The bill also calls for federal subsidies of research and development for advanced batteries to encourage the development of electric cars and trucks, and it seeks to tighten oversight of commodity futures trading and markets. 
 None of the proposals were new, but the Republicans said they were reaching out a hand to Democrats by not including a provision to allow oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which the Democrats oppose. 
 ''When we say, 'deep shore exploration,' '' Mr. Alexander said, ''they say 'no we can't.' When we say 'oil shale development,' they say 'no we can't.' When we say 'more nuclear power to plug in electric cars and trucks,' they say 'no we can't.' We want to make it easier for them to say, 'yes we can,' so we can get a result that will lower gas prices. The American people don't want us to be up here talking trash. They would like us to be up here, getting results.''

HEADLINE: Bloomberg And Council Reach Deal On Budget

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN and MICHAEL BARBARO; Fernanda Santos contributed reporting.

 BODY:
With a legal deadline four days away, city officials brokered a deal on Thursday night on a $59.1 billion budget that would preserve a popular tax cut for homeowners and a $400 rebate and add $129 million in education spending to what had originally been proposed.
 Over all, the size of the budget for the fiscal year that begins in July is essentially unchanged from the current one. But during a news conference in the City Hall rotunda, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, said they were not able to provide as much money as they would have liked for some cultural and social programs. And they repeatedly warned that the current economic downturn threatened the following year's budget, thanks to the rising price of oil, a falling stock market and other troubling indicators. 
 ''I don't have to tell anybody here that this is a difficult time and the forecasts are worrisome,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. ''With so much uncertainty in the local and national economy, we need to show fiscal restraint just as families across the city are doing.''
 Ms. Quinn added, ''As much good news as there is in this budget, there is bad news for some people.''
 The deal came as a relief to lawmakers and administration officials, who had worried that the city might not make the legally mandated July 1 deadline. But the relative austerity of the budget deal disappointed many of the housing, legal, health care and other advocates who had become a regular fixture on the steps of City Hall all week. 
 Details are expected to be released in the next day or two, and the City Council is scheduled to vote on the budget on Sunday night.
 During the news conference, Mr. Bloomberg and Ms. Quinn offered a few of the highlights. The New York City Housing Authority would receive $18 million more than Mr. Bloomberg proposed in May. Libraries would continue to be open six days a week and not five as was originally suggested.
 The city's capital budget would be trimmed by 20 percent. All agencies would absorb across-the-board cuts in operating expenses. And financing for City Council-sponsored programs, now at the heart of a federal investigation, was cut by 38 percent. There would also be less money to pay for security guards at cultural institutions, and a chess program for schools was cut.
 The budget also eliminates civilian positions in the Fire Department and eliminates unfilled positions in the Police Department.
 ''Everything was given a little haircut,'' said Councilman David Weprin, the chairman of the Finance Committee.
 Initial reaction was mixed.
 ''I am disappointed that with a $4.5 billion surplus, the mayor forced the Council to cut funding for essential services, including homeless prevention, legal and mental health services, and workforce development,'' said Councilman Bill de Blasio of Brooklyn. ''In addition, the New York City Housing Authority, which is in dire financial straits, will be forced to shut senior centers and youth programs across the city. The mayor should not have put the city in this situation, and these cuts will be deeply felt for years to come.''
 ''This is a bad day for seniors,'' said Bobbie Sackman, the director of public policy for the Council of Senior Centers and Services, who estimated that the budget would reduce spending on travel, housing, food, H.I.V. testing and other services by a total of $19 million.
 Throughout the process, the mayor and the Council seemed to be living in different fiscal universes. While Mr. Bloomberg called for financial austerity in the face of a rapid downturn in the economy, the Council accused him of overstating the city's woes, pointing to a big surplus in the 2008 budget.
 Talks between both sides began to sour two weeks ago, after Mr. Bloomberg announced on his weekly radio show that the city might have to scrap a popular property tax cut for homeowners. 
 The mayor said that the 7 percent tax cut, put in place in 2007, might not be justifiable given job losses on Wall Street and an unexpected $700 million bill for a retroactive raise given to 23,000 police officers in May.
 Almost immediately, the Council united to oppose the measure, turning what had been described as amicable talks into a bitter stalemate.
 At one point this week, the negotiating team for the Council broke off talks to highlight their frustration.
 One councilman, Lewis A. Fidler of Brooklyn, stormed into the press room at City Hall and accused the mayor of playing ''a nasty game of chicken'' with the property tax proposal, which would amount to a tax hike. 
 ''He's looking at his last year as mayor, and he doesn't want to go out with an unmanageable situation,'' Mr. Fidler said.
 On Thursday afternoon, the atmosphere was so tense that when Mayor Bloomberg walked out of City Hall and headed toward his car, he barely acknowledged the calls of children who had convened on the steps with their parents to decry overcrowding in public schools.
 At the news conference, Mr. Bloomberg and Ms. Quinn even forgot to do the traditional handshake and kiss. When a reporter asked what had happened, they returned. Ms. Quinn said ''Take two,'' and the two performed their duty.

HEADLINE: Post-Spitzer, A New Breed Of Refomer

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ; Jenny Anderson contributed reporting.

 BODY:
No one is dusting off those valiant titles once bestowed on Eliot Spitzer, honorifics like ''The Enforcer'' and ''Sheriff of Wall Street.'' But slowly, even a bit gently, Mr. Spitzer's successor as the attorney general of New York, Andrew M. Cuomo, is shaking up the financial industry.
 Since taking the job last year, Mr. Cuomo has extracted settlements from credit ratings firms and student lenders and trained his sights on banks that played a crucial role in the mortgage crisis. Mr. Cuomo said he is more interested in reforming industries and how they do business than in punishing individuals and firms. 
 ''We do cases in a way that exposes the problem, and then we identify the systemic reforms so the problem doesn't happen again,'' he said, contrasting his office's aims to those of United States attorneys. ''Otherwise you play that game Whack-a-Mole.'' 
 Still, Mr. Cuomo has angered people on Wall Street and in Washington. Advocates for investors say he is too quick to accept deals that do not include significant reforms, while federal officials accuse him of encroaching on their turf. 
 Mr. Cuomo appeared to score a big coup earlier this month when his office reached an agreement with the three biggest credit rating firms, which many investors and regulators blame for aiding investment banks by awarding risky mortgage securities high ratings.
 But critics charge that Mr. Cuomo did not go far enough with that deal. Details of the agreement, which has not been made public, suggest it may be less punitive than initially understood. Two people who have seen the agreement say it will expire three years after it is put in force. It also includes provisions that will ease the burden on ratings firms and big investment banks.
 The deal would break into four parts the fees that the ratings firms -- Standard & Poor's, Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Ratings -- charge to rate mortgage-backed securities. Currently, critics say, investment banks shop for a high rating because they pay rating firms only when deals close. As a further check against conflicts of interest, the three companies also agreed to disclose bonds they reviewed even if they did not rate them.
 While the rating firms will levy four different fees on investment banks, they will still be paid only once bonds are sold, according to the people who have seen the settlement but asked not to be named so as to not jeopardize their relationships with Mr. Cuomo. 
 Furthermore, the rating firms can waive the fees and avoid disclosure if investment banks decide to withdraw offerings or change more than 5 percent of the loans backing the security. Mr. Cuomo's office confirmed these details.
 ''The whole thing makes no sense,'' said Joshua Rosner, an independent financial analyst who has criticized the rating firms. ''I find it frankly a little bit worrisome given the fact that we are at the front end of this problem and we are likely to see problems in other structured assets.''
 Mr. Cuomo said the agreement was a significant improvement over the current system. He added that more changes are coming as regulators around the world scrutinize the role of credit ratings.
 ''It was a sweeping reform which greatly improved the situation,'' he said. ''Is it perfect? No. Very few things in life, let alone commerce and law, usually are.''
 Like Mr. Spitzer, Mr. Cuomo has used New York's powerful Martin Act, which gives prosecutors broad powers to pursue fraud. But Mr. Cuomo is using the law differently than his predecessor, who extracted a $1.4 billion settlement from Wall Street banks that he said promoted stocks to keep banking clients happy and deals flowing. (The agreement with the rating firms does not include fines.)
 Rather, Mr. Cuomo has tried, with mixed success, to fight industry practices that his office believes have hurt investors, borrowers and homeowners. For instance, after exposing conflicts of interest in student lending he got lenders and universities to institute a code of conduct. New York has adopted the code as a state law and a related measure is before Congress.
 ''He's stayed away from personal vilification and gone after institutional corruption,'' said Meyer S. Frucher, chairman of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange and a state official who worked for Mr. Cuomo's father, the former governor Mario Cuomo. 
 So far, Mr. Cuomo has avoided the big public brawls that defined the tenure of his crusading predecessor, whose governorship ended with his notorious assignations. (Mr. Cuomo now has to decide how to proceed with cases left over from the Spitzer era, including the pay battle of Richard A. Grasso, the former chief of the New York Stock Exchange who won an appeal on four of six charges this week.)
 ''Spitzer did have a kind of a notion that there were bad people out there that ought to be taken down a peg or two or three or four,'' said Richard Sylla, a financial historian at New York University. ''Cuomo seems to be a little bit cooler.''
 In one respect he has found himself in the same position as Mr. Spitzer: he has angered federal banking regulators. 
 Supervisors of banks and savings and loans are furious about a deal Mr. Cuomo struck this year with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-chartered mortgage giants, which would force banks and other lenders that sell home loans to those companies to divest their home appraisal businesses. Mr. Cuomo's office argued that appraisals were often inflated during the boom, because higher-priced loans could be sold for bigger profits. 
 John C. Dugan, the comptroller of the currency, who regulates national banks, asserts that Mr. Cuomo is practicing ''regulation by settlement.'' Mr. Dugan said appraisal fraud has not been a big problem among banks and that the settlement would hurt them. (Before Mr. Dugan was in office, the comptroller's office sparred with Mr. Spitzer over his investigation of mortgage lenders.) ''For our larger institutions, the quality of appraisal reviews will go down, not up, if they are forced to do this only one way,'' Mr. Dugan said. 
 Mr. Cuomo responds that the changes are necessary because federal regulators did not address problems with appraisal during the boom. He also asserts that the settlement is not regulation, because it is a private agreement between his office and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Banks are free to ignore the appraisal code, as long as they do not sell loans to the two government-sponsored mortgage giants, he adds. 
 John C. Coffee, a law professor at Columbia, said Mr. Spitzer was the first to use the Martin Act to turn the attorney general's office into ''the country's second securities regulator.'' But he added that Mr. Cuomo appears to be more effective. ''He had shoes to fill, and he has filled them fully and without the same adversarial style that made settlements difficult'' for Mr. Spitzer, Mr. Coffee said.
 For his part, Mr. Cuomo said that he has sought to use his office differently than Mr. Spitzer and other predecessors.
 He dismisses talk of higher office and says he enjoys being attorney general. But he also said that he draws more on his skills as a policy maker -- he was the secretary of housing in the Clinton administration -- than as a prosecutor. He said that financial cases, while important, are not his top priority, ranking health care as his No. 1 interest. 
 ''We are a product of our experiences,'' he said. ''Is it better or worse? Who knows. People will make that decision.''

HEADLINE: The Europeans Step Up

 BODY:
It has been nearly two years since the United Nations ordered Iran to stop enriching uranium. Tehran continues to defy that order, and its scientists are getting closer to mastering a process that is the hardest part of building a nuclear weapon. So we welcome the European Union's decision -- after much foot-dragging -- to impose new sanctions on Iran that go beyond what the United Nations Security Council has mandated. 
 That means that 61 Iranians or companies -- all with alleged links to Iran's nuclear or ballistic missile programs -- will now be subject to a European visa ban, a freeze on assets or both. European states must lose no time in rigorously implementing these penalties.
 Coming after Tehran again cold-shouldered a package of economic and diplomatic incentives offered by the major powers, the European Union's decision reinforces the only strategy that might -- might -- have a chance of peacefully persuading Iran to abandon its nuclear ambitions.
 The strategy -- initiated in 2006 by Britain, France, Germany, the United States, Russia and China -- offers Iran a reasonable choice: suspend nuclear fuel production and cooperate with international inspectors in exchange for rewards from the West, or continue down the current road and face harsher penalties and deeper isolation.
 Tehran has until now played a weak hand brilliantly. Even as it defies the United Nations, it has staved off significant international penalties by showing occasional interest in negotiations and deftly leveraging its economic power as an oil-and-gas producer. 
 Europe's patience, we hope, is finally wearing thin and the tightening financial squeeze may yet have an impact. It would be foolish for the Senate to threaten this cooperation by passing a bill, now under consideration, that could force sanctions on European companies doing business with Iran. 
 While we deplore Russia's and China's continued enabling of Iran, a Senate proposal to kill an American-Russia civilian nuclear cooperation agreement would also be hugely counterproductive. Washington must find other levers to persuade Russia and China to impose tougher Security Council sanctions that all United Nations members would have to enforce. 
 The major powers also must improve on the incentives offered to Iran. Specifically, the Bush administration must make a more credible offer of security guarantees and improved relations if Iran abandons its nuclear ambitions. 
 We strongly urge the administration to follow through on a proposal now being floated to open an American-interests section in Tehran. 
 There is no assurance that Iran's leaders would accept the offer, nor do we know if there is any mix of incentives or punishments that would change Tehran's behavior. The Iranian people need to know that the United States is serious about reconciliation -- and who is responsible for their isolation.

HEADLINE: Food-Shopping Tips Direct From the Store Manager

BYLINE: By RON LIEBER. 
Send your shopping tips to rlieber@nytimes.com

 BODY:
At the bottom of some of its receipts, Heinen's Fine Foods prints its phone number and asks customers to call in with comments. And each week, Tom Heinen, who runs the 17-store chain in the Cleveland area with his twin brother, Jeff, listens to a recording of those calls as he drives to work in his Chevy Blazer.
 This week, he let me listen in as we made a lap of the suburbs, visiting his stores and those of the competition. While lots of self-styled shopping experts have been trotting out the same tried-and-true advice recently on clipping coupons and avoiding the store while hungry, I thought we could learn something new about shopping tactics by talking to a grocer who actually sets the prices. 
 It's a tricky time to be selling the high-quality foods Heinen's offers. Egg prices in May were up 18.2 percent from a year ago, while bread rose 15.9 percent and milk was up 10.2 percent, according to Consumer Price Index data. With those kinds of spikes, the big question most consumers are asking is whether it's time to switch grocers. 
 On those phone calls, Heinen's customers are indeed complaining a lot about prices. But so far, most of them seem to have stuck by the chain.
 Their loyalty suggests a couple of things about the kind of middle- and upper-class shoppers Heinen's tends to attract. While they are concerned about price, they're increasingly thinking about their foods' origins and quality. So they would just as soon not trade down from a store like Heinen's that offers handsome local radishes and an excellent stir-fry station. 
 And they almost certainly don't want to drive around to six different stores cherry-picking deals. ''With two adults working and the kids going to soccer, I defy you to show me how they can do it,'' Mr. Heinen said. ''They'll be in the nuthouse.'' 
 But the chain has chosen to do a number of things differently, given that Whole Foods entered the Cleveland market last year and regional chains have been relentlessly papering the area with circulars. (Whole Foods itself has its own initiatives under way, which I'll describe below.) 
 If your grocer isn't trying some of these same experiments, you're probably paying more than you need to. And the questions the Heinen brothers and others have been asking are the same ones you should be asking of your grocers. Here are a few of them:
 HOW MUCH ARE YOU THROWING OUT? According to one Agriculture Department estimate -- though it is more than 10 years old -- Americans waste 27 percent of all food available for human consumption. Tom Heinen is well aware of this, since grocers have to get rid of all sorts of food past its prime. But he thinks that grocery shoppers share some of the blame as well. His solution is to spend more money but waste less food.
 He explained his logic in front of a display of sausage-stuffed Hungarian peppers, assembled in Heinen's kitchen and ready for cooking at home. ''It's not cheaper to make it yourself if you throw parts of the peppers or the sausage away,'' he said. 
 The theory here is that if you buy marinated meat or washed lettuce or other convenience items, you're not creating any waste in the preparation. If you chop and stuff those peppers with sausage yourself, however, you may buy too much of one or the other and neglect to use it or throw out parts of the pepper that don't work in the recipe. You may also buy the ingredients but never get around to making the dish.
 This way of shopping puts money in the grocer's pocket, so take it with a grain of imported sea salt. But if you value your time and find yourself throwing away half-heads of lettuce on a regular basis, these sorts of convenience foods may be more economical than you think.
 WHERE ARE THE ARTISAN-QUALITY DEALS? Heinen's has won ''best cheese selection'' honors from Cleveland Magazine for several years running, a tall order for a nonspecialty shop. To keep that title, with cheese prices up 14 percent in the last year nationally, the store's managers knew they had to make some adjustments.
 ''We went to vendors and said to them, 'Go out and find us artisan equivalent cheese,' '' said Chris Foltz, the company's director of operations. What Heinen's was looking for was the unusual, the delicious and the gently priced. 
 Now, Heinen's is selling an Australian cheddar and Monterey Jack cheese for $5.99 a pound and is promoting those new offerings with signs that say ''Heinen's Great Value Cheeses.'' There's an offering from Wisconsin, too, for shoppers concerned about how far their food has traveled. 
 If this all sounds a bit familiar, it's because Trader Joe's has been using similar strategies for years, helping it to develop a cult following. ''Too many of our customers think they're too cool,'' Tom Heinen said of Trader Joe's. ''We're worried more about them than we are about Whole Foods.''
 Your grocer ought to be eyeing the competition, too. Does it offer fair prices on unique products? Is there a conscious effort to stock interesting and inexpensive wines? Good olive oil for under $10? If not, ask why.
 IS IT LOCAL? One way to keep prices low is to buy local produce, since it travels fewer miles to the store and tends to pass through fewer hands. Heinen's now has a produce buyer whose primary job during the warm months is to shop the local produce auctions. The chain buys from 45 farmers, most of whom are no more than two hours away.
 This last week, for instance, radishes and green onions from K. W. Zellers & Son in Hartville, Ohio, sold for 99 cents for two bunches, and they sit under a ''Home Grown'' sign highlighting their origin. When local bell peppers are in season, they sell for 59 cents a pound, a fraction of the price that peppers from far away fetch in the winter. At Heinen's, local produce is cheaper about three quarters of the time. 
 Local products aren't always less expensive. Heinen's carries a goat cheese, for instance, that costs about $24 a pound. But grocers generally promote such items anyway, since many shoppers like the idea of supporting nearby businesses and buying items that didn't consume too much diesel fuel to get to the store. 
 WHO'S MY TOUR GUIDE? Not every grocery store bothers to highlight local products. So you may need to ask what comes from nearby and who grew or made it. ''One of the things Whole Foods taught us is the need to tell stories'' about our products, Mr. Heinen said. In fact, Heinen's has 50 stories that it trains employees to tell customers about its meat, produce, baked goods and other items. 
 This month, Whole Foods took another step forward on this front, designating one employee from each store as a ''value guru.'' Those employees now give regular tours highlighting sales, local and seasonal items and popular selections from its private label brand. 
 I learned a couple of new things on my tour with Alli Krohn Smith in the company's Union Square store in Manhattan. First, you can order many grocery items by the case and receive a 5 percent discount. In the health and beauty aisle, where many grocers try to rob you blind, Whole Foods has its own brand of shampoo and conditioner. They each sold for $3.79 for 32 ounces in New York, which is a nice deal.
 Though your store may not have a guru per se, there ought to be someone knowledgeable enough to answer the following questions: What's new? What's local? What's exclusive to this store or chain? What's the best deal in the store right now? What did you buy this week for your own pantry?
 WHAT KIND OF GROCER DO YOU PATRONIZE? Running a grocery store is a tough way to make a living. Industry veterans refer to it somewhat derisively as a ''1 percent business,'' because of its rock-bottom profit margins. The stores are labor- and logistics-intensive and riddled with waste and costs of every sort. 
 So this is what you have to ask yourself: If you are patronizing a grocer that doubles your coupons, discounts your gasoline or runs other expensive promotions, how exactly are they staying in business? Are they gouging you on the second most popular brand when the most popular one goes on sale? Do prices bounce around so frequently that it's impossible to keep the baseline in your head?
 Shoppers can play the discount game and win by shopping six different stores, buying only the sale items and products they have coupons for, buying in bulk and then cooking from the pantry and freezer. 
 But if you don't want to live that life, you shouldn't beat yourself up. Demanding more from a single store on price -- and quality --may be a better way to fill your belly.

HEADLINE: A View From the Senate: Ratify the Law of the Sea

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Treaty on Ice,'' by John B. Bellinger (Op-Ed, June 23): 
 The United States should ratify the Law of the Sea Convention as soon as possible. As we seek to strengthen economic and national security interests, it is troubling to think that the Law of the Sea Convention is still being delayed. 
 Before Senate hearings and in the media, respected national security leaders and industry professionals voiced overwhelming support for this convention, reinforcing President Bush's calls for United States approval.
 The Senate should heed this call and act immediately to ratify this convention. Our failure to join the convention puts our nation at a strategic disadvantage, requiring us to rely on other nations to protect our interests. Why compromise our sovereign interests by allowing decisions to be made for us? 
 With energy prices skyrocketing and the global demand expected to increase, the United States must develop new sources of energy. Significant oil and gas deposits within the Outer Continental Shelf offer significant economic benefits for countries that effectively establish claims to these deposits under the Law of the Sea. 
 Unlike most treaties, the Law of the Sea Convention is part of the basis of maritime law regardless of whether America is a party. But our rights accrue only if the Senate ratifies this treaty; all Americans should demand that action now. Ted Stevens

 on Commerce, Science

HEADLINE: Fitch Weighs Lower Rating For Wachovia

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Fitch Ratings may lower the credit ratings of Wachovia, the bank that ousted its chief executive after greater-than-expected mortgage losses. In a report Friday, Fitch said that Wachovia, based in Charlotte, N.C., increased its loan loss reserve by $2 billion as of March 31, which represented ''only about 1.2 percent'' of the bank's $170 billion mortgage portfolio. About 70 percent of Wachovia's mortgages are option adjustable-rate mortgages that let borrowers skip part of their payment and add the sum to their principal. The company declined to comment.

HEADLINE: Sitting on the Porch, Leaving the Car Garaged

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
IF Americans do as they say, this may be a summer of conspicuous nonconsumption.
 The consumer confidence figures released this week showed that pessimism about the economy is at historic highs, and that plans to take vacations or make major purchases are at some of the lowest levels ever recorded.
 That dire outlook has yet to be fully reflected in the economic statistics, however. It may be that some consumers are not really as worried as they say, or perhaps the economic stimulus tax rebates sent out this spring made it easier for consumers to keep buying other things even while they coped with $4-a-gallon gasoline. 
 One question the Conference Board has been asking for decades is whether Americans think their own income will increase or decrease over the next six months. Most expect no change, and that has been true throughout the survey's history. But until now, there have always been more who expected improvement than who thought they would earn less.
 But the Conference Board, in its preliminary report for June, stated that its survey showed 12.3 percent expected their income to rise, while 15.9 percent expected a decline. That is the highest level ever for pessimism, and the lowest for optimism.
 The accompanying chart plots that data with a three-month moving average to smooth out the data, which comes from responses to 5,000 postcards the Conference Board sends out each month.
 A look at the chart shows that the proportion of optimists always falls during recessions. But in recent years, it has not recovered as it did after the two recessions in the early 1980s. Then, the level of optimism bounced back quickly. It took years after the 1990-1 downturn for optimism to recover to the level just before that recession began. After the 2001 recession, optimism never did get back to prerecession levels.
 The Conference Board bases its expectations index on the answers to that question and two others, not shown in the charts. Those questions ask whether business conditions are likely to improve, and whether there will be more jobs, over the next six months. 
 In the June survey, 33.9 percent forecast business conditions would worsen, and 35.5 percent think there will be fewer jobs. Both figures are the highest since the early 1980s. Fewer than 10 percent expect improvements in either area.
 As a result, the expectations index, which stood at 94.4 last July, is down to 41, a record low. In terms of how they see the present situation, consumers still give more positive responses than they did in mid-2003. But at no time since the survey began in 1967 have they been less confident about the future.
 The Conference Board's survey also asks about buying intentions, although the answers to those questions do not affect the consumer confidence index. The figures for cars and homes are shown in the accompanying charts, again using three-month averages. Car buying intentions are at their lowest level ever, while fewer people plan to buy homes than at any time since 1982, when soaring interest rates devastated the housing market.
 Americans may not want to buy a new home, but most say they are happy to stay close to their old one. In the June survey, 35.8 percent of respondents said they planned to take a vacation in the next six months, including 18.9 percent who planned to drive rather than fly or take a ship. Both figures are the lowest since the Conference Board began asking the question in 1978.

 POPULAR COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT 
 Calls for Election
 President Alvaro Uribe of Colombia is enjoying overwhelming popularity in his country, but he has roused the suspicions of his political opponents by again calling for an election -- essentially a rerun of the vote of 2006 that gave him a second term. His critics say the move is an attempt to extend his stay in office beyond 2010, when his current term expires and when he will not be able to seek re-election due to term limits. PAGE A5 
 POLAND'S DIPLOMATIC VOICE
 Wladyslaw Bartoszewski, 86, survived Auschwitz survivor, fought in the Warsaw Uprising and was an imprisoned dissident under Communism. Despite the immense suffering, Mr. Bartoszewski, a longtime diplomatic official, is well-known for his good humor. ''I don't know how much longer I'll live,'' said Mr. Bartoszewski, -- who served as Poland's foreign minister twice and remains an adviser to Prime Minister Donald Tusk. ''My idea is to die in service, and not through sclerosis.'' PAGE A6 
 U.S. OFFERS MEXICO DRUG WAR AID
 Mexican officials welcomed $400 million in assistance from the United States to help it combat a deadly drug war spreading across the country. But the plan-- which President Bush negotiated with President Felipe Calderon of Mexico without the input of legislators in the two countries -- almost fell apart after Congressional Democrats redrafted it to require Mexico to meet certain human rights conditions to get access to all of the money. PAGE A5
 E.U. SEES RUSSIA'S SOFTER FACE
 There are still tensions between the European Union and Russia, most notably over energy and trade issues. Still, European Union officials came away from a summit with President Dmitri Medvedev of Russia impressed, pointing to a stark contrast in approaches between the humorous, sometimes shy Mr. Medvedev and his predecessor, the pugnacious judo-loving Vladimir Putin. PAGE A6 
 VOTERS' FEARS IN ZIMBABWE
 When Morgan Tsvangirai, Zimbabwe's opposition leader, dropped out of the presidential race, his supporters faced a peculiar choice: cast their ballot for President Robert Mugabe, the only candidate left in the presidential runoff, or face possibly violent consequences from Mugabe's forces. Mr. Tsvangirai told his supporters that they should vote if their safety was at risk, butmany still found ways to protest. PAGE A7

 CHALLENGES TO CITY BAN 
 After Ruling on Guns
 Using the new judicial muscle provided by the Supreme Court's affirmation of the right to bear arms, the National Rifle Association sued San Francisco and its housing authority to invalidate a ban on handguns in public housing run by the city. The chief plaintiff in the suit against the city is a gay man living in a public housing development who wants to have a gun to protect himself from potential hate crimes. PAGE A9
 G.O.P. CRITICIZED ON MEDICARE VOTE
 Democrats moved swiftly to assail Republican senators for voting against a major Medicare bill and said the Republicans should be held responsible for a 10 percent cut in payments to doctors that takes effect next week. Democrats were clearly prepared for the assault, having compiled data to show how each senator had voted on Medicare legislation in the past and how much money each had received in campaign contributions from the health insurance industry. PAGE A11
 REVIEWING AUTISM-VACCINE LINK
 Federal health officials will call together leading experts in autism to discuss the controversial case of a 9-year-old girl who became autistic after receiving numerous vaccinations. A second case has surfaced involving a 6-year-old girl, which officials call more disturbing and relevant to the meeting. Studies have failed to show any link between vaccines and autism, but many parents of autistic children are convinced that vaccines are to blame. PAGE A15
 QUESTIONS FOR TEXAS OFFICIAL
 A Texas congressman, Silvestre Reyes, is said to have facilitated the release of a kidnapped Mexican citizen, who is also a distant relative of Mr. Reyes's. The victim was kidnapped last week in Cuidad Juarez, a border city with warring drug cartels and rampant murder rates, and released within days after the victim's immediate family made a $32,000 ransom payment. This has led families of other victims of violence in Ciudad Juarez to say that Mr. Reyes has not been nearly so responsive to their requests for help. PAGE A11

 A QUIRKY GERMAN SEEDBED
 For Green Cosmetics
 Dr. Hauschka, a line of high-end organic cosmetics made in Germany, has labored in obscurity for most of its 73-year history. But the company that makes it has doubled its sales in the last five years and developed a cultlike following among A-list celebrities and the gilded residents of Beverly Hills and the Upper East Side. It is one of dozens of German companies benefiting from a growing global appetite for environmentally friendly products. PAGE B3
 A CONVENIENT VILLAIN
 ''Have speculators hijacked trading on the futures exchange?'' the Michigan Democrat Bart Stupak asked on Capitol Hill this week. It was part of a week in which lawmakers took turns beating up on speculators for their role in driving up the cost of oil, which settled above $140 a barrel on Friday. But Joe Nocera writes that while speculators make easy targets, they're not the reason prices keep climbing. PAGE B1
 VENTURE CAPITALISTS' QUIET QUARTER
 Not a single company backed by venture capitalists went public in the second quarter of this year -- the first time that has happened since 1978. Part of the reason is the weakness in the financial markets, but some venture capitalists say they have started to back technologies like alternative energy that take relatively long to gestate before they are ready for the public market, while others say the industry is struggling to find its direction and has never fully recovered from the dot-com bust.

 THE GUY WAS A LEGEND,

 Handball players are a brash and almost necessarily self-aggrandizing lot. So on the famed Coney Island courts in the days following the death of Vic Hershkowitz, a giant in New York City handball, he was remembered as an ambidextrous playground wizard who would come to play while still wearing his fireman's uniform. But not for too long, as those giving tributes were compelled to share tales of their own on-court glory. PAGE B10
 FEARS FOR 9/11 HEALTH PROGRAMS
 Dr. John Howard has coordinated the federal government's health programs for ground zero workers since 2006, and his strong support of screening, monitoring and treatment programs for those workers has occasionally put him at odds with the Bush administration, which has been reluctant to provide long-term financing. As his term nears its end on July 5, some worry that the programs he has advocated could be endangered if he is not reinstated. PAGE B10

 IN TELEVISION RATINGS RACE,
 Fox News Hears Rivals' Footsteps
 Fox News has been the dominant cable news network for almost a decade, but its losing ground as CNN and MSNBC have added viewers at far more dramatic rates. The long Democratic primary season -- and its many, many debates -- didn't help Fox, which tilts overtly to the right in its prime-time schedule. But CNN and MSNBC also gained viewers by photocopying pages from Fox's playbook. PAGE A17

HEADLINE: Welcome to the Season of the Bear Battered by Oil Prices, Blue Chip Losses Reach Bear Territory

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
After eight brutal months on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average finally made it official: Blue-chip stocks have stumbled into bear territory. 
 A brief 155-point slide on Friday afternoon brought the decline in the Dow to 20 percent from its October peak, an ignominious figure that is generally regarded as marking the start of a bear market. The index ended down 107 points, a mere 0.1 percent above the threshold. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has not fallen quite as much.
 The eight-month journey has roughly followed the twists of the subprime mortgage crisis, with a significant drop after the Bear Stearns collapse and a tantalizing rally when the economy appeared to recover slightly last month. 
 But in June, as the price of oil kept rising and the pain in the financial industry showed no signs of easing, the losses gained momentum. Many investors concluded that the economy was in worse shape than they had initially feared. This month, as the price of crude has gained about $13, the Dow has shed more than 1,000 points. The index closed at 11,346.51.
 Few of the 30 companies in the Dow industrial index were spared Friday, reflecting growing concern among investors that the ongoing credit squeeze and record energy prices are taking a severe toll on industries throughout the economy. Procter & Gamble fell 2.2 percent. Boeing sank almost 1.9 percent. General Motors, which had plunged to its lowest level in decades on Thursday, eked out a small gain.
 ''The problem is, right now, things are too simple,'' said Brian Gendreau, a strategist at ING Investment Management. ''Whether it's for airlines or automobiles or industry after industry, the market as a whole has become a play on energy, on oil.''
 The broader stock market has fared better than the Dow, but only slightly. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, a broader measure of American stocks, fell 0.37 percent on Friday to close at 1,278.38. It is 18.3 percent off its October high.
 Entering a bear market is a bleak milestone, if primarily a symbolic one. But it would make official what investors have known for months: The economy is in trouble, with little relief in sight. 
 Since the Dow reached its record high last October, all but three of the 30 stocks in the index have lost value. The biggest losers are General Motors (down more than 70 percent), Citigroup (down 64 percent) and the American International Group (down 60 percent).
 Wal-Mart has gained almost 25 percent. Chevron Corporation and I.B.M. have posted modest gains.
 ''Three months ago, I could have said, well, we're in a dual economy,'' Mr. Gendreau said. ''Some sectors like housing or finance aren't doing well. Other sectors are doing fine. Now, a lot of those assumptions have been called into question. It's all been driven by developments in a single commodity market.''
 A similar pattern has popped up all over the world, where several central banks have warned about encroaching inflation, primarily as a result of the run-up in energy prices. 
 Nearly halfway through the year, stock-market investors the world over are nursing losses. Blue-chip indexes in France, Germany and other European countries are down more than 20 percent. Emerging markets in China and Vietnam have lost about half their value.
 And there appears to be little on the horizon to stanch the losses.
 ''We still have worries about high oil prices, worries about inflation, in my mind still questions about the economy,'' Richard Sparks, an analyst at Schaeffer's Investment Research, said. ''Even though we've seen consumer spending bump up with the retail checks, my question is what happens at the end of next month when there are no stimulus checks coming out any more.'' 
 The last bear market, as measured by the broad S.& P. 500 index, stretched from March 2000 to October 2002. During that time, the S.& P. 500 fell almost 48 percent.
 During the 20th century, the stock market went through three great bear runs: 1901-21, 1929-48 and 1965-82. Those periods coincided with geopolitical or economic turbulence -- wars, the Depression, stagflation. Of course, all of those periods eventually gave way to great bull markets.
 While stock prices have fallen this year, shares still are not all that cheap by historical standards. On Friday, the 500 stocks in the S.& P. 500 traded at an average of 21.2 times those companies' earnings per share. Since 1990, that price-earnings ratio has averaged 24.3.
 The Nasdaq Composite Index, heavily weighted with technology stocks, closed down 0.25 percent, or 5.74 points, at 2,315.63. Treasury bond yields fell, and the dollar weakened against the euro. 
 The benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 17/32, to 99 8/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 3.97 percent, from 4.03 percent.

HEADLINE: Face to Face: A Council of Online Gamers

BYLINE: By SETH SCHIESEL

DATELINE: REYKJAVIK, Iceland 

 BODY:
This city near the top of the world has a distinguished history of hosting summit meetings. Presidents, prime ministers and premiers have come here to discuss their differences and chart earth's future. 
 Yet mere planets were beneath the concern of the nine leaders -- warlords, religious crusaders, industrial tycoons, freedom fighters, university dons and banking moguls -- who temporarily set aside their differences last week and gathered here under a banner of peace. After all, they had an entire galaxy to consider.
 Of course that galaxy does not really exist. Yet for the more than 200,000 players of the science-fiction game Eve Online; for the company here that created it, CCP; indeed for the broader concept of how companies relate to their customers, the inaugural meeting of the Council of Stellar Management was a watershed in the evolution of online democracy.
 Corporations of all sorts have long used focus groups and surveys to find out what their customers are thinking. With the Council of Stellar Management, CCP has taken that idea an unlikely step further: allowing its customers, the Eve players, to elect their own representatives to express concerns and suggestions directly to the company. CCP then flew the nine players here at its expense to wield the brickbats. The company plans to repeat the exercise every six months. 
 Imagine an airline that encouraged its frequent fliers to elect their own representatives to hammer the company about baggage handling, inept gate agents and interminable delays. Imagine a sports league in which a group of fans had regular meetings with the commissioner to discuss salary cap and rules changes. Unthinkable, right? Yet that is just like what is happening in Eve. Dozens of players from around the (real) world nurtured their constituents, presented their platforms, shook every virtual hand, kissed every virtual baby and spread the inevitable unflattering rumors about their rivals as they campaigned for a seat on the council.
 ''There have been a whole lot of aspects that were very much like real life in terms of the electioneering process,'' said the committee's chairman and leading vote-winner, Andrew Cruse, a 39-year-old technical writer from West Sussex, England, who is known in-game as the character Jade Constantine. ''It was about saying you are listening to the voters' concerns, being able to make presentations, managing and balancing various interest groups and presenting your ideas in an imaginative, attractive package.''
 In the end the council reflects the panoply of players who have made Eve the most interesting, serious online game in the world. The council includes seven men and two women (though three of the men play female characters). Three council members came from Britain, three from the Netherlands, two from the United States and one from Denmark. The youngest member is a 17-year-old, Charlie Eriksen, a high school student in Odense, Denmark, who as the character LaVista Vista helps run a powerful bank in Eve that holds assets that would be worth tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars in real money. (Though players are not supposed to sell in-game items for real money, some do.)
 At CCP's headquarters by the harbor here, Mr. Eriksen sat beside a council peer almost old enough to be his grandmother, Alison Wheeler, 52, who is the chief executive of Wikimedia UK in London and plays Eve under the name Inanna Zuni. 
 ''Obviously you will get the archetypal geek in the basement, which I suppose is the popular image in America, but really there is a much more diverse collection of people in terms of age and professional background who play this game, and really most games, than the cultural stereotypes would suggest,'' Ms. Wheeler said. ''And you really see that represented on this council.''
 As could perhaps be expected, European and American players arrived on the council with different concepts of how a democratically elected group should operate. CCP mostly allowed the players to establish their own methods of procedure and publicity. While the Europeans were largely in favor of allowing the committee to deliberate in private before announcing recommendations, the Americans favored full and total disclosure -- a reflection of the different political cultures on either side of the Atlantic.
 ''I don't think there is any question that my idea of democracy is very different from a European person's idea of democracy,'' said Sean Conover, a 30-year-old computer forensics analyst from Cranford, N.J., who as the character Darius Johnson is the leader of a powerful military alliance of more than 5,000 players called Goonswarm. ''I think Europeans are more used to the idea that their political elites operate by different rules than everyone else, and that government officers need to be able to huddle somewhere in a private room so they can say things to each other that are different from what they say in public. What we've had to explain is that Americans have a very strong sense of fair play. We don't abide things like that, and we want everything to be open. So, yes, there has been some conflict on that level.''
 To help bridge the gap, CCP took the council on a field trip to Thingvellir, the birthplace of Icelandic democracy, where ancient tribal leaders convened to settle differences. Making an analogy that amused the players to no end, Eyjolfur Gudmundsson, CCP's lead economist, declared that the players on the council had become ''the chieftains of the Internet.''
 Yet the council members came not only from different real-world cultural backgrounds but also from different political factions within the game. Eve is much deeper than some other ''massively-multiplayer'' online games, in that players compete with one another not only in virtual combat, but also as industrialists, traders, propagandists, mercenaries and political leaders. 
 Niall Dologhan, for instance, a 34-year-old public relations executive from London, plays a character named Hardin who helps lead an alliance that supports the interests of a theocratic, slave-holding race called the Amarr. In the game world he would usually have little to do with Ankhesentapemkah, the character played by Eva Jobse, a 24-year-old student from Zeist, the Netherlands, or with Serenity Steele, an alter ego of Shayne Smart, a 36-year-old Internet strategy consultant from Amsterdam.
 Likewise, as the character Dierdra Vaal, one of the deans of Eve University, an in-game corporation dedicated to training new pilots (as players are known), Valentijn Geirnaert, a 23-year-old student in The Hague, has often been in conflict with Goonswarm members like Bane Glorious, the almost erudite Goonswarm member played by Alex Kravitz, a 22-year-old technician for a pharmacy company near Minneapolis. 
 Yet in person -- around the conference table, in the CCP cafeteria, over cocktails amid the infamous Reykjavik nightlife -- the vitriol and bickering that had often characterized their in-game interaction largely fell away, replaced by mostly cordial cooperation. Late at night, in the back room of a bar, you could even witness high-level political negotiations among the players. 
 In terms of the more than 12 hours of formal meetings between the players and CCP executives, for a nonplayer the experience would have been akin to sitting through a Major League Baseball rules committee meeting without knowing anything about baseball. (Try explaining the infield fly rule to a European.) Most of the deliberations were taken up with matters of fairly arcane concern, like the role of black-operations battleships and the ability to disable player-controlled space stations. 
 More broadly, however, what seemed most surprising was how seriously the deliberations were taken by both the players and the company. While in some cases CCP explained that changes in game systems were simply impossible, in others the company seemed willing to carry out the players' suggestions. 
 To moderate the meetings, the company hired Agust H. Ingthorsson, director of the research liaison office at the University of Iceland and a professional moderator with experience in the halls of European power in Brussels. He seemed to come away impressed.
 ''I have to tell you that I have been involved in E.U. meetings where the participants were not as prepared and professional as what we've seen here,'' he said, referring to the European Union. ''These players have approached this meeting with what seems like real understanding of their roles. They are not just fighting for their particular interests but seem to be very socially responsible in wanting to represent all the players of Eve. Perhaps some real-world politicians could learn from them.''

HEADLINE: Economy Can Wait; Stimulate Your Savings

BYLINE: By M. P. DUNLEAVEY. 
M. P. Dunleavey is the author of ''Money Can Buy Happiness'' (Broadway Books, 2007).

 BODY:
IT'S one of those classic ant-versus-grasshopper financial decisions, and millions of Americans are facing it.
 What should you do with your stimulus check? Spend it, as human nature and Congress intend? Or take a few minutes to reflect upon the rising cost of gas and energy, the likely pinch of expenses yet to come -- or bills begging to be paid -- and save it?
 With about two-thirds of the $100 billion in stimulus checks distributed thus far, and millions of people still waiting for theirs (myself included), now is a good time to tune in to the Zen part of your financial brain before you make any decisions. 
 Rather than impulsively dashing to Nordstrom or buying season tickets to your favorite team's games, just sit with the various possibilities this money offers and think hard before you spend a dime.
 The government, of course, is handing out these billions of dollars in the hope that people will splurge. And there are some economic theories as to how a nationwide shopping spree could benefit us all.
 But for every economic argument there is a countervailing one, and I am not going to concern myself with those pros and cons. What matters more is each individual's financial wellbeing. 
 Wouldn't it serve our country's economic health if people used the stimulus to take the path that was fiscally smartest, according to their own situations?
 After all, rich or poor or somewhere in the middle, far too many of us are stretched to the point where financial sanity is harder and harder to maintain.
 Someday, historians will look back on this decade as the Crazy Aughts, when spending more than you earned -- as long as your house or credit card covered you -- was accepted and virtually expected. Don't think of this as a finger-wagging from on high. I've been there, done that and I'm still paying for it. But in light of the windfall many people are anticipating, some numbers bear repeating.
 The personal savings rate, in terms of disposable income, has swooped down to noteworthy lows. By some measures, Americans have not saved so little since the Depression. In 2006, according to the Commerce Department, the savings rate dipped below zero.
 Does that mean people have been living beyond their means? Well, officer, it depends on how you define ''means.'' We have certainly found ways to keep spending. I'm beginning to wonder if we know how to stop.
 Consumer debt continues to rise, according to the Federal Reserve report on credit released this month. Revolving debt in this country, which primarily consists of credit card debt, was $800 billion five years ago. It was nearly $1 trillion through April -- $957 billion, if you want the exact size and depth of the hole we're digging.
 But I refuse to take the pile-up of scary economic indicators and rising fuel costs as an excuse to panic. Good things can grow from this muck we're in. 
 Over all, my debts are minor (and manageable) compared with some, but my husband and I still owe $11,817 on a home equity loan. When I look at the loan statement, I wonder whether the upgrades were worth the angst of carrying extra debt.
 The larger point being: all that money, spent on what, for what?
 WITH that question in mind, it's worth rethinking what you want your stimulus check to stimulate. Here's a thought. One of the oldest chestnuts in personal finance is, ''Pay yourself first.'' Knocking down high-interest debt and building your emergency savings (money for gas) would top that list.
 But the budgeting system I try to follow also insists that you must spend a small percentage of your income every week or month on pure, frivolous fun. It's like tithing, but on your own behalf.
 So take 2 or 5 or 10 percent of your stimulus check as a bonus (it's your money, after all). Then think like the ant and store the rest. You'll be doing yourself -- and the economy -- a great service.

HEADLINE: North Korea Razes Nuclear Tower, but Intent Is Less Apparent

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI; Jim Yardley contributed from Beijing, and Choe Sang-hun from Seoul, South Korea.. 
Jim Yardley contributed from Beijing, and Choe Sang-hun from Seoul, South Korea.

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
International television crews were invited to reclusive North Korea on Friday to witness the destruction of the cooling tower at the country's main nuclear weapons plant. Viewers around the world later watched the most visible symbol of the North's nuclear ambitions collapse in a cloud of shattered concrete.
 In North Korea itself, however, the explosion was a nonevent. The state news agency carried no information about it on Friday, and the images had not found their way onto state television.
 News blackouts are not big news in isolated North Korea, which also let a full day pass before it let its people know, on state television and radio, that President Bush had removed it from the United States' list of countries that sponsor terrorism. It couched that development in a warning that Washington had not yet fully abandoned its ''hostile policy'' toward the North. 
 Mr. Bush characterized the latest steps toward denuclearization as a ''moment of opportunity for North Korea.'' But the North's cagey reaction suggests that any lasting change in Kim Jong-il's secretive, xenophobic approach to governing one of the world's most cloistered nations is likely to be painfully slow, at best.
 Though there are hints that North Korea's powerful military may have relaxed what analysts have described as its wariness about bargaining in earnest on nuclear weapons, experts warn that it is far from clear that Mr. Kim intends to give up all of the country's existing atomic bombs or the capacity to produce new ones.
 Still, North Korea watchers in neighboring South Korea and China say that this week's deal appeared to have emerged from the shifting dynamics between North Korea's reform-oriented civilian officials and hard-line military leaders. If the civilian leadership keeps the upper hand, that could foreshadow a more robust pace of change in the country's deeply impoverished economy, they say.
 ''I don't think it was one group winning against the other, but I think this agreement came out of long discussions between civilian and military leaders,'' said Song Min-soon, who served as South Korea's chief nuclear negotiator and then as foreign minister from late 2006 to early this year. ''Groups inside North Korea who want to reform will now gain a voice.'' 
 In his past negotiations, Mr. Song said, his North Korean counterparts referred often to objections from ''other institutions in Pyongyang,'' the capital, which the South Koreans interpreted as the military and officials from the ruling party.
 ''For some time, I thought it was just an excuse not to make a deal, but later I came to believe that it was not just an excuse but the reality there,'' said Mr. Song, who is now a member of the National Assembly.
 Even if they disagreed about the nuclear program and relations with the outside world, however, reformers and hard-liners are driven by a shared goal of survival, experts said. 
 Paik Hak-soon, a North Korea expert at the Sejong Institute in Seoul, South Korea, said that since the collapse of the Soviet Union, North Korea had basically pursued the long-term goal of formally ending the Korean War and normalizing relations with the United States.
 ''That is the only way for North Korea to survive,'' Mr. Paik said. ''North Korea wanted the United States to come to the negotiating table, and since the United States did not want to come voluntarily, North Korea used the nuclear card.''
 It is a card that the North is unlikely to give up easily. In Thursday's declaration, the North disclosed its plutonium-related activities at the Yongbyon reactor, its main nuclear plant. But the much more difficult task of persuading the North to give up its existing nuclear weapons, estimated at roughly half a dozen, comes in the next stage of talks.
 North Korea's declaration did not specify how many nuclear bombs it had. Officials there have not formally addressed Washington's contention that, in addition to its well-known efforts to make nuclear fuel from plutonium, the country has a parallel, underground program to make bomb fuel from enriched uranium.
 Xu Guangyu, a Chinese analyst often sympathetic to North Korea, said negotiations were unlikely to advance much, given Mr. Bush's short time in office.
 ''North Korea is not going to give up their nuclear weapons easily,'' he said. ''That is the last card they have to play with America. They want to keep their card to see what the next president will do with North Korea.''
 Friday's destruction of the tower, the most conspicuous element of the nuclear complex at Yongbyon, 60 miles north of Pyongyang, did reaffirm the incremental progress that had been made in Chinese-brokered multilateral negotiations to end North Korea's weapons programs. While the North has kept its nuclear activities shrouded in secrecy, steam curling from the tower into the atmosphere was captured in spy satellite photographs, providing outside observers with the most visible sign of operations at Yongbyon.
 ''As you all saw, the cooling tower is no longer there,'' Sung Kim, a senior State Department official who witnessed the blast from a hill, told South Korean television. ''It's a very significant disablement step.''
 But some experts in South Korea said the demolition did not answer critical questions, such as how many weapons North Korea has built or whether it has exported its nuclear technology to countries like Syria.
 ''It's symbolic. But in real terms, whether demolishing or not a cooling tower that has already been disabled doesn't make much difference,'' said Lee Ji-sue, a North Korea expert at Seoul's Myongji University.
 The demolition also shows that North Korea has concluded that the Yongbyon complex, in service for several decades, has served its purpose after producing an unknown number of nuclear weapons, Mr. Lee said.
 Whether North Korea's removal from the terrorism list and the lifting of other sanctions announced by Mr. Bush on Thursday lead to much economic progress could depend, again, on how the tensions between reformers and conservatives play out.
 In the past, China has encouraged Mr. Kim to emulate its own success by reforming and opening its failing state-run economy. In recent years, North Korea has experimented with some isolated market reforms and allowed the opening of a South Korean-run industrial complex in Kaesong, just north of the demilitarized zone.
 But Jin Linbo, a senior research fellow at the China Institute of International Studies, said Mr. Kim had shown no real interest in a systemic economic overhaul. ''These experiments can only be regarded as ways that North Korea is trying in order to find a way to make money,'' he said. 
 As for large-scale economic reforms, ''No, that is too dangerous for the regime,'' he said.
 But Moon Chung-in, a political scientist at Yonsei University in Seoul who was South Korea's ambassador for international security affairs until earlier this year, said he believed that economic change would accelerate now that progress had been made on the nuclear accord.
 ''Whenever I've met party officials in the past, they've told me: 'We don't want the United States or South Korea to dictate how to manage our economy. You cannot make us open up and reform. But we really are desperate and want to modernize the motherland,' '' Mr. Moon said.
 ''You have to be careful about not using the word 'reform'; they are sensitive about that and prefer 'modernize,' '' he said.
 Thursday's deal could also provide a boost to North Korea's special industrial zone, which, despite restrictions, has been growing steadily since opening in late 2004. Today, 72 companies employing 294,702 North Koreans operate there. They include three foreign companies: two Chinese manufacturers and a German auto-parts maker.
 ''European companies were careful about going to Kaesong because they didn't want to be linked with North Korea,'' said Jean-Jacques Grauhar, secretary general of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in Seoul, which toured Kaesong last month. ''But now companies will be more serious about looking at business opportunities in North Korea.''

HEADLINE: TRAVELERS FACING DEEP FLIGHT CUTS BY SUMMER'S END

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD; Nick Bunkley contributed reporting from Toledo, Ohio.

 BODY:
With summer barely under way, it may seem too early for travelers to start thinking about Labor Day. But that is when significant cuts in the airlines' fleets and schedules will begin taking effect, making for a particularly jarring end to summer.
 Across the United States, airports from La Guardia in New York to Oakland in California will be affected by flight cuts, bringing the industry down to a size last seen in 2002, when travel fell sharply after the 9/11 attacks. 
 Over all, the cuts will reduce flights this year by American carriers by almost 10 percent, industry analysts estimate, with even deeper cuts in store for 2009.
 And if oil prices keep rising, airlines may have to keep paring their schedules, as they struggle to find ways to make money in light of rapidly rising jet fuel prices, which have climbed more than 80 percent in the last year. 
 This week, the country's two biggest airlines, American and United, announced plans to lop cities like Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and San Luis Obispo, Calif., out of their networks. Cuts also are taking place on international routes to cities like London and Buenos Aires, and even to popular vacation destinations in the United States like Las Vegas, Honolulu and Orlando.
 With more reductions coming next year, all the domestic industry's growth over the last decade will most likely be lost. ''The U.S. industry is undertaking a historic restructuring,'' Gary Chase, an industry analyst with Lehman Brothers, wrote in a research report Friday. 
 Air fares, which are up about 17 percent this year on average, may rise as much as 40 percent within the next four years, Mr. Chase predicted. 
 And airlines continue to add fees -- Delta said Friday that because of high fuel costs, it will start charging up to $50 to book a frequent-flier awards ticket. American and US Airways also recently announced they would charge to book tickets using miles.
 Leisure travel falls in September, so occasional fliers may first encounter the harsh new reality of flying at Thanksgiving, with fewer flights and less-convenient connections. 
 By year's end, roughly 100 American communities will be left without regular commercial air service, and that number may double next year, according to the Air Transport Association, the industry trade group.
 ''The guy who is used to taking a nonstop flight on a small airplane now has to drive an hour to an hour and a half to an airport to take a trip,'' said David Castelveter, a vice president with the trade group. ''It is a crisis of great magnitude and it is having an impact already.''
 At least one major carrier could liquidate, the trade group has warned, on top of eight small airlines that have disappeared or filed for bankruptcy protection this year. 
 The prospect of losing service alarms passengers and politicians alike. ''I implore American Airlines, as well as the other carriers considering various cost-saving scenarios, to take into account more than profit when they evaluate routes,'' Gov. David A. Paterson of New York said this week after American announced a series of cuts affecting La Guardia and other state airports.
 Airlines know the changes are painful. Said John P. Tague, United's chief operating officer: ''There's going to be a period of adjustment in the last half of the year that will be unpleasant.'' But the downsizing of the airlines is unlikely to be reversed anytime soon. Carriers are selling off hundreds of older, less-efficient planes, so the industry would have trouble growing sharply again even if oil prices were to drop and the economy were to rebound quickly.
 Well before jet fuel costs jumped, analysts were saying there were too many carriers and that a round of mergers was needed to consolidate the industry.
 In effect, travelers are seeing the likely results of such mergers -- reducing operations to save costs -- with only one merger occurring, the combination of Delta and Northwest.
 ''It's not for the faint of heart,'' David Barger, chief executive of JetBlue, said of the current environment.
 For the airlines, the steps are an effort to stave off losses this year that could be the worst in industry history, even greater than in 2002, when travel plummeted in the wake of the 2001 terrorist attacks.
 The A.T.A. predicts the domestic airlines will collectively lose a minimum of $7 billion this year, and as much as $13 billion, which would eclipse the $11 billion the carriers lost during 2002. 
 For passengers like Allon Lefever of Harrisonburg, Va., the looming cuts threaten to make his trips even more cumbersome. Mr. Lefever prefers to fly Continental from Washington-Dulles airport to the Toledo Express airport, through Cleveland, for the board meetings he attends four times a year. 
 But this month, Continental announced it would drop service to Toledo, including the flight Mr. Lefever waited for on Wednesday afternoon.
 ''It's disappointing to see another airline walking away from the Toledo airport,'' Mr. Lefever said. It is also disappointing to airport officials, who try to persuade Toledo residents not to drive to larger airports in Detroit, Cleveland and Columbus. 
 They were hoping to attract more passengers when Continental, which used to serve the airport with 19-seat turbo-prop planes, began flying 37-seat aircraft there in February. ''We haven't had much time to really enjoy it,'' said Eric J. Frankl, the airport's director.
 The loss of service ''really hurts our ability to serve the business community,'' Mr. Frankl said. ''Most companies that are looking for a location want to have good, convenient access to the air transportation system.''
 Mr. Castelveter of the Air Transport Association said the airlines regret having to prune a system that essentially promised Americans -- and even international travelers -- that they could fly to any corner of the country within a day.
 ''I don't think any airline wants to say to any community, 'We can't serve you,' but they've got no choice,'' he said. ''It's now a matter of survival.''
 Mr. Chase at Lehman Brothers said the airlines probably would save about $1 billion by replacing less-efficient planes with newer aircraft and eliminating money-losing routes. 
 That could help airlines recover lost profits, particularly if they charge more for fares, which he forecast will rise by at least an additional 8 percent this year, and as much as 40 percent higher in 2012 compared with 2007.
 That is not much consolation to travelers like Ken Schulze, a farmer from McClure in northwestern Ohio. 
 Mr. Schulze and his wife, Val, fly three or four times a year, often to visit their son in Utah, and like to start out from Toledo. Otherwise, the Schulzes must drive a minimum of 90 minutes to a bigger airport, he said.
 Echoing the wishes of travelers across the country, he added, ''We would really like to see the airlines stay here.''

HEADLINE: Stimulus Payments Elevate Consumer Spending

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
The economic stimulus package, which mailed out about $50 billion in checks in April and May, provided a lift to income and consumer spending last month, the government said on Friday, and left economists arguing over whether the good news would stick.
 Without the stimulus, however, income levels would have risen only slightly, and wage growth again failed to keep pace with inflation. 
 Consumer spending increased 0.4 percent last month, double the gain in April, after adjusting for inflation. Without that adjustment, the increase was 0.8 percent in May, the biggest gain since November, the Commerce Department reported.
 The spending increase came as welcome news to the Bush administration, which proposed the package, and lawmakers who said the stimulus payments could help prevent a prolonged recession.
 ''We've only started to scratch the surface of the effect on spending,'' said Dean Maki, chief United States economist at Barclays Capital in New York. ''Only a tiny fraction of the rebate checks have been spent yet.''
 Mr. Maki said he expected spending to continue to accelerate, which could buoy growth in the latter half of the year.
 Other economists were more skeptical, arguing that the stimulus provided temporary gains that would quickly dissipate. Americans have been delaying big purchases in recent months as high gasoline prices and a soft job market weigh on household budgets.
 Joshua Shapiro, the domestic economist for the research firm MFR, said he expected a bigger increase in spending, given the size of the stimulus. 
 ''You pump out $50 billion in a couple months' time, and there ought to be some noticeable impact,'' he said. The 0.4 percent increase, he added, ''was not a huge one if you think about how much money was pumped out.''
 Discounting the stimulus checks, after-tax income grew 0.4 percent in May, after adjusting for inflation, the government said. That follows a 0.2 percent rise in April and no change in March. Including the checks, income grew 1.9 percent, and after-tax income jumped 5.3 percent. 
 But many Americans actually earned less last month, in terms of real dollars. Wages and salaries grew 0.3 percent after falling 0.1 percent in April, but inflation jumped 0.4 percent.
 The rise in inflation was slightly slower in May, good news for investors addled by an increasing unease over rising commodity prices. Prices were 3.1 percent higher in May than a year ago, a notch down from the 3.2 percent annual increase recorded in April.
 The data reinforces -- but does not exacerbate -- the warnings about inflation that were issued by Federal Reserve policy makers in the last few weeks. The Fed has recently signaled a shift in focus to fighting inflation, and the central bank decided to hold interest rates steady this week to help ward off rising prices.
 Inflation still appears to be primarily driven by the run-up in energy prices. Stripping out the costs of food and energy products, prices rose 2.1 percent year-over-year, and just 0.1 percent for the month. This measure, known as core inflation, has stayed steady for three consecutive months. It also lies within the comfort zone of the Federal Reserve, which is said to prefer a rate of 1 to 2 percent.
 The Commerce Department uses a measure known as the personal consumption expenditures deflator to measure inflation. It is considered the preferred gauge of the Fed, though economists also examine the Consumer Price Index, put out by the Labor Department, to measure changes in prices.
 The positive effects of the stimulus package were enough to convert even some regular critics of the Bush administration.
 ''Amidst a lot of depressing reports, I'm consistently impressed by the way the rebates seem to be helping,'' Jared Bernstein, of the Economic Policy Institute, wrote in an e-mail message.
 ''I can elaborate all the downsides -- they're temporary, we're borrowing growth from future quarters, they'll leak out through imports -- but it's a good example of the federal government quickly and efficiently implementing a positive program. You don't see that every day.''

HEADLINE: In Bear Bailout, Fed Says It Tried to Avert Contagion

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve scrambled to avert an ''expected contagion'' that risked infecting the nation's financial system when its took unprecedented actions in mid-March to provide financial backing to Bear Stearns and provide emergency loans to Wall Street firms. 
 The Federal Reserve released documents Friday providing insights into its private deliberations of those controversial decisions. 
 The Fed's actions came at a time when credit and financial problems were intensifying, threatening to paralyze the entire financial system and plunge the economy into a recession.
 Given the fragile conditions of the financial markets at that time, the Fed said it had felt compelled to intervene because an ''immediate failure'' of Bear Stearns would bring about an ''expected contagion.''
 The Fed initially moved on March 14 to provide temporary emergency financing to Bear Stearns Companies through an arrangement with JPMorgan Chase. 
 Two days later as the investment bank teetered on the brink of a bankruptcy filing, the Fed agreed to back up to $30 billion of a deal in which JPMorgan would take over the troubled company.
 That same day -- March 16 -- the Fed said that it would allow Wall Street firms to go directly to the Fed for emergency loans, a privilege only commercial banks had enjoyed. It was the broadest use of the Fed's lending powers since the 1930s.
 The Fed's decision to take this action was ''based on recent, rapidly changing developments,'' the documents said. ''These developments demonstrated that there had been impairment of a broad range of financial markets'' that Wall Street firms use for financing.
 The Fed's financial lifeline in JPMorgan's takeover of Bear was subsequently changed to $29 billion and -- most recently -- to $28.82 billion.
 The documents said that the Fed, in discussions on March 16, believed that the takeover -- and its involvement in helping to bring it about -- was ''necessary to avoid serious disruptions to financial markets.'' 
 The Fed said that ''many potential investors'' had been invited to back Bear but it had determined that JPMorgan was ''the most suitable bidder.''
 Bear Stearns began to unravel last year when two hedge funds it managed collapsed because of heavy bets on subprime mortgage securities, which soured when the housing market fell into a deep slump. 
 Along with other investment banks, it was forced to take multibillion-dollar write-downs on the bad investments. Then rumors in mid-March about the company's cash position caused a run on the investment bank that left it close to bankruptcy.
 This month, JPMorgan closed its acquisition of Bear, bringing to an end an 85-year-old institution.

HEADLINE: Garden Is a Seedbed For Green Cosmetics

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: ECKWALDEN, Germany 

 BODY:
You know you are not in an ordinary garden when a man in dirt-covered trousers, tending witch-hazel plants, describes his work in words that could come from Nietzsche.
 ''It demands a higher level of consciousness and a force of will to garden at this level,'' said Joscha Huter, 40, who cultivates the plants and flowers used to make the popular, expensive line of German natural cosmetics, Dr. Hauschka. ''There's a point where gardening becomes an art.''
 There's also a point where it becomes a crackerjack business: this rarefied garden in a southern German valley is the seedbed for an environmental marketing phenomenon that has captivated Hollywood.
 Julia Roberts, Jennifer Aniston, Richard Gere and Robert Downey Jr. are among the celebrities who have publicly extolled Dr. Hauschka's skin care products. While the stars may not express themselves like 19th-century German philosophers, their devotion has helped to win Dr. Hauschka a cultlike following from Beverly Hills to the Upper East Side. 
 Sales of WALA Heilmittel, the maker of Dr. Hauschka, have more than doubled in the last five years, to nearly $150 million, about 8 percent of that from the United States, where it also sells herbal remedies. The 73-year-old company, which labored for decades in obscurity, now finds itself in the sweet spot of a booming market for green cosmetics. Estee Lauder, L'Oreal, and other giants are pushing all-natural brands.
 ''Dr. Hauschka is shining because they've been doing this for a long time, and now everybody wants to do it,'' said Joe Smillie, the senior vice president of Quality Assurance International, a San Diego firm that certifies the organic content of food, fabric and other goods.
 WALA is one of dozens of German companies -- from windmill manufacturers to organic beverage producers -- that are benefiting from a growing global appetite for environmentally friendly products. Germany's recent economic renaissance has had an unmistakably green hue.
 Even in this Birkenstock land, WALA is uncommonly chaste. Visitors to the garden are asked to switch off their cellphones, for security reasons and to avoid disturbing the harmony of nature.
 The fact that WALA's green label comes with a dash of Hollywood glitter makes its German managers squeamish, given that they run the company almost as a collective, with all the profits either plowed back into operations or handed out to the 700 workers.
 ''If celebrities like Dr. Hauschka, we're happy, of course,'' said Philip Lettmann, WALA's chief financial officer. ''But we're even happier if an ordinary person with a skin problem finds help by using our products. Our philosophy was here long before the green trend began.''
 Indeed, the company's roots are in herbal medicine. WALA was founded in 1935 by Rudolf Hauschka, a Viennese chemist who sought to develop remedies using only natural ingredients. In 1967, it added the skin care line, named after the founder, who died two years later. 
 The company's name -- an acronym that stands for Warmth and Ashes, Light and Ashes -- suggests a crystals-and-karma sensibility more suited to Northern California than southern Germany.
 But WALA is based on a school of early 20th-century European philosophy known as anthroposophy. Developed by the Austrian theorist Rudolf Steiner, the philosophy is predicated on the existence of a spiritual world that can be accessed by the human intellect.
 Mr. Steiner's thinking was also influential in more down-to-earth matters. He championed biodynamic agriculture, a rigorous form of organic farming that shuns pesticides and uses no fertilizers that were not already present in the garden.
 An acolyte of Mr. Steiner, Rudolf Hauschka planted a biodynamic garden in this town, 28 miles west of Stuttgart, in 1955. There, a team of eight gardeners cultivates more than 150 plants, flowers and trees, ranging from Echinacea to monk's hood. They are harvested by hand, then crushed and dried. Extracts are taken with water, never alcohol. 
 For the company's rose cream, one of its signature products, it buys large amounts of rose oil from suppliers in Turkey, Bulgaria, Iran and Afghanistan. The trade allows WALA to engage in more planetary good works. In Afghanistan, it is encouraging farmers to plant roses in place of opium poppies, said Antal Adam, the chief spokesman.
 A public relations executive who used to work in Cologne, Mr. Adam took a pay cut to join WALA. Like so many of the employees, he seems to have drunk the organic Kool-Aid -- only in this case, it is bitter elixir, a foul-tasting herbal remedy that he cheerfully swigs after lunch to aid digestion. 
 The same fervor, Mr. Adam said, applies to WALA's celebrities, who get free samples but no money for their endorsements. ''We could always buy a face,'' he said. ''Our celebrities do this because they are convinced of the product.'' 
 Dr. Hauschka's success in the United States owes much to Susan West Kurz, a beauty expert and author who transformed a tiny import business into a franchise. The key was introducing Hollywood makeup artists to the products, which she did with the help of her first husband, the character actor J. T. Walsh. 
 ''Right up until the end, he was talking about it,'' Ms. West Kurz said of Mr. Walsh, who died in 1998 after a career playing memorable villains in films, including ''Pleasantville.'' ''There was a mystique around it.'' 
 Even today, Dr. Hauschka clings to its image by shunning department or convenience stores. It is available in natural product stores, pharmacies and from licensed skin care specialists. 
 In 2007, it left the Sephora chain of cosmetic stores, which is known for thoroughly training its saleswomen, because it says Sephora balked at training them adequately to sell Dr. Hauschka. 
 The company has also refused to sign on to industry certifications in the United States for organic or natural products, because it says its methods are more rigorous than competitors that claim to be organic or all-natural. ''Over the last 30 years, every major brand has usurped some of our language,'' Ms. West Kurz said. 
 While Dr. Hauschka's image is powerful, it is not bulletproof. Sales in the United States have sputtered in recent weeks, after a strong first quarter. Executives chalk it up to the soaring price of gasoline, which they say has discouraged shopping for cosmetics.
 Perhaps the fullest expression of WALA's philosophy is its unorthodox ownership structure. The original owners gave up their stakes in 1986, creating a foundation that is legally owned by the German public, and hence cannot be sold. A similar legal arrangement in the United States makes it impossible to sell the American distribution rights.
 Many suitors have tried. In 1997, Estee Lauder paid $300 million for Aveda, a maker of natural beauty products, while L'Oreal paid $1.1 billion for the Body Shop in 2006.
 ''I get called by private equity firms every day,'' said Mirran Rephaely, the chief executive of Dr. Hauschka in the United States.
 In Eckwalden, Mr. Lettmann also gets calls. Before joining WALA, he worked for a private equity firm in Munich. Now he keeps a bottle of bitter elixir next to his desk, and sounds less like a finance whiz than a soul mate of Mr. Huter, the philosophical gardener.
 ''WALA exists in the economic world, but we don't work for profits,'' he said. ''Our primary impulse, from the beginning, is healing.''

HEADLINE: Calculating the Worth Of East River 'Waterfalls'

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON; David Giambusso, Tina Kelley and Sharon Otterman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Amid all the hoopla over Olafur Eliasson's ''New York City Waterfalls,'' which opened on Thursday along the East River, one might think the city was in for a windfall.
 When asked whether the public art installation was worth the $15.5 million it cost to erect it, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and other ''Waterfalls'' enthusiasts have said the exhibit is expected to generate $55 million in economic activity during its run, which ends in October. That amounts to about 0.09 percent of the $59.1 billion budget city officials agreed upon hours after the water began to cascade under the Brooklyn Bridge on Thursday -- roughly the amount generated by a single World Series game during the Subway Series in 2000. 
 And while such forecasts on economic impact are often bandied about by elected officials and tourism boosters, their accuracy is difficult to assess, particularly in the case of a public display like ''Waterfalls'' that has no admission charge and can be taken in during a walk, a bicycle ride or even while taking the subway -- or sitting in traffic -- over the Manhattan Bridge. How much of the money visitors spend on T-shirts or bottled water while viewing the exhibit would otherwise have gone to, say, movie tickets or museum souvenirs (or bottled water while doing something else)?
 ''The methodology is not invented; it is based on something,'' said John Tepper Marlin, a former economist for the city who was responsible for many an economic-impact evaluation in his day. ''But the margin of error is quite wide. How many people are going to come from out of town? You could say 10,000 and I could say one million, and who knows?''
 Seth W. Pinsky, the president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation, estimates that 10,000 people will come from out of town specifically to visit the ''Waterfalls'' over the next three months. He guesses that 7,500 of these will be from the United States and 2,500 from other countries. Nearly 76,000 people from the New York metropolitan area are expected to make special day trips to glimpse the installation, Mr. Pinsky said in an interview, for a total of 86,000. 
 Then there are the 254,000 people who would have been in New York anyhow and will probably take a look at the flowing water.
 These numbers, and the attendant dollar amounts they might yield, were calculated based on how many people visited other public art installations, including the opening of Millennium Park in Chicago in 2004, ''The Weather Project'' at the Tate Modern in London in 2003 and ''The Gates'' in Central Park in 2005. 
 The Economic Development Corporation expects the visitors to spend $19 million while visiting the ''Waterfalls'' -- that would be 1.9 million $10 adult tickets on a Circle Line boat tour (if there were that many available) or more than nine million hot dogs purchased at carts along the route. That spending, in turn, would generate an additional $13 million in indirect benefits like sales taxes.
 The crowd on the sold-out Circle Line Downtown 30-minute cruise at 1:30 p.m. on Friday was indeed a mix of locals and tourists from California, Connecticut and Kentucky. Several passengers on the boat, which fits 115 people, said they had come to New York to see other sights and took the cruise, but doubted others would come just to see the ''Waterfalls.''
 ''I wouldn't have made a special trip from California to see it, but it's interesting,'' said Julie Greenfield, a school nurse from Castro Valley who was in town visiting her cousin. ''Then again, I think compared to the rest of New York, it pales in comparison.''
 Others thought the same thing.
 ''It looks like a construction site that sprang a leak,'' said Christina McVaney, who was visiting from Westport, Conn., with her two children. ''They should have put some fake rocks around it to cover up the scaffolding. That would have worked better.''
 Perhaps the more dubious part of the economic-impact calculus concerns the $23 million that Mr. Pinsky counts from the construction of the exhibit. There is the $15.5 million it actually cost to construct the installation (paid for with $2 million from the quasi-public Lower Manhattan Development Corporation and donations from 120 individuals and groups, including Mr. Bloomberg and his company). And then there is nearly $8 million in more of those indirect benefits -- what the construction workers spent on lunch and parking, and all the accompanying taxes.
 ''The city's economy is one that aggregates from lots of small impacts, so $55 million for three months is not chump change,'' Mr. Pinsky said. He noted that with ''The Gates'' exhibit, the city predicted an economic benefit of $80 million and eventually counted $250 million in ''Gates''-connected revenue.
 The ''Waterfalls'' is not the first controversial water element to grace the city's shores and headlines. The philanthropist George T. Delacorte donated $400,000 to build a 450-foot geyser at the end of Roosevelt Island, then known as Welfare Island, that opened in 1969. 
 Upon learning that the source of the water was the East River, which then had 160,000 fecal coliform bacteria per 100 milliliters, the city's health department demanded that the water be chlorinated to reduce the risk to public health. The chlorine spray damaged a stand of 55 pine trees donated by residents of Sutton Place to improve their view. After occasionally failing, being vandalized and turning red from too much chlorine, the fountain fizzled out in 1987.
 While many New Yorkers have expressed concern about the environmental impact of the ''Waterfalls'' exhibit, Michael V. McGraw, a spokesman for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, said that Mr. Eliasson, the artist, ''has taken some precautions to make sure that wildlife is not hurt.'' He said, however, that the site should be checked several times a day, declaring, ''Not one fish should get caught in the intake areas.'' 
 At the Seaport Cafe at Pier 17, Mohammed Alangir, 33, the manager, expressed hope on Friday that the exhibit would bring in new business, but worried about tourism in general because of the high cost of fuel. 
 ''This year may be slow because of the economy,'' Mr. Alangir said, adding that the weather had not helped business. 
 Employees at Bike and Roll, which is already double-booked for tours of the exhibit this weekend, were more optimistic. ''There is a lot of excitement in the city,'' said Steve Howson, 28, a guide on tours that cost $40 for about three hours and include a bike, a helmet and a guide. ''Some people have just heard about it, some ask, and some have known for months.'' 
 The Ritz-Carlton New York at Battery Park has created a special package for visitors who want to see the ''Waterfalls.'' For $480, visitors get a room with a harbor view, a telescope, two tickets for a 60-minute cruise and shuttle bus tickets. 
 Jennifer A. Oberstein, a spokeswoman for the hotel, said that a better-than-expected 30 customers had already bought the packages and that the company had advertised in Germany, Switzerland and Russia. 
 Andreas Sappok, the general manager at Circle Line Sightseeing Cruises on 42nd Street, said it was too early to say whether his company would benefit from the ''Waterfalls.'' 
 ''You can put the best exhibits in the river,'' he said. ''But if it rains 60 days in a row, it won't matter.''

HEADLINE: A New Fed Board Member

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Senate confirmed Elizabeth A. Duke on Friday as a member of the Federal Reserve, which has been battling housing, credit and financial crises with a short staff. 
 The chamber, however, did not move ahead on another Fed nomination of the banker Larry A. Klane.
 President Bush tapped Ms. Duke and Mr. Klane to the vacant seats on the seven-member Fed board more than a year ago. Those two openings have left the Fed spread thin at a time of much turbulence in the economy.
 Mr. Bush also has reappointed Fed Governor Randall S. Kroszner, whose term has expired. That appointment also requires Senate approval, although he is allowed to continue serving until a successor is sworn in. Democrats have shown no inclination to grant Mr. Kroszner a new term.
 President Bush chose Ben S. Bernanke to be the Fed's chairman and appointed all the current members on the Fed's board, putting his imprint on the institution. The Fed sets interest rate policy and is responsible for the safety and soundness of the nation's financial system.
 Fed Governor Frederic S. Mishkin has said he will leave at the end of August and return to teaching at Columbia, creating a second opening at the central bank if Mr. Klane's nomination remains stalled.

HEADLINE: 3 Nominees Approved by Senate to Fill Openings on S.E.C.

BYLINE: By DOW JONES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Senate has cleared three nominees to the Securities and Exchange Commission, agreeing by unanimous consent to confirm Luis A. Aguilar, Elisse B. Walter and Troy A. Paredes.
 The three nominees, who won approval from the Senate Banking Committee late Wednesday, were confirmed by the Senate on Friday along with a nominee to the Federal Reserve Board and others named to fill openings at the Treasury Department, the Commerce Department and the President's Council of Economic Advisers. 
 Mr. Aguilar, an Atlanta lawyer, and Ms. Walter, a senior executive at the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, will fill openings for Democrats on the five-member commission, serving terms that end in mid-2010 and mid-2012, respectively. 
 Mr. Paredes, a Washington University professor, will serve a full five-year term ending in June 2013 and will succeed Paul S. Atkins, a Republican commissioner. By law, no more than three commissioners may be from the president's party.
 Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, said he was pleased that Senate Democrats were able to reach a deal with Republican lawmakers and the Bush administration to fill so many positions, and he said, ''We are restoring Democratic representation to the S.E.C., where it had been absent.''
 Mr. Aguilar fills a vacancy created when Roel C. Campos left the S.E.C. last fall, and Ms. Walter replaces Annette L. Nazareth, who stepped down in January.
 The newcomers will join Chairman Christopher Cox, a former Republican member of the House of Representatives, and Commissioner Kathleen L. Casey, a former aide to Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama. Mr. Cox has outlined a busy agenda for the remainder of the year and said this week that he looked forward to having the commission back at full strength.
 Mr. Cox said in a statement Friday that the president and Senate had given the S.E.C. ''three outstanding commissioners.''
 ''The S.E.C. has laid out an ambitious agenda to improve investor protection and financial markets regulation, and a full complement of commissioners will help us achieve those important objectives,'' Mr. Cox added. He told reporters that he expected the newcomers to be up to speed quickly, saying: ''I don't think there will be a steep learning curve'' ahead of them.
 Mr. Aguilar, Mr. Paredes and Ms. Walter could not be reached immediately for comment.
 Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey who is a member of the Banking Committee and had recommended Mr. Aguilar to replace Mr. Campos, welcomed the news Friday, saying it was important to have a fully active S.E.C. in the wake of the mid-March collapse of Bear Stearns, now part of JPMorgan Chase.
 ''Given the turbulence in the economy, turmoil in the markets and ongoing questions about financial soundness, these new commissioners certainly have their work cut out for them,'' Mr. Menendez said in a statement. ''In addition, there are key questions about shareholders' rights that must be addressed by the commission. For too long, the S.E.C. has been operating at partial strength. Moving forward, I hope the commission will have the balance and the oversight needed to help restore stability to our markets.''

HEADLINE: Easy Target, But Not The Right One

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
So now we know: it's all the fault of those damnable speculators. They're the ones to blame as the price of oil tops $140 a barrel. 
 It's not our government's fault for failing to come up with a credible energy policy -- that can't be it. Nor is the problem the weak dollar, or the voracious energy appetite of the Chinese, or those pesky rebels in Nigeria who are trying to blow up their country's oil pipelines. And it's certainly not the fault of you and me for driving gas-guzzling S.U.V.'s. It has to be those speculators. They are the only villains in sight.
 This was ''first let's kill all the speculators'' week on Capitol Hill, and it was not a pretty sight. On Monday, the House Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee held an eight-hour hearing (!), the sole purpose of which was to decry ''excessive speculation.'' ''Have speculators hijacked trading on the futures exchange?'' asked the Michigan Democrat Bart Stupak. His answer throughout the day -- as he ''grilled'' an array of sympathetic academics and futures market critics -- was a resounding yes. 
 On Tuesday, the action moved to the Senate, where the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee held its hearing. ''Speculation in the food and fuel markets is not illegal,'' Senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut conceded, ''but that does not mean it is not very hurtful.'' He continued: ''They are artificially inflating the price of food and oil and causing real suffering for millions and millions of people and businesses.'' 
 There were yet more hearings on Wednesday, and by Thursday evening, the House had passed, by a wide margin, a bill calling on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to curtail ''excessive speculation.'' Indeed, the C.F.T.C spent the week being raked over the coals for allowing all this rampant speculation to take place. On Monday afternoon, for instance, Representative John Dingell of Michigan took unseemly glee in going after Walter L. Lukken, the agency's chairman.
 Jabbing his pencil at Mr. Lukken, Mr. Dingell described the founding of the agency as an effort to prevent farmers and consumers from being ''screwed'' by ''those folks in the futures markets.'' 
 ''Now,'' he said, ''we find that those good-hearted folks in the futures market have figured out how not just to screw the farmers and the consumers in the city, but they figured out how to screw the farmers and the consumers in the city on a whole new product -- oil.'' As Mr. Dingell sneered triumphantly, Mr. Lukken seemed to shrivel in his seat. 
 Yes, it was wonderful theater, and great blood sport. And it had absolutely nothing to do with the price of oil.
 It's not just congressmen who are railing about speculators, of course. As oil prices have doubled in the last year, I've gotten e-mail messages from readers decrying speculators, who, many believe, are manipulating the futures market. More than once this week, legislators used that same word their constituents were using: ''manipulation.''
 So let's take a closer look at what the speculators' critics are saying. First, despite the loose use of the word ''manipulation,'' that is really not what is being alleged here, at least not in the classic sense. Remember how the Hunts tried to corner the silver market? They bought up silver and took it off the market, thereby creating an artificial shortage. I suppose OPEC could do something like that -- one could even argue that OPEC does that already -- but no mere speculator could. 
 I can already hear your rejoinder: what about Enron and its famous manipulation of energy prices in California? But remember, Enron was manipulating electricity prices, not oil, which was possible mainly because electricity can't be stored. By getting power plants to shut down for hours at a time, Enron was able to create artificial shortages and jack up the price.
 Instead, the critics' thesis is that speculators are creating an energy bubble the same way investors created the Internet bubble. As speculative bets on energy have grown drastically in recent years, the sheer amount of money being thrown at energy futures is making those bets a self-fulfilling prophecy. All that money, in other words, pushes prices higher than they would go if the market simply consisted of the actual buyers and sellers of oil. 
 In addition, because of something called the ''London loophole'' and the ''Enron loophole,'' which allow speculators to use unregulated exchanges, they can evade the limits of the New York Mercantile Exchange, as well as C.F.T.C. scrutiny.
 The leading proponent of this theory is a portfolio manager based in the Virgin Islands named Michael W. Masters. When I caught up with him on Thursday afternoon, after his week of testimony, he said that the problem was that institutional investors had stopped seeing energy as a commodity the world relies on and instead saw it as an ''asset class'' for their portfolios. ''I am opposed to thinking about commodities as an asset class,'' he said. 
 Several years ago, he continued, he began to notice that increasing cash flows were moving into commodities index funds. This was, he said, ''long-only money'' -- meaning that it was a pure bet that prices would go up. By now, he told me, there is $240 billion in commodity index funds, up from $13 billon five years ago. As he also noted in his testimony before Congress, ''the prices of the 25 commodities that compose these indices have risen by an average of 183 percent in those five years!'' He claims that energy prices will fall by 50 percent if the speculators can only be driven out of the futures market. 
 There are so many holes in this argument I scarcely know where to start. The C.F.T.C. says that some $5 trillion worth of futures and options transaction trades take place every day; can an influx of $240 billion, spread over five years, really propel prices upward to the extent that he and others claim? Then there's the fact that the commodities markets don't work like equity markets, where a small amount of trading can lift every share of a company's stock. In commodities trading, every contract has a buyer and a seller, meaning that for every bet that prices are going up, somebody else is betting they are going down. Why doesn't that short interest depress prices? 
 And what about all those commodities, like coal or barley or sulfur, that don't trade on any futures market but have risen as fast as or faster than oil? Or how about the recent decline in cash flows into many commodity funds -- why have prices kept going up if the money has stopped pouring into those funds? My speculator friends tell me that in the last two weeks, trading volumes have been cut in half. Indeed, what I hear is that much of the speculative money that remains in the market is betting against higher oil prices. 
 As for the London and Enron loopholes, I can pretty much guarantee they will be closed soon. There are some eight bills aimed at curbing speculation, and virtually every one of them calls for an end to the loopholes. That is probably a good thing -- but I'd lay odds the price will not drop as a result. The loopholes are not the reason prices are going up.
 In fact, I'd be willing to go a step further. Even if you eliminated speculation entirely, the price of oil wouldn't fall. Thankfully, no one is proposing to go that far (though Senator Lieberman was toying with the idea), because even members of Congress understand that futures markets serve a crucial purpose. They help companies hedge their oil prices, and they help energy companies manage their risk, for starters. 
 The energy speculators I spoke to say that Congress has it exactly backward: the futures market is actually taking its cues from the physical market, where the buyers and sellers of oil do their business. Last week, the Saudis promised to produce an extra 200,000 barrels a day. But it is pricing that oil so high that oil companies are balking at paying for it. The Saudis didn't arrive at their price by looking to the futures market -- but if they get that price, it will certainly affect the futures market.
 Both speculators and oilmen say that supply and demand is the real culprit. ''Our supply is pathetic,'' said Gary Ross, the chief executive of the PIRA Energy Group, and a well-known energy consultant. ''Look at the data,'' he continued. ''The world economy is growing by 3.9 percent a year. World oil demand should grow by 2.3 percent just to keep pace. That's an extra two million barrels a day. We don't have it! It's obvious.''
 I also think there is something else at play. After years of ignoring the rather obvious fact that oil is a finite resource, the world has suddenly become acutely aware of that reality. Everyone in the oil markets is attuned to every little twitch that has the potential to damp supply or increase demand. That's why, for instance, when Libya announced on Thursday that it might cut oil production, oil jumped more than $5. Meanwhile, when Brazil discovers a huge new oil field, the market shrugs. That is not speculation at work -- it's market psychology. There's a big difference. If there is indeed a bubble, that's what is causing it.
 ''Speculators have always been an easy target,'' said Leo Melamed, the man who founded the futures markets. As Ron Chernow, the great business historian put it, ''At times in history when you have vast and impersonal forces wreaking havoc in markets, there is always a temptation to villainize someone.'' Centuries ago, it was Shylock; now it's the speculator and the short-seller. 
 In his book ''The House of Morgan,'' Mr. Chernow has a description of Herbert Hoover, ''moody and isolated,'' convinced that short-sellers were behind the market's horrendous downturn in 1929. ''He came to believe in a Democratic conspiracy to drive down stocks by selling them short,'' Mr. Chernow writes, adding that Hoover ''began to compile lists of people in the bear cabal and even claimed to know they met every Sunday afternoon to plot the week's destruction!''
 I wonder whether Mr. Dingell has heard about them.

HEADLINE: Gas Drillers in Race for Hearts and Land

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WALTON, N.Y. 

 BODY:
 You could have taken a nostalgic drive through the past on Thursday night, through the dreamy green landscape at the outer edges of the Catskills, past sleepy fishing towns like Roscoe and Downsville, to the lovingly restored Walton Theater, built in 1914 for vaudeville acts, honored guests like Theodore Roosevelt and community events of all shapes and sizes.
 And, if you got there, you would have received a distinctly less dreamy glimpse of the future. You would have heard an overheated mix of fear and greed, caution and paranoia, of million-dollar gas leases that could enrich struggling farmers, of polluted wells, pastures turned to industrial sites and ozone pollution at urban levels. You would have heard anguished landowners from Wyoming and Colorado, facing issues now improbably appropriate to the Catskills, present their cautionary view of an environment dominated by huge energy companies where some will get rich while their neighbors might just see a hundredfold increase in truck traffic without much else to show for it. 
 Such gatherings are being repeated throughout a swath of upstate New York, from Walton to Liberty to New Berlin, as thousands of landowners, many of whom have already signed leases with landmen fanning out across the state, contemplate a new era of gas production now hovering almost inevitably over New York's horizon.
 It's a development born of new technology, rising energy prices and insatiable demand that is turning the Marcellus Shale formation, which reaches from Ohio to Virginia to New York, into a potential trillion-dollar resource in the gut of the nation's most populous and energy-hungry region.
 Development of the Marcellus has been most advanced in Pennsylvania, but since the beginning of the year, development pressures, land prices and activity by oil and gas firms have increased exponentially across a broad expanse of New York from Lake Erie to the Catskills. ''It's kind of a frenzy here,'' said David Hutchison, a retired geology professor who attended the meeting.
 Experts say the development will have enormous, barely glimpsed consequences for the upstate economy, the state's finances and the way of life in quiet rural communities like this one, many of them now heavily influenced by the second-home market. There will be questions about the environmental consequences, especially the potential effect on the upstate reservoirs and watershed that provide New York City's drinking water.
 ''This is happening, it's unstoppable,'' said Chris Denton, a lawyer in Elmira who is assembling big blocks of landowners to negotiate with gas companies. ''And the question is whether we do it in a way that makes sense or a way that's irrational and irresponsible.'' 
 The Marcellus Shale has been known to be a potential energy source for a century. But advances in horizontal drilling and soaring energy prices have made it attractive to energy firms. A few years back, farmers could lease their mineral rights for a dollar an acre. This year alone prices in many places have soared to $2,500 an acre from about $200.
 So, for example, when Henry Constable, 77, a retired dairy farmer who owns 140 acres outside Walton, left the theater on Thursday night, his head was swimming with alternating visions of financial gain and environmental hazard. He did not quite know what he thought. Would he lease his land?
 ''It's definitely a two-sided deal,'' he said. ''I can't give you an honest answer. I'll probably sign something, but I don't know.''
 A stranger listening in offered him a business card and started giving him advice.
 ''Let me give you fair warning,'' he began. ''I'm a financial adviser and a landowner, so I'm on both sides of this play. First thing, you need to have a good lawyer, to make sure you have a good lease that gives the right to sue or defend yourself if you're sued in local court. What these companies want to do is sue you in Minnesota or someplace. And you don't want to sign a walk-down-the-street lease. You need to be working with an oil and gas attorney.''
 The man, who declined to identify himself to a reporter, started adding up how much Mr. Constable's land could be worth at $2,500 an acre and a minimum of 12.5 percent royalties. ''That could be $1.2 million per year for every 40 acres,'' he said. ''Do the math. Assuming you're just signing a lease and not some other monkey deal, you're suddenly J. R. Ewing. You have an estate tax problem. You have an income tax problem. You've got to talk to somebody soon.''
 Most of the meetings have focused on just such issues of what landowners can do to maximize their return and control. This one, sponsored by the Catskill Mountainkeeper environmental group, featured presentations by landowners and environmental and citizens' advocates like Jill Morrison of the Powder River Basin Resource Council in Sheridan, Wyo., and Peggy Utesch of the Grand Valley Citizens Alliance in New Castle, Colo.
 They said those royalty checks came at a huge cost: polluted air and water, industrial noise, well blowouts, toxic chemicals leaching into groundwater and wells and a fracturing of communities. Of paramount importance, many said, would be protecting the New York City watershed, an issue that could touch off regulatory and environmental disputes.
 The first wells in New York, which have the required state permits, are already being drilled, and the process could play out over 40 years.
 ''There are problems and challenges that people haven't even conceived of,'' Ms. Morrison said. ''And I can tell you that those of us who have gone through it know it has consumed the last 10 or 15 years of people's lives. I can't express enough the profound impacts this will have on people's lives, on land, water, air, wildlife. You need to do an enormous amount of planning to get out in front of it, because this is the richest industry in the world, and they're going to come whether you want them or not.''

 BODY:
 PAY close attention to stocks that attract so little interest that they don't trade -- not even a single share -- on at least one day of the year.
 There are more of these neglected stocks than you might think: about one-third of the publicly traded stocks on major exchanges in the United States, according to a new study.
 And though they occupy a sleepy corner of the market, at least some of these stocks are worth studying closely. Many aren't very impressive, at least in part because little is known about them, but a few perform extraordinarily well. 
 These are the implications of a study entitled ''Information Diffusion Based Explanations of Asset Pricing Anomalies,'' written by Athanasios Bolmatis, an investment strategist at Fulcrum Asset Management, a hedge fund in London, and Evangelos G. Sekeris, a financial economist in the supervision and regulation department of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. A version has been circulating in academic circles as a working paper for more than a year.
 The researchers were interested in the quality of information about a company that is available to investors and the speed with which it is disseminated in the marketplace. They believe stocks that occasionally go an entire market session without trading are those for which information is generally of lower quality and is slower to circulate.
 Relatively few investors follow such companies, and few, if any, stock analysts look at them closely. That's important, the researchers argue, because -- at least in theory -- a neglected stock will need to promise a higher return in order to compensate investors for the lower quality and quantity of information. 
 Consider two hypothetical portfolios the researchers put together. The first owned just those stocks that traded each market day of the previous year, while the second held those stocks that had at least one no-trade day. From the beginning of 1962 through 2003, according to the researchers' calculations, the second portfolio outperformed the first by an annualized average of eight percentage points.
 That's a big gap. By contrast, the average small-cap stock outperformed the average large-cap issue during that period by only 2.9 percentage points, annualized, according to the researchers. And the typical value stock beat the average growth stock by 5.5 points a year.
 From those numbers, the odds would seem to be in your favor whenever you invest in the stocks that don't always trade. But in an interview, Mr. Sekeris said that this strategy was not without sizable risk.
 The key to beating the market with such stocks is finding those whose relative obscurity is about to end. That's because new money tends to rush in as Wall Street discovers such stocks, bolstering their performance. Without that newfound attention, many of those stocks would continue to languish -- and be mediocre performers at best.
 AS an example of a discovered stock, Mr. Sekeris offered Faro Technologies. At the start of 2003, its stock most definitely qualified as neglected: over the previous 12 months, there were 38 market days when it didn't trade. Its trading volume mushroomed in 2003 as the company, which produces computer-aided manufacturing measurement systems, reported sharply higher earnings.
 Average daily trading volume for Faro that year was more than 30 times its 2002 level. In 2003, the stock soared more than 1,200 percent.
 At the other extreme, Mr. Sekeris said, the neglected-stock portfolio often contains a disproportionate number of stocks that underperform the market by a dramatic margin -- say, by at least 40 percentage points. In 2003, some 9.1 percent of the neglected stocks produced such performance disasters, versus just 7.3 percent of the stocks in the continuously traded portfolio.
 The 9.1 percent was an ''unusually large number, greater than what you would expect,'' he said. 
 The study did not focus on how an investor might go about researching neglected stocks. But it is clear that before buying, an investor needs to be particularly confident in the information he uncovers. Without compelling information, it's much safer to just invest in an index fund.

HEADLINE: A Friendly Bustle, With Oases Nearby

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE LANAHAN

 BODY:
IT was either the Bronx or Queens. 
 Jason Velez, 32, a financial adviser, and his girlfriend, RoseAnn Monterroso, 28, a consignment shop manager, had decided to move in together. He owned a one-bedroom in Bedford Park and worked nearby in Belmont. She owned a one-bedroom in Jackson Heights and commuted to Midtown.
 They looked in Queens but decided they would get more for their money in Bedford Park -- whose proximity to public transportation and major highways provides easy commuting to both Manhattan and Westchester. ''There's the Bronx stigma,'' said Mr. Velez, who grew up in Parkchester. ''I thought it would be hard to convince her, but the more she saw, she started liking it.''
 She sold her place, he sold his, and they bought a two-bedroom in his co-op on East 201st Street for $178,000. They plan to redo the bath and closets with a custom job, not prefab units. ''We'll take the extra money,'' Mr. Velez said, ''and instead of buying something we don't like, we'll create something we do like.'' 
 But Bedford Park is about more than affordability to Mr. Velez. It's about friendliness. For instance three weeks ago his broker, David Abreu, who lives next door, visited a Manhattan comedy club to witness what Mr. Velez had billed as his first foray into stand-up. (In fact, Mr. Velez is no comedian: halfway through his ''set,'' he pulled Ms. Monterroso onstage, dropped to one knee and proposed. She said yes.)
 Once heavily Irish and Jewish, Bedford Park in the 2000 census was 58 percent Hispanic, 17 percent white, 13 percent black and 7 percent Asian. There is a large mix of new arrivals, among them Guyanese, Albanian and Vietnamese. A Korean commercial strip occupies a block of East 204th Street.
 John Dhauraj, a Guyanese immigrant who has owned a three-bedroom house on East 203rd Street for 19 years, was chatting one recent afternoon with a neighbor, Cholelle Miranda, who grew up locally and rents a place in a six-story brick apartment house two doors down. Their block is typical: tree-lined and backing up to the woodsy Mosholu Parkway, with early 20th-century single-family and multifamily houses sandwiched in among apartment buildings. 
 ''This block is still a community,'' Ms. Miranda said, and Mr. Dhauraj added, ''We look out for each other.'' 
 Like many in this middle-class area, both feel pinched by the economy. 
 ''Let me put it to you this way,'' said Mr. Dhauraj, 63, who used to work in building maintenance. ''Since I retired, I got to look at the pennies. When I was working, I never looked at pennies.''
 Fortunately, Mr. Dhauraj bought before the wave of subprime lending. The Bronx is the seventh-ranked county in the nation for foreclosure-related decreases in home values, according to the Center for Responsible Lending. 
 But several factors insulate Bedford Park. Rental apartment buildings, which constitute a majority of housing here, are mostly immune. Typical homeowners have lived in their homes for a long time, so are less susceptible to the recent proliferation of risky loans. 
 Also, many buildings have gone co-op in the last 25 years, and co-ops have stringent financial requirements. ''In a co-op,'' said Connie Amestis, president of the board at the co-op where Mr. Velez lives, ''you have to put 10 or 20 percent down, so there's no way that a bank can say, 'We'll give you a mortgage with no down payment.' '' 
 WHAT YOU'LL FIND
 Bedford Park is bounded on the north by Mosholu Parkway, on the east by Webster Avenue and on the west by Lehman College. The southern boundary may be anywhere from Bedford Park Boulevard to East 196th Street.
 The neighborhood takes up less than half a square mile. In the 2000 census, it had about 26,000 residents and a median household income around $30,000. Newer residents often come from elsewhere in the Bronx or northern Manhattan, although more Brooklynites have arrived lately, Ms. Amestis said. 
 Most housing consists of rent-stabilized buildings; a number have become co-ops. Many of the frame houses scattered in between have been converted to multifamilies. Tracey Towers, a 41-story pair of Mitchell-Lama rentals at the north end of the area, has provided middle-income housing for 35 years. 
 One can't walk far without happening upon green space. Residents particularly love the woods surrounding Mosholu Parkway, where they jog, bike, take their children and dogs, and sunbathe. The neighborhood abuts the New York Botanical Garden, and the campus of Mount St. Ursula High School and Convent takes up four square blocks between Bainbridge and Marion Avenues. 
 Residents lament a lack of bank branches, and the area's commercial strips do not look as though they have changed in some time. Yet there are plans for a coffee shop near Lehman College, and the city has chosen a developer to turn the colossal Kingsbridge Armory, once a women's homeless shelter, into a mall.
 WHAT YOU'LL PAY
 There are about eight co-op apartments on the market in Bedford Park. Current listings and broker estimates put one-bedrooms in a range from $125,000 to $200,000, and two-bedrooms from $150,000 to $225,000. An 1,100-square-foot three-bedroom co-op on the Grand Concourse was listed at $365,000 in April and is now down to $310,000.
 Multifamily homes are easier to find than single-families. Floyd Cooper of Cooper Group and Associates says houses list from $375,000 to $600,000, depending on size and location. A few on the market were built recently; most are 70 to 90 years old. ''They're fairly well kept,'' Mr. Cooper said, ''and many are still owned by old-timers.'' 
 This continuity may be a reason that the area's market hasn't taken a harder hit, brokers say. According to Mr. Abreu, prices have more than doubled over all in the last five years, with a drop of 5 percent or so in the last two.
 Vatisha Smith of Coldwell Banker Previews International says that in an under-the-radar area like Bedford Park, sellers must price aggressively. Prices here are 20 percent lower than around Yankee Stadium, for example. ''That's the area getting the most attention,'' she said. ''If you don't say 'Yankee Stadium,' people are like, 'What? What?' '' 
 Houses are less expensive below Bedford Park Boulevard. A single-family house in the 2700 block of Marion Avenue is listed at $249,900 -- as is.
 A small one-bedroom rents for $850 a month. A two-bedroom on Mosholu Parkway rents for $1,400, a three-bedroom on Decatur Avenue for $1,800.
 WHAT TO DO
 Bedford Park is well connected to the great outdoors. To the east are the Bronx Zoo and the New York Botanical Garden. To the north and west are Van Cortlandt Park, Mosholu Parkway and Jerome Park Reservoir. 
 For arts and culture, Lehman College, Fordham University and Bronx Library Center are all within a half-hour's walk. A longer walk -- about 1.5 miles -- ends among the Italian grocers and restaurants of Arthur Avenue.
 THE COMMUTE
 The D and 4 trains link the neighborhood to the East and West Sides of Manhattan and reach Midtown in just over 30 minutes. Metro-North trains run from the Botanical Garden to Grand Central in under half an hour. 
 For ''reverse'' commuters to Westchester, Mosholu Parkway connects to the Major Deegan Expressway and Saw Mill River and Bronx River Parkways.
 THE SCHOOLS
 Overcrowding is a major problem at Public School 8 in Bedford Park. In a recent report the city comptroller, William C. Thompson Jr., found it to be 44 percent over capacity. 
 At the school, which teaches kindergarten through Grade 5, 50 percent of fourth graders met standards on 2008 reading tests; 77 percent did so in math. 
 At Junior High School 80, which covers Grades 6, 7 and 8, 23 percent of eighth graders met standards in reading and 41 percent in math. 
 Bedford Park's educational crown jewel is the Bronx High School of Science, which is highly competitive and draws gifted students from all over New York City. DeWitt Clinton High School, on West Mosholu Parkway South, accepts students from all over the city, although Bronx residents have priority. SAT averages for 2007 at DeWitt Clinton were 434 in reading, 446 in math and 429 in writing, compared with citywide averages of 441, 462 and 433. 
 Walton High School, with 2007 SAT scores of 357, 356 and 348, will close for good this summer because of poor performance. Several smaller high schools will occupy the building, including Kingsbridge International High School, for students newly in the country.
 THE HISTORY
 Leonard Jerome, Winston Churchill's grandfather, owned much of Bedford Park in the mid-19th century. In September 1866 Mr. Jerome, a horse fancier, built a racetrack on his estate where, according to The New York Times, high society mixed with ''the 'commons' and the bookmakers.'' 
 At the turn of the century, the city built a reservoir on the track's site. The subway arrived in the late 1910s; 20 years later, Art Deco apartment buildings went up on the Grand Concourse.

HEADLINE: No Need to Starve in a Garret

BYLINE: By PHYLLIS KORKKI

 BODY:
The idea of an artist receiving a W-2 form does not quite square with romantic notions about creativity. But nearly two million Americans say they are artists as their primary occupation. 
 In a recent report, ''Artists in the Work Force,'' the National Endowment for the Arts debunks the stereotype of the ''troubled dreamer,'' ''footloose bohemian'' or ''charming deadbeat'' who exists on society's margins. In fact, artists -- in the form of actors, announcers, architects, dancers, photographers and writers, among others -- make a significant contribution to the American economy, the report says.
 Of course, you are much more likely to make money if you hitch your art to a profitable star. Who knows what kind of brilliant, eccentric and utterly individual art might have emerged if these gainfully employed artists had not been constrained by the needs of the marketplace? On the other hand, who knows how many would have failed to create any art at all?

HEADLINE: CAN WEEDS HELP SOLVE THE CLIMATE CRISIS?

BYLINE: By TOM CHRISTOPHER. 
Tom Christopher writes frequently about horticultural and environmental topics.

 BODY:
Lewis Ziska, a lanky, sandy-haired weed ecologist with the Agriculture Research Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, matches a dry sense of humor with tired eyes. The humor is essential to Ziska's exploration of what global climate change could do to mankind's relationship with weeds; there are many days, he confesses, when his goal becomes nothing more than not ending up in a fetal position beneath his battleship gray, government-issue desk. Yet he speaks of weeds with admiration as well as apprehension, and even with hope.
 It is easy to share the admiration and apprehension when you consider the site that Ziska planted with weeds in downtown Baltimore in the spring of 2002. Tucked in next to the city's inner harbor, the site is part of a barren expanse of turf rolled out over a reclaimed industrial landscape. This unfertile scrap seems an unlikely choice for growing anything, but Ziska saw in it, ominously perhaps, a model of where the global habitat as a whole is headed. 
 ''Ingenuity,'' Ziska says, ''may be the mother of invention, but poverty is definitely the father.'' For some time, he had wanted to create in a laboratory setting the elevated temperatures and increased concentrations of atmospheric CO2 predicted for the mid-21st century by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the leading international scientific authority on the subject. Carbon dioxide has received a lot of attention as a greenhouse gas, a major cause of global warming. But it is also, along with water, light and nutrients, one of the four essential resources for plant growth. The effect that boosting this gas's concentration in the atmosphere will have on plants is very poorly understood. 
 The facilities for testing the effects of CO2 enrichment in Ziska's lab on the U.S.D.A. research campus in Beltsville, Md., were limited. His best option there was a growth chamber, essentially an airtight, climate-controlled, artificially lighted aluminum box about as spacious as a walk-in closet. Ziska had something more ambitious in mind, but his budget, which has been cut repeatedly by an administration seemingly intent on minimizing attention to global climate change (his lab has been reduced to 3 researchers who study climate change and agriculture, from 10 in 1999), wouldn't support the construction of special facilities. Then it occurred to Ziska that the complaints made by residents of nearby Baltimore about summer in their city -- the exhaust-laden air and the way in which buildings and pavement soak up solar energy to create an abnormally warm ''heat island'' -- could be put to good use. When he checked, he found that in fact the temperatures in Baltimore run 3 to 4 degrees Fahrenheit warmer on average than those of the surrounding countryside, and the concentration of CO2 in the local atmosphere (440 to 450 p.p.m., or parts per million by volume) is well above the current global average. This, coincidentally, matched almost exactly what the panel on climate change predicted for the planet as a whole 30 to 50 years in the future in its ''B2 scenario,'' a middle-of-the-road projection that envisions continuing greenhouse gas increases but also some success in abatement programs. 
 By comparing three sites -- an organic farm in western Maryland, a park in a Baltimore suburb and the one by the inner harbor -- Ziska planned to study three circumstances: the present (on the organic farm), the mid-century future as predicted by the climate-change panel (in Baltimore) and something in between (the suburban site). He took soil from the organic farm, which already contained seeds of 35 common weeds, and with it created uniform beds at each of the sites, urban, suburban and rural, so that the growing medium and weed population would be the same throughout. What happened over the next five growing seasons surprised even him. 
 Not only did the weeds grow much larger in hotter, CO2-enriched plots -- a weed called lambs-quarters, or Chenopodium album, grew to an impressive 6 to 8 feet on the farm but to a frightening 10 to 12 feet in the city -- but the urban, futuristic weeds also produced more pollen. Even more alarming was the way that the increased heat and CO2 accelerated and perverted the succession of species within the plots. Typically, a cleared area in the Eastern United States, if left to itself, returns to native woodland. This process varies with the site and circumstances, but in its archetypical form fast-growing annual weeds cover the soil first, playing the role of what ecologists classify as ''pioneer plants.'' These gradually give way to longer-lived perennial weeds, which are in turn replaced by shrubs and trees. 
 In the natural version of this process, the pioneers and their successors are species indigenous to the area, and the woodland's restoration takes decades. But what Ziska observed in his urban plots was ecology on amphetamines, a nearly completed succession to trees by the end of five years, with a domination by invasive weed trees of the most troublesome sort: ailanthus, Norway maples and mulberries. Five years after the creation of the plots, the biggest ailanthus in the rural test site measured about five feet tall. The city site boasted a 20-footer. The suburban plot was following the city's lead, though it lagged a couple of years behind. 
 As a scientist, Ziska was excited by his experiment's striking outcome. As someone who has spent his career battling weeds, though, he was frightened by the implications. Weeds already cost U.S. farmers about 12 percent of their harvest, exacting an estimated annual loss of $33 billion. What would be the additional cost in the future, not only to farmers but also to foresters, land managers and gardeners, of beating back supercharged weeds? Still, even as he contemplated this, Ziska says he couldn't repress a certain admiration. He traces his interest in weeds to an epiphany during his undergraduate years at the University of California at Riverside: noticing a weed springing up through a crack in the Southern California pavement, he was suddenly struck with wonder at any organism that could flourish in such a hot, dry, hostile environment. That may become an essential talent, it occurred to Ziska, given the way our planet is going.
 Taking the long view, it becomes apparent that the events in Ziska's plots were just another twist in the more than 10,000 years of joint history, ours and the weeds'. We have been intimately linked since Neolithic times, for in a fundamental sense weeds are a human creation. ''Weed'' is a subjective label applied as a matter of personal judgment, a point that becomes obvious when you consider how many ''noxious weeds'' -- plants now marked for destruction by federal, state or county authorities -- were deliberately introduced into North America by individuals convinced of their beauty or utility. The ailanthus tree, for example, currently regarded as one of the most troublesome weeds of our urban habitats, was brought from China to eastern North America in the 19th century for use as a fast-growing shade tree and is said to have been introduced into California by Chinese immigrants who valued its medicinal properties. 
 There are countless definitions of weeds, ranging from the hardheaded one necessarily observed by farmers, that a weed is any plant that interferes with profit, to the aesthetic (a popular gardener's definition of a weed is ''a plant out of place''), to Ralph Waldo Emerson's sanctimonious assertion that a weed is ''a plant whose virtues have not yet been discovered.'' But all agree on the central criterion: to qualify as a weed, the plant in question must be viewed with disfavor by humanity. Simply put, any plant, if we dislike it, becomes an intruder in our landscape and so a weed. 
 Arguably, then, there was no such thing as a weed until mankind developed the need to discriminate, which came with the development of agriculture in the Neolithic era, around 9,000 B.C. In fact, many of the wild grains like red rice or wild oats that are among our most troublesome agricultural weeds today were valued food sources until we graduated from the hunter-gatherer stage of our existence. 
 Much has been made of our scientific triumph in breeding modern crop plants from those wild ancestors. The transformation of an east Asian wild grass (red rice) into the crop that provides 20 percent of humanity's caloric intake is extraordinary. What generally goes unrecognized, though, except among weed scientists, is the extent to which we also made weeds what they are. 
 Coexistence with mankind has given rise to the sort of tough plants that flourish despite the worst we can do -- hoeing, pulling, burning and, more recently, spraying the fields with herbicidal chemicals. Weeds have adapted to every means we used to exterminate them, even turning the treatments to their own advantage. Attacking a Canada thistle (actually of Eurasian origin and a regular entry in ''worst weeds of North America'' lists) with hoe or plow, for example, may destroy the plant's aboveground growth but leaves the soil full of severed bits of fleshy root, each of which may sprout a new plant.
 A result of this history is that crops and weeds embody diametrically opposed genetic strategies. Over the centuries, we have deliberately bred the genetic diversity out of our crop plants. Creating crop populations composed of clones or near clones was an essential step in achieving higher yields and the sort of uniform growth that makes large-scale, mechanized cultivation and harvesting possible. Because weed populations live as opportunists, however, they must include individuals with the ability to flourish in whatever type of habitat we make available. They also need diversity to cope with the wide range of punishments we inflict. A patch of Canada thistles, if it is to survive when the farmer switches from hoeing to herbicides, must include individuals that develop a resistance to the chemicals over time. Weed populations that lacked the necessary genetic diversity faded from our fields, lawns and waste places; historians of agriculture can cite many such casualties.
 The survivors are an astonishingly plastic group of plants. James Bunce, a plant physiologist with an office down the hall from Ziska's, has been studying the effect on dandelions (that nemesis of the suburban greenskeeper) of atmospheres artificially enriched with CO2. He found in a series of trials that populations of the familiar weed evolve, changing physically to take advantage of this sort of resource enhancement, within the space of one growing season.
 ''When you change a resource in the environment,'' Ziska said recently, sitting in his compact office, ''you are going to, in effect, favor the weed over the crop. There is always going to be a weed poised genetically to benefit from almost any change.'' 
 Ziska, together with Bunce, has been testing the effects of changing CO2 concentrations on a range of crop and weed species. Wending his way through a basement full of pumps, filters and boxlike aluminum growth chambers, Ziska showed himself to be a connoisseur of atmospheres. Peering at the instrument panel outside one growth chamber, he noted a CO2 concentration of 310 p.p.m. ''That's a 1957 atmosphere, the year of my birth,'' he said. What he and his colleagues have found, he said, is that weeds benefit far more than crop plants from the changes in CO2 and that the implications of this for agriculture and public health are grave. 
 Tests with common agricultural weeds like Canada thistle and quack grass found them more resistant to herbicides when grown in higher concentrations of CO2, making them harder to control. Ziska hypothesizes that this may be a result of faster growth; the weeds mature more rapidly, leaving behind more quickly the seedling stage during which they are most vulnerable. This promises to be an expensive problem for farmers, who will have to spend more on chemicals and other anti-weed measures to protect their crops. (Herbicides already cost farmers more than $10 billion annually worldwide.) 
 But enhancing CO2 levels, Ziska has found, not only augments the growth rate of many common weeds, increasing their size and bulk; it also changes their chemical composition. When he grew ragweed plants in an atmosphere with 600 p.p.m. of CO2 (the level projected for the end of this century in that same climate-change panel ''B2 scenario''), they produced twice as much pollen as plants grown in an atmosphere with 370 p.p.m. (the ambient level in the year 1998). This is bad news for allergy sufferers, especially since the pollen harvested from the CO2-enriched chamber proved far richer in the protein that causes the allergic reaction. Poison ivy has also demonstrated not only more vigorous growth at higher levels of CO2 but also a more virulent form of urushiol, the oil in its tissue that provokes a rash.
 According to Ziska, the steady increase in atmospheric CO2 since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution may have already had a major impact on the growth of at least one supremely costly weed. Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), a native of central Asia, is believed to have been introduced into the United States accidentally, as seeds in soil used to ballast ships or as a contaminant in agricultural seed, in the mid-1800s. Since then, its ability to flourish in dry habitats and its prolific seed production (a single plant can bear as many as 5,000 seeds) has helped it to overrun 100 million acres of Western rangeland, an area larger than the state of Wyoming. In doing so, cheatgrass has displaced more nutritious native grasses, reducing the quantity of livestock a given acreage can support. Cheatgrass has also diminished the land's value to wildlife, which also finds the introduced plant unpalatable.
 The spread of cheatgrass has been widely attributed to the degradation of native grasslands by overgrazing -- cattle prefer and selectively eat the native grasses -- and more especially to its exceptional combustibility. Periodic fires are an integral part of the rangeland ecology, but when the rangeland is still dominated by native grasses, fires occur in some areas at average intervals of every 60 to 110 years. In areas overrun by cheatgrass, however, fire sweeps through every three to five years. While cheatgrass can tolerate such frequent burns, the native flora cannot. 
 Cheatgrass's combustibility is inherent in the plant's pattern of growth. Sprouting in the fall, it resumes growth at winter's end to mature and set seed in early summer, whereupon the plant dies, leaving a tuft of dry, highly flammable leaves through the following dry season. Ziska and his colleagues discovered, though, that the weed's flammability seems to have been greatly augmented by the increases in atmospheric CO2 that occurred during the period of cheatgrass's spread through the West. 
 The scientists grew the plant at four concentrations of CO2: at 270 p.p.m. (the ambient level at the beginning of the 19th century, before the Industrial Revolution), at 320 p.p.m. (a 1960s level), 370 p.p.m. (a 1990s level) and 420 p.p.m. (the approximate level predicted for 2020 in all the climate-change panel's estimates). What they found was that an increase of CO2 equivalent to that occurring from 1800 until today raised the total mass of material (the biomass) each cheatgrass plant produced by almost 70 percent. In addition, the composition of the cheatgrass changed as the CO2 level increased, the tissues becoming more carbon-rich so that the plant leaves and stems are less susceptible to decay. In a natural setting, this would mean that the dead material would persist longer, adding yet more fuel for wildfire.
 More fuel, with a longer life -- Ziska says that the rise in greenhouse gases we have already achieved may have played a decisive role in the spread of a weed that has already transformed the ecology of the Western United States. The situation seems likely to worsen too. The cheatgrass that Ziska grew at the CO2 level equal to that projected for 2020 increased the plant's biomass by another 18 percent above current levels. Global climate change, it seems, will further stoke the rangeland wildfires.
 ''There's no such thing as natural selection,'' Ziska confides. He is not, he hastens to explain, a creationist. He is merely pointing out that the original 19th-century view of evolution, the one presented by Charles Darwin and Alfred Wallace, is obsolete. Their model presented evolution as a process taking place in a nature independent of human interference. That is almost never the situation today -- even at sea, where less than 4 percent of the oceans remain unaffected by human activity, according to a recent article in the journal Science. This interference with nature has set the stage for the success of a growing category of weeds, one exemplified by cheatgrass: invasive plant species. 
 These are plants that evolved outside a local or regional ecosystem but were at some point released into it, typically by human action. Some invasives, like cheatgrass, arrived as hitchhikers and stowaways; others, like kudzu, were introduced deliberately. (A Japanese species, kudzu was planted by state and federal agencies to control soil erosion throughout the Southern states in the 1930s and '40s.) In any case, the invasive plant species share a quality of aggressive, explosive growth in their new homes and the ability to outcompete the native vegetation of forests, grasslands and wetlands -- areas that we are accustomed to think of as outside the sphere of human influence. 
 Popular opinion has treated the invasive plants as botanical illegal aliens. The Environmental Protection Agency has labeled them as the second-greatest threat to the continent's biodiversity, exceeded in their impact only by outright destruction of habitat. Major resources have been devoted to the spraying and rooting-out of invasive plants in the belief that their removal would enable an ecological revival. Roughly $45 million, for example, is spent every year in the unsuccessful attempt to stop the spread of a single European wetland weed, purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria).
 New research, however, suggests that invasive species, at least in some instances, aren't so much the causes of environmental degradation as eco-opportunists taking advantage of disturbed habitats. Or, as the biologist Andrew MacDougall of the University of Guelph, Ontario, puts it, the invasives may behave more as ''passengers'' than as ''drivers.'' This is the conclusion he reached in a pair of studies, one of an oak savanna in British Columbia and the other of degraded prairie in southwestern Saskatchewan.
 MacDougall had not intended to focus on invasive plants when he began studying a Nature ConservancyCanada property on Vancouver Island. An 86 acre remnant of oak-studded grassland, this sanctuary exemplified a type of open savanna habitat that was once common in the area but that was nearly eliminated by agriculture and sprawl. MacDougall's original interest was in the native flora; this Nature Conservancy sanctuary is a biodiversity hot spot, hosting more than 100 species of plants and animals at risk in British Columbia or nationally. 
 Despite this land's protected status, MacDougall found that the native plant community was failing, the rarities becoming rarer. The young ecologist blamed an invasion by several foreign grasses for this decline. Initially, he supposed that simply removing the foreigners would prompt a renaissance of the native grasses and wildflowers. 
 The actual response was quite different. For three years MacDougall removed the invasive grasses from plots he outlined within the reserve. In some plots, he did this by mowing or burning; in others, he removed the weeds entirely. Yet the native flora didn't rebound significantly. In some cases, the decline of the native plant species instead accelerated, and the fundamental character of the flora within the plots began to change, with woody plants encroaching on the formerly open, grassy areas.
 MacDougall concluded that rather than serving as drivers of change, the foreign grasses were functioning more in the role of passengers, merely filling in as the natives disappeared. In fact, the foreigners seemed to be serving a stabilizing role. By blocking light from reaching the soil, they inhibited the germination of tree and shrub seeds. Keeping the brush at bay in this fashion preserved the open character of the savanna habitat so that the remnants of the original savanna wildflowers, grasses and wildlife could at least survive. In light of these findings, MacDougall says, he came to believe that the primary cause of the native flora's decline was human intervention. Before European settlement, fire periodically cleansed the soil surface of dead plant material. Suppression of fire since settlement had allowed a thick layer of litter to accumulate, and the foreign grasses cope better with this than do the natives. 
 The relevance of this discovery to an era of global climate change has become apparent in MacDougall's subsequent research in the Saskatchewan prairie. These grasslands were infiltrated with crested wheatgrass, a species from the Eurasian steppe. Again, the foreign grass was blamed as the driver in the decline of the native flora. MacDougall, however, says he believes the invader's success is largely derived from climatic change over the last half-century. Weather records reveal that spring warmth in this semiarid region is coming earlier than it used to, and the season's rain is more consistent. The wheatgrass, which awakens from winter dormancy earlier than the native grass species, has gained a competitive advantage from this change. 
 MacDougall says he believes that a North American grass species could be found that could compete successfully in the altered climate and would also (unlike the exotic) interact beneficially with native wildlife. He admits, though, that replanting this prairie would be a big endeavor, that it would require as much effort as the 19th-century pioneers gave to taming the prairie habitat. Whether the will and resources exist for this seems questionable, especially as habitat disturbance spreads around the globe, creating many similar situations.
 MacDougall says he is hopeful that the climatic changes projected for this century won't exceed the tolerance of most native plant species. He admits, though, that the spread of the exotics suggests that they are more genetically diverse and thus better able to cope with environmental change. MacDougall clearly doesn't like the prospect, but he admits he can imagine a future so generally disturbed that we may well be grateful for what he calls the ''positive services'' -- the aggressive adaptability -- of the botanical aliens. 
 It was a Tuesday in early January, but the temperature in center city Philadelphia had reached 65 degrees, and rosettes of dandelion leaves were starting to sprout flower buds in the neat bed of mulch outside the Sheraton Society Hill hotel. Inside, in a meeting room set up with chairs, screen and PowerPoint projector, the membership of the Northeastern Weed Science Society was equally disturbed. These are, by necessity, conservative people. A mixture of university researchers, county agents and representatives of the herbicide industry, the attendees had the look of farmers or foresters temporarily off their land -- clean-cut, tanned, tending toward the wiry. Most looked distinctly uncomfortable in crisp sport jackets and polyester blazers that, you suspected, had spent the 12 months since the last annual meeting in a closet. If the members looked like farmers, that was because it is farmers they serve, and they had clearly absorbed the wary ethic of that profession in which sudden change, whether of weather, markets or government policies, is almost always for the worse. 
 The day's news surely confirmed that prejudice. The second day of this year's annual meeting was devoted to a symposium on weeds and global climate change, and the speakers were outlining a future in which many of the members' current strategies will be irrelevant or ineffective. 
 The keynote speaker, Cameron Wake of the University of New Hampshire's Climate Change Research Center, did little to put the audience at ease. Wake is a charismatic man who has traveled the colder regions of the world -- the Canadian arctic, the Greenland ice sheet, Antarctica and the high mountains of Central Asia. On these trips, he collects ice cores, whose analysis enables him to reconstruct histories of past atmospheric and climatic changes. His soul patch, pink shirt and pink tie made him a minority of one in this room. He dealt firmly with an audience member who asserted that the climatic warming is nothing new, that records from imperial Rome indicate that citrus and other warm-weather crops were then far to the north of their current ranges. Wake pointed out that local archaeology can't change the global data set, which proves that the level of CO2 in the atmosphere is at its highest point in more than 650,000 years and that the rate of increase is accelerating. 
 Subsequent speakers got down to cases. Andrew McDonald, an agricultural scientist at Cornell University, had used the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's high projections for CO2 levels at the middle and end of the century to create an atlas of potential weed migrations in cornfields in the Eastern United States. If these projections prove accurate, Kentucky, by the end of the next one to three decades, should have a climate (and weed flora) resembling that of present-day North Carolina; by century's end, it will have shifted to a regime more like that of Louisiana. Delaware, over the same period, will be transformed to something first like North Carolina and then Georgia, while Pennsylvania will metamorphose into West Virginia and then North Carolina. Florida will become something unprecedented in this country. Field observations indicate that these transformations are already under way: another speaker pointed out that kudzu, ''the weed that ate the South,'' has already migrated up to central Illinois and by 2015 could be extending its tendrils into Michigan's Upper Peninsula. 
 Even more sobering were the figures that the biologist Brent Helliker of the University of Pennsylvania flashed on the screen. First, he used maps taken from an ecology textbook to show the way the last ice age drove various forest types southward. Then came a map Helliker created, suggesting that the current warming seems most likely to change the ranges to which forest trees are adapted -- the areas where the black spruce, for example, grows now, are likely to become better suited to broadleaf trees. He asked the question that was on the lips of every one of his listeners: Can the forest adapt so drastically in a space of just decades? Helliker announced that he had no answer to that question, and his talk was over.
 During a break between talks, Lewis Ziska was surprisingly upbeat. With the challenges, he insisted, come opportunities. Kudzu, for instance: Ziska has been seeking financing to study its potential as a source of biofuel. Kudzu roots, as much as 50 percent starch by weight, seem ideal for ethanol production, while the plant's supercharged vines, which can grow a foot a day, would be an abundant source of alternative energy. This would be win-win: we develop an alternative to fossil fuels and, at the same time, create a financial incentive to root out a particularly troublesome weed. 
 Developing techniques for managing weeds in a time of global climate change will be essential to the world's agricultural future, and the U.S.D.A. researchers, though they have been starved of essential financing, lead the world in this field. (There is one exception, Ziska admits; his Web searches have revealed that marijuana growers have an amazingly detailed knowledge of how CO2 enrichment affects their crop. But as Ziska points out, they don't publish in scientific journals.) Possession of this expertise could be a great economic asset to the United States, both for the protection it could provide to our own harvests and as an intellectual export that is sure to be much in demand in other countries.
 Ziska says that he worries about mankind's ability to feed itself in a fast-changing future. Paradoxically, it is weeds, he says, that can provide solutions. They have helped us deal with lesser crises in the past. When diseases and pests overwhelmed our domesticated food crops, it was to their wild relatives -- plants that mankind has been battling for millennia -- that plant breeders turned. Because weeds have more diverse genomes, it is easier to find one with the proper genetic resistance to a given threat -- and then to create a new hybrid by breeding it with existing crops. An answer to the Irish potato blight of 1845-6 was eventually found among the potato's wild and weedy relatives; a wild oat found in Israel in the 1960s helped spawn a more robust, disease-resistant strain of domesticated oats. 
 Weedy ancestors of our food crops, Ziska predicts, will cope far better with coming climatic changes than their domesticated descendants. Coping, after all, is what weeds have always done best. As last year's climate- change panel report, Climate Change 2007, made clear, we have already set in motion far-reaching and unstoppable changes in regional temperatures and precipitation and in the composition of our atmosphere. No matter what actions we take, these changes will continue for decades. If we are to avoid disaster, experts agree, we will need to be tenacious but flexible, ready to identify and exploit any opportunity in what will be a challenging, even hostile situation. In this new world that we have made, weeds, our old adversaries, could be not only tools but mentors. At which point, if Ralph Waldo Emerson is to be believed, weeds by definition will cease to exist.

HEADLINE: Big Hair, and a Tussle in the Skies

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY

 BODY:
THE commercial airlines say business aircraft contribute significantly to congestion in the skies and don't pay their share of the costs of running the air traffic control system.
 The business aviation industry disagrees, asserting that commercial airlines are merely trying to deflect public blame from their own deteriorating image.
 In the midst of all this, Edna won't back down. 
 Edna is a finger-wagging fictional spokeswoman for the Air Transport Association, the trade group for the domestic commercial airline industry. With a blond beehive wig that looks as if it had its debut in a John Waters movie, Edna denounces corporate aircraft on behalf of the everyday airline passenger. 
 Edna ''likes wearing big wigs, not subsidizing them,'' say video, audio and print ads by the association. 
 Through Edna, the commercial airline industry says Congress must ensure five things before it reauthorizes funding for the Federal Aviation Administration. Three involve modernizing technology to reduce delays, addressing fuel costs and maintaining safety standards.
 But two seem directly aimed at public perceptions of corporate aviation: ''Stop unfair financial burdens on passengers'' -- ''All those taxes and fees,'' as Edna grumbles -- and, ''Require corporate jets to pay their fair share.''
 Business aviation has been booming as airlines scramble for survival. Business jet deliveries set a record in 2007, and they were up 41 percent in the first quarter this year over the same period last year. 
 Business aviation says it does pay its share of fuel taxes, while using only a small portion of the federal air traffic control system. The industry is clearly annoyed by what it sees as a faux populism advanced by Edna and her backers, who focus on big, expensive corporate jets (which, in fact, have led the growth in business aircraft sales). 
 ''The airlines wrongly view us as competitors, and the airlines' response to competition is to try to kill it,'' said Edward M. Bolen, the president of the National Business Aviation Association.
 Most business aircraft users, including those flying on the roughly 10,000 business jets operating in the United States, also routinely fly commercial when that is a better option, Mr. Bolen said.
 The intensifying public relations battle for the skies shouldn't be portrayed as a standoff between us and them, he says. ''Our member companies spend about $12 billion a year on commercial airline tickets,'' he said.
 ''They're trying to imply that business aviation is all Fortune 500 companies flying large-cabin jets,'' he said. ''The reality is that most of the companies involved in business aviation are small and midsized.'' Many fly turboprops and piston-engine propeller planes, not jets. Only about 3 percent of business aircraft are flown by Fortune 500 companies, he said.
 The business aviation industry likes to point to fliers like Richard W. Shine. A former Air Force pilot, Mr. Shine says his 28-year-old twin-engine Mitsubishi MU-2 allowed him to expand his scrap metal business, the Manitoba Corporation in Lancaster, N.Y., near Buffalo. 
 He said that as the Buffalo manufacturing economy collapsed, he was able to save his business by having the ability to fly conveniently to nearby states to develop new markets. (His company was founded by a grandfather who moved to Buffalo from Poland and opened a rag-recycling business with a horse and cart in the early 1900s.)
 Mr. Shine does not see himself as a corporate-jet fat cat. ''I wish I was that stereotype,'' he said with a laugh. 
 In the commercial airline industry, meanwhile, there are no plans to tell Edna to pipe down and fasten her seat belt.
 With Edna, the commercial airlines argue that it is inequitable ''for your grandmother or aunt in 23-C to be subsidizing people who have the kind of money to fly in corporate jets,'' said David A. Castelveter, a spokesman for the Air Transport Association.
 ''Edna,'' he contended, ''appeals to people who say, 'Yeah, I don't think it's fair.' ''

HEADLINE: Ferries Open Up to Out-of-Towners

BYLINE: By MARGARET FARLEY STEELE

DATELINE: GREENWICH 

 BODY:
 EVERY Thursday from June to September, Bob Smart and his friend Bob Allis take the 2 p.m. ferry from Arch Street to Island Beach, a town park in Long Island Sound. Like many old friends, they disagree on some things -- including the town's recent decision granting nonresidents ferry access to its two island beaches.
 The restrictions against nonresidents riding the ferry should not have been lifted, said Mr. Allis, 80, a lifelong resident, citing a common argument. ''The taxes are paid by the people of Greenwich to operate the boats and pay the people that work out on the island,'' he said, as he settled on a bench recently for the 20-minute ride, a red and white cooler under the seat. 
 Until this summer, the four-acre Island Beach -- with its crescent-shaped bathing area and shaded picnic grounds -- was something of a local secret. Because the ferries were off limits to nonresidents, only those with private boats could get to Island Beach and neighboring Great Captain Island. 
 But Mr. Allis's friend Mr. Smart, 86, said that allowing out-of-towners on the island beaches ''is a good thing.''
 ''It's a free country, and we have too many regulations,'' he said.
 Beach access is a touchy subject in this wealthy enclave, where the median home price last year topped $2 million. Following a seven-year legal battle, the town in 2002 opened its four beaches to out-of-towners after the State Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional to bar nonresidents. In a lawsuit, Brenden Leydon, a Stamford lawyer, had charged that he was denied his rights of free speech (the right to congregate) when he was turned away from Tod's Point, the town park and beach where he wanted to jog. As a result of the decision, beaches from Greenwich to Groton opened their gates to the public. 
 But because only residents and their guests could use the three municipal ferries, the two island beaches were essentially the last bastions of exclusive beaches for Greenwich residents, and some town officials thought it was only a matter of time before someone challenged that practice as well. ''That might have made us vulnerable to a lawsuit,'' Peter Crumbine, a Greenwich selectman, said in a phone interview. 
 So very quietly last fall, Jim Lash, who was then the first selectman, made an administrative decision to reverse the ferry policy, opening the rides to out-of-towners. 
 With little fanfare, word has spread that the state has a new coastal attraction for the public to enjoy. The ferries to Island Beach run frequently every day during the summer months from the Arch Street dock. They glide past waterfront estates with lush lawns and private docks, sailboats at anchor and a smattering of private islands. 
 When visitors arrive on Island Beach, they have access to a beach staffed by lifeguards, a concession stand, rest rooms, lockers, showers, the picnic area and a playground. The ferries also travel to the 17-acre Great Captain Island, which has a lifeguard beach but no snack bar. Both islands allow camping by residents with permits. 
 The ferry fee is $2 for children 5 to 15, $3 for those 16 to 64. Seniors ride for free but must get a pass in advance at Town Hall or the Civic Center.
 Ferry riders must also buy a beach card, or show a season pass, which is available only to residents. The price of the beach passes has changed several times since the Supreme Court ruling, partially because of another legal challenge on the high cost of using Greenwich's beaches.
 Just after the ruling that allowed nonresidents to use the beaches, out-of-towners had to pay $10 each to use the beach, and $20 to park at Tod's Point and Byram Beach, putting the total cost for a family of four at $60. And beach passes were only available several miles away, at Town Hall and the Eastern Greenwich Civic Center. Many who were turned away at the beach for not having passes never bothered to go back and make the trip for them. 
 Town officials recently decided to reduce the daily beach fee to $5. Residents can purchase a season pass for $27.
 At the reduced fee, the islands are now the best beach deal in town, because parking is free in the lot across from the Arch Street dock, and tickets and beach cards are sold right at the dock. 
 Now officials are wondering if they've made things too easy.
 ''I'm not sure we did it right about the fees we charge and how we control ticket sales,'' said Mr. Crumbine, noting that passes for the other beaches still are sold only at Town Hall or the civic center.
 As for the ferry price, town officials have said the ferries operate at a loss, and some want a fare increase.
 ''The fee should be commensurate with the cost of running the ferry,'' said Mr. Crumbine, adding that he wants to see more figures as the summer progresses. Because residents already pay for the ferry through taxes, any price increase should be borne by nonresidents, he said. 
 The decision to open the ferries upset some residents. Noting that Island Beach was a gift to the town in the early 1900s from the George Lauder family, whose money came from steel fortunes, Elizabeth Magnusson, 20, of Greenwich, said, ''It wasn't given to everyone, and it shouldn't be open to the public.'' 
 But others riding to and from Island Beach recently on the ferry -- with picnic lunches, crabbing nets, and beach chairs in tow -- had different opinions.
 Attracting more people to town could be just the economic boost that mom and pop stores need, said Elizabeth James, 23, a Greenwich native and recent University of Connecticut graduate who lamented the proliferation of chain stores and chic boutiques in town. 
 Deena Cohen of Greenwich said that the beach was underused and that seats on the ferry that Thursday were plentiful.
 Valerie Oliveri, 38, of Greenwich had invited friends from New Jersey, and said she was thrilled with the new policy. ''I don't have to stress about getting them a guest pass,'' she said.
 Christina Bertolf-Ronnlund, 33, of Stamford, a former Island Beach lifeguard, said she liked that she could now use the beach. But she said she knew from experience that when too many people show up ''the island gets littered and the bathrooms get gross.'' 
 Fred Walters, Greenwich's superintendent of marine and facility operations, said his staff would assess use. ''If more people come, we'll have to see if we need changes regarding additional maintenance,'' he said. 
 Ridership so far has been lower than usual, Mr. Walters said. Last weekend, 840 passengers rode to the islands on Saturday, he said, and 369 went out on Sunday, when poorer weather was predicted. 
 A total of 248 daily beach cards were bought for the weekend, which suggests that many of those beachgoers were out-of-towners lacking season cards, Mr. Walters said. But no precise method exists to distinguish residents from nonresidents on the ferries now, he said. 
 Mr. Walters said he did not expect a fare increase. ''This is one of the most popular and expensive programs we run per person,'' he said. ''People love it.'' 
 To break even, the town would have to charge riders $20, Mr. Walters said. ''Who would pay that?'' he asked. 
 Carolyn Hoefer of Greenwich, who was heading back to the mainland on the Indian Harbor ferry, agreed. ''It's so beautiful we should share it with everyone,'' she said.
 Her father, Harold Hutton, who was visiting her from Florida, said, ''It's almost as good as Fort Lauderdale.''
 Ron Berlingo of Port Chester, N.Y., who was escorting a group from a Greenwich senior citizens home and enjoying the sunshineand the breeze from the ferry's upper deck, said he wanted to return with his wife and daughter. ''She'd really like it,'' he said of his 1-year-old.

HEADLINE: E-Mail That Investors Might Like to Read

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
EVERY few years, the conflicts of interest so deeply embedded in the Wall Street business model emerge from the shadows for all to see. Coming to light last week, courtesy of Massachusetts regulators, was UBS's dual roles in the auction-rate securities market, which have had devastating effects on the people and institutions that invested in them. 
 Because every big brokerage firm that participated in this market faced the same conflicts as both underwriters of the securities and managers of the auctions that set their prices, similar ugliness will likely turn up elsewhere as regulators continue their digging.
 Auction-rate securities are preferred shares or debt instruments with rates that reset regularly, usually every week, in auctions overseen by the brokerage firms that originally sold them. They have long-term maturities or, in the case of the preferred shares, no maturity dates whatsoever. The securities are issued by municipalities, student-loan companies, closed-end funds and tax-exempt institutions like hospitals and museums. 
 In mid-February, the $300 billion market for these instruments collapsed, trapping investors who had been told that they were safe and easy to cash in -- leaving both wealthy investors and those of modest means unable to finance their small businesses, buy homes, pay college tuition and otherwise use their money as they had planned.
 After receiving a flood of complaints from investors in his state, William F. Galvin, secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, subpoenaed documents from some major market participants. Thursday, he released materials produced by UBS and filed a civil suit against the firm, accusing it of defrauding investors.
 MR. GALVIN'S complaint says UBS misled investors by peddling auction-rate securities as cash equivalents and ultrasafe. But the suit also asserts that UBS dumped these securities on individual investors to minimize its own exposure to the risks inherent in keeping them on its own books. 
 Karina Byrne, a spokeswoman for UBS, said the firm would defend itself. ''Contrary to the allegations, UBS is committed to serving the best interests of our clients. We continued to support the auction rate securities market longer than any other firm,'' she said in a statement. ''We have offered our clients loans of up to 100 percent of the par value of their A.R.S. holdings at preferred lending rates. UBS, our clients and clients of other industry participants all share the impact of this unprecedented loss of liquidity in the A.R.S. market.''
 Nevertheless, the e-mail messages attached to the Massachusetts complaint support Mr. Galvin's accusations in stunning black and white. 
 The problem UBS faces began in August, when the credit markets seized. Corporations -- which are big buyers of auction-rate securities because of their slightly-higher-than-money-market yields -- were beginning to sell. New buyers had to be found or UBS, as underwriter and auction manager, would be stuck with the securities. The firm was going into shell shock because of losses from subprime mortgages on its books, so it needed to find a way out of the auction-rate mess.
 Throughout the autumn, increasingly frantic e-mail messages flew among UBS executives. ''As you can imagine during these stressful times, the pressure is on to move our inventory,'' wrote David Shulman, global head of fixed income distribution at UBS, on Aug. 30. ''I am aware that JPM and Citi are on all 'alert' in the same fashion with their retail groups.''
 Joel P. Aresco, chief risk officer for the Americas, sent this message on Nov. 15: ''Why the continual increase'' in the inventory of auction-rate securities? ''What measures are being taken to reduce this exposure?'' 
 On Dec. 11, Mr. Shulman wrote: ''I am pushing every angle here to move product.''
 As it turned out, some of that product being moved was Mr. Shulman's own stake in auction-rate securities, the complaint said. He testified that he began selling in September, because of his ''risk tolerance.'' By Dec. 12, he had dumped all his holdings. 
 UBS declined to make any of these executives available.
 On Feb. 12, just days before the auctions ground to a halt, another UBS executive wrote: ''We need to beat the bushes harder than ever to unload this paper.'' 
 UBS's Web site, meanwhile, continued to identify auction-rate preferred stock as a highly liquid cash alternative, the lawsuit said.
 ''The Massachusetts complaint alleges that sophisticated Wall Street insiders, knowing that the market for auction-rate securities was failing, foisted these same securities off on innocent public investors through profoundly deceptive sales practices,'' said Lewis D. Lowenfels, a securities law expert at Tolins & Lowenfels who represents a handful of auction-rate securities investors. ''If these allegations prove to be true and prevalent throughout the Wall Street community, then civil actions awarding punitive damages and possibly even criminal actions may well become widespread.''
 UBS's clients were not the only ones that the firm's executives appear to have misled. Its brokers, too, seem not to have been told about the risks that auctions could fail and their clients could be locked into their holdings. 
 ''We continue to be frustrated by the lack of information that they are providing to us,'' one broker wrote about the firm's auction-rate unit in a Jan. 10 message. ''Given the strange and difficult environment, it is imperative that we are fully aware of the risk we are taking. We do not want to imperil any relationships over something as 'simple' as their cash investments. The lack of clarity regarding ARPS is contrary to our focus on 'improving the client experience.' '' (ARPS refers to auction-rate preferred shares.)
 NO Wall Street firm likes to acknowledge that conflicts of interest bedevil its business. And UBS says its clients come first. 
 But one of the e-mail messages amassed by Mr. Galvin stands out for its cogent discussion of these troubling biases. It was written by Joe Gallichio, a managing director in the municipal finance department at UBS, on Feb. 21, after the market for auction-rate securities had frozen.
 ''As things change they also remain the same,'' Mr. Gallichio begins. ''What we face now in the firm as related to muni short term is classic Wall Street. In its core, it is trading versus sales, risk management versus client franchise.''
 ''As a firm we tell people we are client focused,'' he went on. ''So if the client is always right, then we should fix the problem this product has created in WM,'' the firm's wealth management unit, which includes retail investors. ''To let WM and the firm as a whole go through costly litigation, the loss of investor confidence and significant assets, the cost in management time, legal and compliance, IT spend, the total distraction from our core growth strategy and overall employee morale -- will certainly be in excess of the multibillion-dollar hit to balance sheet we would take by just buying the rest of the assets from WM. I just don't get it.''
 Reached Friday, Mr. Gallichio declined to comment. He didn't have to. His e-mail said it all.

HEADLINE: A Girl's Life

BYLINE: By A. O. SCOTT

 BODY:
TO paraphrase Henry James: It's a complex fate, being an American girl. 
 You grow up being told that you can do anything -- run for president, win a Nascar race, fly into space or become a four-star general -- but in the meantime everything you do is subject to intense and often contradictory scrutiny from the grown-up world. You are exposed to a barrage of mixed signals from parents, friends, teachers, television advertisements, even the stuff you play with, and your response to those signals becomes grist for expert hand wringing and opinion mongering. 
 Who are you supposed to be, or to avoid becoming? A nerd? A ditz? A flirt? A tomboy? What kind of role models are those make-believe princesses, those Bratz and Barbies, to say nothing of the real-life Britneys, Lindsays and Mileys? Mean Girls, Gossip Girls, Girls Gone Wild, Girl Power, You go, girl! What's a girl to do? 
 The short-term answer is likely to be: Go to the movies. In particular, to ''Kit Kittredge,'' the first American Girl movie to be released theatrically. (Three precursors are available on DVD.) It opens this Friday across the country, following an early debut on June 20 in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas and Alpharetta, Ga. And not a moment too soon. Like their aunts, mothers and older sisters, young girls find themselves assiduously pursued by television networks but relatively neglected by the Hollywood studios. Periodic exceptions -- last year's ''Enchanted,'' say, or even ''Juno'' -- have a way of proving that, especially in the world of franchised, big-budget, big-screen entertainment, boys rule. 
 In the 1940s and '50s the Walt Disney brand of wholesome, universally appealing animated features was built on the grace and pluck of fairy-tale heroines, but Pixar, the heir to Disney's tradition, has yet to make a movie with a female protagonist. And while everyone loves Hermione Granger and Princess Fiona, they are permanent sidekicks in serial sagas owned by Harry Potter and Shrek. 
 Move into the PG-13 world of comic-book action, and the gender disparity is even more extreme. Batman, Superman, Spider-Man, Hellboy, Iron Man. Notice a pattern? (Yes, I know, some of the X-Men are women. But they aren't called the X-People, are they? And let's not even talk about ''Catwoman.'')
 It would be silly to expect Abigail Breslin -- or Kit Kittredge, the indomitable character she plays in the movie -- to redress this imbalance all by herself. ''Nancy Drew,'' with Emma Roberts as the title character, tried last year, and was lost in the pop-cultural shuffle. But if the early, limited-release numbers are any kind of omen, a lot of American girls will be going to see ''Kit Kittredge: An American Girl'' over the Fourth of July holiday. Last weekend, showing at five theaters with tickets costing $20, the film earned more than $220,000, or nearly $45,000 per screen. (No other movie in the Top 50 last weekend cracked $10,000 per screen.)
 If ''Kit Kittredge'' turns out to be a hit, there will be the usual expressions of surprise from some movie industry analysts and cultural commentators. This is always the reaction when a previously underserved segment of the population turns out in large numbers for a movie, whether it's African-Americans lining up for the latest Tyler Perry film, evangelical Christians flocking to ''The Passion of the Christ,'' or, just last month, women of various ages and backgrounds embracing ''Sex and the City.'' (It is worth noting that not one of those movies was distributed by a major Hollywood studio, and that both ''Kit Kittredge'' and ''Sex and the City'' were released by divisions of Warner Brothers that the parent company has decided to shut down.)
 In each of these cases, of course, the audience was already there. There was a flourishing market in Christian popular culture before Mel Gibson started writing in Aramaic. In the years before Mr. Perry turned to filmmaking, he and his cross-dressed alter ego, Madea, had built a loyal fan base on the traveling theater circuit. ''Sex and the City'' showed staying power even after its six-season run on HBO was over, with a second life on DVD and in basic-cable syndication. And Kit Kittredge is, for goodness' sake, an American Girl, the apple-cheeked face of a vast and mighty consumer empire.
 Since 1986, when Pleasant T. Rowland started selling them by mail order, 14 million American Girl dolls have been purchased, along with (according to the official Web site, AmericanGirl.com) 123 million copies of books about their various adventures. Kit Kittredge, an aspiring reporter growing up in Cincinnati during the Great Depression, is part of a diverse trans-historical sisterhood stretching from the colonial era to the present. Her fellow citizens of the American Girl republic include Addy, an African-American growing up during the Civil War; Josefina, who lives in 1820s New Mexico; and Julia, from the 1970s. Since 2001 these old-fashioned young ladies have been joined by modern ''girls of the year,'' the newest of whom is named Mia. 
 All of them seemed to be present when I went to see ''Kit Kittredge'' on the first night of its run at the Ziegfeld theater in Manhattan. I was part of a (very) small contingent of fathers in a crowd that seemed largely composed of mothers, daughters, sisters and girlfriends. While males are hardly banished from the American Girl universe, they tend, fittingly enough, to play supporting roles. Many of the dads in ''Kit Kittredge,'' including Kit's, have gone away to look for work, and none of the boys in Kit's circle of friends would think to challenge her natural benevolent leadership. 
 In the Ziegfeld audience, meanwhile, the scattering of live men and boys was greatly outnumbered by the 18-inch-tall inanimate members of the audience, who sat stiff and unblinking as their companions squirmed, giggled and whispered. In addition to my daughter and two of her friends, I arrived with Felicity, Emily and Jess, and we soon lost count of the Samanthas, Addys and Mollys -- and, of course, the Kits -- who surrounded us. 
 This kind of companionship is hardly new. The idea of the doll as surrogate child and perfect friend is one that real-life Felicitys and Samanthas would surely recognize (and quite a few of the American Girl dolls have dolls of their own). The genius of American Girl is that it at once evokes this tradition and updates it. The dolls themselves are of a size and shape that recalls their Victorian porcelain ancestors. Their costliness -- nearly $100 apiece -- and the fact that you can't find them at your neighborhood toy store give them an aura of specialness. 
 And the ''experiential retail'' stores that have become tourist destinations in Chicago, New York and Los Angeles (with new branches in Dallas and the Atlanta suburbs) are wreathed in nostalgia for an older, more luxuriant form of shopping. They are like miniature, idealized versions of the urban department stores of yesteryear, where you can buy a new outfit for your doll (or a pair of snowshoes or sunglasses or crutches, or a collar for her dog) and then take a break for tea, finger sandwiches and even a show. 
 The company's stated goal is ''to create girls of strong character,'' a mission as unimpeachable as it is vague. And the American Girl cosmos can be, to an outsider, a fascinatingly contradictory place. Its starchy traditionalism is balanced by a savvy, up-to-the-minute multiculturalism. The commodity fetishism on display in the stores coexists with a fastidious concern for historical accuracy and, in the books, a clear educational intention. 
 Look at one of the dolls, and you see a kind of anti-Barbie, a sturdy, nonsexualized body whose proportions are more or less those of a real girl. (Since 1998 American Girl has been part of Mattel, which is also Barbie's corporate home.) Her clothes are both practical and authentic, and her activities are a healthy mix of chores, games and career preparations. 
 While some of the historical adventure books acknowledge that opportunities for girls -- especially poor and nonwhite girls -- were limited in earlier times, they emphasize optimism, good will and self-reliance as the ever-available antidotes to injustice or deprivation. This is certainly the lesson of ''Kit Kittredge,'' which does not shy away from showing some of the hard realities of the Depression, including homelessness, unemployment and the scapegoating of the poor. 
 It celebrates, in the midst of hard times, an appealingly ordinary brand of heroism. Kit is brave, smart, determined and kind, but never off-puttingly full of herself or intimidatingly superior. You would want her for a friend. You could easily imagine yourself in her place. 
 Which may be at least some of what girls want, and what they get from American Girl. As the son and husband of feminists, I can't entirely suppress a tremor of unease. Is the brand reflecting tastes, or enforcing norms of behavior? Is it teaching girls to be independent spirits or devoted shoppers? 
 Probably all of those things, and more. I have spent a lot of time, over the years, with Felicity and some others of her kind, and I still haven't figured her out. She doesn't say much, and even though her expression is always fixed in a pleasant smile, she seems to change according to the moods and interests of her playmates. She is an athlete, a musician, a clothes horse, a bookworm, a pet owner, a loner and a confidant. A typical American girl, as far as I can tell.

MICROCOSM 
 E. Coli and the New Science of Life. 
 By Carl Zimmer. 
 243 pp. Pantheon Books. $25.95. 
 From Victorian England to contemporary America, creationists have often denied that we are related to other primates. But the hard truth of our genealogy does even greater damage to human pride. We are cousins of every living thing, including the billions of E. coli bacteria in our intestines. This kinship may not be flattering, but it is useful. By studying these tiny creatures, we learn about other organisms, including ourselves. As the French biologist Jacques Monod once said, ''What is true for E. coli is true for the elephant.''
 Carl Zimmer effectively applies this principle in his engrossing new book, ''Microcosm,'' relating the study of these microbes to larger developments in biology and thoughtfully discussing the social implications of science. If you must limit yourself to only one title on bacteria this year, ''Microcosm'' is a good pick. 
 As Zimmer explains, a number of landmark discoveries have involved E. coli, including experiments confirming the universality of biochemistry and revealing how genes function. Studying the many strains of E. coli (most are innocuous) suggests something further: the divergent behavior of genetically identical bacteria, Zimmer writes, is ''a warning to those who would put human nature down to any sort of simple genetic determinism.''
 Along with some more familiar material, Zimmer vividly describes the unfamiliar microscopic world of E. coli and their tightly packed, rod-shaped bodies: ''If you prick us, we bleed, but if you prick E. coli, it blasts.'' And unlike mammals, bacteria often swap genetic material, placing limits on Monod's dictum. However, species large and small absorb DNA from viruses. For E. coli and humans alike, Zimmer emphasizes, ''there are no fixed essences in life.''
 ''Microcosm'' also examines E. coli's contentious public life. Creationists claim its tail-like, propulsive flagellum is proof of someone's intentional design. But at the 2005 trial over the teaching of ''intelligent design'' in Dover, Pa., scientists showed that the flagellum is not inexplicably complex. The resistance some E. coli have developed to antibiotics (whose limits are given their own slightly disquieting chapter) provides yet more evidence for evolution. 
 In the 1970s, tinkering with E. coli helped scientists learn to manipulate genes, making the bacterium, Zimmer says, ''the monster and the mule'' of bioscience -- a symbol of fears about genetic experimentation, as well as a workhorse used to make drugs. Here, he calmly finds a middle ground. While these initial concerns have remained largely unrealized, ''genetic engineering has fallen far short of the more extravagant promises'' about the eradication of major diseases that were offered 30 years ago. 
 Broadly, Zimmer sees public tolerance for genetic engineering increasing as science further reveals our patchwork genomic cloth. ''New research on human evolution,'' he writes, ''makes it impossible to believe that a thing either is or is not a whole human being,'' as some conservative opponents of biomedical inventions have argued. If our attempts to define a uniquely human core are arbitrary, however, they help us decide how to live. Zimmer thus hopes a debate over genetic engineering will produce a ''deeper understanding of what it means to be human: not as an inviolable essence but as a complex cloud of genes, traits, environmental influences and cultural forces.''
 Desirable as this discussion sounds, is it likely? As Zimmer notes, a bit too briefly, the emergence of biotechnology as an economic force dampened this debate three decades ago. Still, some public advocacy groups remain wary of bioscience, and coming innovations could revive opposition from cultural conservatives, rights-based interest groups and liberals upset at the uneven distribution of these goods. Genetic engineering and new forms of biomedicine could therefore engender a worthy civic dialogue or aggravate old political fractures. Or biotechnology may simply roll on. In any case, Zimmer adroitly links the common heritage we share with E. coli and the emerging horizons of science: ''Through E. coli we can see the history of life, and we can see its future as well.''

HEADLINE: One Rebate Isn't Enough

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. SHILLER. 
Robert J. Shiller is professor of economics and finance at Yale and co-founder and chief economist of MacroMarkets LLC.

 BODY:
TAX rebates have been arriving in bank accounts and mailboxes, and will eventually put more than $100 billion into the hands of consumers. The hope is that by spending the money, they will lessen the risk of economic disaster from the subprime crisis.
 Have the rebates, now mostly distributed, achieved their objective? 
 It's not very likely. The rebates may be helping the economy, but the stimulus they are providing is certainly too small to make a real difference. More will be needed, perhaps much more, before the economy is truly on safe ground. From the outset, government officials considered the tax rebates as a kind of insurance for the overall economy. In January, just before Congress passed the stimulus bill authorizing the rebate checks, Peter R. Orszag, director of the Congressional Budget Office, wrote that, in the current economic situation, there was a risk of ''a self-reinforcing spiral (of less lending, lower house prices, more foreclosures, even less lending, and so on) that could further impair economic activity and potentially turn a mild recession into a long and deep recession.''
 In his view, there was only a moderate probability that this ''self-reinforcing spiral'' would take hold. The goal of the rebate checks, he said, would be to lower this probability ''to an acceptable value.'' He thought that an economic stimulus bill might well make the difference.
 When he signed the stimulus bill in February, President Bush called it a ''booster shot for the economy.'' This analogy to immunization suggested that the rebate would reduce the chance of some economic disaster.
 Has the tax rebate substantially reduced the probability of a downward spiral? 
 It is too soon to tell, because the Treasury only started to send out rebate checks in late April. Retail sales did rise in May. But the dreaded serious recession still seems very much a possibility. The unemployment rate shot up to 5.5 percent in May, from 5 percent. The Reuters/University of Michigan consumer sentiment index has fallen below the lowest levels of the last two recessions.
 The theory supporting tax rebates was originally devised by John Maynard Keynes, one of the most influential economists of the last century. In 1931, during the Great Depression, he compared the economy to a stalled car. (The car, he said, had ''magneto trouble,'' referring to a device once commonly used in automobiles to generate an electric spark for ignition.) 
 In Keynes's analogy, when an engine is running properly, each stroke of a piston gets the next piston ready to fire, which in turn gets another piston ready, in rapid sequence. Similarly, he said, when the economy is functioning properly, each time someone spends money, he provides income for another person, causing that person to spend money, and so on. 
 What was needed in the dysfunctional economy of the 1930s was a government stimulus to get things started again. Keynes referred to the additional rounds of expenditure, set off by the initial stimulus, as ''repercussions,'' and to their total effect as the ''multiplier.''
 But people who have studied such models find that these repercussions aren't powerful enough unless the initial stimulus is really large. Consider the Fair simulation model (fairmodel.econ.yale.edu/main2.htm), a free Web site that embodies much of Keynes's theory and is offered by Professor Ray C. Fair of Yale. With the ''U.S. Model'' on this site, I increased transfers from government to households (''TRGH'') by $100 billion in the second quarter of 2008. The results showed a $59 billion increase in 2008 gross domestic product. That is less than half of 1 percent of G.D.P.
 The simulation also showed that this year's rebates would have further repercussions in 2009, bolstering G.D.P. by $36 billion that year. After 2009, the effects of this stimulus will just sputter out.
 This is not going to mean the difference between prosperity and recession. 
 The Fair model quantifies the repercussions included in Keynes's theory. Why aren't they more powerful? 
 Part of the answer is in the slowness of people to spend extra money. Another is that some of the rebates will be spent on imports. That money will flow abroad, to stimulate other countries' economies, with little of their rounds of expenditures finding their way back home. Third, the domestic expenditures will tend to result in higher interest rates, both long and short, which should reduce investment and lower asset prices. When asset values decline, people tend to cut spending through a negative ''wealth effect.''
 It is also possible that the effects of the rebate will be even smaller than the model predicts. Heightened anxiety about the economy might spur people to use the money to pay off debts and to save, rather than spend. And issuing tax rebates raises the government debt, at least initially, which might create angst for consumers who fear the possibility of higher taxes when the government repays the debt.
 Fuzzy as this picture may seem, there is unfortunately even more uncertainty about the rebates' effects. Much of the recent dynamics of the economy are not captured in Keynes's theory, in Fair's Model, or in any conventional econometric model.
 For example, these models have not taken account of the reasons for the peculiar lending dynamics in the subprime mortgage market, or of the state of financial institutions' balance sheets and the confidence that the public has in these institutions. Nor have they taken account of the vagaries of speculative asset markets, mistakes by securities rating agencies and the problems of bond insurers. 
 THE economy is too complex to capture all these things in any single model. In trying to steer the economy, we are necessarily trying to steer something we don't properly understand.
 We simply do not have the means to quantify all the issues related to the rebates. But the models we do have suggest that the overall effects of the rebates are modest at best.
 The reality of the subprime situation, augmented by the energy crisis, at least suggests that we'd better get ready for another round of rebates. There is little talk of it now, but we should be putting in place another stimulus package like the current one, and stand ready for another after that, and another.

HEADLINE: Mrs. Corbett's Request: Chapter 8: The Hand Model's Tale

BYLINE: By COLIN HARRISON

 BODY:
Chapter 8: The Hand Model's Tale
 Eliska Sedlacek wanted to talk again, and the anxiety in her voice suggested that she preferred to do it soon. I told her to meet me that evening at the north end of Union Square and took the R train downtown after work, the men next to me arguing over the recent acquittal of the three detectives in the Sean Bell case. I confess I eavesdropped with only half-attention; if you live in New York long enough, these police-killing cases have a kind of sad predictability to them, including the arrival of Al Sharpton into the news coverage, and instead of listening to the men recount what the cops knew or didn't know before they fired their guns, I preferred to hope that I would get home early enough to see the last few innings of the Yankees beating the Tigers at the stadium that evening.
 I came up the steps at Union Square, and Eliska was standing there waiting for me, wearing sunglasses and white gloves to keep the sun off her hands. The gloves added a touch of archaic formality to her appearance. We said hello awkwardly -- she kept her arms at her side -- then found a bench. 
 ''I need to tell you some more things that I did not tell you before,'' she began. ''It is long story, but it will make sense. Last night someone call me and say I am in big trouble with them. They want something. But I do not have it.''
 ''You think I have it?''
 ''You are only person who maybe can get this thing, yes.''
 ''O.K., lay it on me.''
 She frowned. ''Lay it on top of you?''
 ''That's an expression. It means fine, tell me what you need to tell me.''
 Which she did, at first haltingly, and then with some relief, never taking off her dark glasses, which eventually meant that I looked at her lips to understand her emotions. Her English wasn't so bad, really, and her story was clear enough, if a variant on the ancient one known as Younger Woman Meets Older Man. The surprise was that the older man was not Roger Corbett.
 Eliska explained that she grew up in a farming village outside of Prague. Her father was adept at fixing broken tractors, and her mother worked in a large bakery. Eliska played on a girls' high-school basketball team, and one day while the team was eating lunch in a Prague restaurant after a game, a well-dressed woman came over to her and asked if she could sit down. The woman introduced herself as a talent scout for a Milan modeling agency. She said that Eliska had legs and hands that would be perfect for advertisements that used only those parts. Was she interested? Eliska said she didn't know. Could she still play basketball? No, the woman, said, fingers get broken or jammed in basketball all the time. How much did such models make, Eliska asked. When the woman told her, she gasped, knowing how hard her father and mother worked for what little they made. Within a month she was in Milan for her first photo shoot. She was instructed on creaming her hands and keeping them covered. Each night she coated them in cocoa butter and then Vaseline, and then she slipped them into disposable latex gloves. She showered with gloves on, rubber bands around each wrist. At age 16, she could expect that her legs would be professionally marketable for five years, as long as she didn't gain weight, become pregnant or have any accidents that scarred her. But her hands could be valuable until she was about 30, as long as she kept them out of the sun and didn't damage them. 
 Eliska gave her first few modeling fees to her parents, and they used the money to repair the ceramic tiles of the roof on their house and to buy her father new mechanic's tools. She felt good about helping them, she said, but her new economic status changed things with them, especially with her mother.
 ''She feels I look down on her job, that I am too good for her,'' Eliska remembered. ''I think she knew I would not stay at home and that this was sad thing she must get herself ready for. I am just a kid then, I don't understand what is happening, really.''
 The modeling agency suggested that Eliska move to Paris, which she did, making her parents unhappy. The agency helped her find a flat that she shared with two other young models, a dingy place near the Gare du Nord, and she soon found that she could make just enough to dress and eat well but no more. The agency seemed to know exactly how much she needed to live on, and the fees appeared to be set so that she had to keep working. And soon it was clear from talking to the other girls that the world of modeling was a brutal class system; she was not in the same league as even the lowest runway models, who were themselves competing frantically for higher pay and visibility. Then there were the famous runway models, ethereal creatures who seemed created out of light and color alone, and looking at them she knew why she was and would forever be known as a ''parts'' model. 
 She dated -- or whatever it was that young women did with young men. One evening, while she was sitting in a bar with her friends, a portly man in his late 30s introduced himself. He was Russian, and speaking no French or German, he communicated with her in English. His name was Nikolai Gamov. As a Czech, she was naturally suspicious of Russians, knowing the history of Soviet control of Czechoslovakia, but she found him charming despite herself. She did not mind the age difference; in fact, she liked it. One thing led to another, as it so often does, and soon he was visiting her every time he was in Paris. She came to miss him, and then -- yes -- to love him. They dreamed that they would move to America someday. He was tired of the danger of being a businessman in Russia, he told her, and felt that under Putin the country was going backward politically. People don't realize, he said, that the price of oil buys Russia its armies. The price of oil will stay high, and Putin will take us to war. I saw what happened to my uncles in Afghanistan and to my cousins in Chechnya. In America you do not have to be in the army or navy. When you get an American passport, you can travel and do business in China, South Korea, India, no problem. You are free. 
 Eliska liked the idea of living in America. And so she and Nikolai planned their future together. She'd move there first and begin the process of becoming an American citizen. Then they'd marry. She sent her portfolio to the New York agencies and was thrilled when they asked her to travel to the U.S. to do a series of shots that involved modeling an $87,000 watch. Then she was asked to pour wine into a glass. Then model rings. Within a few months she had enough work to get a green card and rent a cheap apartment at 101st Street and Second Avenue. She flew back and forth to Paris every few weeks -- it was a hectic but exciting existence -- and Nikolai asked her to take something in her suitcase for him each time. Little toy soldiers. They were heavy and unpainted and did not look to her as if they'd ever been for sale. There were three different ones: a soldier throwing a grenade, his arm cocked backward; another kneeling on one leg and sighting a rifle; and last, a soldier crawling on the ground, one hand holding a rifle. He sprinkled a few in her checked baggage each trip.
 ''He tells me put them in a box and he will get them when he comes to America. Sometimes he gives me Christmas ornaments, boots and trains. I fill up one box after next with these things. They say MADE IN CHINA on them, but Nikolai says they are not made in China, they are made in little town outside Moscow with special molds taken from original Chinese ornaments. This is where his family comes from, I know. His brother has business cutting up old cars for parts and also, of course, stealing cars, sometimes from Western Europe, and taking off their identification. I do not ask Nikolai too much. His brother is older, very Russian, heavy and drinks too much. I think he is bad guy. I meet him in Paris when he is with Nikolai. One time I ask Nikolai, is these ornaments gold or silver and he say no. What is it? It is not something you need to know about, he say. Why am I doing this then, and he say for us, for when we live in America. He say I will tell you some other time, just trust me. He is always trying to get to come to America, he says. Paris is no problem, but he wants to come to America. He has a lot of business, so I say O.K., what do I know about this business, especially in Russia, where everything is so much corruption? Besides, also, he treat me very nice, buy me clothes and perfume and everything like that. Sometimes he ask me to fly to Paris just to get his toy soldiers and bring them back here, and most times, I say, O.K., I will do it. Then one time, the last time, last year, he say you must go for me, please you take very big box of toys. I want you to fly from Paris to Montreal and then take train to New York City. They don't search the luggage on the trains. We have a big fight about this, but finally I say O.K. So I fly to Montreal and the box of toys comes out to the luggage carousel and I pick it up, so heavy, and then I stay in hotel in Montreal for two days and go to modeling agency there for meeting and then take the Amtrak train to New York. When you take train into United States, the border agents are very suspicious, but I am ready for them. They ask why am I coming to New York, and I say I am hand model, first I have meeting in Montreal, then have business in Manhattan, New York. Of course I am wearing my gloves on my hands all the time inside the warm train and this is good proof, you know? Also I have portfolio, very professional photographs. But the agent doesn't like this and the dog comes to smell me and the lady agent takes me to a place and does search on me for drugs. But I have no drugs. They call the agency in Manhattan, and they say, Yes, she is coming here for business. So they put me back on the train. And so I get to New York and take cab to my flat and think I am never going to do this again. 
 ''Then I do my work and after that I try to call Nikolai and he does not answer. I try e-mail, and that is no good, either. Maybe a week goes by, and then I am very nervous. Crying too much, even on job. Then I call my agency in Paris, and they say please you must call someone who left message. It is Russian phone number, and this makes me very nervous so I find a pay phone in bus authority station on Eighth Avenue and wear hat and sunglasses and take off gloves and make myself look fat under a big coat and use phone card that I buy just for this and call the number, and a lady answers and says we think you should know that they found Nikolai in a hotel room in Pusan. He was tortured and shot dead. They say he stole something from them. I do not know where is Pusan, it is not in Russia. Then she says, 'There are people who want to talk to you,' and I hang up I am so scared. Then I find out Pusan is a city on the coast of South Korea. Why is Nikolai in South Korea? Who does he know in South Korea? He never say anythings about that. I know I cannot go back to Paris now, but also everyone who knows me knows where I am living, so I move my apartment in the next few days to Mulberry Street, all my clothes and things.''
 ''And the boxes of soldiers and trains, that stuff?''
 ''Yes, all of that I put into four or five boxes. I hired these two boys to move everything for $400.''
 ''And the new apartment on Mulberry Street,'' I asked, ''that was where you met Roger Corbett?''
 ''Yes, he lived downstairs from me, and we became friends, you know. I was very lonely, and I did not trust anyone, and he was very American and showed me pictures of his family and children, and I knew he was safe. I did not tell him too much about myself. But he was sweet. I liked him. He explained lot of things about how America really work and said he can help me find good lawyer who can get me citizenship papers. I asked Roger could I store some of my things in his apartment, and he said fine. I had the key anyway, you know, because we were seeing each other so much.''
 ''So you moved those boxes into his apartment?''
 ''Yes, I put them in his closet in the back, and he did not think about them, and I mostly forgot them.''
 I wasn't sure if I believed that she'd forgotten about them. ''Wait, you're telling me that you smuggled these ornaments into the U.S. at the request of your Russian boyfriend. He wouldn't tell you exactly what they were, though it's clear someone had gone to a great deal of trouble to make them. Then your boyfriend was killed because he stole something, you moved because you were scared, and you hid the boxes in Roger's apartment. And you say you 'forgot' about them? Come on.''
 ''Well, O.K., of course, I am thinking, I know there is somebody in Russia who maybe wants them, but if they find me here they will not find them in my apartment. I am not sure what to do. I do not know who to talk to about them. I don't trust any Russians in this country. And I am thinking let me talk to Roger about it, he is so smart, but he has other problems.''
 ''Like what?''
 ''Like he is finishing divorce, looking for job, all these big things.'' 
 All in all, Eliska's story was pretty good; it had money, sex and violence. I even believed most of it. Whether I believed the right parts was another question.
 ''Let me see your hands,'' I said.
 She pulled them back. ''Why?''
 ''I'm curious.''
 ''Please don't touch them, though.''
 ''Not to worry.''
 Turning toward me on the park bench, she loosened the fingertips on one glove and then the other. She checked to be sure I understood that this was a great intimacy for her, that her hands were not just protected but a forbidden sight, especially outside in the sun. She pulled the gloves off and raised her hands aloft in professional display. They were beautiful and pale, the fingers surprisingly long. And of course, they matched the rest of her -- her long neck and arms, torso and legs. She rotated her hands in space, as if each held an invisible fruit. These were ethereal fingers that touched only luxuries: diamonds, gold, watches, the smooth skin of sports cars that cost more than houses. Her nails were clean and perfect. These were hands that no longer grabbed or pinched or scratched; they suggested immortality and perfection. Having seen them without gloves -- naked, even -- I understood why she kept them covered.
 ''Did Nikolai like your hands?'' I found myself asking.
 ''Of course,'' she said, ''but -- ''
 ''But what?''
 ''But he did not see them very often.'' Eliska paused, smiled to herself. ''Only on special occasions.''
 And with that, perhaps knowing she could change the mood of the conversation, she reached out her right hand and brushed her long fingers ever so softly along my face, down my cheek, and then beguilingly across my lips. ''You see how soft they are.''
 I did, and in that moment I closed my eyes and suddenly knew Roger. These were the fingers that had touched him, given him solace. 
 Eliska saw my response. ''So maybe you help me?'' she asked. 
 That night I watched Detroit beat the Yankees for the second night in a row. A-Rod had gone onto the disabled list with a strained right quadriceps, his first time on the D.L. since 2000. Bad times for my team, five losses in the last seven games, Pettitte looking shaky on the mound, Posada out with a bum shoulder. Like a lot of Yankee fans, I find my mood fluctuates with the fate of the team. And my mood was sour.
 Then again, perhaps I was just trying to avoid thinking about Eliska Sedlacek and her request. My wife reads in bed most nights, and after she'd settled in with this month's thriller of the decade, I slipped into my home office and got onto the Internet. I knew that Pravda, the Russian newspaper, maintained an English-language Web site, and I not-so-casually typed in Nikolai Gamov's name. He seemed worth a Google, anyway -- and, oh, boy, a story appeared, condensed from one originally from The Seoul Herald. It explained that Gamov had been shot eight times and that a gun recovered at the scene was identified as ''a Baikal,'' a make manufactured in Russia. Gamov, the article noted, had been ''suspected of illegal trading practices.''
 I sat back in my chair, a little shocked. The girlfriend of a murdered Russian mobster wanted me to retrieve boxes of items he'd smuggled into America. Should I do it? Maybe not. Was I in real trouble? Maybe yes. n

HEADLINE: The Joy of Graduating

BYLINE: By KATE STONE LOMBARDI

 BODY:
DANIELLE GORMAN was musing about what it takes to secure the No. 1 spot at her highly ranked, competitive high school. 
 ''Valedictorians are the type of people who take on too much and are unwilling to fail,'' she said. 
 She should know. Danielle is this year's valedictorian at Moorestown High School, in Moorestown. She often studied until 2 in the morning. 
 Danielle, 18, took one Advanced Placement class in her sophomore year, five her junior year and four senior year. Why not five? Because her math class, ''Multivariable Calculus and Differential Equations,'' covered material beyond what the A.P. tests measure. 
 On top of her studies, there was mock trial, model congress and the debate team, along with four years on the track team. Oh yes, and there were those relaxing summers, like the one after her sophomore year, when she took a course on international law at Harvard Summer School, while at the same time completing a 50-hour internship with a law firm. 
 Danielle, who will attend M.I.T. this fall, said she chose challenging courses and pushed herself because she wasn't sure what she ultimately wanted to do. She wasn't shocked to find out she had been named valedictorian -- she knew she was one of the three top students -- but tried to keep herself from wanting the honor too intensely.
 ''I really conditioned myself to not want it or expect it,'' Danielle said. ''I take things pretty stoically. It didn't set in for a while, and then I was really happy.''
 Another valedictorian season has come to a close, with students throughout the region having proudly stepped up to the podium to deliver their graduation speeches and receive the accolades that come from being the highest academic performer in their school. 
 But as the path to that honor has intensified over recent years, some administrators are beginning to question the valedictorian tradition. Several factors -- including the increase in the number of high school students, grade inflation, intense competition for college acceptances and a savvier student body -- have changed the game. 
 Some students strategize to win, taking on a heavy load of A.P. courses, which are weighted when grade point averages are calculated. Some avoid more creative courses, like art or photography, where grading can be subjective, and a B could ruin their shot at the top spot. There have been conflicts about how to measure the transcripts of transfer students who come from schools with different grading systems. In a handful of cases, the zeal for valedictorian honors has led to lawsuits. 
 Take Danielle's high school in Moorestown, which landed in the national spotlight five years ago, when a high school senior sued the district in an effort to be named valedictorian. Blair L. Hornstine was awarded $60,000 by the Moorestown School District to settle a federal lawsuit that she filed after the district tried to name a student with a lower grade point average as co-valedictorian.
 Ms. Hornstine had been home-schooled, and her lawyer said she suffered from chronic fatigue syndrome. Critics claimed she manipulated the system, and her lawsuit caused an uproar in the community. Ms. Hornstine was so vilified -- there was even a Web site that chronicled her case called the ''Blair Hornstine Project,'' a play on the film ''The Blair Witch Project'' -- that she skipped her graduation.
 Later that summer, Ms. Hornstine's acceptance to Harvard was withdrawn, after accusations that articles she had written for the local newspaper were plagiarized. She ended up going to St. Andrews University in Scotland, where she graduated in 2006 with a degree in classics.
 Danielle remembers the controversy and has some sympathy for her predecessor. 
 ''I felt really bad for her,'' Danielle said. ''She ended up being valedictorian but losing a lot of other things. I remember everyone said she shouldn't care so much because it ended up hurting her.''
 This year at Horace Greeley High School in Chappaqua, N.Y., Susannah Rudel and Brett Rosenberg are co-valedictorians, and share the honor with apparent grace. Though no one would speak for the record, the stories circulated about contested grade point averages and smothered resentment, yet Susannah and Brett presented a united front, describing how delighted they were that as best ''study buddies'' they would both be honored.
 ''I would have felt terrible if it was just me,'' Susannah, 17, said in an interview that included her co-valedictorian at the school. ''I genuinely don't believe I would have succeeded as much without Brett. I spend hours on the phone going over math problems with her.''
 Brett, 17, said that if she alone had been named, ''it definitely would have been empty in a way, and it wouldn't have been fair because it was such a collaborative relationship.''
 Those words are balm to high school administrators, who had to calculate the top grade point averages to the third decimal point to determine the girls were tied. Nineteen students at Horace Greeley High had perfect 4.0 grade point averages or higher; Susannah and Brett each had a 4.1. 
 Each girl took seven A.P.s in high school. Susannah was captain of the varsity swim team, placed in the state championships, earned her Gold Award from the Girl Scouts and plays the flute. Brett was captain of the cross-country team, captain of the nationally ranked academic challenge team, and plays the bass clarinet. Susannah will attend Amherst College this fall; Brett will go to Harvard. 
 ''The two of them had an exact numerical tie,'' said Andrew Selesnick, the high school principal. ''It's pretty remarkable. You just want to be sure, you don't want to make a mistake.''
 The high school has reason to be cautious. Five years ago, the valedictorian and the salutatorian were named at a cum laude ceremony in the fall. But a week later, the students were called to the principal's office and told a mistake had been made in calculating the grade point averages. A teacher, who traditionally changed final class grades based on students' performance on the A.P. test, had delayed reporting an upgrade. The new grade -- a fraction of a point -- changed the equation for several students in the tight competition at the top of the class. The students were told, based on recalculations, that there would be two valedictorians and two salutatorians. All four students gave speeches. 
 ''I remember thinking it was a little odd,'' said Dan Adler, the originally named valedictorian. ''But I clearly appreciated it when I was given the honor, so for someone else who deserved it not be granted it was a little absurd.''
 When the differences between the top student and the 10th come down to hundredths of a point, some administrators are questioning how meaningful the valedictorian distinction is.
 ''We have had valedictorians and salutatorians when it's less than a hundredth of a point apart,'' said Carol Burris, principal of South Side High School in Rockville Centre, on Long Island. 
 South Side, like many schools in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, has eliminated class ranking on transcripts, because administrators believe a rank reduces students to a number and prefer that colleges take a close look at student transcripts and consider the broader student. Still, they maintain the grade point averages to determine the No. 1 and No. 2 spots. ''Our community has been happy with eliminating ranking, but naming the valedictorian is a strong tradition,'' Dr. Burris said. ''If you're going to have student speakers, it really is an honor and you have to have some objective way of choosing them.'' 
 Given all the drama over the honor, how do valedictorians fare in the long term? Karen D. Arnold, an associate professor of higher education at Boston College, spent more than 15 years studying valedictorians who graduated in 1981 from high schools across Illinois. Dr. Arnold found that high school valedictorians consistently did well in college and were generally well-rounded, successful people. They were not a group, however, who were particularly creative or who would achieve great distinction in life.
 ''They're kind of like wonderful organizational achievers,'' Dr. Arnold said. ''They're hard workers. They're not going to remold your organization, but they might lead it.'' 
 Dr. Arnold said she was familiar with the arguments in favor of eliminating valedictorians but believed the tradition should be maintained. ''There aren't many academic honors, and it is one of those labels that follows you through life, like the Heisman Trophy or Rhodes scholar,'' she said. ''To get rid of the one meaningful designation for what school is really all about seems like something we should do only with great caution.'' 
 Mr. Adler, Horace Greeley's 2003 co-valedictorian, works in management consulting. He graduated last year from Yale, where he found himself in the company of hundreds of other valedictorians. (''I think I dated at least two of them,'' he said.) 
 ''I'm still extremely proud of the honor, but if I were to give someone advice about how to think about it in the right way, it's that you have to think about this as a validation of what you're capable of and keep it in the back of your mind as a motivation,'' he said. ''But you can't be haughty about it, because there are so many people who you are going to meet who are just as smart as you.''

HEADLINE: Tending to a Heroic Past, and to the Cows

BYLINE: By LARY BLOOM

DATELINE: Ashford 

 BODY:
 JAMES KNOWLTON, who was born during the nation's bicentennial year and is a descendant of Revolutionary War heroes, is planning to spend the early hours of July Fourth as he does every other morning. From 7 a.m. to 11 a.m., he will milk the 55 Holsteins he and his father own, because, on a dairy farm, all cows are created equal. Each needs constant tending and, though Mr. Knowlton argues that such creatures are smarter than advertised, none are willing to take holidays off. 
 By late afternoon on Independence Day, before the evening milking -- which Mr. Knowlton's father, Thomas, usually performs -- members of the extended family may assemble for a picnic. But even then, Mr. Knowlton will not be inclined to call to mind the legacy of Lt. Col. Thomas Knowlton or images from the struggle for freedom against the British. Those thoughts are more likely to occur on non-holidays when, for example, he is watching a film like ''The Patriot.'' The screenplay suggests the life and triumphs of Colonel Knowlton, whose brother Daniel was one of James Knowlton's ancestors, a man who also distinguished himself in battle in the French and Indian War and during the Revolution. 
 Nevertheless, Mr. Knowlton understands why in Connecticut's Quiet Corner his family's name resonates in the patriotic air. In other regions, schoolchildren know well the revolutionary roles played by two native sons: the spy Nathan Hale and the turncoat Benedict Arnold. But ask them about Thomas Knowlton and you are likely to draw a blank. This is so even though on field trips to Hartford's Capitol building they pass a large bronze statue that commemorates the Massachusetts native who brought honor to the town he moved to as a boy. In fact, back when James Knowlton was in the fourth grade at Ashford Elementary School, he hadn't yet comprehended the legacy. His grandfather, Royal O. Knowlton, Ashford's longtime town clerk, told tales about the colonel's heroics. But the boy thought it was ''just family stories.''
 He was convinced otherwise by his fourth-grade teacher. When she told her students about the exploits of Colonel Knowlton, eyes turned to the 9-year-old with the startled expression. It was true -- all that stuff. 
 The innovations of Colonel Knowlton are known these days by United States Army Rangers and Central Intelligence Agency employees. It was Knowlton's Rangers, an elite force and a forerunner of the Special Forces, who changed the style of warfare from two armies that faced each other in formal fashion to a fight using tactics of deception. It was Colonel Knowlton who developed the country's first spy agency -- indeed, Nathan Hale worked for him at the time he was captured and executed. 
 It was also Colonel Knowlton who was so brilliantly captured himself -- in art. A famous painting by John Trumbull, ''The Death of General Warren,'' at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, shows Knowlton's six-foot frame looming above others at Bunker Hill, where he fiercely held on to key ground. 
 When George Washington was told of his death at the age of 36 in the Battle of Harlem Heights, the general said, ''The gallant and brave Colonel Knowlton ... would have been an honor to any country... .'' To the commander of the Continental Army, this was the biggest loss from his officer corps.
 The revelations about his family's heroes are what accounts for what Mr. Knowlton now calls his ''sickness.'' He is a sucker for anything old. When he is watching period films, for example, he pays more attention to the settings than plots, looking for architectural details and for the way things used to be. ''Being the descendant of the family probably shaped me,'' he said. 
 Though he has not yet read David McCullough's masterly work, ''1776,'' in which Colonel Knowlton's raids on the British are described in glowing terms, Mr. Knowlton possesses an older volume that offers more detail. ''I'll show you something,'' he said, ''that I don't think my father has ever seen.'' We walked to the farm's tool shed. There on a bench was a ragged copy of the historian Bruce Bliven Jr.'s 1955 book, ''Battle For Manhattan.'' Bliven described Colonel Knowlton's performance in a combat zone that later became the setting of Columbia University.
 The trouble with Mr. Knowlton's copy is that some pages are stuck together, including the section that documents the hero's death. As Mr. Knowlton explained, ''My grandfather used to take this book to the outhouse, and keep it there for a long time.'' The outhouse, alas, had no weather-stripping.
 Mr. Knowlton admits he is hard-pressed to feel exultation on the Fourth of July. ''The Knowltons fought for freedom and high ideals,'' he said. ''I'm not happy with the direction of our country today.'' He mentioned the emphasis on war, the decay of the environment, the struggling economy. ''Our country,'' he said, ''is beginning to look like the England we defeated.''
 Even so, he feels a duty as a member of a prominent family to carry on the Knowlton line. At 32, he has no children yet. Divorced, he now lives with Beth Royer, who teaches plant science in Killingly. When he does have children, he says, he will teach them about their locally famous ancestors -- and the values for which they so boldly fought.

HEADLINE: Selected Speeches by Valedictorians From Around New Jersey

 BODY:
Here are some of the speeches written by this June's valedictorians from high schools around New Jersey.
 Absegami High School
 Andrew Choi
 Age: 18
 Attending: Princeton University
 Dr. Pfeffer, Dr. Gatto, members of the administration, faculty, proud parents, and above all, my fellow graduates, I guess I should start by encouraging you to reach for the stars, follow your dreams, find your passion and to seize the day, but... I'm not going to. These words of advice have been echoed throughout our lives and on such a day as this, I'd hate to be part of that echo. We've all heard it before and if you haven't... you probably aren't even listening to me now. I just find it interesting when people tell me to follow my dreams as if I would purposely avoid my dreams or just happen to misplace them somewhere. 
 Anyway, I'd like to make something very clear. I'm up here speaking before you because I did well on a few tests and quizzes. Maybe I ate the most nutritious breakfasts. Or maybe I was drinking the strongest blend of coffee. Whatever the case may be, like many of you, I'm 18 years old. What deep insight into life could I possibly offer that one of you could not? At this point in my life I don't know what my dreams are or maybe I just misplaced them. I don't know what my passion is or maybe I just misplaced that too. I have no idea what the upcoming year has in store for me. I also have no idea whether high school was the best or the worst years of my life. I just don't have that kind of perspective yet. 
 It may seem ironic that I come before you with so much I don't know. Well, in an effort to not completely disappoint my teachers, I'll tell you what I do know. I know that waking up at 6 a.m. every morning is not fun. I know that trying to finish lunch within our 10 second lunch periods is nearly impossible. I know that getting signed out at 12:30 is always a welcomed surprise. I know that many people failed to learn any hallway walking etiquette during high school. I know that waiting to the last minute is never a good strategy, but it has often been my only strategy. I know that high school wasn't always roses, but I wouldn't be who I am today without it. I also know that both my loving parents and my supportive sister are in attendance this evening to see me graduate. I know that many of my friends who are currently sitting patiently with their caps and gowns on are thinking about how stupid I sound right now. Thanks for putting up with me all those years guys! I also know that life is not always filled with sunshine and I won't pretend that it is. Sometimes it can be overwhelmingly painful. Sometimes it may seem as if the stormy weather is here to stay. 
 I'm here to tell you that it's not. How do I know this? Because each and every one of us wearing these caps with these really annoying tassels are gathered here this evening. Forget about our bright futures for now. Forget about all the plans you have in the upcoming months. Forget about how we're going to ''change the world'' or how we are the ''leaders of tomorrow''. We've spent our entire lives talking about it and being told about it. At present, we are here. We are here, along with our parents, our grandparents, relatives, our brothers, our sisters, our pets even, on this field to conclude our high school careers. Look around at your loved ones. There are over 6.7 billion people in the world at this very instant. To have even just one of those people care about you and love you enough to be here this evening is truly special. My only hope is that you appreciate the significance of their love for you tonight.
 You will inevitably change. Your goals and aspirations will change. Where you live will change. Your job may change. Your favorite color, food, car you drive may unfortunately change. However, the unconditional love these special individuals have for you will be forever unwavering. Sometime this evening let your mother, your father, sister, brother, cousin, neighbor, mentor, teacher, relative and even your pet cat Angel know that you appreciate them and everything they do. That is all I ask and that is the only certainty I am able to share with you at this point in my life. These are the people that make waking up at 6 a.m. every morning a bit easier. These are the people that make the burdens of life feel a bit lighter. Thank them, enjoy their company tonight and please do not look past the present. 
 To my parents, my sister, to my friends who've always been there, to my teachers who made the extra effort, to everyone that have supported me throughout my 18 years, I thank you. Class of 2008, I sincerely wish you the best of luck. I know you are eager to move on to the next stage of your life and that is great, but I urge you to never take the present and those you have around you for granted. Now if anyone knows where I may have placed my dreams, I will be attending Project Graduation tonight. Back to the purpose of my speech this evening: farewell.

 Bloomfield High School

 Mayor McCarthy, members of the Town Council and the Board of Education, Mr. Digesere, Dr. Cirasella, Mr. Jennings, administrators, faculty, staff, graduates of the class of 2008, students, family, and friends. Good Evening!
 We stand here today as soon-to-be graduates of Bloomfield High School. Personally, I see graduation as an unusual thing. Consider the ceremony briefly as an outsider; perhaps the most striking element would be our costumes -- because, let's face it, they are costumes compared to our normal dress. Also unusual is the level of formality; this certainly doesn't exist in our everyday lives as students.
 Still, an outsider would most likely cite as unusual the great reverence and seriousness with which we regard graduation. Take a quick look around, because you probably haven't moved your neck in the past five minutes. Seriously. It's quite a sight: everyone sitting so properly. Maybe this is because graduation means more to us than a formal recognition of education -- it has actually become a sort of rite of passage. 
 Even then, the most important element of this ceremony is our expectations, as individuals and collectively. We have spent much time pondering this moment, and more valuably, its ramifications. These expectations have morphed us -- from unsure freshmen into more confident, more educated, unsure seniors. I don't know anyone who is completely certain of their future -- and that's O.K.! Uncertainty is not a looming monster waiting to devour us, but instead the embodiment of opportunity. We are defined by what we gain of this uncertainty through the choices we make and the attitude with which we confront it.
 As we enter the world for the first time as high school graduates, we should be careful to maintain a critical, and yet positive outlook. Life is not a merciless set of crises or tribulations, but rather a wonderful panoply of choice and opportunity. We are not merely a product of our choices, but also of the mark we leave on others.
 Through graduation, we have taken our first steps out of uncertainty and into the world. Though some of us may peer farther into our futures than others, none can claim to know the path ahead. My advice to everyone is to take the path you want in life. Don't simply work to avoid the difficult hills ahead, but instead, move toward your goals. Be wary of fallen branches but never let this watch stop you from pausing along the way to appreciate the patches of bright yellow tulips. We manufacture life by living. Though our paths fade into the distance, we must never lose sight of the beauty all around us as we progress onward, seeing beauty in the little things which define us: our dreams, our friendships, family, integrity, love, passion, and hope. Thank you.''

 Simply Unforgettable
 Up to this day in our lives, we have always seen graduation as a dream, this misty far off event that is supposedly going to happen to us but never seems like a reality. As you can see, however, it happened. We have on our caps and gowns, our parents are doing their best to hold back the tears, and we are all thinking about the parties we will go to after we throw our caps into the air.
 Reflecting on what I would say today, I somehow came up with thunderstorms. As some of you may know, I have a terrible fear of thunderstorms. It is actually a pretty funny sight to see, I am eighteen years old but once the storm clouds begin to draw near and the rumbling begins I tense up and become very agitated. If I am driving, both hands are clenched on the wheel, I am sitting up straight, and I find myself reassuring my nervous passengers that I can and will get them home safely. For the record, I always do . . .
 But at the same time, I am awestruck. I will never forget flying home from Florida with my family and looking out my window to watch the huge but distant lighting bolt streak through the cloud in a sky of red and pink. The sheer power and the way the bolt lit up the night sky was breathtaking. All I could do was marvel at the scene outside the tiny airplane window as the storm began to unfold.
 It is really astonishing; the fact that something like a thunderstorm could inspire such different emotions. I become fearful at the sight of a thunderstorm, but at the same time I am amazed by its power and beauty.
 Next year, the Class of 2008 will be separated for the first time. Some are going to college, others to work, and a few to serve in the military. Whatever it is we are planning, I think we are all at least a little scared. We are, on this day, ending the chapter that has dominated our existence. We are about to start something completely new. And soon after that the so called ''real world'' will be waiting. I will admit to having times where I am fearful about this new chapter, what could turn out to be an approaching thunderstorm. And yet, in those exact same moments, I am filled with awe of the potential lightning bolts. I am excited about what may come, what God has planned for me.
 The rumbling is starting, the clouds are gathering and we do have some fears. But even more than this, the Class of 2008 is excited for what is to come. We are excited to fulfill our potential, to chase after our dreams, and to learn from our mistakes along the way. This crazy, fun loving grade is excited and ready to live life to the fullest.
 Of course, one cannot talk about thunderstorms and lighting without talking about the famous finale. A rainbow, this beautiful promise, always comes through in the end. The clouds always clear and this stunning arch of color and light always appears. The future could be very much like a thunderstorm with its uncertainty and also its awe, but the remarkable thing is that whatever happens there is always a clearing in the end. In the future, we all have the ability to become a better person than before. And whatever we do in the years to come, wherever life leads us, we must allow these times in our lives to show us how to live every situation to the fullest. We must face every challenge and learn from plenty of mistakes. We must have a passion for what we do, whether it is big or small. We must wake up each morning without regret and with the conviction and drive required to truly live a life of success.
 This day would not be complete without thanking the people who have done their best to guide us towards that success. Thank you teachers and administrators for putting up with us. I suppose we served as a part of your thunderstorm, but we know you loved us all along. Thank you, of course, to our parents who have looked to us as their rainbows. And lastly thank you to my classmates who have done their part to help me through a storm or two over the years.
 I do not know what my future holds. I do not know what my classmates will find in their own, but I do know that we will learn much over the coming years. We may run into a storm or two, but we must look at the beauty of it. It is okay to have fear, this is a part of life. It is a wonderful feeling to be filled with awe, for this wipes out fear. Just be sure to soak in that rainbow in the end. Life is what you make of it, so go, and make it simply unforgettable.

 Good evening Mr. McWilliam, Dr. Brander, parents, friends, family, teachers, and administrators. On behalf of the Class of 2008 we extend our gratitude and appreciation to each and every one of you. To our friends who shared our laughter as well as our tears, and our joys along with the disappointments. To the parents and family who guided us through the past 18 years, the love that you shared, the advice you gave, and the sacrifices you made may seem to have gone unnoticed. Please realize that as we look back we know everything you said and did was out of love, and words can not express how thankful we truly are. And finally to our teachers, for the guidance, support, and knowledge you shared, going beyond books and academics you were our coaches, advisors, mentors, and friends. 
 To the class of 2008, congratulations! Our hard work has finally paid off, and we have successfully completed our high school career. I'm sure looking back, all of us would agree that our lives are significantly changed from freshman year, the first time we stepped off the bus, and entered the halls of West was such a long time ago.. But what caused this change, was it the people we met, the experiences we shared or the lessons we learned? Regardless, sometime over the past four years a transformation has occurred within each and every one of us. But are you settled on this transformation... are you willing to stay this way for the rest of your life or do you wish to make an impact on the world, start a family of your own, take a risk, or further your education. Can the amount of time needed to make a difference or change our lives ever truly be measured? Could it have been our four years of high school? One summer? A month, a week, or even a single day? Is it possible to change your life with one decision, one act of kindness, or simple determination in the pursuit of a dream? 
 I believe that it is the small acts of kindness, the choices we make, and the passion with which we live that have the ability to change our lives. With a single conscious act we can make a difference. It is important that we stay focused and work towards a dream. The passion which you have will allow you the drive and inspiration to attain your goal. NEVER allow your passion to fade. Stay strong and always believe in the possibility of your dreams. 
 Ayn Rand once wrote:
 ''Do not let your fire go out, spark by irreplaceable spark, in the hopeless swamps of the approximate, the not-quite, the not-yet, the not-at-all. Do not let the hero in your soul perish, in lonely frustration for the life you deserved, but have never been able to reach. Check your road and the nature of your battle. The world you desired can be won. It exists, it is real, it is possible, it is yours.'' 
 Life will not always be easy, and obstacles will come between us and our dreams. But we must never give up! Learn from your mistakes and never let defeat or frustration extinguish the fire and passion within your soul. No matter how impossible or unattainable the life you long for may seem it lies within your reach, all you have to do is believe. 
 Our generation is blessed with endless possibilities, and our future awaits us with every door open and every opportunity within our reach. The future is now...we can't wait for someone else, we can't wait for tomorrow, and we can't wait for a better, perhaps less busy time in our lives. Today is the day to make a difference, today is the day we make this world a better place ... live each day to the fullest, love with all your heart, and never put a limit on the possibilities of your dreams. 
 I realize that today is the day we have all been waiting for, we're off to do great things, and listening to this speech is extremely insignificant in the great scheme of tonight, but if you take one thing away from tonight I hope that it's this: The life you have longed for is within your reach, and what you have always desired can be won.
 I'm asking you to make a wish, now ... place it deep within your heart ... dream big and realize that what you wish for is possible, and can be achieved. ''Do not let your fire go out, spark by irreplaceable spark. Do not let the hero in your soul perish, in lonely frustration for the life you deserved, but have never been able to reach.'' Believe in yourself, and the beauty of your dreams.
 The world you desire can be won. It exists, it is real, it is possible, it is yours!

 Hawthorne High School
 Dana Corasaniti
 Age: 18
 Attending: The University of DelawareRobert Frost wrote a poem to illustrate his belief that innocence, beauty, and success fades away with time. It briefly reads, ''Nature's first green is gold. Her hardest hue to hold. Her early leaf's a flower, but only so an hour. Then leaf subsides to leaf. So Eden sank to grief. So dawn goes down today, nothing gold can stay.'' He would agree that our graduation exemplifies his poem, as the sun sets tonight so does our time and happy memories at Hawthorne High School.
 My point of view, however, is different. Robert Frost would say every day is followed by night, but I prefer the expression every winter is followed by summer. In reference to his poem, I believe gold is never gone. Frost speaks of an impermanent paradise; however, the gold that he is referring to, in my opinion, is not a place; it's a feeling and a quality that every senior here tonight possesses. We are the paradise. Within all of us is the golden characteristic, one of inspiration and motivation to succeed, and this has been clearly displayed through our four years here at Hawthorne High School. We have won titles in every sport season, achieved high honors in academics, and become a socially unified class, but this is only the beginning. As we step off the field tonight and begin a new chapter in our lives, we will continue performing honorable deeds, achieving our goals, and being wonderful individuals. This gold we have within us, the passion to achieve, to learn, and to do better, defines our class. We have influenced those around us, I believe -- faculty, students, and parents -- because we are unique. I've seen it when we laugh together in the hallways, cheer as one in the BearCave, and lead in sports and clubs. There is an unexplainable quality that we possess that elicits pride, leadership, and friendship.
 We will never forget these four years that have gone by rather quickly; however, we are not the class who will sit around talking about the glory days because every day in our future will be a glorious day. We have the drive, determination, and ambition that will shape our bright futures. Some of us will become doctors, firefighters, loving parents, teachers and congressmen; we will exceed all expectations.
 One of my middle school teachers once told me two words of advice that I have lived by ever since; in reference to Frost's poem, Mr. Kenny told me to ''Stay Gold.'' This saying has been the catalyst to my success as a person, student and athlete. Throughout my high school years, I have aimed to maintain his advice by staying true to my self and my peers, working hard, and being the best person I can be, as cliche as that may sound. As I leave the town of Hawthorne in the fall, I will continue to follow this advice as I journey to college. I would like to pass on to the Class of 2008 these words which have had a profound influence on my character development.
 Seniors, wherever your path might take you in the future, whatever obstacles and hardships you may face, stay gold. Follow your heart and continue shining your light on others. Also, Stay Blue and White. Remember the memories we have shared in the halls, on the field, and in the classrooms. Remember the values and lessons that have been instilled in us by parents, teachers, and friends. And remember, no matter what path in life you choose, no matter where it may take you, and no matter the time you spend away, you will always be-- a Hawthorne bear!

 We Must React.
 We are a generation of progress, promise and problems. Although the first two I am glad to be a part of, I do not believe that we can in any measure take credit for the last. I apologize, I have begun my speech on an unhappy note already, and I have not even rightly greeted and thanked everyone gathered here today. Greetings. Thank you, all of you, whether teacher, parent, alumni, student, friend, family member or administration, for attending our graduation. It is an important moment in our collective existence and it is wonderful of you to show your support.
 Our class, our generation, has been saddled with a number of problems which are not our own. Our climate is changing, degrading into something that has never been seen on our planet as far back as we can measure. There are dangerous holes in the ozone layer which will continue to expand, despite the ban of chemicals which originally caused them. The American economy has begun a perilous slip into a recession, even a depression, and the country itself has lost much of the international respect that it had garnered over the past two and a quarter centuries. But perhaps worst of all, our country is falling behind technologically and educationally, and in many ways we are losing the advantage we once held in these fields of progress. Despite the mournful tone that it imparts to my speech, I am not at all sorry for bringing up the problems mentioned above, because they need to be discussed. Although they are diverse and different issues, they are nevertheless alike in one respect. They are all, in a sense, a violation of the Native American proverb ''We do not inherit the earth from our ancestors; we borrow it from our children.'' In a sense, the generations before us, who are the origin of these problems, have defaulted, like so many Americans as of late, on their loan to us. Like it or not, nearly each and every member of this audience has been part and parcel, by their action or their inaction, to the bringing of these problems.
 They are, perhaps, unfairly, likely to be the subjects for which your generation is most remembered, and unfortunately they are now our issues, to change or to neglect. Because this, more than anything else, is what each subsequent generation promises, that is to say, a chance for change.
 Not only does each generation bring change to our world, but they also bring change to themselves. So much of the latter has already occurred among us. Consider this. If one examined our class, you would have watched us become Eagle Scouts, club presidents, peer mediators, congressional award medalists, the list stretches on endlessly. These changes are, by far, some of the happiest things that I have observed in my high school experience. But there is nothing sadder than watching your friends and classmates, in the words of Thomas Leary, ''Turn on, tune in, and drop out'' and far too much of that has happened, in our class and others. We have to stop it.
 Again, I am sorry. I do not mean to preach, or sound idealistic. I know that these problems are not small, and that none of us, not even all of us, can stop these problems. They are national, global issues that will affect the entire population of the world for years to come. But that does not mean we cannot work at them, change them. We just have to see the problems for what they are: obstacles to be approached, handled, and surmounted.
 It's enough just to address the problems, to react. When science tells us our climate is changing and we are at fault, we should react. When unstudied educational reforms threaten to dilute our children's education, we should react. And when the government misleads us, we should react. We cannot afford to sit idle and ignorant. More than anything else, our generation needs to be decisive and informed, because these are the qualities necessary for our future to have any hope.
 To borrow a phrase from a speaker far more able than I, ''A change is coming'', and it is coming with our generation. There is no group more suited to it than us. After all, we are young, we are hopeful, and now, with graduation, we are free. What more could you need?

 Good evening, faculty, guests and my fellow students. I would like to begin by thanking everyone who has made this day possible. Family, friends, and faculty--and even the students themselves--you have given much to make our graduation from high school a reality.
 On a more personal note, I would like to thank my parents, grandparents, siblings, and friends for making me the person I am today. More specifically, I would like to thank my mom for the ideas that inspired this speech. 
 My thoughts tonight deal with the past, present and future: You are not unique. Without you even realizing it, this notion has been subtly pounded into your head ever since you were a young child. When you cried, when you laughed, when you sat sullen and silent: you were not alone. Surely you noticed that you were not the only kid to show your emotions in these ways. You began to develop ''sympathy'' and ''empathy''--you began to be able to feel other's pains and joys and share in them. Although we are not unique, our connection to other members of our species is something uniquely human.
 Every emotion you have ever felt has been felt millions of times before. Each of your experiences, however personal or modern they may seem, has been shared by ancestors who lived centuries ago. Although you may make new discoveries, inventions, and works of art or literature, you will never create a new emotion. 
 What, then, makes each human life worthwhile? Why, then, am I about to ask you, my fellow (graduating) seniors to exit Moorestown High School with passion, determination, and hope? 
 Because I believe that we can make a difference, just as so many generations of youth have believed and done before us. We have hopes. We have high hopes that we can impact the world in enormously positive ways. And more than just hope, we have evidence that we can fulfill our wish to improve the lives of others. We have listened to bright, young children speak lovingly of books read, we have cleaned up the environment of Moorestown, and we have adopted former strangers as our Little Sisters and Little Brothers. We have helped starving children, given aid to regions plagued by genocide, and contributed to the fight to end modern-day slavery. We have given tens of thousands of hours of our time not only to our small town, but also to our large world. We have reached our small hands out into the community with the goal of pulling ourselves closer to one another. 
 Why do we do this? We do this because we are not unique. We are so similar to one another that when strangers cry out in pain and hunger, we not only see their pain--but experience their pain. We are so similar to one another that when we give to others, we not only see the relief it grants--but feel the relief it grants. We reach out to one another to create meaning within our own lives. We are no greater than the sum of the people we love and influence. The meaning of our lives must exist within our shared humanity. 
 When we walk off this field, we will file one after another in neat and orderly rows. As is natural for humans, we will gather into clumps of family, friends, and teachers: both sobbing and smiling. Tonight is one of those most precious moments where you realize how much love is felt for you. I encourage you to embrace that feeling of connection and to carry it with you into the future. Open yourself up to the new friendships, experiences, and opportunities that you will encounter in the coming years. I am confident that you are capable of this, and I am sure that the results will not disappoint you.
 Thank you.

 While we are definitely graduating with our X high school credits, at least 20 in English, 15 in science and even 15 in mathematics, there are some things we are graduating with that I've experienced and understood and have found to be far more important than mere academic knowledge...we are graduating with hope, spirit, and guidance.
 We are graduating with hope. Tomorrow we will be done with these last four years, but NBTHS wasn't a prison to our dreams, it was a guide to greater aspirations and better goals. The future holds a lot in store for us, and believe it or not, we will all recall the valuable lessons of North Brunswick High School as we proceed through college and our careers.
 We are graduating with spirit. Do you remember freshman year, searching for your classrooms, getting help from teachers and upperclassmen? Occasionally somebody would tell you to go to the 3rd floor, but other than that NBTHS is a place proud of its own. The pep rallies, chanting, screaming, singing ... all for our class, the class of 2008.
 We are graduating with guidance. Thank your teachers, I know I will. They are better than books, because a teacher can be your friend. Be thankful for their service, they really don't get paid enough. Visit them after high school, nothing will please them more to see our success from their teachings. Thank you teachers, for instilling knowledge in us, for not writing us up maybe that one late, and for always believing in our best qualities.
 Lastly, here is my advice to you, some tips for the future from what I have learned at NBTHS...
 Listen to your teachers, they often know what they are talking about.
 Give people compliments, they will always help you later.
 Speak clearly with conviction, then you can't be wrong.
 Eat your vegetables. Ramen noodles won't get you through college.
 Dance, sing, write, be creative, your soul is the master artist.
 When in doubt, make a joke...but make sure it's a good joke.
 Read a bestseller, everyone needs to escape from time to time.
 Make new friends, but don't lose your old ones. They have been through the most with you.
 Travel when you get a chance. The world has a lot to offer.
 Don't be reckless with someone else's feelings. Don't let others be reckless with yours.
 Learn how to juggle. Its fun, but really ... try to learn something unique.
 Don't forget where you came from, North Brunswick will always be home, it will always be your community.
 Don't forget where you graduated from, NBTHS will always be your high school. The new carpets, school wing, auditorium is part of our legacy at NBTHS.
 Most important, don't forget that we are the best class, the class of 2008.
 Thank you, good luck to you all, OH-EIGHT!

HEADLINE: The Joy of Graduating The Frenzied Battle to Be valedictorian Is Giving Some Administrators Pause

BYLINE: By KATE STONE LOMBARDI

 BODY:
DANIELLE GORMAN was musing about what it takes to secure the No. 1 spot at her highly ranked, competitive high school. 
 ''Valedictorians are the type of people who take on too much and are unwilling to fail,'' she said. 
 She should know. Danielle is this year's valedictorian at Moorestown High School, in Moorestown, N.J. She often studied until 2 in the morning. 
 Danielle, 18, took one Advanced Placement class in her sophomore year, five her junior year and four senior year. Why not five? Because her math class, ''Multivariable Calculus and Differential Equations,'' covered material beyond what the A.P. tests measure. 
 On top of her studies, there was mock trial, model congress and the debate team, along with four years on the track team. Oh yes, and there were those relaxing summers, like the one after her sophomore year, when she took a course on international law at Harvard Summer School, while at the same time completing a 50-hour internship with a law firm. 
 Danielle, who will attend M.I.T. this fall, said she chose challenging courses and pushed herself because she wasn't sure what she ultimately wanted to do. She wasn't shocked to find out she had been named valedictorian -- she knew she was one of the three top students -- but tried to keep herself from wanting the honor too intensely.
 ''I really conditioned myself to not want it or expect it,'' Danielle said. ''I take things pretty stoically. It didn't set in for a while, and then I was really happy.''
 Another valedictorian season has come to a close, with students throughout the region having proudly stepped up to the podium to deliver their graduation speeches and receive the accolades that come from being the highest academic performer in their school. 
 But as the path to that honor has intensified over recent years, some administrators are beginning to question the valedictorian tradition. Several factors -- including the increase in the number of high school students, grade inflation, intense competition for college acceptances and a savvier student body -- have changed the game. 
 Some students strategize to win, taking on a heavy load of A.P. courses, which are weighted when grade point averages are calculated. Some avoid more creative courses, like art or photography, where grading can be subjective, and a B could ruin their shot at the top spot. There have been conflicts about how to measure the transcripts of transfer students who come from schools with different grading systems. In a handful of cases, the zeal for valedictorian honors has led to lawsuits. 
 Take Danielle's high school in Moorestown, which landed in the national spotlight five years ago, when a high school senior sued the district in an effort to be named valedictorian. Blair L. Hornstine was awarded $60,000 by the Moorestown School District to settle a federal lawsuit that she filed after the district tried to name a student with a lower grade point average as co-valedictorian.
 Ms. Hornstine had been home-schooled, and her lawyer said she suffered from chronic fatigue syndrome. Critics claimed she manipulated the system, and her lawsuit caused an uproar in the community. Ms. Hornstine was so vilified -- there was even a Web site that chronicled her case called the ''Blair Hornstine Project,'' a play on the film ''The Blair Witch Project'' -- that she skipped her graduation.
 Later that summer, Ms. Hornstine's acceptance to Harvard was withdrawn, after accusations that articles she had written for the local newspaper were plagiarized. She ended up going to St. Andrews University in Scotland, where she graduated in 2006 with a degree in classics.
 Danielle remembers the controversy and has some sympathy for her predecessor. 
 ''I felt really bad for her,'' Danielle said. ''She ended up being valedictorian but losing a lot of other things. I remember everyone said she shouldn't care so much because it ended up hurting her.''
 This year at Horace Greeley High School in Chappaqua, N.Y., Susannah Rudel and Brett Rosenberg are co-valedictorians, and share the honor with apparent grace. Though no one would speak for the record, the stories circulated about contested grade point averages and smothered resentment, yet Susannah and Brett presented a united front, describing how delighted they were that as best ''study buddies'' they would both be honored.
 ''I would have felt terrible if it was just me,'' Susannah, 17, said in an interview that included her co-valedictorian at the school. ''I genuinely don't believe I would have succeeded as much without Brett. I spend hours on the phone going over math problems with her.''
 Brett, 17, said that if she alone had been named, ''it definitely would have been empty in a way, and it wouldn't have been fair because it was such a collaborative relationship.''
 Those words are balm to high school administrators, who had to calculate the top grade point averages to the third decimal point to determine the girls were tied. Nineteen students at Horace Greeley High had perfect 4.0 grade point averages or higher; Susannah and Brett each had a 4.1. 
 Each girl took seven A.P.s in high school. Susannah was captain of the varsity swim team, placed in the state championships, earned her Gold Award from the Girl Scouts and plays the flute. Brett was captain of the cross-country team, captain of the nationally ranked academic challenge team, and plays the bass clarinet. Susannah will attend Amherst College this fall; Brett will go to Harvard. 
 ''The two of them had an exact numerical tie,'' said Andrew Selesnick, the high school principal. ''It's pretty remarkable. You just want to be sure, you don't want to make a mistake.''
 The high school has reason to be cautious. Five years ago, the valedictorian and the salutatorian were named at a cum laude ceremony in the fall. But a week later, the students were called to the principal's office and told a mistake had been made in calculating the grade point averages. A teacher, who traditionally changed final class grades based on students' performance on the A.P. test, had delayed reporting an upgrade. The new grade -- a fraction of a point -- changed the equation for several students in the tight competition at the top of the class. The students were told, based on recalculations, that there would be two valedictorians and two salutatorians. All four students gave speeches. 
 ''I remember thinking it was a little odd,'' said Dan Adler, the originally named valedictorian. ''But I clearly appreciated it when I was given the honor, so for someone else who deserved it not be granted it was a little absurd.''
 When the differences between the top student and the 10th come down to hundredths of a point, some administrators are questioning how meaningful the valedictorian distinction is.
 ''We have had valedictorians and salutatorians when it's less than a hundredth of a point apart,'' said Carol Burris, principal of South Side High School in Rockville Centre. 
 South Side, like many schools in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, has eliminated class ranking on transcripts, because administrators believe a rank reduces students to a number and prefer that colleges take a close look at student transcripts and consider the broader student. Still, they maintain the grade point averages to determine the No. 1 and No. 2 spots. ''Our community has been happy with eliminating ranking, but naming the valedictorian is a strong tradition,'' Dr. Burris said. ''If you're going to have student speakers, it really is an honor and you have to have some objective way of choosing them.'' 
 Given all the drama over the honor, how do valedictorians fare in the long term? Karen D. Arnold, an associate professor of higher education at Boston College, spent more than 15 years studying valedictorians who graduated in 1981 from high schools across Illinois. Dr. Arnold found that high school valedictorians consistently did well in college and were generally well-rounded, successful people. They were not a group, however, who were particularly creative or who would achieve great distinction in life.
 ''They're kind of like wonderful organizational achievers,'' Dr. Arnold said. ''They're hard workers. They're not going to remold your organization, but they might lead it.'' 
 Dr. Arnold said she was familiar with the arguments in favor of eliminating valedictorians but believed the tradition should be maintained. ''There aren't many academic honors, and it is one of those labels that follows you through life, like the Heisman Trophy or Rhodes scholar,'' she said. ''To get rid of the one meaningful designation for what school is really all about seems like something we should do only with great caution.'' 
 Mr. Adler, Horace Greeley's 2003 co-valedictorian, works in management consulting. He graduated last year from Yale, where he found himself in the company of hundreds of other valedictorians. (''I think I dated at least two of them,'' he said.) 
 ''I'm still extremely proud of the honor, but if I were to give someone advice about how to think about it in the right way, it's that you have to think about this as a validation of what you're capable of and keep it in the back of your mind as a motivation,'' he said. ''But you can't be haughty about it, because there are so many people who you are going to meet who are just as smart as you.''

HEADLINE: In Hamptons, a Recipe For Prize-Winning Beaches

BYLINE: By ROBIN FINN. 
E-mail: theisland@nytimes.com

DATELINE: Southampton 

 BODY:
 LEAVE it to the Hamptons to furnish the level of tender loving care necessary to grant celebrity status to not just one but two of its ocean beaches. 
 Take oft-raked sand the consistency of granulated sugar, a steady drumbeat of clean waves (an ingredient requiring input from eco-conscious politicians), pristine pavilions where the food is edible and the restrooms aren't contagious. Add scads of pretty folks in designer swimwear, pricey parking passes to discourage the riffraff and well-policed parking lots where Lamborghinis and Lexuses feel secure. 
 And presto, it's a winning formula. Twice. 
 Coopers Beach in Southampton and Main Beach in East Hampton both landed on the America's Best Beaches 2008 list tabulated by Stephen P. Leatherman of Florida International University, a coastal research expert who does not mind being called Dr. Beach. The name was his idea; as for the list, he has compiled and marketed it since 1991, so he and it presumably qualify as a bit of a brand. Not bad for a fellow from landlocked Charlotte, N.C., where the only award-winning moisture occurs in the form of humidity; he is now based in Coral Gables, Fla.
 Mr. Leatherman is also a good sport about being ribbed for being a consummate scam artist (in addition to expenses-paid visits to the Hamptons every six weeks or so, he does his best work in Hawaii, on the Florida coast and in North Carolina's Outer Banks). The scam theory achieves an aura of irrefutability once he reveals that his newest project is a film that follows him around the planet as he searches for the world's most wonderful beach. Filming could take forever. 
 Anyway, what a relief for the Hamptons, in this economically eroded season -- erosion being injurious to beaches in more ways than one -- to hang on to its most cherished status symbols. Coopers was ranked fourth, down a notch from last year (more local indignation on that distressing development later), and Main moved up a slot to sixth. 
 Cue those seasonal cash registers. According to Southampton's deputy village clerk, Eileen Musarra, who says she is known around Village Hall as ''the sticker Nazi'' (no freebies for nonvillage residents; sticker thieves face prosecution), Coopers generated almost $220,000 last year from day-tripper parking passes, $30,000 for its concessions contract and $37,000 from chair and umbrella rentals, and was a major draw in the overall $287,000 spent on season passes. Sadly, Ms. Musarra finds Coopers, which accommodates more than 300 cars, ''still beautiful but too crowded.'' She's picky. 
 The reappearance of Coopers (third consecutive year) and Main (sixth time) in the top 10 was marked by a soggy news conference Monday at Coopers, where, the day being misty and nonbeachy, politicians in suits outnumbered vacationers in bathing suits. A member of the Southampton Town Board showed up barefoot. Nice touch. 
 Everybody except Representative Timothy H. Bishop, whose day job keeps him indoors in Washington, wore a nice tan. Mr. Bishop, speaking from a portable wooden podium plopped in the sand like a beach umbrella, organized the conference to pump up support for his Beach Protection Act, which would require the federal government to supply $40 million for enhanced and expeditious water-quality testing and public notification standards nationwide. It passed in the House of Representatives in April and needs Senate approval before it can be presented to President Bush.
 Mr. Bishop, a Southampton resident, said that the beachgoing public deserves to swim in water that ''will not cause an adverse health impact'' and noted that coastal areas yield 85 percent of United States tourism dollars. As far as the slippage of his hometown beach to fourth from third place on the roster, he said, ''I would like to know what the other three are.'' (Caladesi Island State Park in Florida; Hanalei Beach in Kauai, Hawaii; and Siesta Beach in Sarasota, Fla., in that order.) Mr. Leatherman customarily retires the winner from contention. He said that Coopers had not ''gone down'' in quality but that a couple of other beaches had gone up. 
 Mr. Leatherman has deviated only once from selecting a beach in Hawaii or Florida for the top honor: Last year, Ocracoke Island in the Outer Banks got the nod. ''Let's face it, the color of the water is more beautiful in Hawaii and Florida, and the sand is softer and whiter,'' he said. He also said that Coopers (he applauds its accessibility and parking facilities) and Main (he says its dunes give it the aesthetic edge in the local competition) may not be doomed to being also-rans forever. Thank the lifeguard squads.
 ''Based on the fact of 100 people drowning last year at our beaches, mostly due to riptides, I'm tightening up next year in the safety categories: if your beach doesn't have a lifeguard, it doesn't make the list, no matter how beautiful it is,'' Mr. Leatherman warned. ''That's going to cause carnage in Florida and California and maybe open up some spots for safety-conscious beaches like Coopers and Main.''
 Mayor Mark Epley of Southampton Village had a different take: ''We personally believe this is the No. 1 beach and the guy who did the list is wrong.''
 They can duke it out in July when Mr. Leatherman, who bikes to Coopers and Main from the villages, returns to the Hamptons to scope out data for his 2009 list. Mr. Epley may want to catch Dr. Beach's PowerPoint presentation at the Parrish Art Museum here on July 26. The topic being, of course, ''What Makes a Great Beach.''

HEADLINE: Playing Markets That Trade Miles

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
ANY traveler who has tried to redeem frequent flier miles for an award seat, only to be thwarted by blackout dates or limited availability, knows that attractive alternatives are hard to come by. You could spend miles for magazine subscriptions, donate them to charity or, in a few cases, purchase merchandise in an exchange that often doesn't quite add up (17,000 miles for a coffee maker?).
 Now imagine a virtual stock market for the eBay generation where the miles and pointsare currency, and the free market -- rather than the airlines -- determines the exchange rates. That's the general idea behind some new online services that have quietly begun testing ways for travelers to leverage unused miles. Such mileage matchmaking services have popped up as airlines, including American, Continental, Delta and United, have been announcing significant capacity cutbacks -- reductions that are expected to make frequent flier awards even harder to use when the cuts begin to take effect this fall. 
 One of the sites, Points.com, has introduced a service called Global Points Exchange that allows travelers to barter miles with one another and set their own exchange ratios (I'll give you 8,000 American miles for 10,000 of your Delta miles). 
 It can sometimes be a rough calculus. But for Andy Simmons, a software solutions consultant from Chicago, trading was worth it. 
 ''I was stuck with these 16,000 Delta miles I'd probably never use unless I bought more, so I had to make an economic decision,'' he said. Mr. Simmons made three trades -- two at an even swap of 4,000 miles each and another trading 8,000 of his Delta miles for 7,000 American miles. Total transaction fees: $250. 
 ''I realized I'll lose some miles, but I had to make a decision: Is something better than nothing?'' he said. ''My answer is yes.'' 
 Another site that is letting travelers set their own trading terms is LoyaltyMatch.com, which started in February. It's the brainchild of Brad Ball, a technology executive who had accumulated piles of miles after several years of heavy business travel. Like so many other fliers in the same situation, Mr. Ball was having trouble using them for something he really wanted. Though he had enough miles for a number of award tickets, he said, ''As you spend more time on planes, the last thing you want to do when you have some down time is get back on.''
 LoyaltyMatch, based in Waterloo, Ontario, offers an alternative, he said, by letting travelers convert those unused points and miles into merchandise that they can then sell online for cash or swap for other items, services and activities. 
 Sellers register and enter their loyalty programs and account totals, which LoyaltyMatch uses to automatically list the items those miles and points can buy. For example, my test account (with a measly 16,309 American Airlines miles and 15,000 American Express points) immediately triggered four Exchange Alerts from other users willing to pay cash or trade miles or points for the merchandise that LoyaltyMatch said my miles and points could buy. 
 One user, ''big--tall'' from Canada, was willing to pay $35 for a Cuisinart popcorn maker that would cost me 10,000 AmEx points. Another, ''airmileguy,'' also from Canada, proposed a trade for a Wired magazine subscription that 400 of my American Airlines miles would buy. (I could click on ''make an offer'' to suggest a suitable swap.) Similarly, ''dangerfield'' from Australia wanted to trade for some Callaway golf balls. 
 Buyers simply browse the site for items they want and submit a cash or trade offer. The site then matches you up with potential sellers, who can choose to accept your offer and use their points or miles to buy that popcorn maker for you and have it mailed to your door. You in turn, pay the seller through PayPal or order the item you agreed to trade from your loyalty program. For its services, LoyaltyMatch charges $1.99 a transaction. 
 It takes a calculator and a certain amount of patience to figure out how good an offer really is -- and whether it makes sense to unload miles that might otherwise have languished. And while LoyaltyMatch.com and Points.com seem to hold a lot of promise, they still have a long way to go. As is common with any test site, technological glitches are still being worked out. And while each strives to offer travelers more options, they are bound by the various rules and regulations of the loyalty programs themselves. 
 AT Points.com, along with a $6.95 transaction charge, you still have to pay the airlines' traditional mileage-transfer fees. Delta, for instance, charges a $30 transfer fee and 1 cent per mile. American charges $80 for up to 5,000 miles, $130 for 6,000 to 10,000 miles and $180 for 11,000 to 15,000 miles. Points.com also has very limited trading options. Alaska, American, Delta, Frontier, IcelandAir and Aeroplan, the frequent flier program spun off by Air Canada, are the only participants. The company says it expects participants to grow as the site develops. In partnership with the online agency Travelocity, Points.com has also branched out with a service that lets travelers book hotel rooms with miles. So far, though, only a few airlines -- including Frontier, Midwest and US Airways -- are participating.
 A big drawback of LoyaltyMatch is that not many of the major domestic airlines have merchandise programs that allow travelers to redeem miles for retail items. So a traveler looking to unload American miles, for example, can really only sell magazines -- a small-ticket item -- for cash. ''In my opinion, it is only a matter of time until most of the frequent flier programs add merchandise to their members rewards offerings,'' said Mr. Ball of LoyaltyMatch. 
 If all you're really interested in is scoring that ''free'' ticket, there's help on that front as well. ExpertFlyer.com, a subscription site that charges $4.99 a month for basic service, lets frequent fliers see how many award tickets or upgrades are available for a given flight by listing airline fare codes. The site, once favored only by hard-core frequent fliers, is now easier to navigate, with codes translated into lay terms. Travelers searching for tickets can also set up an alert to receive e-mail when award seats are released for a specific flight. 
 ''The main draw of loyalty programs ''is that allure of being able to earn and use miles and sit at the front of the bus,'' said Chris Lopinto, a founding member of ExpertFlyer.com. ''We're trying to take the pain out of the process, to try to make it easy again.''

When Mom and Dad Share It All
 I find it disheartening that in 2008 couples who share parenting duties equally have such an unusual arrangement that it merits a cover article in your magazine (June 15) and that much of Lisa Belkin's focus was on organizations that assist parents who may strive to achieve such equality. My husband and I equally divide parenting tasks in much the same manner as the schedule set forth on your cover, but not because we discuss divisions of labor ad nauseam or take classes to learn how to split the work -- it simply never occurred to either of us that we're not equally responsible. 
 SADIE ZEA ISHEE

 Full-time working couples do 44 hours of housework a week? What are they doing? Changing all the beds every day? Scrubbing the grout with a toothbrush? Canning fruits and vegetables?
 Among the many statistics about housework in this article, the most telling one comes near the end, in the section about lesbian couples. They report spending 6 to 10 hours a week apiece doing chores. This disparity goes by unremarked. Do the lesbians therefore live in squalor? Are their children ragged and dirty? I very much doubt it, since 10 to 20 hours a week total is what my husband and I spend on our house, yard and pets. (Admittedly, the kids are gone.) 
 The probable reason for the difference between the amount of time straight and lesbian couples report spending on housework is that the lesbian parents aren't locked into a gender-inflected, resentful feud that leads them to exaggerate the degree to which they're put upon.

 I'm curious and hopeful as to when this ridiculous era of treating parenting like forced servitude will end. Being a parent is not only an incredible gift; it is simply analogous to being a person. Yet we in the Western world, particularly America, seem to create an industry around the practice. In an age when we have taken the notion of parenting to be a job, a sacrifice, a mental exercise, among other things, I worry about the consequences of such hypervigilance on our children. I would hate for them to read the parenting missives currently out there and think that they were so much work and so little joy. Such a message does them a disservice. PAIGE HARRISON
 Santa Monica, Calif.
 In research for my book, ''How to Avoid the Mommy Trap: A Roadmap for Sharing Parenting and Making It Work,'' I saw time and time again that not all mothers subscribe to the egalitarian dream of 50-50 parenting. Rigid adherence to a 50 -50 division of parenting and housework matters less to finding a functional family balance than do making conscious decisions, having good communication, working together to make parents' joint desires reality and adopting flexibility for dealing with new situations and constraints. 
 Sometimes rigid splitting of duties worked, but more often it didn't. The couples I interviewed found that a harmonious arrangement evolved when parents began to treat each other as valued partners as opposed to adversaries working from two opposing positions or from a relationship similar to that of a frustrated boss and beleaguered subcontractor One day, the practice of ''sharing parenting'' will be known as ''parenting.'' The efforts of mothers and fathers today to make parenting more equal will help this beneficial change to come about. 
 JULIE SHIELDS
 McLean, Va.
 Belkin managed to perpetuate the very inequality she was writing about when she said it ''makes sense'' that stay-at-home mothers handle three times the housework as their husbands. Look at it this way: they are home for the kids, not the toilets. While the average American worker is on the job 38 hours a week, stay-at-home mothers with small children at home work upward of 100 hours a week, plus they are on call 24/7. And a sick day is doing what they do all the other days, only they feel worse than usual. If only dads would recognize that and do a little more around the house.
 JEN SINGER
 Kinnelon, N.J.
 After 20 years of balancing our jobs and child care, my husband and I can attest that tag-team parenting is the hardest job there is. There is no such thing as a 50-50 relationship, and women will always be hard-wired to be ''mom'' no matter how many middle-of-the night feedings dad gets up for. As a couple, you are forever compromising, always stressed out. It hurts your marriage, it hurts your family and -- oh, yeah -- it hurts your job. Now that I am a stay-at-home mom, I can enjoy the privilege (and it has become a privilege in this country) to focus on raising our second child. The sad thing is that what started out as choice, a woman's working or not working, has become an economic necessity, and our children have become the center of a juggling act.

 Questions for Gore Vidal
 At 82, Gore Vidal can still teach us all something: the validity of the adage, ''There's no fool like an old fool'' (''Literary Lion,'' June 15). Vidal says it is only a rumor that John McCain was a P.O.W. and claims to have doubts because Vidal ''is West Point'' and he knows ''a lot of the Annapolis breed.'' Gore certainly did not attend that academy, and yet he feels comfortable defaming McCain by implying that he did not suffer in the P.O.W. camp. We have all seen the pictures of McCain in the Hanoi Hilton, but Vidal wants us to believe him, and not our lying eyes.

 O.K., here we have a cover article wondering, ''Will Dad ever do his share?'' How shocking then -- and telling -- is the sentence in Ben Greenman's article (Lives, June 15): ''I didn't have to clean Greenland [cat urine] off the couch, or take my hat to the dry cleaner. . . . My wife did.'' Can you believe it?

HEADLINE: After Brutality, Mugabe Dusts Off the Olive Branch

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG 

 BODY:
President Robert Mugabe once boasted he had a degree in violence, and he has surely added a doctorate in the savage presidential runoff season that is likely to stagger to a close this weekend with his proclaiming himself the Zimbabwean people's choice despite an election denounced across the globe as a sham.
 In the three months since the opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai beat him in the general election, Mr. Mugabe, 84, has accomplished much of what governing party insiders say he and his coterie of strongmen set out to do in the long delay they engineered before the runoff on Friday. 
 Soldiers, war veterans and unemployed youths mobilized by Mr. Mugabe's ruling clique have decimated the ranks of the opposition, with the damage measured in shattered bones, battered and burned bodies and the corpses of assassinated organizers -- a record that helped prompt President Bush on Saturday to announce that the United States would move forward with broader sanctions on the Zimbabwean government. 
 ''Violence has left our structures scattered, tattered and seriously perforated,'' acknowledged Nelson Chamisa, a member of Parliament and the spokesman for the opposition Movement for Democratic Change.
 Now that he will have officially won a runoff that Mr. Tsvangirai quit with only days to go because of the extreme violence, Mr. Mugabe, in power for 28 years, is ready for talks with the opposition. ''We want our brothers in the M.D.C. to come to us to discuss our problems,'' he said at a rally on Thursday, exhibiting magnanimity that had earlier escaped him.
 In that spirit, the opposition's chief strategist, Tendai Biti, held for two weeks in one of the country's filthiest jails on flimsy treason charges, was released last week. And doctors treating victims of Mr. Mugabe's onslaught say torture camps in the Mashonaland provinces, the heartland of the gory campaign of terror, have been closed and the wounded are now straggling into Harare, the capital, for treatment.
 The current moment has a familiar quality that has left some Zimbabweans wondering if Mr. Mugabe is up to old tricks.
 In 1987, after conducting a murderous campaign to crush the forces of a rival liberation hero, Joshua Nkomo, Mr. Mugabe and Mr. Nkomo signed a unity accord that merged the two forces into a single party, ZANU-PF, that still rules Zimbabwe.
 The historian Martin Meredith explains in his book ''The Fate of Africa'' that Mr. Mugabe's objective was always to establish a one-party state. The question now is whether he can again succeed in bludgeoning an independent force into submission.
 There is one major, imponderable difference now: the gruesome violence has been inflicted in the Internet age. The photographic and video evidence of atrocities is online in real time: the women whose bottoms were beaten for so many hours they have turned deep purple, the men whose backs are pocked with burns from dribbled, burning plastic, the boys and girls with broken legs and black eyes.
 These images, more than anything else, have created a worldwide revulsion to Mr. Mugabe and an avalanche of denunciations from Western leaders and some African heads of state on a continent where many have been silent during Mr. Mugabe's pitiless decades in power.
 But Mr. Mugabe is a cunning survivor. The chief mediator between him and Mr. Tsvangirai is South Africa's president, Thabo Mbeki, who has a complicated relationship with Mr. Mugabe that stretches from 1980. Mr. Mbeki has uttered nary a word directly criticizing Mr. Mugabe in the past three months and is now pushing hard for Mr. Mugabe and Mr. Tsvangirai to talk. Some senior members of Mr. Mbeki's own party have said in recent interviews that they think Mr. Mugabe has for years outfoxed South Africa's president.
 Still, Mr. Mbeki is sticking with the policy of quiet diplomacy he has pursued with Mr. Mugabe for the past several years. South Africa has fought to keep Zimbabwe off the international agenda, and on Friday it opposed an effort led by the United States and Britain to have the United Nations Security Council pronounce the runoff illegitimate, saying it was not the Council's role to do so. Instead, the Security Council issued a weaker statement regretting that the runoff was not postponed.
 South Africa also opposes sanctions against Zimbabwe. 
 President Bush said Saturday that the United States would press the United Nations for an arms embargo on Zimbabwe and a travel ban on government officials. He also said he was instructing American officials to develop sanctions against Zimbabwe's government. Currently, the United States sanctions apply only to some 140 members of Zimbabwe's elite and businesses they own or control.
 Ronnie Mamoepa, spokesman for South Africa's Foreign Ministry, explained that while South Africa's own liberation movement sought international sanctions against the apartheid regime, Zimbabwe's opposition has not asked for them.
 Mr. Mamoepa said it did not make sense to impose sanctions now when both sides were already willing to enter negotiations for a political settlement. 
 He also said South Africa had not yet expressed any view on the validity of the election. 
 ''Our principal task is to bring the two belligerents to the table to talk about the future of the country,'' he said.
 South Africa's studied neutrality has embittered many in the opposition. 
 ''If Mbeki endorses and legitimizes Robert Mugabe and ZANU-PF,'' said Mr. Chamisa, ''instead of being part of the solution, he risks being part of the problem.''

HEADLINE: Cost of Asphalt Rises, Affecting Repaving

BYLINE: By NATE SCHWEBER

 BODY:
THE Clifton Avenue Bridge over Interstate-280 and the New Jersey Transit railroad tracks in Newark is a cratered moonscape, a patchwork of cracks, pockmarks and potholes that make vehicle shock absorbers rattle and drivers bounce like Muppets. 
 The bridge is scheduled to be replaced this summer. But because of the skyrocketing cost of asphalt -- one more bit of fallout from soaring oil prices -- this project, like more than a dozen statewide, may be held off until next year, New Jersey officials said.
 That upsets Ruben Morales, who lives nearby and drives his Mercedes-Benz CL500 and his motorcycle over the rough terrain daily. 
 ''I've bent the rims of my motorcycle on those potholes,'' said Mr. Morales, 29, a corrections officer. ''It's been bad for years.''
 As the cost of asphalt, a petroleum-based product, keeps going up, state and local officials around the region are postponing road repairs that are not deemed crucial and all but halting new road construction. 
 In Westchester and on Long Island, the New York State Department of Transportation is working to make all necessary road repairs because of the high level of traffic in and out of New York City, said Skip Carrier, a department spokesman.
 ''It's a question of how quickly we can get to the projects, not that we won't do the projects,'' he said. ''It's a necessary part of maintaining our infrastructure; we have to do the work.''
 The highways on Long Island, he said, are not only vital to commuters but also to commercial and freight traffic. In Westchester, he said, the high volume of commuter traffic makes road repairs there crucial.
 Mr. Carrier said, however, that Gov. David A. Paterson had asked the Transportation Department to cut its budget by more than 3 percent, which could affect how quickly roads get repaved.
 Asphalt is made of two parts -- an aggregate, of stones or gravel, and a binder, a sticky tarlike substance made from petroleum. The cost of the binder, which makes up 6 percent of the mixture that covers roads, has gone up 16 percent since April and more than 40 percent since last year, said Kenneth D. Simonson, chief economist for the Associated General Contractors of America, a trade association. The cost of asphalt itself has gone up more than 5 percent since April and 10 percent in the past year, he said. 
 The price of the diesel fuel needed to help crush stone from quarries and haul asphalt to road construction sites is also cranking up costs, Mr. Simonson said. So are new technologies that refine crude oil into more valuable petroleum products, like diesel and gasoline, and leave less low-grade material for road paving. 
 The cost of fuel means that drivers are driving less, which means less gasoline tax revenue for states to fill Transportation Department coffers, said David Weinstein, a spokesman for AAA Mid-Atlantic. And high diesel costs coupled with the housing slump have resulted in fewer tractor-trailers hauling home building materials and furniture, resulting in less diesel tax revenue for states, he said. 
 Between January and May 2004, New Jersey took in more than $198 million in gasoline taxes and more than $46 million in diesel taxes, Mr. Weinstein said. For that period this year, those numbers were around $184 million and $45 million, respectively. 
 Even though the price of asphalt has doubled since 2005, the Connecticut Department of Transportation is moving ahead with all scheduled repairs, 250 to 300 miles of two-lane roads, said Kevin Nursick, a department spokesman. 
 ''For years to come it would certainly be a factor in determining which projects move ahead,'' he said. 
 Having seen the cost of asphalt rise drastically last summer, Westchester road officials budgeted for what they thought was a high estimate of this year's increase, 15 percent. But the price went up nearly 20 percent, said Ralph Butler, the county's commissioner of public works. 
 Westchester is moving forward with repaving almost 12 miles of road at a cost of almost $9 million, or nearly $90 a ton of asphalt, up from $72 last year, Mr. Butler said.
 But Bergen County, N.J., will repave only 23 miles of road, not the 32 that were scheduled, because of the cost of asphalt, said Mabel Aragon, a county spokeswoman. 
 New Jersey, according to its Transportation Department, paid $49.46 per ton for asphalt in 2001 and will pay $88.71 this year -- a 79 percent increase in seven years. 
 IN addition to $200 million budgeted for road repairs this summer, the New Jersey Transportation Department also budgeted up to $25 million for fuel price adjustments, money a contractor can apply for should the price of fuel jump before the completion of a job. Despite that, many contractors say they are working for less profit, and therefore can hire fewer workers. 
 Chris Janeira, 24, of Kearny, has worked paving roads for seven years. This year, he has been doing odd jobs to make ends meet because he has less paving work.
 ''I keep calling, they keep saying, 'Next month, next month, costs are too high right now,' '' said Mr. Janeira, who is a member of Heavy and General Construction Laborers Union Local 472. ''This is a bad summer.''
 New Jersey had set an aggressive goal to repave enough roads so that Transportation Department officials would have to fill only 50,000 to 75,000 potholes annually, Commissioner Kris Kolluri said. Two years ago, the state filled 300,000 potholes; last year, 200,000. Rising asphalt costs will make it more difficult to cut that number more this year, he said.
 ''On the one hand, we have inflation; on the other we have a financial crisis, so it becomes a very challenging balancing act,'' he said. ''But it's about efficiency and safety.''
 Though New Jersey officials say they are proceeding with all scheduled road work, there is anecdotal evidence that repairs are needed. According to AAA, there has been a 12.8 percent increase in the number of flat tires reported to the organization on roads throughout New Jersey from May 1 through June 17.
 Might delayed repairs result in less roadwork this year and therefore fewer traffic jams? Unfortunately not, Mr. Kolluri said. 
 ''I wish that was the silver lining around this dark issue,'' he said. ''However, traffic congestion is part of how the network works.''

HEADLINE: The Joy of Graduating The Frenzied Battle to Be Valedictorian Is Giving Some Administrators Pause

BYLINE: By KATE STONE LOMBARDI

 BODY:
AT last week's graduation ceremony at Horace Greeley High School in Chappaqua, two valedictorians shared the stage, each giving her own speech under a threatening, dark gray sky.
 Though no one would speak for the record, the stories circulated about contested grade point averages and smothered resentment. Yet the co-valedictorians, Susannah Rudel and Brett Rosenberg, presented a united front, describing how delighted they were that as best ''study buddies'' they were both honored. 
 ''I would have felt terrible if it was just me,'' Susannah, 17, said in an interview that included her co-valedictorian at the school. ''I genuinely don't believe I would have succeeded as much without Brett. I spend hours on the phone going over math problems with her.''
 Brett, also 17, said that if she alone had been named, ''it definitely would have been empty in a way, and it wouldn't have been fair because it was such a collaborative relationship.'' 
 Those words are balm to high school administrators, who had to calculate the top grade point averages to the third decimal point to determine the girls were tied. Nineteen students at Horace Greeley High had perfect 4.0 grade point averages or higher; Susannah and Brett each had a 4.1. 
 Each girl took seven A.P.s. Susannah was captain of the varsity swim team, placed in the state championships, earned her Gold Award from the Girl Scouts and plays the flute. Brett was captain of the cross-country team, captain of the nationally ranked academic challenge team, and plays the bass clarinet. Susannah will attend Amherst College this fall; Brett will go to Harvard. 
 ''The two of them had an exact numerical tie,'' said Andrew Selesnick, the high school principal. ''It's pretty remarkable. You just want to be sure, you don't want to make a mistake.''
 The high school has reason to be cautious. Five years ago, the valedictorian and the salutatorian were named at a cum laude ceremony in the fall. But a week later, the students were called to the principal's office and told a mistake had been made in calculating the grade point averages. 
 A teacher who traditionally changed final class grades based on students' performance on the A.P. test had delayed reporting an upgrade. The new grade -- a fraction of a point -- changed the equation for several students in the tight competition at the top of the class. The students were told, based on recalculations, that there would be two valedictorians and two salutatorians. All four students gave speeches. 
 ''I remember thinking it was a little odd,'' said Dan Adler, the originally named valedictorian. ''But I clearly appreciated it when I was given the honor, so for someone else who deserved it not be granted it was a little absurd.''
 Another valedictorian season has come to a close, with students throughout the region having proudly stepped up to the podium to deliver their graduation speeches and receive the accolades that come from being the highest academic performer in their school. But as the path to that honor has intensified over recent years, some administrators are beginning to question the valedictorian tradition. Several factors -- including the increase in the number of high school students, grade inflation, intense competition for college acceptances and a savvier student body -- have changed the game. 
 Some students strategize to win, taking on a heavy load of A.P. courses, which are weighted when grade point averages are calculated. Some avoid more creative courses, like art or photography, where grading can be subjective and a B could ruin their shot at the top spot. There have been conflicts about how to measure the transcripts of transfer students who come from schools with different grading systems. In a handful of cases, the zeal for valedictorian honors has led to lawsuits. Moorestown High School, in Moorestown, N.J., landed in the national spotlight five years ago, when a high school senior sued the district in an effort to be named valedictorian. Blair L. Hornstine was awarded $60,000 by the Moorestown School District to settle a federal lawsuit that she filed after the district tried to name a student with a lower grade point average as co-valedictorian.
 Ms. Hornstine had been home-schooled, and her lawyer said she suffered from chronic fatigue syndrome. Critics claimed she manipulated the system, and her lawsuit caused an uproar in the community. Ms. Hornstine was so vilified -- there was even a Web site that chronicled her case called the ''Blair Hornstine Project,'' a play on the film ''The Blair Witch Project'' -- that she skipped her graduation.
 Later that summer, Ms. Hornstine's acceptance to Harvard was withdrawn, after accusations that articles she had written for the local newspaper were plagiarized. She ended up going to St. Andrews University in Scotland, where she graduated in 2006 with a degree in classics.
 Danielle Gorman, this year's valedictorian at Moorestown High, remembers the controversy and has some sympathy for her predecessor. 
 ''I felt really bad for her,'' Danielle said. ''She ended up being valedictorian but losing a lot of other things. I remember everyone said she shouldn't care so much because it ended up hurting her.''
 Securing the No. 1 spot at her highly competitive high school was no easy thing, said Danielle, 18. She often studied until 2 in the morning. She took one Advanced Placement class in her sophomore year, five her junior year and four senior year. Why not five? Because her math class, ''Multivariable Calculus and Differential Equations,'' covered material beyond what the A.P. tests measure. 
 On top of her studies, there was mock trial, model congress and the policy debate team, along with four years on the track team. Oh yes, and there were those relaxing summers, like the one after her sophomore year, when she took a course on international law at Harvard Summer School, while at the same time completing a 50-hour internship with a law firm. ''Valedictorians are the type of people who take on too much and are unwilling to fail,'' she said. 
 Danielle, who will attend M.I.T. this fall, said she chose challenging courses and pushed herself because she wasn't sure what she ultimately wanted to do. She wasn't shocked to find out she had been named valedictorian -- she knew she was one of the three top students -- but tried to keep herself from wanting the honor too intensely.
 ''I really conditioned myself to not want it or expect it,'' Danielle said. ''I take things pretty stoically. It didn't set in for a while, and then I was really happy.''
 When the differences between the top student and the 10th come down to hundredths of a point, some administrators are questioning how meaningful the valedictorian distinction is.
 Thomas Moore, the principal at Wethersfield High School in Connecticut, said the school is considering eliminating class ranking but not the valedictorian tradition.
 ''Sometimes the difference between the No. 1 student and the No. 10 student are fractions within fractions,'' he said. ''But we're a very traditional town and there is some value in recognizing that one child and giving them the ability to speak at graduation.'' 
 Several administrators said that they are also looking at eliminating class ranking because ranking reduces students to a number and they would prefer that colleges take a close look at student transcripts and consider the broader student. Still, they maintain the grade point averages to determine the No. 1and No. 2 spots. 
 Given all the drama over the honor, how do valedictorians fare in the long term? Karen D. Arnold, an associate professor of higher education at Boston College, spent more than 15 years studying valedictorians who graduated in 1981 from high schools across Illinois. Dr. Arnold found that high school valedictorians consistently did well in college and were generally well-rounded, successful people. They were not a group, however, who were particularly creative or who would achieve great distinction in life.
 ''They're kind of like wonderful organizational achievers,'' Dr. Arnold said. ''They're hard workers. They're not going to remold your organization, but they might lead it.'' 
 Dr. Arnold said she was familiar with the arguments in favor of eliminating valedictorians but believed the tradition should be maintained. ''There aren't many academic honors, and it is one of those labels that follows you through life, like the Heisman Trophy or Rhodes scholar,'' she said. ''To get rid of the one meaningful designation for what school is really all about seems like something we should do only with great caution.'' 
 Mr. Adler, Horace Greeley's 2003 co-valedictorian, works in management consulting. He graduated last year from Yale, where he found himself in the company of hundreds of other valedictorians. (''I think I dated at least two of them,'' he said.) 
 ''I'm still extremely proud of the honor, but if I were to give someone advice about how to think about it in the right way, it's that you have to think about this as a validation of what you're capable of and keep it in the back of your mind as a motivation,'' he said. ''But you can't be haughty about it, because there are so many people who you are going to meet who are just as smart as you.''

HEADLINE: Skelos's New Role Could Benefit the Island

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
THE sudden elevation of Dean G. Skelos, a Republican from Nassau County, to be the majority leader of the State Senate -- one of the most powerful positions in Albany -- bodes well for Long Islanders and the issues they care about, political and civic officials say.
 But a big ''if'' looms in Mr. Skelos's future: Will the Republicans retain their majority in the November election so that he keeps the post? 
 The Republicans control the Senate by a slim margin, 32 seats to 30 for the Democrats. In this presidential election year, Democrats are hoping for a blowout across the board. Senator Skelos is vowing not only to keep the majority but also to expand it.
 For years Mr. Skelos has served as deputy leader and as chief of Long Island's Senate delegation, an influential bloc that won substantial increases in state aid to local schools. The Island has nine state senators, and all but one are Republican.
 ''This means we have a majority leader who really understands the issues Long Island faces,'' said Matthew T. Crosson, president of the Long Island Association, a local business and civic group. 
 ''Long Island is generally misunderstood in Albany as being uniformly wealthy'' and not having needs, but Mr. Skelos knows better, Mr. Crosson said.
 ''He's had a very good record as an advocate for Long Island,'' Mr. Crosson said. ''Obviously, he's been successful in getting more education aid than we would have without his efforts, and he's also been helpful on economic development and affordable housing.''
 On the legislative front, Mr. Skelos has already pegged tax reduction -- an issue dear to the hearts of residents back home -- as his top priority. ''We are suffering from a property tax crisis in this state,'' he said. ''There is no issue that is more important to the people.''
 Mr. Skelos was sworn in as the majority leader on Tuesday night, shortly after the incumbent, Joseph L. Bruno, made his surprise announcement that he would not seek re-election.
 Thus Mr. Skelos was catapulted into becoming part of the state's reigning triumvirate. The so-called three men in a room -- the governor, the Assembly speaker and Senate majority leader -- collectively decide what does or does not happen in the state budget and legislation.
 A resident of Rockville Centre, Mr. Skelos (pronounced SKELL-os) has served in the Senate for more than two decades. At 60, he has youthful looks, and he takes pride in his Greek heritage. Among the issues he has focused on are restrictions on sexual predators of children and ending taxes on commuters working in New York City.
 Long Islanders seem to be in vogue these days in Albany. The new governor, David A. Paterson, grew up in Hempstead, and the new state comptroller, Thomas P. DiNapoli, is from Nassau. Both are Democrats.
 Politicians from the Island have been a force in Albany before. Joseph F. Carlino, a Nassau Republican, served as Assembly speaker in the 1960s, and Perry B. Duryea Jr., a Suffolk Republican, held the post in the 1970s. Mr. Bruno's predecessor as majority leader was Ralph J. Marino, a Republican from Oyster Bay Town.
 The Republican campaign to hold the Senate could see battleground contests in Mr. Skelos's backyard.
 The Republicans will be pushing to recapture the North Hempstead seat that Craig M. Johnson, a Democrat, won in 2007, breaking the decades-long Republican monopoly on the Island's Senate districts. But rising Democratic voter registration is expected to bolster Mr. Johnson.
 Another tough contest looms in Brian X. Foley's bid for the Democratic nomination to face Senator Caesar Trunzo, a Republican who is 82. Mr. Foley is the supervisor of Brookhaven, where he upset the Republicans, and Mr. Trunzo has been beset by party infighting and election losses in his hometown, Islip.
 ''Single-mindedness is going to be required if Dean is going to retain his majority,'' said Desmond Ryan, a Republican lobbyist from Suffolk. He cited Speaker Carlino's losing his seat in the Lyndon B. Johnson presidential landslide in 1964 and Speaker Duryea's demotion to minority leader in the fallout of President Richard M. Nixon's Watergate scandal when the Republicans lost 22 Assembly seats in 1974.
 ''Will George Bush's policies do to the Senate what Nixon's policies did to the Assembly in 1974?'' Mr. Ryan said. ''What Skelos has got to do is bring a message of change and reinvigorate the Republicans.''

HEADLINE: So Ready to Send the Kids Off to College

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP. 
E-mail: parenting@nytimes.com

 BODY:
''IT'S only a two-minute ride to school,'' said Adam. ''Calm down, Dad.'' He had his final final exam of high school, in economics, at 10:15 on June 17, and it was now 10:03, and how was he preparing? Reviewing his notes? No. (That's what his older brother, Ben, would do.) Sharpening those No. 2 pencils? No. (That's what his younger sister, Annie, had done that morning, before the eighth-grade state math test.)
 A half-hour before the final, Adam had strolled around the corner to the deli to get himself a bacon, egg and cheese sandwich. As much as I urged him to get to school early so he'd be in the right frame of mind for the test, so he would graduate and go away to college in the fall (please, dear Lord), he would not accelerate his pace by one newton. 
 I had known it would come to this. It's why I'd made sure I was home that Tuesday morning. I knew I would have to bird-dog my dear twin senior boys right to the bitter end. 
 You don't graduate if you don't return all your books, and for weeks Ms. Katz, in Room 317 at the high school, and I had been exchanging information on the progress of the Winerip twins' final book roundup. (At the low point, we were looking at eight lost books between the two; however, when I said that they -- not I -- would pay, we whittled the list down pretty fast.)
 ''It's practically mathematically impossible for me to fail,'' Adam had reassured me. I tried to make the point that not failing wasn't the goal here, but he was locked on a replay of Tiger Woods sinking a birdie putt.
 ''Relax, Dad,'' said his twin, Sam. ''His test doesn't start until 10:30.''
 ''10:15,'' said Adam.
 ''You idiot,'' said Sam. ''You need to go.'' And only then, when his twin had spoken, did Adam head out the door to take his final final, accompanied by Sam, who was making one last hunt for his ninth-grade biology textbook.
 They graduate on Sunday. They are off to college in the fall -- separating for the first time. And though I could not love them more, I am, as my sons say, so ready. Indeed, it's hard to know who's readier, the two of them or the one of me. For months I've been waging war on senioritis and, having been double-teamed, I am worn to a nub. It got to the point that when Ms. Palmer, the dean of discipline, called the house, she didn't bother identifying herself; she knew I'd recognize her voice.
 And so while most of the attention at graduation will rightly focus on the lofty principles espoused by the valedictorian and salutatorian, I am just thankful that somewhere in that great mass of blue robes will be my twins.
 I know I'm not alone. At our school, there was an extensive schedule of senioritis activities. Tuesday after Memorial Day was senior skip day. (''Everyone did it, Dad, it's no big deal.'') We live on a barrier island, and on June 11 the high school sent home a warning letter saying that a ''large group'' of seniors had scaled the fence behind the school and jumped into the bay, ''an unlawful act,'' and that there would be serious consequences if it happened again. (''I swear we didn't do it, Dad, it wasn't us this time, honest, Dad.'')
 My twins never had the same view of high school that I did. Through ninth grade I'd pressed them relentlessly about their class work. But as much as I yelled, as much as I grounded them, they did not become the top students their older brother and younger sister are. I don't know how to explain it. They're smart. They'd been in gifted programs.
 They just weren't interested.
 My wife and I would go to parent-teacher conferences girded for the update -- the homework not turned in, the quizzes and unit tests that needed to be made up. When the teachers saw my hurt, they'd talk about what good boys they were, how funny they were, how wonderfully social they were. I dismissed these as backhanded compliments. I had been a top student, and while I always had a small group of good friends, I wasn't particularly social, nor was being social something I much cared about.
 And so, it wasn't until midway through this senior year that it finally dawned on me what had happened. Somehow, we had raised two of the most popular kids at the high school. This didn't help at the recent academic awards night, when they won a few small prizes and I left reminded of all my parenting failures. But at varsity sports night -- they were stars. And when I saw the yearbook, my God, the two of them were everywhere: Adam winning a pie-eating contest; Sam, so handsome in a tuxedo for the school fashion show, blowing glitter from the stage; Sam and Adam dressed in ketchup and mustard costumes, leading the seniors to victory in the class Olympics.
 Sam was voted best smile; Adam best dancer. (''Adam's not really the best dancer,'' Sam had explained to me. ''He just campaigned really hard for it.'')
 I can say it out loud finally, now that they've got those blue robes on: As nerve-racking as they could be, it's been a great ride. Because they're so different from me, they've taken me so many places I'd never been, good and bad, and that's made me both a smarter and humbler parent. Any parenting smugness I once possessed is long gone. I know the dean of discipline sensed this. She'd always speak to me in gingerly tones. ''Mr. Winerip, it's not that bad, I don't want to give you a heart attack.''
 When this keeps happening, your parental standards shift. After a while, I could see Adam's point: ''Dad, a one-day in-school suspension is not that big a deal.''
 As an education columnist, I had long advocated for vocational schools, but thanks to Adam, I saw the importance firsthand. Adam had been miserable in A.P. English Composition during junior year, but in senior year he loved the carpentry course at our county vocational school, hopping out of bed before dawn to catch the bus.
 Sam may have squeaked by in calculus, but his final class project, a profile of a mathematician, was masterly. He chose his teacher, Mr. Witkin, who is leaving the classroom after 33 years. Sam took a video camera around school to interview his thousand best friends, plus his teachers. That video contained everything from a close-up of Sam's bellybutton to teachers talking movingly about what made Mr. Witkin so good.
 I feel sure that, even without a firm grasp of calculus, a boy whose video can make you laugh and cry will find his niche in the world.
 Still, I face this summer with dread. I know there will be constant battling. Already they've started in on me. ''Why can't we have a 1 a.m. curfew, Dad, everyone else has a 1 a.m. curfew. We're 17!''
 It's the one thing we agree on, they're 17. I've explained this is my last hurrah, that when they start college, I'm not going to be there to tell them when to be in, when to study, when it's O.K. to party.
 As my wife and I have done for their older brother, we will pay for their four years, except for first semester freshman year. They will each pay for that with $15,000 of their summer job earnings. Our hope is that knowing how hard they had to work to save that money -- putting in six days a week, nine hours a day lifeguarding as juniors and seniors; getting up at 6:30 to clean restroom toilets at the beach as sophomores; umpiring Little League games each spring -- they will not waste their first year of college.
 That, at least, is our hope.

HEADLINE: I'll Bet You...

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KAPLAN

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS 

 BODY:
 IT was past midnight and Mike Matusow, nicknamed the Mouth, was about to hit his stride. Best known as a verbose professional card player on ESPN poker telecasts, Mr. Matusow was not gambling at high-stakes Texas Hold 'Em on this night in May. Instead, he was in a spare bedroom at his house, shirtless, furiously pumping his legs on a commercial-strength stepping machine. 
 His drive to burn calories was motivated by finance, not fitness. ''Last year, I talked about how I used to weigh 181 pounds and somebody said that I'd never weigh that again,'' said Mr. Matusow, who stands six feet tall and who on this day weighed 189, down from his peak of 241 pounds. ''I said I would, and we made the bet for $100,000.'' 
 He was given one year to get back to 181 by Ted Forrest, one of the world's leading poker players; on June 3, the year would be up. 
 Mr. Matusow seemed headed for victory -- he had 19 more days to drop just eight pounds -- but there was a wrinkle. ''My girlfriend and I are going on a cruise,'' he said. ''I asked Ted to settle for $70,000, so I could eat and drink with her. He said, 'I'll gamble for 30.' So now I will have to run five miles every day on the boat, drink protein shakes and eat grilled chicken.''
 Over the years, so-called proposition betting -- the sometimes absurd, usually spur-of-the-moment wagers that gamblers make among themselves -- has become as ingrained as oversize designer sunglasses in the professional poker world. Huck Seed, the 1996 champion in the World Series of Poker, once bet $10,000 that he could learn to do a standing back flip in two months (he did). The pool-player-turned-poker-pro John Hennigan vowed to spend six weeks living in Des Moines, Iowa (action-starved, he returned to Las Vegas after two days). Howard Lederer, an avowed vegan, ate a hamburger to win $10,000 from a fellow poker professional, David Grey. (Offered an opportunity to win his money back by eating a few olives, which he can't stand, Mr. Grey demurred.)
 With $10,000 or $100,000 on the line, what often sound like frat-boy boasts had better ring true, and fast. ''You make claims? You say you can do something? You put your money up,'' Mr. Lederer said. ''That is being a gambler.''
 These bets offer a glimpse into the rarefied world of professional gamblers, where often money is not the object, but the pawn one moves about the board. Such wagers are ''mostly a way of keeping score, but if the points are too small there is no fun in it,'' said Daniel Negreanu, the winner of four World Series of Poker tournaments, who has been known to play casual rounds of Wii bowling and Golden Tee golf for sums totaling in the low five figures. ''You have to understand that losing money is no big deal when you gamble for a living.'' 
 ''We don't think of money the way that salaried people do,'' continued Mr. Negreanu, who sports a goatee and two gold hoops in his left earlobe. ''We don't love money the way rich people do. We know we can always make more of it.'' 
 His confidence is abetted by the fact that the professional poker economy has grown significantly in recent years, with an explosion of tournaments, the advent of online poker sites and promotional deals with those sites, giving top players a large pool of money to gamble with when they're not sitting at card tables. Indicative of this is the 2008 World Series of Poker now taking place here. The event has attracted many of the game's most successful players for a gross prize pool that is on track to exceed 2007's total of $159.8 million. (In an unusual arrangement, the nine finalists will be chosen by July 14, but play will be suspended until Nov. 9 and 10, when ESPN will cover the final table.) 
 Among many high-stakes professionals, gambling goes beyond being a job; it's also a lifestyle and a passion. Of course, there are successful players who avoid proposition betting -- Chris Ferguson, called Jesus and known for his mathematically rigorous approach to poker, describes these wagers as ''maybe not a waste of money, but often a waste of time.'' But it is not unusual for gambling to be in a pro's blood.
 ''These guys may play poker 10 hours a day, but that leaves 14 hours in which they need to do something interesting,'' said Michael Craig, the author of ''The Professor, the Banker and the Suicide King,'' which chronicles a mega-stakes Hold 'Em game between a Texas banker and a group of professional players. ''If they are home watching TV, they bet sports. If they are driving through the rain, they bet on how long it will take a raindrop to reach the bottom of the car's window. They want to have gambling in every aspect of their lives.''
 This begs a question as to whether poker's high-stakes proposition bettors meet the clinical definition of pathological gamblers. ''They have their own culture and their own norms,'' said Bob Breen, a clinical psychologist at the Rhode Island Gambling Treatment Program. ''We're talking about professional gamblers, not pathological gamblers. They may be doing nothing more than blowing off steam by making these bets.''
 Technically, such bets are illegal in some states, according to gambling and criminal law experts, though authorities almost never pursue wagers between individuals. In Nevada, ''gambling between private persons does not require a license and is not illegal,'' said David Salas, a deputy chief of enforcement for Nevada's Gaming Control Board. 
 Almost anything is fodder for a wager between pros. This was borne out on a recent afternoon in the high-rise apartment of Andrew Robl, 21, who dropped out of college and moved here to make his living as a gambler. His favorite game is online poker, at which he has made more than $1 million, he said, playing under the name Good2CU. 
 Facing a floor-to-ceiling window with a view of the Strip below, Mr. Robl recounted a wager in which he paid $20,000 to a friend who endured 25 days without leaving the bathroom of a room at the Bellagio hotel, surviving on room service and food from friends. While Mr. Robl regaled this reporter with the story, his manager, Nick Rainey, who recently negotiated Mr. Robl's one-day endorsement deal with the Web site Full Tilt Poker (fulltilt.com) when Mr. Robl made it to the final table at a World Series of Poker tournament, initiated a bet of his own. He wagered another poker professional in the room, Luke Kim, that he, Mr. Rainey, could tell Coke from Pepsi in a blind tasting. 
 Mr. Rainey disappeared into a bedroom, and Mr. Kim filled the first four of 20 Dixie cups with the soft drinks, numbering each cup and compiling a list of which cola was in each. Mr. Rainey emerged from the bedroom and began sipping. He flubbed it during the second flight, on the seventh cup.
 Mr. Kim had won a quick $1,000, at least on paper; like many proposition bets, this one was added to a running tab between the bettors. Gamblers bet so frequently among one another that money changes hands only when one party requests a payout, and then often in the form of chips or a transfer between online poker accounts. 
 Collecting on a bet is not always a given. Gavin Smith, who earns his living playing poker tournaments, remembers wagering a wealthy Californian who, with $100,000 on the line, said he could jump from an automobile roof to a hotel awning. The Californian failed to make it, came close to injuring himself in the process, and has yet to pay it all off, Mr. Smith said. 
 Considering Las Vegas's many world-class golf courses, it is not surprising that gamblers extend their wagering to the links. There, between standard bets on rounds of golf, proposition bets on making specific putts or, in one case, catching drives as if they're fly balls in centerfield, are an additive to most outings. 
 ''Golf betting is the funnest thing in the world,'' said Mr. Negreanu, whose game is raggedy at best and whose financial results reflect it. An unlucky card ''can kill you at poker,'' he said, but golf is only ''2 percent luck.'' 
 In the past, he has found himself in the hole for more than $1 million in golf bets. Nonetheless, he remains surprisingly sanguine about it all. Recently he coolly came back from a deficit of $160,000 on the front-nine of a golf match against the poker pro Patrik Antonius. They were playing for $20,000 a hole. Mr. Negreanu wound up ahead by $20,000 after the 18th. 
 Mr. Antonius said he has $400,000 riding on planned golf and tennis games in the near future. ''Having money at risk motivates me to get better and beat the other guy,'' said Mr. Antonius, a fitness fanatic. ''It's nice to wake up in the morning and know what you need to work on.''
 Clearly, though, golf is not for everyone. Mr. Matusow, he of the $100,000 weight bet, said that he avoids taking up the game for a simple reason: ''I'd go broke. Those other guys would win all of my money.''
 And what came of his weight wager? On the seven-day cruise with his girlfriend, Mr. Matusow gained seven pounds, which left him needing to lose 15 pounds in nine days. ''I didn't eat for the last five days, did a master cleanse and spent time in the Jacuzzi,'' he said by telephone. ''It was sheer torture. But I did it. I got down to 179.''
 SOON after Mr. Matusow made weight, he said, Mr. Forrest paid up, with $60,000 in poker chips (after accounting for $40,000 Mr. Matusow owed from a previous debt). Mr. Forrest did not return several messages seeking comment. 
 As for Mr. Matusow, his weight began climbing almost immediately. ''Right now I am eating a 20-piece Chicken McNugget meal,'' he said by telephone. ''And guess what? It's gooood!''
 Days later, after collecting $675,924 in tournament winnings, Mr. Matusow reported that he had bet Erick Lindgren, another poker pro, that he, Mr. Matusow, would weigh less than 200 pounds on Jan. 15, 2009. ''Right now,'' Mr. Matusow said, ''Erick is looking pretty good.''

HEADLINE: The Joy of Graduating The Frenzied Battle to Be Valedictorian Is Giving Some Administrators Pause

BYLINE: By KATE STONE LOMBARDI

 BODY:
AT last week's graduation ceremony at Horace Greeley High School in Chappaqua, N.Y., two valedictorians shared the stage, each giving her own speech under a threatening, dark gray sky.
 Though no one would speak for the record, the stories circulated about contested grade point averages and smothered resentment. Yet the co-valedictorians, Susannah Rudel and Brett Rosenberg, presented a united front, describing how delighted they were that as best ''study buddies'' they were both honored. 
 ''I would have felt terrible if it was just me,'' Susannah, 17, said in an interview that included her co-valedictorian at the school. ''I genuinely don't believe I would have succeeded as much without Brett. I spend hours on the phone going over math problems with her.''
 Brett, also 17, said that if she alone had been named, ''it definitely would have been empty in a way, and it wouldn't have been fair because it was such a collaborative relationship.'' 
 Those words are balm to high school administrators, who had to calculate the top grade point averages to the third decimal point to determine the girls were tied. Nineteen students at Horace Greeley High had perfect 4.0 grade point averages or higher; Susannah and Brett each had a 4.1. 
 Each girl took seven A.P.s. Susannah was captain of the varsity swim team, placed in the state championships, earned her Gold Award from the Girl Scouts and plays the flute. Brett was captain of the cross-country team, captain of the nationally ranked academic challenge team, and plays the bass clarinet. Susannah will attend Amherst College this fall; Brett will go to Harvard. 
 ''The two of them had an exact numerical tie,'' said Andrew Selesnick, the high school principal. ''It's pretty remarkable. You just want to be sure, you don't want to make a mistake.''
 The high school has reason to be cautious. Five years ago, the valedictorian and the salutatorian were named at a cum laude ceremony in the fall. But a week later, the students were called to the principal's office and told a mistake had been made in calculating the grade point averages. 
 A teacher who traditionally changed final class grades based on students' performance on the A.P. test had delayed reporting an upgrade. The new grade -- a fraction of a point -- changed the equation for several students in the tight competition at the top of the class. The students were told, based on recalculations, that there would be two valedictorians and two salutatorians. All four students gave speeches. 
 ''I remember thinking it was a little odd,'' said Dan Adler, the originally named valedictorian. ''But I clearly appreciated it when I was given the honor, so for someone else who deserved it not be granted it was a little absurd.''
 Another valedictorian season has come to a close, with students throughout the region having proudly stepped up to the podium to deliver their graduation speeches and receive the accolades that come from being the highest academic performer in their school. But as the path to that honor has intensified over recent years, some administrators are beginning to question the valedictorian tradition. Several factors -- including the increase in the number of high school students, grade inflation, intense competition for college acceptances and a savvier student body -- have changed the game. 
 Some students strategize to win, taking on a heavy load of A.P. courses, which are weighted when grade point averages are calculated. Some avoid more creative courses, like art or photography, where grading can be subjective and a B could ruin their shot at the top spot. There have been conflicts about how to measure the transcripts of transfer students who come from schools with different grading systems. In a handful of cases, the zeal for valedictorian honors has led to lawsuits. Moorestown High School, in Moorestown, N.J., landed in the national spotlight five years ago, when a high school senior sued the district in an effort to be named valedictorian. Blair L. Hornstine was awarded $60,000 by the Moorestown School District to settle a federal lawsuit that she filed after the district tried to name a student with a lower grade point average as co-valedictorian.
 Ms. Hornstine had been home-schooled, and her lawyer said she suffered from chronic fatigue syndrome. Critics claimed she manipulated the system, and her lawsuit caused an uproar in the community. Ms. Hornstine was so vilified -- there was even a Web site that chronicled her case called the ''Blair Hornstine Project,'' a play on the film ''The Blair Witch Project'' -- that she skipped her graduation.
 Later that summer, Ms. Hornstine's acceptance to Harvard was withdrawn, after accusations that articles she had written for the local newspaper were plagiarized. She ended up going to St. Andrews University in Scotland, where she graduated in 2006 with a degree in classics.
 Danielle Gorman, this year's valedictorian at Moorestown High, remembers the controversy and has some sympathy for her predecessor. 
 ''I felt really bad for her,'' Danielle said. ''She ended up being valedictorian but losing a lot of other things. I remember everyone said she shouldn't care so much because it ended up hurting her.''
 Securing the No. 1 spot at her highly competitive high school was no easy thing, said Danielle, 18. She often studied until 2 in the morning. She took one Advanced Placement class in her sophomore year, five her junior year and four senior year. Why not five? Because her math class, ''Multivariable Calculus and Differential Equations,'' covered material beyond what the A.P. tests measure. 
 On top of her studies, there was mock trial, model congress and the policy debate team, along with four years on the track team. Oh yes, and there were those relaxing summers, like the one after her sophomore year, when she took a course on international law at Harvard Summer School, while at the same time completing a 50-hour internship with a law firm. ''Valedictorians are the type of people who take on too much and are unwilling to fail,'' she said. 
 Danielle, who will attend M.I.T. this fall, said she chose challenging courses and pushed herself because she wasn't sure what she ultimately wanted to do. She wasn't shocked to find out she had been named valedictorian -- she knew she was one of the three top students -- but tried to keep herself from wanting the honor too intensely.
 ''I really conditioned myself to not want it or expect it,'' Danielle said. ''I take things pretty stoically. It didn't set in for a while, and then I was really happy.''
 When the differences between the top student and the 10th come down to hundredths of a point, some administrators are questioning how meaningful the valedictorian distinction is.
 Thomas Moore, the principal at Wethersfield High School in Connecticut, said the school is considering eliminating class ranking but not the valedictorian tradition.
 ''Sometimes the difference between the No. 1 student and the No. 10 student are fractions within fractions,'' he said. ''But we're a very traditional town and there is some value in recognizing that one child and giving them the ability to speak at graduation.'' 
 Several administrators said that they are also looking at eliminating class ranking because ranking reduces students to a number and they would prefer that colleges take a close look at student transcripts and consider the broader student. Still, they maintain the grade point averages to determine the No. 1 and No. 2 spots. 
 Given all the drama over the honor, how do valedictorians fare in the long term? Karen D. Arnold, an associate professor of higher education at Boston College, spent more than 15 years studying valedictorians who graduated in 1981 from high schools across Illinois. Dr. Arnold found that high school valedictorians consistently did well in college and were generally well-rounded, successful people. They were not a group, however, who were particularly creative or who would achieve great distinction in life.
 ''They're kind of like wonderful organizational achievers,'' Dr. Arnold said. ''They're hard workers. They're not going to remold your organization, but they might lead it.'' 
 Dr. Arnold said she was familiar with the arguments in favor of eliminating valedictorians but believed the tradition should be maintained. ''There aren't many academic honors, and it is one of those labels that follows you through life, like the Heisman Trophy or Rhodes scholar,'' she said. ''To get rid of the one meaningful designation for what school is really all about seems like something we should do only with great caution.'' 
 Mr. Adler, Horace Greeley's 2003 co-valedictorian, works in management consulting. He graduated last year from Yale, where he found himself in the company of hundreds of other valedictorians. (''I think I dated at least two of them,'' he said.) 
 ''I'm still extremely proud of the honor, but if I were to give someone advice about how to think about it in the right way, it's that you have to think about this as a validation of what you're capable of and keep it in the back of your mind as a motivation,'' he said. ''But you can't be haughty about it, because there are so many people who you are going to meet who are just as smart as you.''

HEADLINE: Traffic Sputters On Auto Row

BYLINE: By SAKI KNAFO

 BODY:
GIVEN the standing of the automobile in New York's hierarchy of transportation modes, some city residents may be surprised to learn that there's a place in Manhattan known as Automobile Row. The strip, which extends from West 41st Street to 57th Street on 11th Avenue, is lined with dealerships, their tinted-glass facades and vast, serene interiors conjuring visions of suburbia. 
 Generally speaking, this is not a good time for American auto dealerships. Soaring gas prices and fears of a recession have contributed to a decline in car sales nationwide, and last year, according to the National Automotive Dealers Association, 430 franchised new-car dealerships closed. 
 Yet, while some dealerships on 11th Avenue are struggling, many others are reporting record sales. One recent afternoon at J-Mac's, an Irish bar on West 57th Street that is popular with the lunchtime dealership crowd, Victor Cabrera, a roadside assistant for a nearby Lexus establishment, addressed this phenomenon succinctly. 
 Had gas prices affected business at his company? 
 ''We're used to dealing with rich people,'' he replied. ''They don't care.'' 
 As it turns out, there are really two Automobile Rows: one in the 40s, where shoppers will mainly find midmarket brands like Honda and Dodge, and a separate cluster in the 50s, where luxury brands like Lexus and BMW are sold. 
 Audi Manhattan, at 629 West 54th Street, apparently belongs to the latter group. ''We don't sell cars to people that need transportation,'' said Raul Colon, the general manager. ''We sell cars that people aspire to.''
 On the other end of the strip, and the economic spectrum, is Manhattan Jeep Chrysler Dodge, on 11th Avenue near 48th Street. Tyrone Laws, a sales manager there, said the dealership had seen a decline in business recently. The decline might have been steeper, Mr. Laws said, had Chrysler not devised a special deal to attract new customers, offering to pay a portion of customers' fuel bills instead of giving them an ordinary rebate. ''It's definitely bringing people in,'' he said.
 One person for whom gas prices are a big concern is Mr. Cabrera, the roadside assistant at Lexus. Mr. Cabrera, a Dodge owner, used to drive his S.U.V. to work every day from the Norwood section of the Bronx. Now he rides the subway all the way from the 205th Street/Bainbridge station, the first stop on the D train in the borough. 
 ''It's the middle-class people who have to save some money,'' Mr. Cabrera said.

HEADLINE: City Directory Is New for '08 And Greener Than Ever

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
One legend has it that Vincent Impellitteri, an obscure legal secretary for a judge, was chosen for the Democratic ticket in 1945 by party leaders who plucked his name from the index of the Green Book.
 William O'Dwyer, their mayoral candidate, was Irish and from Brooklyn. Lazarus Joseph, the candidate for comptroller, was Jewish and from the Bronx. To balance the ticket, Tammany Democrats needed an Italian from Manhattan to run for City Council president.
 ''We flipped through the Green Book for the longest Italian name we could find,'' Bert Stand, the secretary of Tammany Hall, the venerable Democratic organization, said at the time. 
 The 2008 edition of the Green Book, the official name of the official directory of the City of New York, has just been published. The cover is green again, as it has been for all but one of the previous 79 editions (the last one, in 2005, was orange, a homage to the more or less saffron-colored fabric used in the ''Gates'' art installation that graced Central Park that year).
 The origins of the green cover are ambiguous, but the latest version is an unabashed advertisement for the environment. The front cover is dominated by a stylized Statue of Liberty. Her torch is a compact fluorescent lamp. The back cover proclaims: ''Help Make NYC Greener.''
 First published in 1918 at 112 pages and originally known as the ''little green book,'' it is no longer little. Since 2005, it has grown by 14 pages to 660, before the index of names, which also lists county, state, federal and even United Nations officials.
 The latest edition, priced at $19.95, already includes a 10-page insert of updates.
 It remains a vital tool for local Kremlinologists. In the 1970s, Robert Moses's name was dropped (he was still a consultant to the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority), an omission, The New York Times wrote, akin to dropping Scarlett O'Hara from ''Gone With the Wind.''
 Another year, the title page was torn out of thousands of copies because the comptroller's middle initial was wrong.
 This year, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has six entries (he also sits on the Banking Commission and is a trustee of the Fire Department pension fund and other boards), the same as Vincent E. Green, who is a deputy investigations commissioner and inspector general in several agencies. William C. Thompson Jr., the city comptroller, is listed eight times. Martha E. Stark, the finance commissioner, is most ubiquitous, with 11 listings.
 During the Depression, the directory was condensed to 32 pages to economize. During World War II, publication was suspended to save paper. It was suspended again, to save money, under Mayor John V. Lindsay in the early 1970s, but was resumed in 1974 under Mayor Abraham D. Beame.
 A New York Times book review of the directory in 1975 theorized that ''either Mayor Beame was becoming irked at having people continually call 566-5700 and ask why John Lindsay wasn't plowing the side streets out in Bellerose, or he simply wanted a Green Book with his name in gold on the cover, too.''
 In 1976, a special bicentennial edition celebrated the titles of some of New York's earliest officials, now generally, but not universally, considered to be anachronistic. They included the public whipper and the city scavenger.
 In 1985, bowing to the way most people referred to it, the city changed the directory's official name to the Green Book.
 The index of names has served as an unscientific gauge of government demography. Mr. Impellitteri, who would go on to succeed Mr. O'Dwyer, the last certifiably Irish mayor, was himself followed by Robert F. Wagner, who was half Irish. Under Mayor Wagner, the appropriately named Green Book listed 53 municipal officials whose last names began with O'. By 1990, there were half as many. The latest Green Book lists 14 -- outnumbered, this time, by 16 Rodriguezes.

HEADLINE: A Sale That Began In the Kitchen

BYLINE: By KEITH MULVIHILL. 
E-mail: mulvihill@nytimes.com

 BODY:
EVERYONE knows that the word ''recession'' can strike fear in the hearts of anxious home sellers far and wide. But there is another dreaded, but less talked about, ''R'' word capable of setting a seller's nerves on edge with a single utterance: renovation. 
 ''A lot of sellers don't want to deal with renovations,'' said Thomas Coates, a broker for Halstead Property. ''They are just scared of them. First there's the expense, and then there's the thought of putting up with no usable kitchen or bathroom for four to six weeks.'' 
 Last summer, when Mr. Coates got a call from a previous client, Bill Tooker, about wanting to sell his 800-square-foot one-bedroom apartment on the 11th floor of 10 West 15th Street, he went over for a fresh look. Mr. Tooker bought the place in 2006 for $685,000. 
 ''I remember when I helped Bill buy the apartment,'' Mr. Coates said. ''I thought the kitchen was dreary and dated.'' The countertops were mauve; the kitchen cabinets had frosted plastic windows. ''I told Bill that if he hoped to earn some money on the deal he should renovate it,'' he recalled.
 To his relief, Mr. Tooker agreed. Persuading prospective home sellers to go the extra mile (or two) is not easily accomplished. ''People say to me, 'This is the way it looks; I am not spending any money,' '' Mr. Coates said. ''And yet, they still want top dollar.'' 
 Mr. Tooker, 44, a financial analyst for a Manhattan clothing manufacturer, began by researching the cost of a gut-renovated kitchen. ''I started out by going to Home Depot and Ikea,'' he said, and he found he could do the job for about $20,000. ''But I thought: 'This is a good property in a good building, I need to do this right.' '' He settled on Elyotto Kitchen & Bath on 10th Avenue in Midtown. 
 In the end, he paid $37,000 for his new galley kitchen. This included everything: pipe reconfiguration, wall repairs, custom wood cabinets by Heritage, limestone-tiled flooring, granite countertops and new appliances. The entire job took four weeks to complete. 
 In October 2007, when Mr. Coates visited again, ''I was blown away,'' he recalled, upon seeing the new kitchen. ''It was a knockout.'' 
 He was also pleased to see that Mr. Tooker had acted on another piece of advice. ''I suggested he buy at least one high-end name-brand item and the rest should be good, solid brands like GE Profile,'' Mr. Coates said. The splurge was a built-in Bosch dishwasher. ''That's something I can put on the sell sheet.''
 And Mr. Coates's next bit of advice? Wait. With the holidays fast approaching, Mr. Coates said, he thought it was best to put the apartment on the market in January, after the holiday real-estate shopping lull. Mr. Tooker again heeded his advice, and in mid-January they listed the apartment for $879,000. 
 ''We settled on that figure primarily due to a similarly sized apartment on a lower floor that sold for $850,000 in fall 2007,'' Mr. Coates said. ''Aside from the brand-new kitchen, Bill's place had a better view and a window in the kitchen, so I felt comfortable starting out at a higher number.''
 The listing went live on the Halstead Web site on a Monday, and the next day he got calls from brokers hoping to get their clients inside for a peek. ''I think I showed it twice the first day by appointment,'' Mr. Coates said. Later that Tuesday, he heard from another Halstead colleague who thought her clients would be very interested.
 The eager apartment shoppers were Allison and Greg Reilly. They came to the apartment at 9 a.m. on Wednesday with their broker -- and a dilemma. ''We already had an accepted offer on a different place nearby, but we weren't in contract yet,'' said Mr. Reilly, 26, a lawyer.
 But the other place needed a gut renovation, and as first-time buyers, the Reillys were feeling skittish. ''We figured we had a day or two more before we had to turn in the paperwork,'' said Mrs. Reilly, a structural engineer, also 26.
 The couple said they hadn't even spoken to each other while touring the apartment. But afterward, in the elevator ride down to the lobby, the truth came out. ''We liked it better,'' Mrs. Reilly said. 
 ''It felt so big,'' she recalled. ''We never had a place that had room for a dining room table with chairs before. And the kitchen totally sold us.''
 ''The cabinets were the first thing I noticed,'' Mrs. Reilly added. ''We love dark wood.'' What's more, the cabinets, appealingly, opened upward, like the futuristic gull-wing doors of a DeLorean sports car, Mr. Reilly noted.
 The granite countertop, glass-tile backsplash and stainless steel appliances were all a hit. ''We thought, this is exactly how we would have done it had we done it ourselves -- but without the stress,'' Mrs. Reilly said.
 The two conferred with their broker who phoned Mr. Coates a while later. Unbeknown to any of them, the previous day's lookers had left a message with Mr. Coates offering close to asking price. 
 A flurry of phone calls ensued. The Reillys came back with a two-pronged offer -- and rushed their financials to Mr. Coates. They put in a full asking price bid of $879,000 with the condition that Mr. Tooker would be out in four months, or an option of $890,000 if he could be out in three months, a time frame that coincided with the expiring lease on their apartment in Jersey City. 
 ''It was more than we wanted to pay,'' Mr. Reilly said, ''but the maintenance on this place was the lowest of nearly all of the places we had seen.'' The monthly payment is $871. In addition, the couple asked Mr. Tooker to forgo more showings of the apartment.
 Mr. Tooker was willing to take his chances on buying a new place in a flash, and opted for the higher amount. ''Once I learned that they were such solid buyers,'' he said, ''I didn't hesitate. We had the contract signed in a week's time.'' 
 The quick deal offered him another advantage. ''I had been through the whole open house thing once before,'' he said, referring to a previous apartment. ''Having to spend Sundays out of your apartment is not fun. I was happy not having to deal with that.'' 
 Did he think the kitchen renovation had made a difference? ''Absolutely, without a doubt,'' he said.
 The deal closed on May 7. 
 Aside from getting a place that they loved, the Reillys got something else that had seemed a distant fantasy: a short commute home after a night out on the town. ''We used to have to take the E train to the World Trade Center stop and wait there forever for the PATH train,'' Mr. Reilly said. 
 As for Mr. Tooker, he got something he had always wanted, too: no mortgage. He paid all cash for a large alcove studio on West 13th Street, with a spacious balcony to watch the sunset.

HEADLINE: Why Oil and Wages Don't Mix

BYLINE: By BEN STEIN. 
Ben Stein is a lawyer, writer, actor and economist. E-mail: ebiz@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Oh what a circus, oh what a show,
 America has gone to town,
 Over the death of a mineral called cheap gasoline.
 We've all gone crazy,
 Mourning all day and mourning all night,
 Falling over ourselves to get all of the misery right. ... 
 WITH great apologies for the above to the greatest librettists and musical show composers of all time, the guys who brought us ''Evita,'' let us sit down upon the ground and tell sad stories of the death of a beloved hydrocarbon. 
 Now, what I am about to say may shock you. As of this spring in our country, before the immense climb in gasoline prices, the purchase of gasoline and oil amounted to barely 2 percent of national income. Barely 2 percent. Suppose the prices have risen by one-fourth since then. Now gasoline and oil would be roughly 2.5 percent of the total. 
 Or look at it another way. As of this spring, gasoline and oil and heating oil together amounted to about 2.5 percent of total personal consumption expenditures in this great country. Considering the recent price increases, these goods might account for slightly more than 3 percent of such expenditures now. (All of these calculations come from numbers in the March report to Congress from the Council of Economic Advisers.) We are talking about several hundred billion dollars here. I could have a lot of fun with that money, rescuing lost dogs and cats, but it's not enough to shake the foundations of the nation, at least not a nation of this size.
 Certainly, it's not enough to affect even vaguely the incomes of upper-class or upper-middle-income people. The average driver travels about 12,000 miles a year, and if he or she gets 15 miles per gallon (not good mileage at all), the annual gasoline bill would have been about $3,200 a month ago and maybe $3,600 now (if the vehicle uses premium). For people who make a half-million dollars a year, that's pennies. The increase from a year or two ago also means little to them.
 The problem comes in another, staggering set of government numbers. (Economists argue about the validity of using these numbers over long periods, but they capture the sorrow of the situation.) Get this, friends: from 1947 to about 1973 -- from the days from the great Harry S. Truman to the great Richard M. Nixon -- real hourly pay for nongovernment workers rose by about 40 percent. The peak year was the one before R.N. left for San Clemente in 1974. Since then, real wages both hourly and weekly for all nongovernment workers, on average, have fallen by about 5 percent, very roughly.
 There are all kinds of reasons for this, ranging from the larger size and different composition of the labor force to the devastating foreign competition in manufacturing, which tends to set a limit on other wages as well.
 But the trend is dismal. The average private worker now earns very roughly $600 a week, not counting fringe benefits. For this worker, gasoline might well account for close to one-tenth of his or her earnings. If the price of gas goes up 25 percent, the effect is serious. To put it mildly, people making $600 a week do not have a lot of leeway on spending.
 As I see it, the problem is not the price of oil generally. (I think that the price will decline somewhat before long, but the long-term trend is very much up.) The problem is the stagnation of wages. Please bear in mind that the numbers I gave are averages. Skilled workers make much more. Lawyers, doctors, investment bankers, accountants, dentists -- they all make more. ( I just paid two dentists a total of more than $10,000 -- I am not kidding -- to have one poor old tooth get a root canal and a crown, and I'm not finished with that miserable tooth yet. I paid for 90 percent of it out of my own pocket. I do earn more than the ordinary citizen, but nothing by Wall Street standards.) 
 But, obviously, a heck of a lot of workers make less. Imagine what it means to minimum-wage workers for gasoline to surge past $4 a gallon.
 What is to be done? The federal government can do little to make the price of oil fall in the short run, except, perhaps, for one basic thing: balance the budget. The world price of oil is denominated in dollars. The dollar is weak for many reasons, but a big one is the immense budget deficits run by our government. If President Bush and Senators John McCain and Barack Obama were to stand together in front of a camera and solemnly swear that they would balance the budget in four years, even if it required tax increases on people earning millions, the dollar would rise against the euro, and oil would fall in dollars.
 But that will not happen. So the only thing for workers to do is to drive less, buy fuel-efficient cars and trucks and, above all, whip their children into a frenzy to get more education. Not many doctors and lawyers are worried about the high price of gasoline. Not many people at hedge funds are worried about filling the tanks of their Bentleys.
 WE need more human capital in our labor force and more efficiency in fuel use. These will have to reverse the trend in real wages and the real cost of gasoline. Balancing the budget would be good, too, but I won't hold my breath. Meanwhile, it's all a bit discouraging -- especially the trend for wages. But we will get through it, just as we get through everything else, one adaptive, smart American at a time.

HEADLINE: A SWIMMER CERTAIN AGE WHAT IT TAKES FOR A 41-YEAR-OLD TO MAKE THE OLYMPICS

 BODY:
NEAR THE WARM-UP POOL AT THE Missouri Grand Prix swim meet, in Columbia, a crop of Olympic hopefuls lolled around in practice suits and towels on a Saturday morning in February. Fully clothed among them stood some relics of Olympics past: Scott Goldblatt, who won a gold medal in the 2004 Games, wore an aqua sport coat and a striped tie and was doing on-air commentary for Swimnetwork.com; Mel Stewart, who won two golds and a bronze in 1992, wore the same goofy get-up, working as Goldblatt's sidekick. Meanwhile, Dara Torres, who won the first of her nine Olympic medals in 1984, a year before Michael Phelps was born, stripped off her baggy T-shirt and sweat pants, revealing a breathtaking body in a magenta Speedo. She pulled on a cap marked with her initials and prepared to swim. Torres is now 41 and the mother of a 2-year-old daughter, Tessa Grace. She broke her first of three world records in 1982, at 14, and she has retired from swimming and come back three times, her latest effort built on an obsessive attention to her aging body. 
 Torres's retinue includes a head coach, a sprint coach, a strength coach, two stretchers, two masseuses, a chiropractor and a nanny, at the cost of at least $100,000 per year. At the Olympic trials, this week, in Omaha, Neb., she's expected to swim fast enough to make her fifth Olympic team. If she does, she'll be the first American swimmer to compete in five Olympics (despite sitting out 1996 and 2004). She'll also be oldest female swimmer in the history of the Olympic games. 
 Stewart walked over to give Torres a hug, but he stopped himself short. ''I don't want to mess anything up,'' he said, laughing, patting the air around her torso. 
 Last November in Germany, Torres clocked 23.82 seconds in the 50-meter freestyle short course, breaking the American record and making her one of only five women to swim the event in less than 24 seconds. The day after she got home to South Florida, she had a bone spur shaved out of her shoulder. In early January, she had another operation, to deal with a torn meniscus in her knee. Now just five weeks after the latest procedure, Torres looked great. She flashed her wide-open smile at Stewart and dove in the pool. Stewart retreated to Goldblatt and shrugged. ''Hey, we'd all be in there if we could be winning,'' he said.
 As Torres swam, her nearly six-foot frame stretching out across the water, her head coach, Michael Lohberg, checked her hip rotation and distance per stroke, while Torres's two stretchers, who moved from Connecticut to Florida to aid in her training, looked for small asymmetries and tensions in her body. Torres treats her body the way a motorhead treats his car: obsessively tuning it up, sparing no expense. If you study Torres's face and neck, you can see some faint signs of her 40-plus years. But barring the 13 small surgical incisions on her knees, elbows, shoulders, hands and fingers, her physique looks nearly flawless. Rowdy Gaines, who in 1996 was the oldest swimmer (at 35) to qualify for the American Olympic swimming trials, recently described Torres to me as having ''the perfect swimmer's body; really, it's the picture they'd draw in the dictionary.'' Her posture is gangly, loose and cocky, like a teenage boy's. Her proportions more closely resemble the long inverted triangle of Phelps -- broad shoulders, long torso, slim hips, long arms -- than the more tightly muscled curves of two of the biggest names in American women's swimming, Natalie Coughlin and Katie Hoff. 
 Torres is known for being both competitive and compulsive. Each year, on her mother's birthday, she tries to beat her siblings to be the first to call. In February, when a group of swimmers appeared on ''The Today Show'' to promote the new Speedo LZR suit, a Speedo rep offered $100 to the first athlete to say www.speedo.com; guess who won the money? Torres's partner, David Hoffman, a reproductive endocrinologist, who is Tessa's father, describes Torres's personality as ''not type A. She's type A + +.'' As if to explain, one evening, over dinner with Torres, her mother and me, Hoffman mentioned how challenging it can be to do any kind of physical exercise with Torres. ''When we go on bike rides, she's gone,'' Hoffman said.
 ''That's not true!'' Torres objected. ''I wait for you!''
 Hoffman raised his eyebrows, resting his case.
 After her swim, Torres returned to her hotel to eat lunch, nap and tear two LZR swimsuits worth $1,000 -- Speedo failed to send Torres's size, 27 long, and suggested she squeeze into 26 regular. Then she headed back to the aquatic center in the late afternoon. Gone was the morning's big smile. Torres was now 149 pounds of focus. Her body kept warm in a knit cap and Ugg boots, she lay on a yoga mat in the gymnasium, readying herself for the preliminaries of the 50-meter freestyle. Most swimmers prep for races by pinwheeling their arms and trying to relax. For Torres, the chore is far more elaborate, as her two stretchers work in tandem to contort and flex her body, in a 20-minute preswim version of the two-hour sequence they do three times a week at her home. 
 Swimmers refer to the 50-meter freestyle as ''the splash and dash.'' You dive, hit the water, go all out for about 20 seconds and then reach for the wall. In the preliminaries, Torres streaked down the pool in 24.89 seconds, placing second behind the 22-year-old Kara Lynn Joyce. She was pleased with her performance.
 The next morning, back at the aquatic center for the finals, Torres appeared more interior. As her stretchers made last-minute adjustments -- during competitions they stretch her five times a day -- she stared at the ceiling, listening to her iPod. Up on the blocks, Torres looked taller and fitter than the seven other women, who were between 12 and 20 years her junior. Torres dried her block with a towel, bent down to start and this time touched the wall in 24.85 seconds, just ahead of Natalie Coughlin and again behind Joyce. 
 Within minutes, the three women stood on a podium. A college kid hung a silver medal around Torres's neck. 
 ''Can I see it?'' a high-school swimmer asked Torres after she stepped down.
 Torres does not relish coming in second. ''Sure,'' she said. ''You can have it.'' 
 TORRES LOVES TO WIN, but not as much as she hates to lose. Growing up in Beverly Hills, the fifth of six children and the older of two girls, Torres started following her brothers to swim practice at the local Y.M.C.A. at age 7 and later joined the Culver City swim team. As a kid, Torres didn't have much of a work ethic, but she did do whatever it took to come in first. Torres's mother, Marylu Kauder, a former model, told me that one of her earliest memories of her daughter swimming was watching Torres during practice swim halfway across the pool and then stop and turn around so she could beat her teammates back to the wall. Torres lived a privileged life -- her childhood home had 10 bathrooms. Still, when she broke the world record in the 50-meter freestyle, at 14, the achievement didn't seem to impress or surprise anyone much in the Torres household. As Torres recalls, her brothers said, ''Congratulations, whatever.'' Torres's own response wasn't far more pronounced: ''Someone told me I was the fastest in the world, and I thought, O.K., that's neat. But those things really don't stay with me.'' 
 During her junior year in high school, Torres moved down to Mission Viejo, Calif., to train for the 1984 Olympics with Mark Schubert, who was coaching one of the best teams in the country and who is now the head coach of the U.S.A. Swimming National Team. ''There are some athletes who love to train but are afraid to race,'' Schubert explained to me. ''In high school Dara was the opposite. I wouldn't say she loved to train. But when it was swim-meet time, that's when she'd really shine.'' Despite this, the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles did not go as planned for Torres. At one point, she recalls, she peeked out to the pool from the athletes' tent because she wanted to see her friend Rowdy Gaines swim. ''I remember lifting up the bottom and seeing 17,000 people and I just freaked out. I got hot, I had to go to the nurse's station, they were putting ice packs on me.'' Torres swam so poorly in the preliminaries of the 4X100-meter freestyle relay (the 50-meter freestyle did not become an Olympic event until 1988) that the coaches even considered whether they could substitute a veteran for Torres in the finals that evening. But that afternoon a team captain took Torres back to the dorm to watch soap operas and managed to calm her down. In the finals, Torres swam her leg in 55.92 seconds, a personal best, and the team won a gold medal. Still, Torres describes those Olympics as ''just scary.''
 At the University of Florida, which Torres started attending in 1985, practice became a much more prominent and difficult part of her life. The coaches routinely weighed all the swimmers, and if a swimmer didn't make weight, he or she had to swim extra morning workouts. At Florida, Torres earned 28 N.C.A.A. all-American swimming awards, the maximum number possible during a college career, but she also became bulimic, forcing herself to throw up to make weight. In the summer of 1988, between her junior and senior years of college, Torres was ranked No. 1 in the world in the 100-meter freestyle. But as she puts it, she ''just couldn't get it together'' in Seoul at the 1988 Olympics, Torres placed seventh in the 100-meter freestyle; again she won medals only in relays, a silver and a bronze. Near the end of the games, Torres overheard the East German swimmer Kristin Otto, who won gold medals in the 50- and 100-meter freestyle, tell a reporter, ''I thought I'd have more competition out of Dara Torres.'' ''That was a knife in my back and my heart,'' Torres told me. 
 Once her college career ended, Torres decided to retire. But before long she felt the urge to compete again and was elected an Olympic team captain for the 1992 games in Barcelona. With her bulimia in check, she won a gold in a freestyle relay, yet it was her only event. ''I would say 1992 was less than stellar by her standards,'' Schubert told me, adding sympathetically, ''I don't ever remember her being good enough for her.'' Torres had no individual medals to her name, and her growing collection of relay medals presented a complicated prize. She kept them under her bed in her apartment in New York, where, she told me, they turned black with tarnish.
 After 1992, Torres lived what appeared to be a glamorous life. She became the first athlete model in the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue, married and divorced Jeff Gowen, a sports producer, kept fit running and cycling in Central Park and playing basketball at the Reebok gym. But in the spring of 1999, despite not having been in a pool, except to cool down, in seven years, Torres decided she wanted to compete in the 2000 games and moved to California to train. After only five months, Torres's time in the 50-meter freestyle was 0.3 seconds faster than the world record she set in that event more than 15 years earlier. In Sydney in 2000, Torres, then 33, won three individual Olympic medals -- bronzes in the 50-meter freestyle, 100-meter freestyle and 100-meter butterfly. She won two gold medals in relays as well. Though she instantly missed the intensity of training for the Olympics -- she told me she cried on the way to the required urine test after her last race, sad that it was over and unsure what to do with her life -- she came home and again retired. ''I felt like I really didn't have anything else to prove to myself,'' she told me. ''Plus, I thought 33 was really old. And I was tired.''
 Over the next five years, Torres married and divorced again, this time an Israeli surgeon named Itzhak Shasha, and was inducted in the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame. (Torres's father, Edward Torres, a real-estate developer, was Jewish, and she converted before marrying Shasha.) She also became the first woman to win the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach car race; when asked to explain why she entered the event, she replied, ''I'm so freaking competitive it's unbelievable.'' Then, in the fall of 2005, after struggling for years to have a baby, Torres finally became pregnant with Tessa. At the time, she began swimming again for exercise, because, she says, she had terrible morning sickness and she'd ''rather throw up in the pool gutter than next to the StairMaster.'' But predictably, Torres soon found herself racing ''whoever the middle-aged guy happened to be in the next lane,'' even when she was noticeably pregnant. Three and a half months postpartum, she raced at the Masters World Championships. Fifteen minutes after nursing Tessa in the bathroom, she swam the first leg of the 50-meter freestyle relay in 25.98 seconds -- fast enough to qualify for this week's Olympic trials. 
 A WEEK AFTER THE MISSOURI GRAND PRIX, in the muggy South Florida haze, Torres rolled up to the Coral Springs Swim Club at 7:45 a.m. for an 8:00 practice, because, as she explained in a text message: ''. . . hate getting there last! You'd think I would have grown out of that, but I still hate anything to do with being last!!'' 
 As a swimmer of a certain age, Torres takes much longer to recover between workouts. In college she swam 10 practices a week, for a total of about 65,000 meters. Now she swims five, totaling around 25,000 meters. In the water, she does the same workouts as the other sprinters on her team -- timed sets, kicking and drills -- and she dispatches each with her signature flawless technique and the happy-to-be-there enthusiasm of a woman who was supposed to have hung up her Speedo many years ago. ''Isn't he nice to look at?'' Torres whispered to me, cocking her head toward her training partner, the 6-foot-4, well-muscled, 28-year-old Bulgarian Ray Antonov. At the end of practice they kissed each other four times on the cheek. ''It's a Bulgarian thing,'' Torres said, laughing. 
 Torres's innovations for keeping her body in top shape as she advances deeper into middle age are almost entirely out of the pool. In Florida, after her two-hour water workout, Torres changed into a black workout top and shorts and met her strength coach, Andy O'Brien, in the gym. Over the past year and a half, O'Brien, who is also the strength coach of the Florida Panthers hockey team, has switched Torres's focus away from heavy, static weightlifting and geared her training toward balanced, dynamic exercises that stimulate her central nervous system. ''The idea is not to isolate muscle groups but to get muscles contracting together in the right sequences,'' O'Brien explains. Weight training, he notes, grew out of bodybuilding, and that low-rep high-weight tradition is ill suited for a sprinter since a body comprised of big muscles that have been trained to produce force only individually wastes considerable energy trying to move. O'Brien says speed derives from highly coordinated movements and fluid timing. Under his tutelage Torres is 12 pounds lighter, stronger and more cut than she was in 2000. Torres told me that it took her head coach, Lohberg, a little while to embrace O'Brien's program, but she says, ''I'm swimming really fast now, so he can't complain.''
 Torres does her weight training for 60 to 90 minutes, four times a week. On this day, O'Brien coached Torres through a series of exercises that she did while lying on a large exercise ball -- lifting weights, doing crunches with weights behind her head. She also performed cross-body pulls with another large ball in her arms. Throughout, O'Brien kept his eyes on Torres's shoulders and upper back (and several of the young men on the team kept their eyes on O'Brien, unable to afford his services themselves but eager to see what they could learn). Nearly everyone in Torres's orbit is in awe of her body -- its beauty, its strength, its form. ''Look at the way her scapula is traveling!'' O'Brien enthused, noting the place where she just had an operation. ''Dara repairs 10 times faster than most athletes. Considering her age and the length of time she's been training, it's pretty amazing.''
 After grabbing a steak salad for lunch, Torres drove home (fast) to be stretched. Torres puts as much energy -- and money -- into her workout recovery as she does into her training. Nearly everybody I spoke to for this article struggled to find a way to say gracefully that Torres's considerable financial resources -- sponsorships from Toyota and Speedo; money she has earned from modeling, TV work and motivational speaking; plus a private sponsor for training expenses -- are helping her gain speed. Torres books a massage three times a week and visits, as she needs to, a chiropractor, who works his bald head to a frothy sweat as he tries to stick his hand under her shoulder blade. This afternoon, however, she was getting her two-hour stretch. BlackBerry in hand, pink flower bolster from Tessa's bed under her legs, Torres lay on her kitchen floor gossiping with her stretchers, as they used their bodies to guide her limbs into precise angles and knead knots and sometimes small pieces of scar tissue out of her muscles. 
 ''Dara and I haven't seen each other in like 10 hours, so we have to catch up,'' Anne Tierney, one of the stretchers, explained as she sat on a chair near Torres's head. Her partner, Steve Sierra, sat on a chair near Torres's side, and the two proceeded to ''mash,'' or massage Torres's shoulders and legs with their feet -- sometimes standing on her body -- so their hands wouldn't tire and they could apply more force. After 45 minutes, they began Torres's resistance-stretching sequence, a series of maneuvers that looks like a cross between a yoga class, a massage and a Cirque du Soleil performance. The concept behind resistance stretching is that muscles can gain more flexibility if they're contracted and stretched at the same time. At one point Torres rolled onto her stomach, tucking one leg underneath her chest (in what yogis call pigeon pose). Then Tierney leaned her torso against Torres's slightly bent back leg, pushing it toward Torres's glutes, as Torres worked to overcome Tierney's force and straighten out that leg. Later, Torres moved up onto a massage table and Tierney and Sierra worked on her tensor fascia latae, a muscle that starts on the outside of hip and extends down the leg. Sierra used his hands and shoulders to rotate Torres's thigh externally; Tierney stood at the foot of the table, pulling outward on Torres's calf near the ankle. 
 Torres calls resistance stretching her ''secret weapon.'' Bob Cooley, who invented the discipline, describes it in less-modest terms. According to Cooley, over a two-week period in 1999, his flexibility system turned Torres ''from being an alternate on the relay team to the fastest swimmer in America.'' The secret to Torres's speed, Cooley says, is that his technique not only makes her muscles more flexible but also increases their ability to shorten more completely, and when muscles shorten more completely, they produce greater power and speed. ''What do race-car drivers do when they want to go faster?'' Cooley asks. ''They don't spend more hours driving around the track. They increase the biomechanics of the car. And that's what resistance flexibility is doing for Dara -- increasing her biomechanics.''
 Moments from the end of Torres's workday -- her swim workout, her gym workout and her two-hour stretching session nearly complete -- Tessa ran into the kitchen, shouting, ''Mama!'' The toddler clearly takes after her mom: even at age 2, she's working on driving her plastic car between the Mini Cooper and the Lexus S.U.V. in the garage, while standing up. Tessa distracted herself in the living room full of toys while Sierra finished with Torres, first working his fingers under her rib cage, a painful technique that, unexpectedly, helps with shoulder rotation, and then pressing very firmly with the heels of his hands on Torres's solar plexus, as if doing CPR. None of this is comfortable -- I had the distinct pleasure of being stretched by Tierney and Sierra myself -- but Torres has a very high threshold for pain and the willingness to endure it.
 ''O.K., Tessie!'' Torres finally yelled, standing up from the table and sliding on her flip-flops. ''Outside? Race ya!'' 
 UPON HEARING THAT TORRES is likely to make the Olympic team at age 41, many people have the same question: How is this possible? Kinesiologists counter with a different query: Why are you so surprised? ''Dara is extremely impressive, but she's not as unique as people think,'' says Michael Joyner, a competitive athlete and anesthesiologist at the Mayo Clinic who writes scholarly papers about aging and sports. ''Ted Williams hit .388 when he was 39. Jack Foster did very well in the Olympic marathon when he was 40. Karl Malone earned a triple-double in an N.B.A. game at 40. Jeannie Longo won a French time-trial championship in cycling at age 47.'' Torres's events -- short swims -- are also well suited to competitors of advanced age. Compared to, say, running, swimming is more technique-intensive and produces fewer injuries. Sprints are also kinder to older athletes, in that strength falls off more gradually than aerobic power. In April, at 37, Mark Foster, a freestyle sprinter in England, came out of retirement and earned a spot, for the fifth time, on the British Olympic swim team. ''For those of us who pay attention to this stuff,'' Joyner said, ''Dara's performance is unusual but not totally unexpected.''
 So why do we assume a middle-aged swimmer must be all washed up? Because for nonelite athletes, sporting achievements fall off precipitously with age. Body composition changes toward more fat and less muscle. Strength and aerobic capacity decrease as well. But a primary reason that athletic performance degrades in adulthood is changes in priorities. People tend to devote more time and energy to jobs and families than to sports. Even committed athletes downgrade their workout goals from achieving personal bests to staying in shape. Academics refer to this reduction in physical activity as hypokinesis. The phenomenon is not limited to humans. A 1985 study showed that rats with unlimited access to running wheels exercised less as they aged. ''But look at people who maintain activity levels,'' says Joel Stager, a professor of kinesiology at Indiana University. ''It's a different story! A lot of what we assume is aging is just progressive hypokinesis. How many people at Dara's age have maintained their training consistently? I'm going to say there are very, very few.''
 Even childbirth needn't be a sports-career killer. In 1972, in The Journal of the American Medical Association, E. Zaharieva published a study of 13 women who were pregnant and then competed in the 1964 Olympic Games. Most resumed serious training between three and six months after giving birth. All said, Zaharieva wrote, ''they became stronger, had greater stamina and were more balanced in every way after having a child.'' Last September, Lindsay Davenport was back on the pro tennis tour and winning just three months after giving birth, while in November, Paula Radcliffe won the New York City Marathon less than 10 months after having a baby. 
 So how long can peak athletic performance last? Hirofumi Tanaka, the director of the Cardiovascular Aging Research Laboratory at the University of Texas at Austin, found that both elite and nonelite runners and swimmers could maintain personal bests until age 35, after which performance declined in a gradual, linear fashion until about age 50 to 60 for runners and 70 for swimmers. Deterioration was rapid from there. Tanaka also found that swimmers experienced more modest declines than runners and that swim sprinters, like Torres, experienced the smallest declines of all. At Yale University, Ray Fair, a runner and an economist, crunched statistics on aging and peak athletic performance and created what he calls the Fair Model. The model provides a table of coefficients that enable an athlete to take a personal-best time and compute how long he or she should expect to take to complete that same event at a specific point later in life (assuming he or she has continued to train at the same level). According to the Fair Model, a woman who swam a personal best 24.63 seconds in the 50-meter freestyle at or before age 35 should expect to clock 25.37 seconds at age 41. ''I am struck by how small the deterioration rates are,'' Fair wrote in a paper titled ''How Fast Do Old Men Slow Down?'' ''It may be that societies have been too pessimistic about losses from aging for individuals who stay healthy and fit.''
 Historically, the economics of swimming have also contributed to the preponderance of young champions. Little sponsorship money existed for swimmers until about 10 years ago, which tended to mean that once a swimmer graduated from college, the gig was up -- it was time to get a job. But now Speedo and TYR, among other companies in the swimming business, make it possible for elite American swimmers to train full time and continue to be competitive well into their 20s and 30s. This can't fully counteract ''black-line fatigue'' -- burnout from spending too many hours staring at the bottom of a pool; Phelps insists he's retiring at age 30 -- but the money is pulling elite swimmers' ages up. Economists who study sports, like Raymond Sauer at Clemson University, note that if athletes are economically motivated enough -- if, says Sauer, they have ''low wealth and poor income-earning alternatives''-- they can stay in sports until a quite advanced age. Stager, at Indiana University, notes that the average age of competitors at national swimming championships increased from 16 in the 1960s to 20 in 2004. 
 Despite evidence that older athletes can remain competitive longer than many imagine, Torres's achievements have provoked consistent rumors that she must be doping. These began at the Sydney Olympics in 2000 and have been so persistent in Torres's latest comeback that last September Torres flew to Colorado Springs, Colo., to meet with Travis T. Tygart, C.E.O. of the United States Anti-Doping Agency. Tygart acknowledges that since the high-profile steroid scandals involving Barry Bonds and Marion Jones, the onus has fallen on athletes to prove that they're clean, and that that's nearly impossible to do. ''Can U.S.A.D.A. give Dara or some other athlete the stamp of cleanliness?'' Tygart asks. ''No, the science isn't there yet.'' Every athlete who is training for the Olympics is subject to testing at any time, in or out of competition. But Tygart was able to offer Torres the chance to volunteer for a pilot program that tests more broadly blood and urine for signs of doping and presumably will catch a much higher percentage of dirty athletes. Torres said yes. (Jones, among others, passed less-sophisticated U.S.A.D.A. tests while using performance-enhancing drugs.) Tygart has not yet released any data on Torres's testing. But he says the fact she volunteered is significant. ''I think a dirty athlete would be crazy to volunteer for this program,'' he told me. He was also heartened that Torres did not ask how the pilot's protocols worked or what drugs they would be looking for.
 EVEN TORRES KNOWS that if she manages to earn one of the two spots available on the Olympic team for the 50-meter freestyle, or one of the six available on the 100-meter freestyle (which includes a relay team), this will be her last trip to the Games. Mark Schubert, the national team's coach in 1984, told me he's sure Torres will hold master's swimming records in freestyle sprints at age 50 and 60 and 70. But -- let's face it -- compared with the Olympics, even the Masters World Championship is a glorified losers' round, and holding a master's world record is hardly an exciting achievement for an athlete who hit the world stage just as she entered high school and who has nine Olympic medals to her name. Driving home one night from a sushi dinner, Torres's partner, David Hoffman, admitted that he'll be relieved when Torres emerges from her Olympic training tunnel. ''We don't spend as much time together,'' he told me as he idled his car outside their home. ''We can't go on a vacation.'' Torres had driven home separately with Tessa. Hoffman watched the swimmer standing in their driveway at dusk, her mind clearly turned toward getting Tessa to bed, so that she could get nine hours of sleep herself. ''I can't wait until this is over,'' Hoffman sighed. ''It'll have been two years.''
 Still, the next morning Torres rolled back up to the pool, chipper and early as usual. ''Hey, Dara,'' one of her teammates called, ''I heard you were going up for 'Dancing With the Stars'?''
 ''I can't dance,'' Torres laughed, dipping her goggles in the pool. ''No way if I'm going to be the first one off!''
 And with that, Torres grabbed her workout sheet, stuck it to the side of the pool and got down to business. The mood at practice was calm, and as Torres warmed up, her lean frame stretched out among the 16 other spectacular bodies, it was easy to forget that before last year nobody believed that a 41-year-old mother of a toddler, coming off a six-year hiatus, could swim this fast. 
 According to her coach, Michael Lohberg, Torres should feel less pressure than his other, younger swimmers. ''What's the worst thing that can happen to her?'' he asks. ''She goes home to her daughter and her partner. Her whole sense of self-worth doesn't come down to tenths and hundredths of seconds in a pool.'' But Torres doesn't necessarily agree with that opinion. She takes seriously her new role: hero of the middle-aged. About an hour into the morning's workout, all the swimmers gathered in the center of the pool for a much-loathed drill, vertical kicking. The task at hand was to hoist one's torso out of the water, using only a flutter or dolphin kick, for 40 seconds, 12 times, with 35-second breaks between each rep. For the last 10 seconds of each vertical kick, the coach yelled, ''Streamline,'' meaning the swimmers, while still kicking, had to extend their arms straight overhead, one hand on top of the other. 
 At first Torres led good-natured griping among the swimmers. But after five kicks, the sets were done in silence, all of the athletes too exhausted and miserable to complain. The coach even stopped yelling, as his swimmers' eyes were on the clock; everyone knew when to pop up and when to come back down. Yet each time, Torres rose to her vertical kick a second before everybody else, and there she was, rising out of the water, for a few moments longer at the end.

HEADLINE: Fuel for Inequality

BYLINE: By ROBERT B. REICH

 BODY:
AS if the widening wage gap weren't bad enough, the bottom half of the American work force -- everyone who will earn less than about $42,000 this year -- is getting hit by the equivalent of a whopping regressive tax in the form of soaring gas prices. And fuel isn't a discretionary item like cable TV that can be cut from the family budget. 
 On average, Americans now spend 4 percent of their income on gas. But this figure varies significantly. People who live in impoverished Wilcox County in Alabama, for example, spend 16 percent of their income on gas, while residents of affluent Hunterdon County in New Jersey spend 2 percent.
 Poorer Americans also tend to drive older cars that get lousy mileage. They don't trade them in as often as wealthier people do, and can't afford hybrids or new models that use gas more efficiently. And it's not unusual for their jobs to require them to haul stuff from one place to another in pickup trucks or vans that guzzle even more gas.
 Low-wage workers in rural areas are taking the biggest hit, but those who work in cities aren't faring much better. It used to be that the very poor inhabited central cities and the working class lived in the inner suburbs, but now that the rich are moving back into town, the poor are being pushed outward. Retail, restaurant, hospital and hotel employees who work in upscale cities often must look 30 to 50 miles from their jobs for affordable housing. Their longer commutes mean they need to spend more on gas.
 It's true that those on the bottom half of the economic ladder make greater use of public transportation, but they're having a harder time finding it. Budget constraints are causing states and cities to reduce rail and bus services. A survey of the nation's public transit agencies released last month showed that 21 percent of rail operators and 19 percent of bus operators are cutting service. 
 The wage gap in America continues to widen. And the gas gap is giving it additional fuel.

HEADLINE: Weighing the Costs Of a Look Inside the Heart

BYLINE: By ALEX BERENSON and REED ABELSON

 BODY:
A group of cardiologists recently had a proposition for Dr. Andrew Rosenblatt, who runs a busy heart clinic in San Francisco: Would he join them in buying a CT scanner, a $1 million machine that produces detailed images of the heart?
 The scanner would give Dr. Rosenblatt a new way to look inside patients' arteries, enable his clinic to market itself as having the latest medical technology and provide extra revenue. 
 Although tempted, Dr. Rosenblatt was reluctant. CT scans, which are typically billed at $500 to $1,500, have never been proved in large medical studies to be better than older or cheaper tests. And they expose patients to large doses of radiation, equivalent to at least several hundred X-rays, creating a small but real cancer risk.
 Dr. Rosenblatt worried that he and other doctors in his clinic would feel pressure to give scans to people who might not need them in order to pay for the equipment, which uses a series of X-rays to produce a composite picture of a beating heart. 
 ''If you have ownership of the machine,'' he later recalled, ''you're going to want to utilize the machine.'' He said no to the offer.
 And yet, more than 1,000 other cardiologists and hospitals have installed CT scanners like the one Dr. Rosenblatt turned down. Many are promoting heart scans to patients with radio, Internet and newspaper ads. Time magazine and Oprah Winfrey have also extolled the scans, which were given to more than 150,000 people in this country last year at a cost exceeding $100 million. Their use is expected to soar through the next decade. But there is scant evidence that the scans benefit most patients.
 Increasing use of the scans, formally known as CT angiograms, is part of a much larger trend in American medicine. A faith in innovation, often driven by financial incentives, encourages American doctors and hospitals to adopt new technologies even without proof that they work better than older techniques. Patient advocacy groups and some doctors are clamoring for such evidence. But the story of the CT angiogram is a sobering reminder of the forces that overwhelm such efforts, making it very difficult to rein in a new technology long enough to determine whether its benefits are worth its costs.
 Some medical experts say the American devotion to the newest, most expensive technology is an important reason that the United States spends much more on health care than other industrialized nations -- more than $2.2 trillion in 2007, an estimated $7,500 a person, about twice the average in other countries -- without providing better care. 
 No one knows exactly how much money is spent on unnecessary care. But a Rand Corporation study estimated that one-third or more of the care that patients in this country receive could be of little value. If that is so, hundreds of billions of dollars each year are being wasted on superfluous treatments. 
 At a time when Americans are being forced to pay a growing share of their medical bills and when access to medical care has become a major political issue for states, Congress and the presidential candidates, health care experts say it will be far harder to hold down premiums and expand insurance coverage unless money is spent more wisely. 
 The problem is not that newer treatments never work. It is that once they become available, they are often used indiscriminately, in the absence of studies to determine which patients they will benefit.
 Some new treatments, like the cancer drug Gleevec and implantable heart defibrillators, undoubtedly save lives, contributing to the United States' reputation for medical breakthroughs. But others -- like artificial spinal disks, which can cost tens of thousands of dollars to implant but have not been shown to reduce back pain in many patients, and Vytorin, a new cholesterol drug that costs 20 times as much as older medicines but has not been proved superior -- have been criticized for not justifying their costs.
 And sometimes, the new technologies prove harmful. Physicians were stunned, for example, when clinical trials showed last year that expensive anemia medicines might actually hasten death in kidney and cancer patients. Such drugs are used more widely in the United States than elsewhere.
 ''We have too many situations where we thought we knew what the answer was and it didn't turn out like everyone thought,'' said Dr. Mark Hlatky, a cardiologist and professor of health research and policy at Stanford University.
 A Tool of Dubious Value
 The problem of inadequate study is especially serious for medical devices and imaging equipment like scanners, which typically are not as strictly regulated as prescription drugs. Under Food and Drug Administration regulations, the makers of CT scanners -- CT is short for computed tomography -- do not have to conduct studies to prove that their products benefit patients, as drug makers do. The manufacturers must certify only that the scanners are safe and provide accurate images.
 Once the F.D.A. approves a test or device, Medicare rarely demands evidence that it benefits patients before agreeing to pay for it. But last year, Medicare officials raised questions about the benefits of CT heart scans and said it would demand more studies before paying for them. But after heavy lobbying by cardiologists, Medicare backed down. Private insurers, while initially reluctant to pay for the tests, are also covering them.
 Physicians in this country have a free hand in deciding when to use new technology like CT angiography. Some are conservative. But others, especially doctors in private practice who own their scanners, use the tests aggressively. 
 Douglas Ring, a 63-year-old Los Angeles real estate developer, said he received a CT heart scan in October 2005, on the advice of Dr. Ronald P. Karlsberg, a Beverly Hills cardiologist. ''Ron has been my physician for 15 or 20 years, and he got this new toy in his office, and he said I should try it,'' Mr. Ring said. He took the test despite having no symptoms of heart disease, like shortness of breath and chest pain. He was already taking cholesterol medicine, and a different test had shown no problems with his heart.
 The CT heart scan by Dr. Karlsberg found a moderate buildup of plaque in one of Mr. Ring's coronary arteries. The doctor increased Mr. Ring's cholesterol medicines and encouraged him to diet and exercise. 
 Dr. Karlsberg said he considered the information from Mr. Ring's CT scan extremely valuable. ''Here's a case of near-serious coronary disease that required medical management,'' said Dr. Karlsberg, a partner at the Cardiovascular Medical Group of Southern California, which conducted about 1,400 CT heart scans last year. 
 Many other cardiologists, though, say patients like Mr. Ring do not benefit from CT scans. And by the time they are 50, most people will have plaque visible on a CT scan, so the findings of Mr. Ring's scan were not surprising.
 Arteries narrowed by plaque are not necessarily a threat, said Dr. Eric Topol, a practicing cardiologist and director of the Scripps Translational Science Institute in La Jolla, Calif. The danger arises when bits of plaque break and produce a clot that blocks blood to the heart. But CT angiograms cannot tell whether a particular blockage is likely to rupture or, except in extreme cases, is keeping the heart from receiving enough blood.
 If doctors do choose to treat blockages, they can insert stents -- small metal scaffolds that prop open arteries. But while stents have been proved to reduce chest pain, they have not been shown to prolong patients' lives or help them avoid heart attacks. Patients with the most severe blockages can receive bypass surgery, which when necessary can be a lifesaving procedure.
 And so patients who do not have chest pain, like Mr. Ring, should not receive CT heart scans, said Dr. Rita Redberg, a cardiologist and researcher at the University of California, San Francisco, who is a leading critic of the scans.
 ''No data suggests that there's any reason for anyone asymptomatic to have a test,'' she said. ''There certainly is this idea that having a test can help you prevent a heart attack, and I don't know where it came from.''
 Further, each scan creates an additional lifetime risk of cancer that is somewhere between 1 in 200 and 1 in 5,000, said Dr. David J. Brenner, director of the Center for Radiological Research at Columbia University. Younger patients and women are at higher risk.
 Dr. Karlsberg and other cardiologists who support widespread use of CT heart scans argue that they can reduce the need for other tests -- like conventional angiograms, which can find plaque but require a catheter to be threaded through the arteries. Conventional angiograms are more expensive than CT scans and carry their own risks. 
 If a CT heart scan finds plaque that a doctor intends to treat with a stent, a conventional angiogram will still be necessary to determine where and how to implant the stent. So a CT scan does not always eliminate the need for a conventional angiogram. 
 The most valuable use of a CT angiogram may be when a patient comes to an emergency room complaining of chest pains but has few other symptoms of a heart attack. The test can quickly rule out heart trouble. But such patients represent a minority of those receiving CT heart scans.
 Dr. Karlsberg also pointed to the case of a seemingly healthy 68-year-old patient whom he scanned in his office in 2006. To the shock of both doctor and patient, the scan revealed a 95 percent blockage of the patient's main coronary artery. The patient had immediate bypass surgery to relieve the blockage, an operation that may have saved his life, Dr. Karlsberg said. The man, who cited privacy concerns in asking that his name not be used, confirmed the doctor's account.
 Cardiologists who oppose wide use of the scans agree that they can sometimes find dangerous blockages that require immediate surgery in asymptomatic patients. But they said such cases are extremely rare -- not common enough to justify using the scans routinely, given their cost and radiation risks.
 For too many people, the scans are simply inappropriate, said Dr. Howard C. Herrmann, director of interventional cardiology at the University of Pennsylvania. ''I find many patients have CT angiograms who shouldn't be getting CT angiograms.'' 
 As more than 13,000 heart doctors gathered in Chicago in late March for the annual American College of Cardiology conference, the biggest and best-located booths belonged to General Electric, Philips Electronics, Siemens and Toshiba, the leading makers of the machines used for CT angiograms. 
 Cardiologists hired by the companies offered short briefings on ways to reduce radiation doses, while sales representatives in business suits quietly talked up the benefits of the scans and the clarity of the images. The sales atmosphere was low key, more art gallery than ''Glengarry Glen Ross.'' 
 A hard sell is unnecessary because the manufacturers are finding a receptive audience. Many cardiologists have been eager for a new tool that lets them see inside the heart with unprecedented clarity -- while also providing a new source of revenue.
 Use of CT scans accelerated after 2004, when manufacturers introduced a new generation called 64-slice scanners, which are fast enough to capture images of a beating heart. The scanners fire X-rays in a series of rotations around the torso, generating thousands of narrow vertical images. Sophisticated software then combines data from the X-rays into a single image.
 The Financial Incentives
 Already, more than 1,000 hospitals and an estimated 100 private cardiology practices own or lease the $1 million CT scanners, which can be used for the angiograms and for other imaging procedures. Once they have made that investment, doctors and hospitals have every incentive to use the machines as often as feasible. To pay off a scanner, doctors need to conduct about 3,000 tests, industry consultants say. 
 Fees from imaging have become a significant part of cardiologists' income -- accounting for half or more of the $400,000 or so that cardiologists typically make in this country, said Jean M. Mitchell, an economist at Georgetown University who studies the way financial incentives influence doctors.
 Besides generating profits themselves, the scans enable cardiologists to find blockages in patients who have no symptoms of heart problems. Doctors can then place stents in patients who would not otherwise have received them, generating additional revenue of $7,500 to $20,000 per patient.
 While clinical trials have not shown that stents benefit patients with no symptoms of heart disease, they are still routinely inserted in such patients when tests find significant blockages. Cardiologists joke that the phenomenon is ''ocular stenosis'' -- blockages that can be seen are stented.
 ''You find a lot of asymptomatic disease,'' said John O. Goodman, a business consultant to cardiologists. ''It will put more patients in the cath lab'' -- medical shorthand for a cardiac catheterization laboratory, where conventional angiograms and stenting procedures take place. 
 Ms. Mitchell said cardiologists simply practice medicine the way the health system rewards them to. Given the opportunity to recommend a test for which they will make money, the doctors will. 
 ''This is not greed,'' she said. ''This is normal economic behavior.''
 Doctors who perform a lot of CT heart scans tend to be evangelists for the technology. Dr. John A. Osborne, a cardiologist in solo practice in Grapevine, Tex., just outside Dallas, argues that CT angiograms catch heart disease at its earliest stages. His Web site, sothcardiology.com, states the proposition in stark terms: ''Half of Americans have died of heart attacks and strokes. Which one are you?'' 
 Supported by a staff of about 20 people, Dr. Osborne estimates that he does 15 CT angiograms a day. Arterial plaque is ''cancer of the coronaries,'' he tells patients. ''Do you have it or not?'' 
 Before their plaque creates symptoms, Dr. Osborne asserts, patients should be aggressively treated, urged to diet and exercise and given cholesterol-lowering and other drugs. 
 Scans 'Sell Themselves'
 Like many cardiologists who perform CT scans, Dr. Osborne relies on primary-care doctors to send him candidates. He frequently gives lectures to primary-care doctors on the technology's benefits. When doctors see the images, he said, ''they become true believers.'' 
 Two years ago, Dr. Osborne persuaded a family practice doctor, Dr. Michael Dotti, to have his own CT angiogram at no cost. Dr. Dotti was amazed at the scan's ability to spot early signs of disease. ''It's nice to know I have clear arteries at 51,'' he said. ''The scans sort of sell themselves.'' 
 The technology has been covered in the news media, including a September 2005 Time magazine cover on CT angiograms, ''How New Heart-Scanning Technology Could Save Your Life.'' The following month, Oprah Winfrey devoted a segment of her television program to women's heart disease and recommended that her viewers consider taking the test. Representatives for Time and Ms. Winfrey declined to comment on their coverage of the technology.
 Even cardiologists who think the CT scans are overused say they may one day prove valuable. If manufacturers can produce scanners that can determine which plaques are stable and which are likely to rupture, the machines could revolutionize the treatment of heart disease. Patients found to be at low risk might be able to avoid taking medicine entirely, while others would be given intensive treatment.
 But for now, doctors cannot use the images that way. Finding out whether the heart is actually short of blood and at high risk for an attack requires tests other than a CT scan -- most likely, a nuclear stress test, which uses radioactive dye to track blood flow through the coronary arteries.
 The CT angiogram is ''a great technology searching for a great application,'' said Dr. Charanjit S. Rihal, the director of the cardiac catheterization laboratory at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., who sees little diagnostic value in the current generation of heart scanners. 
 CareCore National, a Bluffton, S.C., company that reviews treatment and test requests for health insurers, has found that when doctors request a CT angiogram for a patient, they also frequently ask for a nuclear stress test. 
 ''We're seeing layering of tests on top of each other,'' said Dr. Russell Amico, a CareCore executive. His company denies as many as 70 percent of the CT scans requested, a much higher rate of rejection than for other kinds of tests his company reviews.
 Impatient Patients
 Sometimes, it is not the doctor but the patient who is eager for the scan. On a recent Wednesday morning on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, Dr. Harvey Hecht at Lenox Hill Hospital watched from a lead-shielded control room as a 59-year-old patient, Robert Franks, underwent a CT angiogram.
 Mr. Franks has a family history of cardiac disease, and his father and two uncles died of heart attacks. But Mr. Franks, director of corporate security for Time Inc., is in excellent shape. He works out daily and takes two cholesterol-lowering medicines. The drugs have reduced his LDL, or bad, cholesterol to 60, a remarkably low level.
 Nonetheless, in February, Mr. Franks took a test called a calcium score, which measures the amount of calcified plaque in the arteries. The test, a less extensive form of scanning, revealed a moderate buildup of calcium in his arteries, a potential sign of heart disease.
 So he decided to have a nuclear stress test. When that test showed no problem, the cardiologist who conducted it said he did not need more testing.
 But Mr. Franks was still not satisfied. ''I'm someone who wants to know,'' he said. 
 After doing research on the Internet, he found Dr. Hecht, who recommended a CT angiogram. Dr. Hecht acknowledged that Mr. Franks probably did not have severe heart disease. But he said the scan would be valuable anyway because it might reassure him. And his insurance would cover the cost.
 A CT scanner is 8 feet high by 8 feet wide and 2 feet deep, with a doughnut-shaped hole at its center. Wearing a hospital gown, Mr. Franks lay on a table attached to the machine and was injected with a drug to lower his heart rate, along with a contrast dye to improve the quality of the images from the test. (Mr. Franks later compared the warmth he felt after the injection of the dye to ''the first sip of a well-blended martini.'')
 In the control room, Salvatore Fevola, the manager of the CT scanning equipment at Lenox Hill, instructed Mr. Franks, who was raising his hands over his head, to hold his breath as the table moved through the machine.
 Twelve seconds later, the test was complete, and the machine's software began to assemble information from thousands of images into a single coherent picture of Mr. Franks's heart. 
 A few minutes later, Dr. Hecht studied the results. As he had expected, the angiogram revealed that Mr. Franks's arteries were healthy. In some places, plaque had blocked 25 percent of their blood flow, but in general, cardiologists do not consider blockages clinically relevant until they reduce blood flow at least 70 percent.
 After Mr. Franks finished dressing, he joined Dr. Hecht, who went over the results, explaining that his heart appeared healthy and that he would not need a stent. Still, Dr. Hecht recommended that Mr. Franks have another CT angiogram next year to check that the plaque was not thickening. Mr. Franks agreed, pronounced himself satisfied and left.
 For Mr. Franks, the test was quick and painless. But it subjected him to a significant dose of radiation. 
 Based on a reporter's notes about the duration of the scan and the power output reported by the scanner, Dr. Brenner of the Center for Radiological Research estimated that Mr. Franks had received 21 millisieverts of radiation -- even more than a typical test, equal to about 1,050 conventional chest X-rays.
 Given the radiation risks, Dr. Ralph Brindis, another cardiologist, said Dr. Hecht had erred. Because Mr. Franks had already taken a nuclear stress test with normal results, he did not need a CT angiogram, said Dr. Brindis, vice president of the American College of Cardiology. And particularly because the scan's results were benign, he said, Dr. Hecht should not have recommended a follow-up test. 
 ''The biggest problem we have with radiation is that the doses are cumulative and additive,'' Dr. Brindis said. ''So the concept of doing serial CT testing on asymptomatic patients, I think, is abhorrent. I cannot justify that.''
 Dr. Hecht said he sharply disagreed with Dr. Brindis. The scan was appropriate for Mr. Franks, despite his normal results from the nuclear stress test, because of Mr. Franks's other risk factors for heart disease, including his higher-than-average calcium score, Dr. Hecht said. And he said he recommended a follow-up scan next year so he could see how quickly the plaque in Mr. Franks's arteries was thickening.
 Otherwise, ''how do we know that our therapy is effective?'' Dr. Hecht said. He acknowledged that many cardiologists do not favor repeat scans but said long-term radiation risks were a relatively minor issue for patients 60 and older.
 Cardiologists like Dr. Brindis hurt their patients by being overly conservative and setting unrealistic standards for the use of new technology, Dr. Hecht said. 
 ''It's incumbent on the community to dispense with the need for evidence-based medicine,'' he said. ''Thousands of people are dying unnecessarily.''
 Medicare's Scrutiny
 The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services had decided to push back. 
 The agency, which this year will spend more than $800 billion on health care, rarely questions the need to pay for new treatments. But last June, Medicare said it was considering paying for CT heart scans only on the condition that studies be done to show they had value for patients. 
 Concerned about the overall proliferation of imaging tests, Medicare said it might require a large-scale study to determine the scans' value. 
 The plan met with fierce resistance, particularly from a relatively new organization of specialists, the Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography. The society has 4,700 physician members and one purpose -- to promote CT angiograms. 
 ''For the CT society, this was life or death,'' said Dr. Daniel S. Berman, the group's president-elect. ''This decision could essentially put them out of business.''
 Galvanized, at a meeting in November in Chicago, the CT specialists vowed to overturn any possible Medicare proposal. 
 ''We didn't need to be talking about registries and the research,'' Dr. Berman said. ''We needed to be questioning the wisdom of the Medicare decision itself.'' 
 The next month, Medicare issued the draft of its proposal, saying that it would pay for the scans only if a large-scale study were conducted. The CT society, along with other prominent medical groups whose members performed scans, set to work lobbying the agency and members of Congress.
 One group marshaled the evidence the doctors would take to Medicare, arguing that the agency had ignored some studies, including those of the new 64-slice CT scans. Another group visited Congressional offices. Defenders of the technology argued that Medicare had agreed to pay for other tests, like mammograms, without requiring proof that they improved patient care. Breakthrough technologies, they said, need time to prove themselves. 
 Medicare ''set the bar so high, no new technology would be able to survive,'' said Dr. Michael Poon, a New York cardiologist who is the CT society's current president. 
 Cardiologists met with Representative Carolyn McCarthy, a New York Democrat. In March, she and other members of Congress wrote to Medicare, urging it to reconsider its plan. Eventually, a dozen or so senators and 79 representatives lined up to support the society's efforts. 
 And Medicare gave way. 
 ''There are a lot of technologies, services and treatments that have not been unequivocally shown to improve health outcomes in a definitive manner,'' Dr. Barry Straube, Medicare's chief medical officer, explained when announcing that the agency would keep covering the tests.
 In other words, the lack of evidence that the CT scans provide measurable medical benefit would not stop Medicare from paying for them. 
 Heavy lobbying makes it virtually impossible for the agency to insist on more evidence before agreeing to pay for a new technology, said Dr. James Adamson, chief medical officer for Arkansas Blue Cross and Blue Shield. ''Medicare,'' he said, ''does not make a lot of really hard decisions.'' 
 In a subsequent interview, Marcel Salive, a Medicare official, said the agency still hoped for large-scale studies to demonstrate the value of CT scans. 
 The technology's proponents say they understand the need to prove its value. ''It's incumbent on us to do more work,'' said Gene Saragnese, vice president for molecular imaging and CT at General Electric. 
 Doctors are also discussing the creation of registries to track patients who have had CT angiograms. But now that Medicare has backed down, skeptics say it is unlikely that anyone will conduct a major clinical trial to determine if patients who receive CT heart scans have better medical outcomes than those who do not. 
 ''It's clearly going to be much more difficult, given the Medicare decision,'' said Dr. Sean Tunis, a former Medicare official who directs the Center for Medical Technology Policy, a nonprofit group.
 Industry consultants say that now that Medicare has agreed to pay for the tests, resistance among commercial insurers is likely to disappear. ''I believe the holdouts will be paying within 12 months,'' said Michelle Boston, the chief executive of Partners Imaging, a Dallas company that works with doctors to offer CT scans. 
 And so CT angiograms seem destined to continue, in ever greater numbers. ''Once the train leaves the station, once the technology gets on the marketplace, we don't get the evidence,'' said Dr. Redberg, the University of California, San Francisco, cardiologist. ''We're spending a lot of money on technology of unclear benefit and risk.''

HEADLINE: David Caminer, 92, Dies; A Pioneer in Computers

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
David Caminer, who as an employee of a legendary chain of British tea shops found the earliest ways to use a computer for business purposes, including standardizing flavorful, cost-effective cups of tea, died June 19 in London. He was 92.
 The death was announced by the Leo Computers Society, whose purpose is to keep alive the memory of LEO, the computer Mr. Caminer helped develop for J. Lyons & Company. It was the world's first business computer, a distinction certified by Guinness World Records. 
 Lyons was the first company in the world to computerize its commercial operations, partly because it had so many of them: it had more than 200 teahouses in London and its suburbs, with each Lyons Corner House daily generating thousands of paper receipts and needing scores of fresh baked items. 
 In addition to running the tea shops, Lyons catered large events like tennis at Wimbledon and garden parties at Windsor Castle; it also operated hotels, laundries, and ice cream, candy and meat pie companies. And, of course, tea plantations.
 As a result, the company required exceptionally efficient office support. So it was only natural it would look at the ''electronic brains'' that scientists in the United States were developing for scientific and military purposes as a way to streamline its own empire. Mr. Caminer's role was finding ways to retain traditional clerical rigor while speeding up the company's logistics and finances many times over.
 The result was LEO, its name derived from Lyons Electronic Office. The Economist magazine called it ''the first dedicated business machine to operate on the 'stored program principle,' meaning that it could be quickly reconfigured to perform different tasks by loading a new program.'' 
 ''LEO's early success owed less to its hardware than to its highly innovative systems-oriented approach to programming, devised and led by David Caminer,'' Computer Weekly said last year.
 LEO performed its first calculation on Nov. 17, 1951, running a program to evaluate costs, prices and margins of that week's baked output. At that moment, Lyons was years ahead of I.B.M. and the other computer giants that eventually overtook it.
 ''Americans can't believe this,'' Paul Ceruzzi, a historian of computing and curator at the National Air and Space Museum, said in an interview last week. ''They think you're making it up. It really was true.''
 That a food conglomerate did this seems almost incredible. New Scientist said in 2001: ''In today's terms it would be like hearing that Pizza Hut had developed a new generation of microprocessor, or McDonald's had invented the Internet.''
 David Treisman was born on June 26, 1915, in the East End of London. His father was killed in World War I, and his mother married Felix Caminer. An avid leftist, he decided a university education was irrelevant, obituaries in the London papers said. He joined Lyons as a management trainee in 1936.
 During World War II, he lost a leg in combat in Tunisia. He returned to Lyons and soon became manager of the systems analysis office. Lyons sent employees to the United States to study office automation, and American experts said they should go to the University of Cambridge, where Maurice Wilkes was developing an early computer.
 Lyons made a deal to help finance Dr. Wilkes's work in return for his help in building a computer for the company. As work on the hardware progressed, Mr. Caminer drew up a flow chart to show how the different job requirements related. The charts became the basis of the computer code.
 Mr. Caminer has been called the first corporate electronic systems analyst, a designation with which Mr. Ceruzzi agreed. 
 The finished LEO, which had less than 100,000th the power of a current PC, could calculate an employee's pay in 1.5 seconds, a job that took an experienced clerk eight minutes. Its success led Lyons to set up a computer subsidiary that later developed two more generations of LEO, the last with transistors, rather than the noisy vacuum tubes used in the first two models.
 LEOs were sold to the Ford Motor Company, tobacco companies, a steel maker, South Africa, Australia, the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, among other buyers. When the British government chose the last LEO to handle its telephone billing system, Tony Benn, postmaster general, praised Lyons for ''standing up to and beating on its own merits'' the competition from overseas.
 But the Lyons computer operation merged into a succession of companies, which chose to use American technology, not least for its universality. Many have compared LEO's experience with that of the de Havilland Comet, which was the first commercial passenger jet in production but which lost out to Boeing jets.
 Mr. Caminer, who was appointed to the Order of the British Empire in 1980 for developing a computer system for the European Common Market, had many explanations for the failure of Lyons to press its advantage. One was that it had no idea how rapidly technology would advance. Another was: ''We were too often arrogant about always knowing best.''
 Mr. Caminer is survived by his wife, the former Jackie Lewis, a son and two daughters. The remnants of Lyons predeceased him in 1998.
 On Jan. 9, 1965, when the first LEO computer was turned off forever, The Daily Mail published an obituary. It recalled how LEO hummed, and once made a noise that sounded like a hornpipe to Prince Philip.
 ''Let it be remembered that throughout almost 14 years of life he worked a 24-hour shift on one dreary problem after another without complaining and spent, at the most, only a few hours off sick,'' the computer's obituary said.

HEADLINE: The American Multinational, Unbowed

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. HOLSTEIN

 BODY:
AS the business pages inform us, Tata Motors of India has bought Jaguar from Ford, Chinese car manufacturers are aspiring to become international companies, and Cemex of Mexico is the world's largest ready-mix cement company. At a moment of economic insecurity in the United States, these challengers from afar have been depicted as sweeping over the American economic landscape to devastating effect.
 But the authors of ''Globality'' (Business Plus, $26.99) maintain that economic Armageddon may not, in fact, be at hand. They demonstrate that the traditional multinationals still have advantages -- in the form of skilled human resources, management expertise, innovative capabilities, brand reputations and overall economies of scale. 
 One of the few irritations in the book is that the authors -- Harold L. Sirkin, James W. Hemerling and Arindam K. Bhattacharya, all of the Boston Consulting Group -- have tried to invent a new word. They argue that globality is somehow different from globalization, the word that most commentators use to explain what's happening to the world's economy. 
 Globality, the authors say, ''is a blockbuster new script -- action, drama, suspense and road picture all packed into one -- with a sprawling cast of characters and locations in every corner of the earth.'' Despite the grand prose, however, the new buzzword doesn't work -- it merely describes trends that have been under way for at least two decades under a very similar name. But the authors can soon be forgiven for the buzz language, because their insights into the competitive battle in emerging markets are so keen. 
 Consider their discussion of human capital. Headlines in America say that India and China are graduating many more engineers than American universities can possibly generate. But it turns out that emerging multinationals have problems tapping their own people. 
 In India, for example, the attrition rate in the outsourcing industry is 50 percent annually, and a great percentage of people who have college-level training in English are not truly fluent, the authors write. Further, only about one-fourth of all college graduates can be hired directly without extensive training, they say.
 Traditional multinationals have an advantage over many challengers because they can offer career routes to the most talented Indians and Chinese that their own countries' companies do not yet have. The incumbents, as noted by the authors, have extensive programs in place to assess employee performance, to develop global plans for job rotations and, in general, to build their long-term careers. Not all the challengers know how to do that, and relatively few of them have established truly global footprints.
 Nor are big Western companies always captives of their relatively high cost structures back home. They are capable of stripping down and finding profitable niches at the bottom of the economic pyramid. 
 The authors note that Whirlpool first introduced a washing machine in Brazil in 1998 that cost $300, at a time when the average Brazilian earned about $200 a month. The product was obviously too expensive and did not sell.
 Then Whirlpool decided to create a new lower-cost model and developed the machine in Brazil, where the company has skilled engineers and industrial designers as well as sophisticated factories. The Ideale washer was introduced in 2003 at a cost of $150, creating a new market for low-capacity, low-price, semiautomatic washing machines in Brazil.
 Procter & Gamble achieved a similar low-cost strategy in Mexico in consumer products, the authors write. It seems that the big guys are more flexible and aggressive than is often said.
 They also have an edge when it comes to mergers and acquisitions. Deals by emerging-market companies are increasing, but they are still child's play when compared with those that Western multinationals make routinely. 
 Westerners are buying up emerging competitors, too. A Chinese national, for example, created a Silicon Valley company called WebEx that relied heavily on highly skilled engineers in China for programming. Rather than allow WebEx to emerge as a competitor, Cisco Systems simply bought it in 2007. 
 Similarly, I.B.M. and Electronic Data Systems have been snapping up business-process outsourcing companies in India. Moreover, the challengers tend to pay more for their acquisitions and are relatively inexperienced in handling post-merger integrations, the authors say.
 Technological innovation may be another differentiator. The emerging challengers are clever about repackaging existing ideas, combining Eastern and Western cultural values to create new products and devising ways to make and sell things for less money. All of that gives them competitive juice, and they clearly will make further technological progress. But in most cases, their national economic and political systems don't encourage innovation as much as those in the United States.
 A final piece of the competitive battle is the value of brand names. The challengers are using acquisitions to improve their brand equity, as Tata almost certainly will with Jaguar in its fold. But of the top 100 brands in 2006, as ranked by the corporate branding consultant Interbrand, not one comes from the rapidly developing economies the authors are writing about.
 (Samsung, Hyundai and LG are from South Korea, but the authors argue that they emerged during a previous wave of competition.)
 In today's emerging markets, the authors write, there are no real rivals to Coke, American Express or Google when it comes to the power of brand names. 
 TO be sure, it would be utter folly to discount completely the competitive challenge from emerging markets. American multinationals that insist on making every decision at headquarters and cling to their high-cost ways of doing things will clearly be in trouble.
 As the authors rightly note: ''The layers of middle management that have built up over time in many incumbent organizations can create a lumbering, centralized bureaucracy that increases costs, hinders flexibility, slows responsiveness, and hinders a company's ability to develop an organization across the rapidly developing economies.'' 
 But the good news for many large American companies is that they have already figured out how to compete in the backyards of would-be competitors. They absorb foreigners into their management ranks, allow some decision-making clout to devolve to distant markets and adapt their products or invent new products to compete. General Motors, for example, is enjoying robust sales growth in China (where it was No. 1 in 2007), India, Russia and Brazil and is far ahead of its archrival Toyota Motor in those markets.
 Many American chief executives, it turns out, are aiming at emerging markets. If it's true that those markets are among the most crucial economic battlegrounds of the coming decade, it is just possible that American companies will win more than they lose. And they will find many insights into prevailing in those battles in this book.

David Frum, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, is the author of ''Comeback: Conservatism That Can Win Again.''

 BODY:
WHITE PROTESTANT NATION 
 The Rise of the American Conservative Movement. 
 By Allan J. Lichtman. 
 Illustrated. 598 pp. Atlantic Monthly Press. $27.50. 
 In most lines of work, a person does his credibility real damage by denying the obvious and asserting the manifestly untrue. Yet in the book world, there can be very large rewards for a writer who boldly turns reality on its head. With ''White Protestant Nation: The Rise of the American Conservative Movement,'' Allan J. Lichtman apparently hopes to claim some of those rewards for himself.
 Lichtman's thesis is embedded in his title: American conservatism should be seen as an ideology devoted above all to advancing ''an antipluralistic ideal of America as a unified, white Protestant nation.'' This breathtaking argument bumps into an obvious counterargument: What about all the Catholics? William F. Buckley, Rudolph W. Giuliani, Sean Hannity, Russell Kirk, Clare Boothe Luce, Joseph R. McCarthy, Michael Novak, Bill O'Reilly, Antonin Scalia, Phyllis Schlafly and William E. Simon hardly seem marginal to the past or present of American conservatism. Indeed, enumerating important Catholics in the American conservative movement feels a little like listing famous Jewish violin players. It might be quicker and easier to do it the other way around. 
 Lichtman himself seems nervously aware of the wobbliness of his thesis. Immediately after advancing it, he acknowledges that conservatives have achieved a ''partial and uneasy rapprochement'' between white Protestants and white Catholics. Soon afterward, references to the title gradually cease, and then they vanish altogether.
 By that point, however, Lichtman, a professor of history at American University, no longer needs it. His discarded title thesis has done the work required: given him a special personal definition of the term ''conservatism'' that allows him to trace the origins of the modern movement not to the anti-Communism of the 1950s or the opponents of the New Deal in the 1930s, as is usually done, but to the Ku Klux Klan of the 1920s. And not just to the Klan, but to all the other racialist and fascist groupings that troubled the peace of American society in the aftermath of World War I.
 As Lichtman puts it: ''American conservative politics is not about limited government, states' rights, individual freedom or free markets. These are all dispensable ideas that the right has adjusted and readjusted to protect core principles.'' And what are those core principles? They amount to ''protecting America's superior civilization from racially or culturally inferior peoples, foreign ideologies, sexual deviance, ecumenical religion or the encroachment of a so-called one-world government.''
 For Lichtman, conservatism is less a body of ideas than a collection of unattractive impulses. No person or group that excites his ire is too obscure to be included as a vital component of the conservative story. Thus, in his telling, Elizabeth Dilling (who self-published conspiratorial anti-Communist and anti-Semitic books in the 1930s) is as integral to the origins of conservatism as Milton Friedman. Willis Carto's Liberty Lobby deserves equal attention with Paul Nitze's Committee on the Present Danger. And the racial theorists of the Pioneer Fund take pride of place over the University of Chicago economics department. This kind of unweighted cataloging will surely find an audience among the partisans of the activist left, where everything is connected and any stick will do to beat a dog. Yet to the extent that ''White Protestant Nation'' aspires to be a work of history rather than a tract for the times, it has to be adjudged to have fallen well short of success.
 It fails, first, because assertion does not make things true. Lichtman dismisses the importance of free-market economics to conservative politics. But he offers scant reason for readers to accept a dismissal so at variance with general perception. 
 It fails, second, because Lichtman's own intensely felt passions blind him to all contradictory evidence. He wants to denounce conservatives for Ku Kluxery and racism -- and also for the administrations of Warren G. Harding and Calvin Coolidge, two presidents he intensely dislikes. Yet Harding was the first president in American history to publicly condemn lynching (in Birmingham, Ala., no less), and Coolidge denounced the Klan in a 1925 speech to the American Legion.
 Likewise, the anti-New Deal Liberty League of the 1930s figures in Lichtman's schema as blackly reactionary. The repeal of Prohibition is by contrast good and progressive. But the Liberty League was basically the old Association Against the Prohibition Amendment under a different name. Can these individuals (one of them a past chairman of the Democratic National Committee) really have been transformed from cosmopolitan libertarians to antipluralist reactionaries in the span of months? Or is it remotely possible that they saw some continuity between their past and present opposition to overweening government?
 ''White Protestant Nation'' fails, next, because Lichtman lacks the historian's intuition for change over time. He hails women's suffrage as progressive and damns immigration restriction as antipluralist and reactionary. Yet many of the most important proponents of suffrage favored immigration restriction -- and many of the pro-immigrant groups opposed suffrage. Advocates of racial equality like Norman Thomas could also be adamant isolationists; internationalists like J. William Fulbright could be determined segregationists. Facing this refractory reality, it might make sense to accept that the political alignments of the 2000s cannot easily be projected backward 70 years or more. 
 Perhaps the single most famous attempt to impose a white Protestant identity upon America was the State of Oregon's effort to suppress Catholic schools, which culminated in a landmark Supreme Court case named for Walter Pierce, the Democratic governor who signed the legislation. During World War II, Pierce, by then a member of Congress, would favor the internment of Japanese-Americans. He was also a supporter of women's rights, prison reform and New Deal economic legislation. So: Was Walter Pierce a liberal? Or a conservative? Or perhaps we should accept that once we voyage back in time, we arrive in a different political landscape, with issues not easily assimilated into our present-day controversies. Lichtman, like Gilbert and Sullivan, believes contrary-wise that every child born alive is born a little liberal or else a little conservative.
 Finally, ''White Protestant Nation'' fails as history because Lichtman will not think seriously about the relationship between causes and effects. He is fascinated by what might be called the inner story, and so he mines archives and clippings for conservatism's internal debates and struggles. But conservatism did not come to national political power in the 1980s by means of memorandums. It came to power because of the collapse of the governing liberal consensus of the 1950s and '60s. Riots, crime, inflation, rising taxes, gasoline lines, recessions, foreign policy humiliation: it was these things that elected Ronald Reagan in 1980. The story of conservatism cannot be told in isolation from the larger political story. Yet Lichtman shirks that story -- perhaps because to tell it would require him to engage the possibility that the liberalism of the '50s and '60s had ceased to work.
 You do not need to be a partisan of a political movement to write its history. But you do need enough imaginative sympathy to comprehend how it won adherents and supporters. Yet increasingly it seems that the history of conservatism is attracting liberals who lack that sympathy -- for whom the whole thing was a giant con, a tissue of rationalizations for ugly bigotries. These liberal chroniclers of conservatism refuse to examine their own prejudices. They do not see that their wholesale dismissal of the principles of others amounts to little more than self-flattery. We might call this the Bourbon school of liberalism: after many years in exile, it has still learned nothing.

GRAND NEW PARTY 
 How Republicans Can Win the Working Class and Save the American Dream. 
 By Ross Douthat and Reihan Salam. 
 244 pp. Doubleday. $23.95. 
 One of the Republican Party's most astute pols, Representative Tom Davis of Virginia, recently reflected on his party's status among voters. In a 20-page memo for his colleagues, Davis wrote, ''If we were a dog food, they would take us off the shelf.'' Bad as things are, they may get worse.
 The signs of Republican trouble are everywhere. Eighty-one percent of Americans believe the country is on the wrong track, the worst number since The New York Times and CBS started asking the question in 1991. Consumer sentiment in May, as measured by the University of Michigan, was at its lowest level in 28 years. Republicans have lost three consecutive special elections for House seats in rock-ribbed Republican districts, a particularly ominous harbinger of electoral catastrophe.
 Yet Democratic successes right now are driven more by Republican failures than by an enthusiastic public embrace of what Democrats stand for. The Democratic-controlled Congress, after all, has a lower approval rating than even President Bush. 
 In other words, there is at least a dim light at the end of a dark tunnel for the Republican Party. The conservatives Ross Douthat and Reihan Salam, both with The Atlantic Monthly, neither hard-core party activists nor longtime political operatives, want to provide a road map to get the party to brighter and more long-lasting sunshine. 
 The core thesis of their book ''Grand New Party'' is that the working class in America -- the non-college-educated half of the electorate -- continues to ping-pong between the parties and is there for the taking by any group that can seriously and directly address its concerns. The authors note: ''Since 1968, these voters have provided the 'silent majority' that elected Nixon, the 'Reagan Democrats' who gave the Gipper his landslides and the 'angry white men' who put the Gingrich G.O.P. over the top in 1994. ... Yet after each Republican triumph, this working-class constituency ... has become disillusioned with conservative governance and returned to the Democratic column.'' 
 Why have the two parties been unable to turn periodic hookups with this key group of voters into an enduring marriage? For Democrats, it is in part that they have misread working-class anxiety -- this is a new body of voters, no longer the union-dominated industrial workers or toilers on family farms, but people employed in services like education, health care or office administration, with two-earner households stretched thin. Their problems will not be solved by ''stronger unions, more food stamps, a war on Wal-Mart or the nationalization of a major industry or two.'' 
 Democrats have disdained so-called social issues as distractions from real economic problems. Douthat and Salam say to the contrary that the social issues are a major part of working-class insecurity. ''Safe streets, successful marriages, cultural solidarity and vibrant religious and civic institutions make working-class Americans more likely to be wealthy, healthy and upwardly mobile. Public disorder, family disintegration, cultural fragmentation and civic and religious disaffection, on the other hand, breed downward mobility and financial strain -- which in turn breeds further social dislocation, in a vicious cycle that threatens to transform a working class into an underclass.'' 
 What about the Republicans? The authors say they blew their chances to capitalize on their opening to these voters ''by confusing being pro-market with being pro-business, by failing to distinguish between spending that fosters dependency and spending that fosters independence and upward mobility, and by shrinking from the admittedly difficult task of reforming the welfare state so that it serves the interests of the working class rather than the affluent.'' If the right cannot find a way to address voter insecurities and needs, then some combination of the populist left and the neoliberal center, of Denmark-style social democracy with Clinton-style free-market centrism, will be likely to fill the void. 
 Of course, Douthat and Salam lay out a long list of policy proposals in the final chapters of the book to show the Republicans the way. But the most valuable part is the first half, in which they give a concise, penetrating and insightful history of political movements and social dynamics through the 20th century and explain the plight of the working class. They describe why and how Franklin Roosevelt forged a consensus and an enduring Democratic majority, how and why it began to dissipate in the 1950s, what the Goldwater movement represented, how Reagan created an opportunity for a new consensus that Republicans frittered away. 
 They go on to describe how Clinton made the 1990s a conservative era, creating a new broad center but also ushering in a Republican Congress for the first time in 40 years. Yet Republican blind hatred of Clinton blocked an opportunity to expand real reform. And Douthat and Salam recount how George W. Bush's White House -- ''a team with a better grasp of politics than policy and a White House that prized loyalty over brilliance'' -- blew its chance to capture these voters after 2004, and presided over an economy in which the working class slipped farther behind as wealth became concentrated into fewer and fewer hands. If this story sounds and is familiar, they manage to link social and political trends in a way that takes them beyond most commentators.
 Douthat and Salam's biggest contribution comes in a chapter called ''What's the Matter With the Working Class?'' They make a strong case for why the dissolution of families is significant: it leaves people in an increasingly disrupted society, so that their turn to social conservatism is understandable. The authors outline the twin problems of inequality and insecurity in a clear and convincing manner that should resonate as much with Barack Obama as with any Republican. Had Obama read this book before his now-famous ''cling to guns and religion'' comments, he might have phrased his analysis -- which is not out of sync with that of the book -- differently.
 When it comes to remedies, the authors dutifully come up with a stream of proposals big and small to address the issues in a way that is supposed to contrast with the combination of leftist populism and centrist neoliberalism that is the alternative. But the result is a mix of compassionate conservatism and ersatz centrist neoliberalism.
 They advocate a family-friendly tax reform that vastly expands the child tax credit and provides both pension credits for household labor and tuition credits for years spent rearing children. They call for improving the stock of affordable housing and also for ''progressive cost-sharing,'' so that more out-of-pocket health costs are paid by the well-to-do. They want a reduction in payroll taxes for lower-income workers in return for means-testing Social Security benefits, along with wage subsidies for low-income workers to make less-educated single male workers more desirable marriage partners. They draw ideas from the Brookings Institution's neoliberal Hamilton Project and from the Clinton administration (adding ''thousands of new police officers'' sounds suspiciously like the Clintonian promise of 100,000 new cops on the street that drew ridicule from Republicans in the 1990s). 
 Their remedies are meant to be suggestions rather than concrete proposals. But most of these ideas will resonate more with progressive pragmatists like Ron Wyden and Barney Frank and eclectic Republicans like Chuck Hagel and Arnold Schwarzenegger than with conservative Republican leaders like John Boehner or Mitch McConnell.
 Still, the core Republican and conservative establishment should read this book. Its members may hate activist government, or at least bow politically to the hatred, but Douthat and Salam make a strong case that a conservatism of reflexive tax cuts and sink-or-swim economics will never resonate with the huge core of voters who are spread thin and falling behind.

HEADLINE: No Safety Nets Here; Just One Day at a Time

BYLINE: By MICHAEL POWELL

DATELINE: ALBUQUERQUE 

 BODY:
To hit the campaign trail with a presidential candidate often is to journey into a land of precarious economics, where talk of globalization and corporate synergies yields to more prosaic questions: 
 How do I make it through this week, and the one after that? How can I afford health care for my 2-year-old? And what becomes of me when I'm 62, without a pension, without a 401(k)?
 Carrie Hummel, a 28-year-old with auburn hair cropped short around her face, stands up amid the pipes and ovens of the Flying Star Cafe Commissary here and lays bare the details of her life at a meeting with Senator Barack Obama. She works as a hairdresser and waitress, her boyfriend is an intern for the state and a full-time student, and they care for his 3-year-old daughter. 
 Most days they scratch up enough cash for gas, she says; their little girl has health insurance but they go without. ''You know,'' she adds in a soft voice that could not be misconstrued for a whine, ''this is a pretty hard life. I just want to figure out how we get out of this box.''
 Voices like hers are like a subsurface hum that never quite goes silent on the trail. It is the same for Senator John McCain, the Republican, as it is for Mr. Obama, the Democrat. (None of these women were hand-picked by the Obama campaign; some were Republicans; two said they would be unlikely to vote for him.) 
 Maureen Paweski, 44, asks Mr. Obama if he might consider waiving federal taxes on tips, because waitress friends cannot make ends meet.
 Then a curly-haired woman, a bakery worker, rises and inquires about college tuition costs, which spiral upward. 
 The United States may tip into the chute of recession. Unemployment is rising. The foreclosure rate in Nevada, where Mr. Obama flew from Albuquerque, stands at 6.7 percent, the highest in the nation. 
 The real income of the wealthiest Americans has risen fast for years. But real median weekly paychecks jumped by $1 in the last eight years, to $695 from $694. Janet Yellen, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, warned in 2006 that ''rising inequality is intensifying resistance to globalization, impairing social cohesion and could ultimately undermine American democracy.'' 
 The trend lines have gotten worse since.
 The challenge for Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain is to find answers that do not sound too pat.
 Mr. Obama, lanky and formal in his black suit, white shirt and black tie, nodded as the women spoke. ''We have,'' he says, ''been talking about health care since Harry Truman.'' 
 He is a wonkish man with a raft of proposals. He mentions a $500 income tax credit and a plan to give every American six paid sick days each year. He would extend the federal Family Medical Leave Act to cover any firm with 25 or more employees. 
 He is aware that such talk will not pay Ms. Hummel's gas bill. A study at the University of Iowa shows that women who use the Family Medical Leave Act suffer long-term loss of wages and promotions.
 Ms. Paweski said afterward, ''I'm not sure a $500 tax credit does the trick.'' 
 Months ago in Ohio, Mr. Obama sat at a similar roundtable with women no less precariously perched than those in Albuquerque. In an interview, he spoke of feeling something like helplessness.
 ''My mom wasn't different,'' Mr. Obama said. ''Her health was shaky; she was always one step ahead of being broke. You listen and you want to deliver for them, but you're thinking, O.K., best case scenario, I take office in 2009. If everything goes magically well, I've got a health plan midway through 2010 -- and meanwhile, these women have bad jobs, no health care.''
 Back at the Flying Star Cafe, the candidate points to 23-year-old Eirinn Sanchez. ''You're a very charismatic person,'' she says, ''and I've been paying attention to the way that people react to you just one-on-one.'' 
 ''Politicians,'' she adds, ''generally suffer from a lot of talking-mouth syndrome.''
 Mr. Obama squints and offers a tentative ''Uh-huh.''
 ''How do you keep true to the things you say?'' Ms. Sanchez says.
 Mr. Obama closes his eyes. He begins with the familiar markings of his life, his work as a community organizer and a civil rights lawyer. He talks of ignoring vanity.
 He fishes in his left pocket and extracts a mound of trinkets and tchotchkes. 
 ''I carry around all these things that people give me,'' he says. ''These are, like, all these good luck charms: a Native American gave me this wood eagle, a biker gave me his lucky poker chip. 
 ''They will hand it to you and say, 'You know, I want you to do well but I want you to fight for me,' '' he says. 
 He is describing those who play life's game without a net below, not least these women. ''If you are asking for their trust, you better be serious,'' he says. ''You better not overpromise.''
 Fifteen minutes later Ms. Hummel picks up her bag. She would like health insurance but she cannot find a penny. ''I'm terrified to commit to insurance,'' she says. ''We've got nothing extra.''

HEADLINE: MENDING FENCES June 22-28

 BODY:
THE NEWSBarack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton appeared together at a political rally, putting aside their primary rivalry to set a fresh tone for the Democrats in the fall campaign.
 BEHIND THE NEWS Hundreds of people turned out for the rally on Friday in Unity, N.H. (where else?), part of a day of choreographed harmony. Although a litany of issues remain between the two former adversaries, Mrs. Clinton used the occasion, three weeks after suspending her campaign, to renew her endorsement of Mr. Obama and pledge to do all she could to help the Democrats take the White House. ''Unity is not only a beautiful place,'' she told the crowd, ''it's a wonderful feeling, isn't it?''
 THE NEWS North Korea disclosed its first significant accounting of its arms program, leading President Bush to lift some sanctions and remove the country from a State Department list of state sponsors of terrorism. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS It was a key step in what promises to be a long diplomatic process toward a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula. North Korea's disclosure of its nuclear capabilities (highlighted by the blowing up of a cooling tower at its main nuclear plant) seeks to meet a key condition set by the United States and other countries, which view North Korea as a dangerous source of instability, before the country can get American aid and loans from world institutions.
 THE NEWS Florida's largest sugarcane producer agreed to sell nearly 300 square miles of land to the state to help restore the Everglades.
 BEHIND THE NEWS Florida agreed to pay $1.75 billion for the assets of United States Sugar, including 187,000 acres of land north of Everglades National Park. The company has complained about expensive water-quality regulations and has been a target of environmentalists for the runoff that flows from its farms. The deal will restore much of the crucial water flow between Lake Okeechobee and the Everglades. ''It's dollars and cents and the right thing to do,'' said Robert H. Buker Jr., the company's president.
 THE NEWS The plaque honoring Jackie Robinson in the Hall of Fame was revised to pay tribute to his impact as the first black player in the major leagues.
 BEHIND THE NEWS At his request, Robinson's plaque had only listed his on-field accomplishments. But last week, his widow, Rachel, unveiled a new plaque with an added sentence: ''Displayed tremendous courage and poise in 1947 when he integrated the modern major leagues in the face of intense adversity.'' The chairwoman of the Hall of Fame, Jane Forbes Clark, said the addition was ''extremely important.'' The reason: ''There is no person more central or more important to the history of baseball for his pioneering ways.'' 
 THE NEWS Congress moved closer last week to approving the most sweeping government overhaul of mortgage financing since the New Deal.
 BEHIND THE NEWS With sinking home values continuing to drag down the economy, the Senate worked to finalize the legislation, which includes a rescue plan to slow the more than 8,000 new foreclosures being filed each day. The House has approved a similar bill. Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut said he expected action before July 4: ''People I don't think want to leave here, hanging bunting around and eating hot dogs and hamburgers knowing that every day thousands of Americans are falling into an abyss.''

HEADLINE: Oil and Inflation

 BODY:
This month, Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, broke from the usually banal official pronouncements about the dollar to talk bluntly about the risks of inflation. He told an international conference that a weakening dollar had caused an ''unwelcome rise'' in inflation and pledged to guard against such dangers. 
 Until this recent round of comments -- which other Fed officials have now joined -- the Fed had focused on the turmoil in the financial markets and slowing growth, not rising prices. With the markets relatively calm during most of June, it apparently felt freer to raise warnings about inflation. The Fed's decision Wednesday to hold interest rates steady -- after a string of cuts to stabilize financial markets and support the economy -- underscored its growing concern about prices. 
 Then came Thursday and Friday. The stock market plunged into bear market territory, leaving no doubt that the credit crunch persists and the economy is still very fragile. At the same time, oil prices surged, sharply increasing inflationary pressure. The Fed would have preferred to deal with the threats of recession and inflation sequentially. But it does not have that luxury. 
 The Fed is in a bind. If it keeps rates low and loans plentiful to combat a recession, inflation could worsen. If it raises rates and tightens the money spigot to fight inflation, the downturn could be deepened and prolonged. 
 History may not be a reliable guide. It is easy -- but not necessarily helpful -- to draw analogies to eras like the stagflationary 1970s. Then, high prices led to higher wages and the dreaded wage-price spiral. Raising interest rates increased unemployment and slowed wage growth, choking inflation. But today, wages are barely budging, even as prices go up. Rate hikes to fight today's inflation -- which stem from commodity prices, not wages -- may not be the fix they once were. 
 We don't know how the Fed is going to get out of this bind. In the long run, however, the bigger challenge is not the Fed's. Policy makers must come up with strategies to prevent the recession-and-inflation problem from happening time and again. Foremost would be a systematic plan for reducing the nation's dependence on oil. From this perspective, high oil prices are actually a good thing -- cutting use and spurring the development of alternative energy -- but there must be help for the most hard-hit Americans, like lower-income workers. 
 The country first saw how high oil prices can wreak economic havoc with the oil shocks of the 1970s. Congress and presidents have failed to reduce America's vulnerability by reducing its dependency. The Fed will have to feel its way through the current crisis. But the next president and Congress will have to tackle the oil problem once and for all.

 YOUNG BRIDES OF YEMEN
 Defy the Fate of Girls
 Nujood Ali, 10, above, and Arwa Abdu Muhammad Ali, 9, have spurred a movement to defy child marriage in Yemen. ''This is the first shout,'' said a human rights lawyer. But despite a rising tide of outrage, the fight against the practice is not an easy one. Hard-line Islamic conservatives defend it, pointing to the Prophet Muhammad's marriage to a 9-year-old. PAGE 8
 Iraq's Robust Team
 After five years of war, Iraq's chances of fielding a competitive Olympic team are vanishingly small. Only one athlete, a weight lifter, qualified for the Beijing Olympics. But the country, which has been in three wars in two decades, has a robust team for the Paralympics, in which disabled athletes compete. PAGE 12 
 INDIA'S MONTH OF UNREST
 Indian citizens have long embraced their constitutional right to assemble peaceably, and they have done so with gusto this month in myriad large protests over a wide range of issues in many parts of the country. Some speculate that India's weak central government could be contributing to the widespread unrest. Others attribute the upheaval to rapid changes in Indian society. PAGE 11
 NATIONAL
 A NEW MIDDLE NAME
 Makes a Statement
 They are Jewish and Catholic, Hispanic and Asian, an Alvarez here, a Crowley there, with a Frumkin, a Strabone, an O'Maley and who knows what else, all with at least one thing in common: They have semiofficially adopted the middle name Hussein in support of their preferred presidential candidate. PAGE 14
 BOGUS UNIVERSITIES
 In all, they awarded more than 10,000 diplomas for customers in 131 countries, in the process operating more than 120 ''universities.'' But the authorities say money, not higher education, was the goal of Dixie and Steven K. Randock Sr. of Colbert, Wash. The charges the couple and six former employees pleaded guilty to included mail and wire fraud. PAGE 14
 AIR STRAIGHT TALK
 As the presidential campaign moves from primary to national mode, Senator John McCain hopes to restore a bit of the old campaign style by recreating his signature Straight Talk Express (a term some Democrats find Orwellian) back-of-the-bus forums on his new campaign airplane, a Boeing 737-400. PAGE 20
 THE PRICE OF PROTEST
 Vermont Law School is closely watching a renewed fight over the military's ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy. It is one of two law schools in the nation that bar military recruiters in protest of the policy, a stand that costs it up to an estimated $500,000 in federal research money. PAGE 15 
 METRO 
 FOR ALBANY, 12 MONTHS
 Of Can-You-Believe-It?
 A governor had a spectacular fall. Back-to-back suicides stained the state's top law enforcement agency, coupled with reports of a rogue unit of state troopers. The top Republican resigned. Investigations abounded. Yes, you might say Albany had a rocky year. PAGE 23
 LAND OF FALLING WATERS
 Let it not be thought that the four man-made torrents of water currently adorning New York harbor, created by the Danish-Icelandic artist Olafur Eliasson, are the city's only waterfalls. A tour of the city provides various examples of others -- provided that the definition of ''waterfall'' is expanded a bit. PAGE 23
 THE COST OF ROYALTIES
 Soaring prices for energy, rising demand and advances in drilling techniques are turning the dreamy, green landscape at the outer edges of the Catskills into a potential windfall for landowners. But they are also hearing cautionary tales from Wyoming and Colorado. Our Towns, Peter Applebome. PAGE 23
 SPORTS
 THINKING ABOUT PITCHING,
 And Remembering 1968
 Nobody is suggesting that they lower the mound even more. But the craft of pitching does seem to be undergoing a revival of late. It isn't even midseason, and seven starters had at least 10 victories before Saturday's games. PAGE 2
 VAULTING TO THE TOP
 It's been only four years since Jenn Stuczynski's coach watched her in a basketball game and persuaded her to pick up a pole for the first time. Now, at 26, Stuczynski holds the American record, clearing 16 feet 3/4 inches at the Adidas Track Classic in May. Only one woman in the world has vaulted higher. PAGE 6
 SUNDAY BUSINESS
 STARTING A COMPANY,
 And Hiring Hubby
 Some female entrepreneurs have proved comfortable not only with running their own companies, but also with having their husbands work for them. They find ways to work together at home and create a separate balance of power in their business relationship. How? By carefully delineating their roles and playing to each other's strengths. PAGE 1
 A TUSSLE IN THE SKIES
 Commercial airlines say business aircraft contribute significantly to congestion in the skies and don't pay their share of the costs of running the air traffic control system. The business aviation industry, which is booming as airlines struggle, says it is being unfairly viewed as competitors. PAGE 2

 FEAR, LOATHING AND GLORY,
 A Gonzo Documentary
 You'd need two area codes, or maybe even two states, to hold the many sides of Hunter S. Thompson. ''Gonzo: The Life and Work of Hunter S. Thompson,'' a new documentary from Alex Gibney, borrows from two films made about Thompson and video of luminaries who have lined up to pay respect to a man whose brand of journalism, not to mention life, was not for the faint of heart. PAGE 7
 NEW SONG AND DANCE
 When the popular game ''Guitar Hero'' featured the Aerosmith song ''Same Old Song and Dance'' in its third installment, sales for the song more than doubled. That sparked an idea. Soon, Aerosmith was in a motion capture studio for Neversoft, the games designer, creating what is to be half game, half biographical box set: ''Guitar Hero Aerosmith.'' Page 16
 OBITUARIES
 DAVID CAMINER, 92
 As an employee of the legendary chain of British tea shops J. Lyons & Company, he found the earliest ways to use a computer for business purposes, including standardizing flavorful, cost-effective cups of tea. LEO, which he helped develop for the company, was the world's first business computer. PAGE 25

 Europe's Baby Shortage
 Birth rates across the Continent are falling at drastic and, to many, alarming rates. Why are Europeans so hesitant to have children, and what does it mean for their future and ours? PAGE 34
 SWIMMING INTO THE SUNSET
 Dara Torres won the first of her nine Olympic swimming medals in 1984. At the trials this week, she is expected to make her fifth Olympic team. If so, she will become the oldest female swimmer in the history of the Games. And it will not have come easily. PAGE 28

 LATIN HEART OF CHICAGO 
 Beats to Rhythm of Life
 Pilsen, Chicago's core Latin neighborhood, thrums with life. Take the art walk, starting on South Halsted Street. Or visit the National Museum of Mexican Art, the city's leading Latino cultural organization. But rest assured, if you can't make time, with a surging population and influence the Latino population will sway its way to you. Just wait a while. PAGE 5 
 SUNDAY STYLES
 WITH THE MOMS AWAY,
 The Dads Do Play
 Stay-at-home fathers are depicted as a lonely lot, spurned by cliquish moms and nannies on the playground, financially emasculated by their breadwinner wives, generally cut off from the forces that sustain a man. Not so for the seven or eight fathers of the nameless P.S. 234 breakfast club, whiling away their mornings with hash browns and banter. PAGE 1
 A LONG LOOK AT SMELL
 High-fashion magazines typically dedicate a page or two -- if that -- of editorial space to a new perfume. The July Harper's Bazaar devotes 40 of its editorial pages to four celebrities and models who also star in the advertising campaign for Sensuous, a new fragrance from Estee Lauder. As Jubal Early of TV's ''Firefly'' might have asked: ''Does that seem right to you?'' PAGE 1
 BOOK REVIEW
 YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE
 (Unless You're 007)
 One mark of a truly successful fictional character is that he not only survives his creator, but also continues in new adventures. Take Sherlock Holmes (whom not even his creator could kill). More recently, take Bond, James Bond, now back in ''Devil May Care,'' which ''is not without its pleasures,'' Alex Berenson writes in a review not overly long on praise. PAGE 8
 ASSESSING BLAME
 Over her adult lifetime Arianna Huffington's political positions have been fluid, a fact that could in theory give her new book, ''Right Is Wrong,'' the perspective of a former insider. But, Jack Shafer writes in his review that ''Huffington appears to be stuck in 2004,'' and that ''her new book seems oblivious of the right's decline.'' PAGE 18
 AUTOMOBILES
 THE URBANE MAKEOVER
 Of a City Slicker
 With gasoline prices soaring, crossovers -- car-based utility vehicles that usually burn less fuel than their truck-based counterparts -- are nudging out sport utility vehicles in showrooms. And in the crossover class, Nissan's redesigned Murano has much to offer buyers. But will negative reaction to S.U.V.'s hit the crossover market? PAGE 1
 WEEK IN REVIEW
 GAUGING THE EFFECTIVENESS
 Of Gun Control Laws
 Among the questions in the background of the Supreme Court's ruling last week on gun control laws was whether those laws work, or whether they may even be counterproductive. An analysis of research into the subject, as conducted by Justice Stephen G. Breyer, led him to conclude, in effect: Who knows? PAGE 1
 IRAQ'S OIL MOTIVES
 A report that the Iraqi oil ministry was close to awarding contracts to service its oil fields to some of the largest Western oil companies did nothing to assuage fears that the war in Iraq was a naked grab for oil that would open the country to multinational energy giants. PAGE 1
 Editorial
 AIR FORCE'S TANKER MESS
 The Air Force needs the new refueling planes, but its repeated bungling of the procurement process shows that it is incapable of doing the task on its own. Defense Secretary Robert Gates must take over. WEEK IN REVIEW, PAGE 9
 WASTE, FRAUD AND ABUSE
 How did a company run by a 21-year-old president and a 25-year-old former masseur get a sensitive $300 million contract to supply ammunition to Afghan forces? Good question. WEEK IN REVIEW, PAGE 9
 OIL AND INFLATION
 The country first saw how high oil prices can wreak economic havoc with the 1970s oil shocks. Now, the next president and Congress will have to tackle the oil problem once and for all. WEEK IN REVIEW, PAGE 9

HEADLINE: Anxious In America

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
Just a few months ago, the consensus view was that Barack Obama would need to choose a hard-core national-security type as his vice presidential running mate to compensate for his lack of foreign policy experience and that John McCain would need a running mate who was young and sprightly to compensate for his age. Come August, though, I predict both men will be looking for a financial wizard as their running mates to help them steer America out of what could become a serious economic tailspin.
 I do not believe nation-building in Iraq is going to be the issue come November -- whether things get better there or worse. If they get better, we'll ignore Iraq more; if they get worse, the next president will be under pressure to get out quicker. I think nation-building in America is going to be the issue. 
 It's the state of America now that is the most gripping source of anxiety for Americans, not Al Qaeda or Iraq. Anyone who thinks they are going to win this election playing the Iraq or the terrorism card -- one way or another -- is, in my view, seriously deluded. Things have changed.
 Up to now, the economic crisis we've been in has been largely a credit crisis in the capital markets, while consumer spending has kept reasonably steady, as have manufacturing and exports. But with banks still reluctant to lend even to healthy businesses, fuel and food prices soaring and home prices declining, this is starting to affect consumers, shrinking their wallets and crimping spending. Unemployment is already creeping up and manufacturing creeping down. 
 The straws in the wind are hard to ignore: If you visit any car dealership in America today you will see row after row of unsold S.U.V.'s. And if you own a gas guzzler already, good luck. On Thursday, The Palm Beach Post ran an article on your S.U.V. options: ''Continue to spend upward of $100 for a fill-up. Sell or trade in the vehicle for a fraction of the original cost. Or hold out and park the truck in the driveway for occasional use in hopes the market will turn around.'' Just be glad you don't own a bus. Montgomery County, Md., where I live, just announced that more children were going to have to walk to school next year to save money on bus fuel.
 On top of it all, our bank crisis is not over. Two weeks ago, Goldman Sachs analysts said that U.S. banks may need another $65 billion to cover more write-downs of bad mortgage-related instruments and potential new losses if consumer loans start to buckle. Since President Bush came to office, our national savings have gone from 6 percent of gross domestic product to 1 percent, and consumer debt has climbed from $8 trillion to $14 trillion.
 My fellow Americans: We are a country in debt and in decline -- not terminal, not irreversible, but in decline. Our political system seems incapable of producing long-range answers to big problems or big opportunities. We are the ones who need a better-functioning democracy -- more than the Iraqis and Afghans. We are the ones in need of nation-building. It is our political system that is not working. 
 I continue to be appalled at the gap between what is clearly going to be the next great global industry -- renewable energy and clean power -- and the inability of Congress and the administration to put in place the bold policies we need to ensure that America leads that industry. 
 ''America and its political leaders, after two decades of failing to come together to solve big problems, seem to have lost faith in their ability to do so,'' Wall Street Journal columnist Gerald Seib noted last week. ''A political system that expects failure doesn't try very hard to produce anything else.''
 We used to try harder and do better. After Sputnik, we came together as a nation and responded with a technology, infrastructure and education surge, notes Robert Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International. After the 1973 oil crisis, we came together and made dramatic improvements in energy efficiency. After Social Security became imperiled in the early 1980s, we came together and fixed it for that moment. ''But today,'' added Hormats, ''the political system seems incapable of producing a critical mass to support any kind of serious long-term reform.''
 If the old saying -- that ''as General Motors goes, so goes America'' -- is true, then folks, we're in a lot of trouble. General Motors's stock-market value now stands at just $6.47 billion, compared with Toyota's $162.6 billion. On top of it, G.M. shares sank to a 34-year low last week. 
 That's us. We're at a 34-year low. And digging out of this hole is what the next election has to be about and is going to be about -- even if it is interrupted by a terrorist attack or an outbreak of war or peace in Iraq. We need nation-building at home, and we cannot wait another year to get started. Vote for the candidate who you think will do that best. Nothing else matters.

HEADLINE: If Only Mugabe Were White

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
Patson Chipiro, a democracy activist, wasn't home when Robert Mugabe's thugs showed up looking for him.
 So they grabbed his wife, Dadirai, and tormented her by chopping off one of her hands and both of her feet. Finally, they threw her into a hut, locked the door and burned it to the ground.
 That has been the pattern lately: with opposition figures in hiding, Mr. Mugabe's goons kill loved ones to send a message of intimidation. Even the wife of the mayor-elect of Harare, the capital, was kidnapped and beaten to death. 
 When the white supremacist regime of Ian Smith oppressed Zimbabweans in the 1970s, African countries rallied against it. Eventually, even the white racist government in South Africa demanded change and threatened to cut off electricity supplies if it didn't happen.
 Yet South African President Thabo Mbeki continues to make excuses for Mr. Mugabe -- who is more brutal than Ian Smith ever was -- out of misplaced deference for a common history in the liberation struggle. Zimbabweans suffered so much for so many decades from white racism that the last thing they need is excuses for Mr. Mugabe's brutality because of his skin color.
 Life expectancy in Zimbabwe has already dropped from the low 60s to the high 30s. It's true that he has created more trillionaires than any other country, but that's only because inflation may be as much as 10 million percent. Anyone with $90 is a trillionaire in Zimbabwean dollars, and buying a small loaf of bread costs one billion Zimbabwean dollars.
 When I grew up in the 1970s, a central truth was that Ian Smith was evil and Mr. Mugabe heroic. So it was jolting on my last visit to Zimbabwe, in 2005, to see how many Zimbabweans looked back on oppressive white rule with nostalgia. They offered a refrain: ''Back then, at least parents could feed their children.''
 Africa's rulers often complain, with justice, that the West's perceptions of the continent are disproportionately shaped by buffoons and tyrants rather than by the increasing number of democratically elected presidents presiding over 6 percent growth rates. But as long as African presidents mollycoddle Mr. Mugabe, they are branding Africa with his image.
 To his credit, Zambian President Levy Mwanawasa has taken the lead in denouncing Mr. Mugabe's abuses, and Nelson Mandela bluntly deplored Mr. Mugabe's ''tragic failure of leadership.'' Mr. Mandela could also have been talking about Mr. Mbeki's own failures.
 The United States doesn't have much leverage, and Britain squandered its influence partly by focusing on the plight of dispossessed white farmers. (That's tribalism for Anglo-Saxons.) But there is a way out.
 The solution is for leaders at the African Union summit this week to give Mr. Mugabe a clear choice.
 One option would be for him to ''retire'' honorably -- ''for health reasons'' after some face-saving claims of heart trouble -- at a lovely estate in South Africa, taking top aides with him. He would be received respectfully and awarded a $5 million bank account to assure his comfort for the remainder of his days. 
 The other alternative is that he could dig in his heels and cling to power. African leaders should make clear that in that case, they will back an indictment of him and his aides in the International Criminal Court. Led by the Southern African Development Community, the world will also impose sanctions against Mr. Mugabe's circle and cut off all military supplies and spare parts. Mozambique, South Africa and Congo will also cut off the electricity they provide to Zimbabwe. 
 If those are the alternatives, then the odds are that Mr. Mugabe will publicly clutch his chest and insist that he must step down. There will still be risks of civil conflict and a military coup, but Zimbabwe would have a reasonable prospect of again becoming, as Mr. Mugabe once called it, ''the jewel of Africa.''
 Some people will object that a tyrant shouldn't be rewarded with a pot of cash and a comfortable exile. That's true. But any other approach will likely result in far more deaths, perhaps even civil war.
 How do we know that sanctions will work? Well, we have Mr. Mugabe's own testimony.
 In a 1987 essay in Foreign Affairs, Mr. Mugabe called on the U.S. to impose sanctions on white-ruled South Africa for engaging in a ''vicious and ugly civil war'' against its own people. Mr. Mugabe demanded that the world ''accept the value of sanctions as a means of raising the cost'' of brutal misrule.
 If only Mr. Mugabe were a white racist! Then the regional powers might stand up to him. For the sake of Zimbabweans, we should be just as resolute in confronting African tyrants who are black as in confronting those who are white.

HEADLINE: Gun Laws And Crime: A Complex Relationship

BYLINE: By ADAM LIPTAK

 BODY:
Lurking behind the Supreme Court's ruling last week that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to bear arms were a series of fascinating, disputed and now in many ways irrelevant questions. 
 Do gun control laws reduce crime? Do they save lives? Is it possible they even cost lives?
 Justice Stephen G. Breyer, one of the dissenters in the 5-to-4 decision, surveyed a quite substantial body of empirical research on whether gun control laws do any good. Then he wrote: ''The upshot is a set of studies and counterstudies that, at most, could leave a judge uncertain about the proper policy conclusion.''
 There is no question, of course, that guns figure in countless murders, suicides and accidental deaths. Over the five years ending in 1997, the Justice Department says, there was an average of 36,000 firearms-related deaths a year. (Fifty-one percent were suicides, and 44 percent homicides.) Determining whether particular gun control laws would have, on balance, prevented some of those deaths is difficult. Take Washington, D.C., whose near-total ban on handguns in the home was on the receiving end of last week's decision. 
 At the crudest level, as Justice Breyer wrote, violent crime in Washington has increased since the ban took effect in 1976. ''Indeed,'' he continued, ''a comparison with 49 other major cities reveals that the district's homicide rate is actually substantially higher relative to these other cities than it was before the handgun restriction went into place.''
 Those statistics by themselves prove nothing, of course. Factors aside from the gun ban, like demographics, economics and the drug trade, were almost certainly in play. ''As students of elementary logic know,'' Justice Breyer wrote, ''after it does not mean because of it.''
 But Gary Kleck, a professor at Florida State University's College of Criminology and Criminal Justice, whose work Justice Breyer cited, said there were good reasons for making a definitive judgment.
 ''We know the D.C. handgun ban didn't reduce homicide,'' he said in an interview.
 Not everyone agrees. A 1991 study in The New England Journal of Medicine compared Washington to its suburbs before and after the gun law took effect. It found that the law was linked to a 25 percent drop in homicides involving firearms and a 23 percent drop in such suicides. The study found no drops in other kinds of homicides and suicides in Washington, and no changes in the suburbs.
 Professor Kleck was critical of the study, saying that the period it studied was too short and that the suburbs were a poor point of reference. ''The place most like D.C. is Baltimore,'' he said, describing his own approach. ''It's a virtual twin city.''
 Professor Kleck conducted what he called ''an elaborate before-and-after study'' of Washington and Baltimore that took into account trends before the implementation of the ban and included ''a good long follow-up'' because the ban ''didn't immediately take anyone's guns away.'' 
 Baltimore did not have a similar law, yet its crime rate mimicked Washington's. ''The law itself had no effect one way or the other,'' Professor Kleck said.
 Even if he is right, his conclusion is not an indictment of all efforts to regulate guns. There are many flavors of gun control, and many problems of definition and measurement.
 ''It's very hard to wrap your head around,'' said Eugene Volokh, a law professor at the University of California at Los Angeles, whose work supporting an individual-rights view of the Second Amendment was cited three times by the majority in last week's decision. ''You have to think about the particular kind of gun control at work, and you have to subdivide gun users and gun abusers.''
 There is some evidence, Professor Volokh said, that denying guns to people who might use them in self-defense, usually merely by brandishing them, tends to increase crime rates. There is also evidence that the possibility of confronting a victim with a gun deters some criminals. 
 In addition, criminals are the people least likely to obey gun control laws, meaning that the laws probably have a disproportionate impact on law-abiding individuals. ''For the typical gun control law,'' Professor Volokh said, ''you'll have very little positive effect but a possible negative effect.''
 A brief defending the Washington law filed by the American Public Health Association and other groups said there were other collateral positive effects, including reductions in suicides and accidents, that gun control opponents overlook or underestimate. More generally, the brief said, ''banning handguns in Washington, D.C., appears to have reduced suicide and homicide rates.'' It cited the New England Journal study and statistics showing that Washington has an exceptionally low suicide rate. Asked what sorts of gun control laws seem to work, Professor Kleck mentioned two.
 ''Background checks in general at the state level did show lower homicide rates,'' he said, adding: ''I'd improve the enforcement of laws against unlicensed carrying of guns in public places.''
 The international experience is no less complex. Justice Breyer cited one study finding, in the justice's words, ''that strict gun laws are correlated with more murders, not fewer.'' 
 According to the study, published last year in The Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy, European nations with more guns had lower murder rates. As summarized in a brief filed by several criminologists and other scholars supporting the challenge to the Washington law, the seven nations with the most guns per capita had 1.2 murders annually for every 100,000 people. The rate in the nine nations with the fewest guns was 4.4.
 Justice Breyer was skeptical about what these comparisons proved. ''Which is the cause and which the effect?'' he asked. ''The proposition that strict gun laws cause crime is harder to accept than the proposition that strict gun laws in part grow out of the fact that a nation already has a higher crime rate.''
 Many criminologists say cultural, economic and demographic factors play a big role in murder rates, and some say the number of guns and the number of murders may well be uncorrelated.
 The murder rate in the United States, in any event, is higher yet -- 5.7 per 100,000 people in 2006, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In 2005, according to the Justice Department, 55 percent of homicides were committed with a handgun and 16 percent with another kind of gun. 
 Correlation or not, the United States is a special case, Nicholas Johnson, a Fordham law professor, said in an e-mail message. ''Our culture of armed civilians is unparalleled in the history of the world,'' he said. ''According to the high estimate, there is a gun in every other American home.''
 Justice Breyer concluded that the mixed quality of the evidence on the efficacy of gun control, along with its varying interpretations, means that lawmakers should be allowed to assess it for themselves to set reasonable gun control policies.
 Justice Antonin Scalia, on the other hand, said the Constitution had largely shut down the discussion. Justice Scalia, writing for the majority, acknowledged that ''gun violence is a serious problem.'' But, he went on, ''the enshrinement of constitutional rights necessarily takes certain policy choices off the table.''

HEADLINE: As Housing Bill Evolves, Crisis Grows Deeper

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ; David M. Herszenhorn contributed reporting.

 BODY:
When Congress started fashioning a sweeping rescue package for struggling homeowners earlier this year, 2.6 million loans were in trouble. But the problem has grown considerably in just six months and is continuing to worsen.
 More than three million borrowers are in distress, and analysts are forecasting a couple of million more will fall behind on their payments in the coming year as home prices fall further and the economy weakens. 
 Those stark numbers not only illustrate the challenges for the lawmakers trying to provide some relief to their constituents but also hint at what the next administration will be facing after the election. While the proposed program would help some homeowners, analysts say it would touch only a small fraction of those in trouble -- the Congressional Budget Office estimates it would be used by 400,000 borrowers -- and would do little to bolster the housing market.
 ''It's not enough, even in the best of circumstances,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Economy.com. The number of people who will be helped ''is going to be overwhelmed by the three million that are headed toward default.'' 
 Last week, the Senate voted overwhelmingly to advance the bill, and the House passed a version last month. Because of procedural delays in ironing out differences between the two houses, the Senate is not expected to pass the bill until after the Fourth of July recess. 
 The bill would let lenders and borrowers refinance troubled mortgages into more affordable 30-year fixed-rate loans that are backed by the government. Democratic leaders say Congress could send something to the president next month. 
 The White House, which initially threatened to veto the measure, has indicated that it is open to supporting the bill if certain provisions are removed. 
 ''The Congress needs to come together and pass responsible housing legislation to help more Americans keep their homes,'' President Bush said on Thursday.
 Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and a central force behind the legislation, said on Friday that recent reports about falling home prices have rallied support for the plan. But he acknowledged that the plan may not do enough to help homeowners or the housing market. Mr. Frank, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said that even after a bill like this, ''you may need more.''
 Other proposals that have been floated in Washington include expanding the current plan to make it mandatory instead of voluntary for certain home loans; having the government buy loans outright from lenders; and providing some way and some incentives to let homeowners become renters in their own homes.
 But not everyone supports government interventions. Some Republicans, like Senators Jim DeMint of South Carolina and Jim Bunning of Kentucky, say the proposal would use government subsidies to bail out reckless lenders and borrowers. They suggest that the housing market will correct itself more quickly if Congress does not intervene.
 The biggest impediment to helping homeowners is the weak economy. In addition to falling home prices and risky loans, homeowners are now confronting a tough job market. The unemployment rate has risen to 5.5 percent, up from 4.9 percent in January. 
 Mortgage rates have also been climbing. An estimated nine million homeowners owe more than their homes are worth and could find themselves with few options if they lose their jobs or if their mortgage bills rise substantially.
 To take part in the proposed program, lenders would have to lower each debt obligation to 85 percent of the home's current value. Borrowers would stay in their homes but would have to pay a 1.5 percent annual insurance premium. If homes' values grow and borrowers sell or refinance, they would have to share the gain with the government.
 The program would be managed by the Federal Housing Administration and paid for by the insurance premium, as well as a 3 percent fee paid by lenders and a tax on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored buyers of mortgages. (The refinance proposal is part of a broader housing bill that would also overhaul laws relating to the two companies and the F.H.A.)
 To qualify, borrowers would have to be in enough trouble that they could not afford their current mortgage payments but financially strong enough to make payments on their new loans.
 ''No matter how you fiddle with terms of their present situation, it's not going to save the day'' for many borrowers, said Bert Ely, a housing finance consultant based in Washington. ''They are not in a good financial situation because they have lost their jobs and they are overburdened with credit cards and home equity loans.''
 The effectiveness of the bill will depend to some extent on how it is handled by the F.H.A., an agency created during the Great Depression to insure home loans. It will have several challenges: persuading the lenders who made second mortgages and home equity loans to cooperate; screening loans to make sure borrowers have a good shot at keeping their homes after refinancing; and weeding out those trying to take advantage of the system.
 Second mortgages and home equity loans were popular during the housing boom and often allowed Americans to buy a home with little or no money down or let them take out cash against their homes as prices rose. Now, home values have fallen so much that there is little or nothing left to pay off these loans when homes are sold or repossessed. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that about 40 percent of riskier mortgages made in recent years are coupled with such secondary loans.
 Under the Congressional plan, these loans would have to be eliminated before homes could be refinanced. People who negotiate loan modifications say holders of second loans have been reluctant to take losses, and lenders with first loans are often unwilling to give them enough money to secure their cooperation. Under the Senate version of the plan, the F.H.A. would have some leeway in negotiating with borrowers who have second loans.
 Another challenge for the F.H.A. would be selecting borrowers who have the best chance of paying off new loans. The agency would have to make sure lenders are not unloading only their worst loans, and lenders and the F.H.A. would have to guard against borrowers who can pay their current loans but would like a cheaper, government-backed loan.
 Even if the agency insures hundreds of thousands of new mortgages, analysts do not expect the tide of foreclosures to ebb until the economy improves markedly. Mr. Zandi and others forecast that two million to three million mortgages will default -- beyond the three million in trouble now -- and economists at Lehman Brothers say home prices nationally may drop 15 percent by the end of 2009. That may force policy makers to consider further interventions.
 ''In this rush to legislate and with the lack of discussion of a lot of issues, people will look at this bill in the winter and say we shouldn't have done this, we shouldn't have done that,'' said Mr. Ely, who closely followed the savings and loan debacle. ''The politics are going to be so different come next year. There will be another administration, and who knows what the makeup of the House and Senate will be.''
 There is a precedent for such government endeavors, but not since the New Deal. In the 1930s, the government created the Home Owners Loan Corporation to buy mortgages and modify them. In three years, it bought a fifth of the country's home loans, said Alex J. Pollock, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington. 
 ''We won't need todo anything of that magnitude here,'' he said.
 An official for the Mortgage Bankers Association, a trade group in Washington, acknowledged that the proposal may not help the majority of troubled borrowers, but said it would be a good start and would help restore confidence in the financial markets and the economy. 
 ''There is no silver bullet,'' said the official, Steve O'Connor, a senior vice president of the association. ''There is no single solution to the housing crisis. It will take multiple tools to turn the housing market around, and it's going to take time.''

HEADLINE: Short Game Has a Long Life, Thanks to the Memories

 BODY:
To the Sports Editor: 
 Re ''Yankees Revisit Pirates, and Mazeroski's Homer,'' June 24: Thank you for your wonderful article on the 1960 World Series. As a pure baseball fan, this was the greatest game that I ever saw in over 50 years of watching baseball. Hal Smith will be remembered in Pittsburgh as Bernie Carbo in Boston for hitting the most famous three-run homers in the history of the World Series.
 But looking at your box score reprint, the most significant thing that I noticed was the time of the game: 2 hours and 36 minutes. This was the seventh game of a World Series with many pitching changes, 19 runs and 24 hits. 
 Imagine how long that game would take today!David Halpert

 To the Sports Editor: 
 Re ''Strange Habits of Highly Successful Tennis Players,'' June 21: Far and away the worst (and the strangest) habit or tic in the professional tennis world is the yell or grunt or screech vocalized by so many players every time they hit the ball. This is a purposely learned (and easily unlearned) habit that is gratingly irritating, if not to the screecher's opponent, then most assuredly to the stadium or television viewer (when a grunter or, more often, grunters are playing, I simply turn off the sound). 
 Unnecessary vocalizations should be banned, and the penalty for each offense should be the loss of a point. Tennis would then be much more enjoyable. Bill O'Fallon

 Re ''NBC's Miller Says He's Sorry for Remarks About Mediate,'' June 21: Rocco Mediate played his heart out at the United States Open and lost like a true sportsman to Tiger Woods, the No. 1 golfer in the world.

 Re ''Deaths in Racing,'' June 15: This chart, based on information provided by the Association of Racing Commissioners International, mistakenly reported 170 racing-related horse deaths in 39,806 starts in Washington, giving the state a ''death percentage'' of 0.427. The actual number of racing-related deaths for Jan. 1, 2003, through May 27, 2008, was 72, for a death percentage of 0.181.

 From Goal, on Euro 2008
 Not unlike Germany against Turkey, or any recent World Cups, the old Western European and Latin soccer powerhouses seem to always find a way to maintain their dominance. 
 It just seems that experience and previous titles somehow, reliably and consistently, prevail over high flying younger teams, no matter how brilliant and enthusiastic.
 The last decade, however and certainly, points to more and more countries pushing at the gates.
 My pick is Spain as the winner. 
 Marc
 Either Spain did a brilliant job of taking Russia out of the game early on, or the Russians were just off. Did exhaustion finally catch up with the fastest squad? And will the Spanish get as much room to run through versus the Germans as they did tonight against Russia? Should be an interesting final.

HEADLINE: Gaffe

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

 BODY:
To a fisherman, a gaff is an iron hook attached to a pole to drag aboard a large catch; to a sailor, it's a spar attached to the mast; to a Hollywood director, a gaffer is the chief lighting electrician hanging from the set's rafters; to a ''gotcha!'' journalist, a gaffe -- with an e ending, from the Old French for ''hook'' -- provides the hot news lede on a dull campaign day. To a politician -- even one who can ''stand the gaff'' or abuse -- it's the dread mistake that pierces the psyche like the angler's sharp hook.
 ''President Bush said one thing but meant the other,'' wrote the A.P.'s Deb Riechmann, covering Bush's planned farewell tour of Europe this month. She reported the president's mention of ''the North American Initiative and the Forum for Freedom,'' when Bush intended to say ''North Africa Initiative and the Forum for the Future,'' errors she labeled as ''verbal stumbles.'' When he substituted civil for cold in referring to allied unity during the cold war, the reporter classified that as a blooper. 
 In the official White House transcript of Bush's remarks, an asterisk was dutifully placed after the spoken errors, and corrections were made in footnotes. This reminded me of a mistake in a text I prepared in a Vietnam speech for President Nixon. Seated in the Oval Office, he told the nation: ''At this very desk, President Woodrow Wilson . . . said, 'This is the war to end war.' '' A curator later discovered, however, that the ''Wilson desk'' was not President Wilson's, as we assumed, but once belonged to Henry Wilson, a vice president under Grant. (A footnote in the collected presidential papers corrects my mistake.) 
 None of these qualified as gaffes. My Nixon text contained a plain inaccuracy requiring a curator's fix. In Mr. Bush's mix-up of America and Africa as well as his substitution of freedom for future, his spoken error was neither a blunder nor a blooper. 
 Why not? The meaning of blunder -- probably rooted in the Old Swedish blundra, meaning ''to have one's eyes closed'' -- has evolved to ''a serious mistake, often with far-reaching consequences.'' Its most famous use was attributed to several Frenchmen, including Talleyrand in 1804, referring to the wrongful execution of a nobleman whom Napoleon suspected of conspiring against him: ''It is worse than a crime. It is a blunder.'' That's an English translation of the French faute, meaning ''fault, foul, misdeed, offense.'' Blunder is a heavy charge, a synonym for ''strategic misjudgment'' that can lead to military or political defeat. 
 Blooper has a kooky quality of embarrassment, rooted in the howling sound made by the feedback of a bouncing signal in the early days of radio. It is allied to a baseball synonym for ''Texas leaguer,'' a half-hit baseball looped over the infielders and too short to be caught by an outfielder. Not a heavy charge; both meanings of blooper elicit an apologetic ''whoops!'' It is one step short of a goof, which is ''a silly misstep.'' 
 A fluff is a minor verbal goof like a mispronunciation, as when the announcer Harry von Zell introduced President Herbert Hoover with the spoonerism ''Hoobert Heever.'' The closest synonym is slip, a clip of ''slip of the tongue.'' Such a misspoken or tripped-over word or phrase sometimes gets edited out of a taped interview in an act of kindness. 
 Misspoke, as in the usage ''the president misspoke,'' is a verb back-formed from the aforementioned ''misspoken.'' It is a press-secretarial phrase in growing use that asserts with a note of defiance: ''You know that's not what he meant, so don't make it a big deal.'' 
 Asked about Hillary Clinton's false memory of being under sniper fire at a Bosnian airport -- which the psychiatrist-journalist Charles Krauthammer perceptively diagnosed as a relatively common psychological ''confabulation'' -- John McCain said: ''I have misspoken from time to time, and so I think she just misspoke. . . . Maybe we should be focusing on the issues that are of importance.'' I would classify Clinton's gleefully derided Bosnia recollection as an exploitable mental lapse; her strategy of ignoring small-state caucuses was a blunder; and her evocation of the length of Robert Kennedy's primary campaign, with its ancillary reminder of his assassination, caused such a shudder that it can be judged a gaffe.
 McCain's admission that economics was not his strong suit makes it into the gaffe tank because he was chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee for six years and such modesty now haunts him. Contrariwise, his statement that U.S. forces might be in Iraq for ''100 years,'' seized upon as a gaffe by Obama supporters, lends itself to counterattack as a smear because the tape exists to show the phrase was taken out of context.
 ''When Barack Obama incorrectly named the wrong concentration camp that his great-uncle had helped liberate, that was incorrectly called a gaffe,'' protests James Miceli in an e-mail message. I agree; it was a slip, or to use a newer word, a thinko, coined on the analogy of ''typo.'' Last month, Obama thrice called Matt Lauer of the ''Today'' show ''Tim'' until the embarrassed host had to correct him for what CNN called a faux pas, French for ''false step,'' meaning ''social error''; Obama had been on ''Meet the Press'' the day before with Tim Russert (whom we now remember as TV's fairest of them all), and the repeated misnaming can be dismissed as a lapse. Most Democrats, however, would glumly concede that he got into trouble with his April remark about people in small towns: ''They get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy toward people who aren't like them . . . as a way to explain their frustrations.'' That was a gaffe because it added fuel to charges of elitism (though it was a stretch to label it ''bittergate'').
 One thing for which the millions of us who are mistake-prone can be thankful: nobody descends to the baby-talk boo-boo any more.

HEADLINE: The Oracle Collective

BYLINE: By VIRGINIA HEFFERNAN

 BODY:
You're not supposed to use the Internet like a Magic 8 Ball. Google can't tell you whether you'll pass the bar exam or find happiness in Spokane. But almost from the start, the Web has been barraged with personal questions -- often highly subjective ones. Internet users want to do more than ''conduct searches'' as if they were military police. They want to canvass opinions, plead for sympathy, share an experience or otherwise be humored. 
 Fortunately, a deluxe humoring service has arrived, in the form of Yahoo Answers. In the two years since it was introduced, Yahoo Answers has become second in popularity only to Wikipedia as a reference site. Unlike search engines, it doesn't direct seekers to lists of citations, databases, entries and advertisers. Instead, the service delivers questioners to other people who simply like questions, matching inquiring minds with know-it-alls. 
 You can read questions and answers without joining, but if you join, you can also ask questions (which costs you points, in the ingenious economy of the service) or answer them (which earns points). Named experts don't weigh in; no one is paid; answers are composed, ad hoc, by the people and for the people. Members ascend various levels for asking and answering, and with each level comes privileges: you win credibility and a better seat at the seminar. 
 Take some recent questions plaguing the people of the world. 
 ''Will Clinton supporters vote for McCain?'' Joy asks. Schona replies, ''I think some will not bother to vote, but most will come around to support Obama in the end.''
 ''Who will Barack Obama choose as his vice president?'' asks starfishblues. 
 Twenty-seven answers follow, filled with knowing references to ''swing states,'' ''the Hispanic vote'' and the unlikelihood of Joe Biden agreeing to leave his post as chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. Admittedly, a couple of replies are obnoxious, and several are simply partisan. But starfishblues has deemed her question ''resolved,'' in Yahoo Answers parlance, because she hit the motherlode with an answer from Donnie Brasco. 
 ''Richardson is a good option,'' Donnie Brasco begins. ''I think Obama will really be tough to beat in Nov. if he picks either Gen. Clark, Gov. Sebelius, Gov. Napolitano, Gov. Kaine or Sen. Hagel. Gen. Clark has the military background to counter Sen. McCain's views of Iraq. . . . Gov. Kaine can possibly deliver VA to Sen. Obama and make him competitive in NC. Govs. Sebelius and Napolitano can attract female support. . . . Sebelius can make him competitive in the Midwest and Napolitano can make him competitive in the Southwest just like Gov. Richardson. Hagel would be the perfect bipartisan ticket if McCain picks Lieberman.''
 Whew. And that's just an excerpt. This kind of exhaustive pro bono punditry -- with all the flourishes of professional talking heads -- is part of what makes Yahoo's service so surprising.
 A decent colloquial question-answer service on the Internet has been a long time coming. In the mid-1990s, technocritics worried that using the Internet would be like ''drinking from a firehose,'' as Cliff Stoll put it. In 1996, AskJeeves.com appeared, an obliging valet who would fetch drinks of water and spare newbies from the blast. Jeeves purported to tackle questions with infinite patience -- from ''how do I make moonshine?'' to ''why am I so tired?'' -- and return silver-plattered answers from reliable sources on the Web.
 What AskJeeves retrieved, however, was hard to make heads or tails of. If you asked ''what is this rash?'' you were left with something like what still shows up on the revamped version of the site, now called Ask.com: two links to encyclopedia entries, including ''rash'' (''a change in the skin'') and ''Red & Anarchist Skinheads,'' a k a RASH.
 Years ago I despaired at AskJeeves, and these days I never look at Ask. Before Yahoo Answers, I'd just use Google for my questions, and I was forever being detained with impenetrable papers from Medline or iVillage bulletins that were really ads.
 Today I go straight to Yahoo. When I expand the same question I put to Ask -- ''What is this dry, rashy patch on my neck?'' -- the question is registered, and then I am introduced to kindred spirits. Off the bat I'm drawn to outlaw--immortalz, who phrases our problem this way: ''Can you tell me what type of rash or skin disease i may have?'' He elaborates: ''Im a black male and i have like these dark patches around my neck, they dont itch or anything they just become really dry if i dont moisturize it. . . . Can anyone help me?''
 A reply that serves him and me both comes up: ''Eczema or psoriasis. I recommend seeing a dermatologist who can give you topical lotions to subdue the problem.'' Instant relief. The problem already feels subdued. Not only does some anonymous smarty recognize a rash right away, and project absolute confidence about its being subduable, but outlaw--immortalz has bucked me up with his belief in the power of the people and emotional openness. I feel less shame. I feel less itchy. I'm not kidding.
 In discussions of Google, hypothetical queries always have the sheen of scholarliness. We imagine Web users asking about the history of Montana or Bjork's second album -- the same kind of questions that callers used to ask the information and research desks of the New York Public Library. 
 In fact, people ask the Web all kinds of crazy things, including ''Does he love me?'' (Mamay: ''He's 13, he doesn't know what love is.'') Look over your own Google search history, if you can bear it. Embarrassment does not inhibit us, as it must have inhibited callers to the public library. People ask about shoe fetishes. They ask about suing their parents for malpractice. They ask about what's cool to wear in Dallas. 
 And they ask from the heart. So far, the Yahoo Answers points system rights the giving-and-getting balance, while kindly presupposing that every member has something to say -- a valuable answer for someone, somewhere. And we do. If nothing else, we can mirror a questioner's confusion and make him feel less alone. What I'm saying is: Maybe when we turn to the Internet with questions, we're not looking for information. We're looking for -- yeah, I'll say it -- love. 
 POINTS OF ENTRY
 This Week's Recommendations
 ASK AND YE SHALL RECEIVE: Interrogate the Internet at Yahoo Answers -- answers.yahoo.com -- where odd questions and odd answers are welcome. Also, don't miss this hilarious cartoon sendup of the less literate side of Yahoo Answers: somethingawful.com/flash/shmorky/babby.swf.
 CONCENTRATE AND ASK AGAIN: The Magic 8 Ball, a 1946 invention by Al Carter and Abe Bookman of the Alabe Crafts company, expressed postwar optimism about -- oh, who knows? It was a weird plastic ball filled with gooey fluid that had a triangle thingy floating in it. Mattel has produced it since 1997. Something in the phrasing of the 8 Ball's answers -- ''My sources say no,'' ''Reply hazy, try again'' -- was poetic. Fans solemnly dissect one at 8ball.ofb.net. And while many have tried digital versions, Mattel's own is best: mattelgamefinder.com/demos.asp?demo=mb.
 MEN ASKING DIRECTIONS: Though it seemed at first like another ill-conceived effort to get guys to buy cars and razors, AskMen.com has emerged (over eight years) as a daily magazine in the GQ mode. Pressing questions like ''Do real men like Coldplay?'' propel the blogs, and poker, gadgets and Scarlett Johansson are all comprehensively covered.

HEADLINE: Zimbabwe Faces Wider Sanctions Under Bush Plan

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG and CELIA W. DUGGER; Sheryl Gay Stolberg reported from Washington, and Celia W. Dugger from Johannesburg. Neil MacFarquhar contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Bush called Saturday for an international arms embargo against Zimbabwe in the wake of last week's ''sham election,'' and announced that the United States is drafting new economic sanctions that, for the first time, would take aim at the entire government of President Robert Mugabe.
 ''The international community has condemned the Mugabe regime's ruthless campaign of politically motivated violence and intimidation,'' Mr. Bush said in a statement from the presidential retreat at Camp David, Md., adding that he had directed his secretaries of treasury and state to develop sanctions ''against this illegitimate government of Zimbabwe and those who support it.''
 The announcement came a day after Zimbabweans voted in a presidential runoff that has been widely denounced by Western leaders because of state-sponsored violence and efforts to intimidate voters with threats of beatings if they failed to cast their ballots for Mr. Mugabe, the sole candidate. Dozens of opposition supporters were killed in the weeks leading to the runoff. 
 The opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, dropped out of the race, citing continuing attacks against his supporters, and he later sought refuge in the Dutch Embassy. By taking the rare step of imposing sanctions on the government, the United States would put Zimbabwe in a league with nations like North Korea and Iran -- a significant toughening of current policy toward Zimbabwe. The Bush administration has already imposed sanctions on Zimbabwe, but they apply only to about 140 members of the governing elite and the businesses they own and control. 
 ''This certainly steps up pretty dramatically the scale of punitive action,'' said J. Stephen Morrison, who directs the Africa program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies here, and worked on Africa issues in the State Department under President Clinton. ''It's long overdue, but having Bush get out there and say some hard things is very important.''
 The call for an international arms embargo, which Mr. Bush coupled with a proposed ban on travel by officials of the Mugabe government, is unlikely to be successful. American officials said it would almost certainly run into opposition at the United Nations from South Africa, Russia and China; South Africa's position has long been that the Zimbabwe election is an internal affair.
 The United States' own sanctions, by contrast, can be carried out unilaterally. American officials and outside experts said they hope the sanctions would put pressure on Zimbabwe's mining industry, a crucial source of foreign exchange for a government that is very short of it. The sanctions are expected to restrict the government's ability to do business with American companies, although it is unclear which agencies or state-controlled businesses would be affected. 
 Africa experts and human rights advocates have not generally been calling for sanctions, in part, Mr. Morrison said, because they have been so focused on trying to tamp down the violence and abuses surrounding the elections. In Washington, Mr. Morrison and a colleague, Mark Bellamy, a former ambassador to Kenya, have been pressing for a diplomatic offensive to create an international consensus that Mr. Mugabe must be ousted.
 Zimbabwe's opposition spokesman, Nelson Chamisa, asked whether his party favored sanctions, would say only that it sought intensified international pressure. It seems likely that the opposition is reluctant to demand sanctions for fear of playing into Mr. Mugabe's hands. The state media, daily, in story after story, blame the limited sanctions imposed by the United States and Europe on the Zimbabwean elite for having led to the country's economic ruin.
 It is almost certain that Mr. Mugabe will argue that any new sanctions are part of a Western plot to topple him.
 It is unclear how much pain that sanctions would actually inflict on the Mugabe government, especially if Zimbabwe continues to get support from countries like South Africa and China. 
 A senior American official said Saturday that the decision on the United States' sanctions had been made in the previous 48 hours, and research on how to carry them out had just begun. Although officials, for instance, said sanctions might allow the United States to freeze Zimbabwean assets in American banks, it was unclear if such assets existed. 
 Arvind Ganesam, director of the business and human rights program at Human Rights Watch, said sanctions on mining could have a significant impact, depending on how they were worded. ''As long as the government can draw on mining revenues, it's got a revenue stream independent of its own population,'' he said. ''And as long as it has access to those assets it can be as irresponsible as it wants.''
 United States officials said the sanctions, which would take at least two weeks to draw up, could still be averted if Mr. Mugabe installs what the United States considers a legitimate government. Mr. Tsvangirai drew 48 percent of the votes in the general election in March, to Mr. Mugabe's 43 percent, but the runoff was called because neither side had a majority. 
 ''We don't have a government in Zimbabwe that reflects the will of the people; the pressure has to be ratcheted up,'' said Gordon D. Johndroe, a deputy White House press secretary and spokesman for Mr. Bush's national security adviser, Stephen J. Hadley. 
 The results of Friday's runoff are expected to be announced as early as Sunday.
 In making the statement about sanctions, Mr. Bush was defying warnings last week by the African National Congress, South Africa's governing party, to stay out of Zimbabwe's business. 
 The White House had been monitoring the situation all week. On Monday Mr. Bush's top advisers on Africa briefed him. On Wednesday, he met at the White House with the permanent representatives to the United Nations Security Council, and later called on the African Union to ''continue to remind the world that this election is not free and it's not fair.'' 
 On Friday night, Mr. Hadley briefed Mr. Bush again. By that time, the United States had already begun discussions with its European allies in the Security Council about possible sanctions. American officials circulated a draft resolution Friday that would include an arms embargo and travel and financial restrictions on important members of the government, diplomats said. 
 The sanctions would extend to individuals who ''engaged in or provided support for actions or policies to undermine democratic processes or institutions in Zimbabwe including having ordered, planned or participated in acts of politically-motivated violence,'' the draft reads, according to one diplomat who read aloud from the document but requested anonymity for sharing it.
 South Africa has torpedoed most attempts to criticize Zimbabwe. Dumisani Kumalo, South Africa's ambassador to the United Nations, said last week that the Council should not weigh in before the African heads of state at an African Union summit in Egypt on Monday. 
 ''It's an African issue,'' he said.
 Although the proposed embargo seems destined to fail, Mr. Morrison said the push at the United Nations could increase pressure on the international community. ''The fact that they're willing to push it and embarrass people and make them uncomfortable is a good thing,'' he said. ''It will stigmatize the arms transactions; it will get the Chinese to think twice; it will perhaps get others to think twice.''

CORRECTION-DATE: July 6, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about new American economic sanctions to be imposed on Zimbabwe following that country's presidential runoff election on June 27, which was widely criticized as fraudulent and coercive, misspelled the surname of the director of the business and human rights program of Human Rights Watch, who said the sanctions could have a significant impact on Zimbabwe's mining industry. He is Arvind Ganesan, not Ganesam.

HEADLINE: OCCUPATION PLAN FOR IRAQ FAULTED IN ARMY HISTORY

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Soon after American forces toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003, Gen. Tommy R. Franks surprised senior Army officers by revamping the Baghdad-based military command. 
 The decision reflected the assumption by General Franks, the top American commander for the Iraq invasion, that the major fighting was over. But according to an Army history that is to be made public on Monday, the move put the military effort in the hands of a short-staffed headquarters led by a newly promoted three-star general, and was made over the objections of the Army's vice chief of staff. 
 ''The move was sudden and caught most of the senior commanders in Iraq unaware,'' states the history, which adds that the staff for the new headquarters was not initially ''configured for the types of responsibilities it received.''
 The story of the American occupation of Iraq has been the subject of numerous books, studies and memoirs. But now the Army has waded into the highly charged debate with its own nearly 700-page account: ''On Point II: Transition to the New Campaign.'' 
 The unclassified study, the second volume in a continuing history of the Iraq conflict, is as noteworthy for who prepared it as for what it says. In essence, the study is an attempt by the Army to tell the story of one of the most contentious periods in its history to military experts -- and to itself. 
 It adds to a growing body of literature about the problems the United States encountered in Iraq, not all of which has been embraced by Army leaders.
 Lt. Col. Paul Yingling of the Army ignited a debate when he wrote a magazine article that criticized American generals for failing to prepare a coherent plan to stabilize postwar Iraq. 
 In 2005, the RAND Corporation submitted a report to the Army, called ''Rebuilding Iraq,'' that identified problems with virtually every government agency that played a role in planning the postwar phase. After a long delay, the report is scheduled to be made public on Monday.
 But the ''On Point'' report carries the imprimatur of the Army's Combined Arms Center at Fort Leavenworth. The study is based on 200 interviews conducted by military historians and includes long quotations from active or recently retired officers. 
 Publication was delayed six months so that Gen. George W. Casey Jr., the current Army chief of staff and former top commander in Iraq, could be interviewed and senior Army leaders could review a draft. 
 The study's authors were instructed not to shy away from controversy while withholding a final verdict on whether senior officials had made mistakes that decisively altered the course of the war, said Col. Timothy R. Reese, the director of the Combat Studies Institute at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., who, along with Donald Wright, a civilian historian at the institute, oversaw the volume's preparation. 
 Even so, the study documents a number of problems that hampered the Army's ability to stabilize the country during Phase IV, as the postwar stage was called. 
 ''The Army, as the service primarily responsible for ground operations, should have insisted on better Phase IV planning and preparations through its voice on the Joint Chiefs of Staff,'' the study noted. ''The military means employed were sufficient to destroy the Saddam regime; they were not sufficient to replace it with the type of nation-state the United States wished to see in its place.''
 For his part, General Franks said through an aide that he had covered Iraq decisions in his book and had not seen the forthcoming report.
 The report focuses on the 18 months after President Bush's May 2003 announcement that major combat operations in Iraq were over. It was a period when the Army took on unanticipated occupation duties and was forced to develop new intelligence-gathering techniques, armor its Humvees, revise its tactics and, after the Abu Ghraib prison scandal, review its detention practices. 
 A big problem, the study says, was the lack of detailed plans before the war for the postwar phase, a deficiency that reflected the general optimism in the White House and in the Pentagon, led by then-Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld, about Iraq's future, and an assumption that civilian agencies would assume much of the burden. 
 ''I can remember asking the question during our war gaming and the development of our plan, 'O.K., we are in Baghdad, what next?' No real good answers came forth,'' Col. Thomas G. Torrance, the commander of the Third Infantry Division's artillery, told Army historians. 
 The allied land war command, which was led by Lt. Gen. David D. McKiernan and which reported to General Franks, did additional work on the postwar phase, but its plan was not formally distributed to the troops until April 2003, when the ground invasion was under way.
 Inadequate training was also a factor. Lt. Col. Troy Perry, the operations officer of the First Battalion, 68th Armor Regiment, told Army historians that his unit trained extensively, but not for the sort of problems that it would encounter in setting up ''stability operations'' for securing Iraq once Mr. Hussein's government fell. 
 A fundamental assumption that hobbled the military's planning was that Iraq's ministries and institutions would continue to function after Mr. Hussein's government was toppled. 
 ''We had the wrong assumptions and therefore we had the wrong plan to put into play,'' said Gen. William S. Wallace, who led the V Corps during the invasion and currently leads the Army's Training and Doctrine Command. 
 Faced with a brewing insurgency and occupation duties that they had not anticipated, Army units were forced to adapt. But organizational decisions made in May and June 2003 complicated that task. 
 L. Paul Bremer III, who replaced Jay Garner, the retired lieutenant general, as the chief civilian administrator in Iraq, issued decrees to disband the Iraqi Army and ban thousands of former Baath Party members from working for the government, orders that the study asserts caught American field commanders ''off guard'' and, in their view, ''created a pool of disaffected and unemployed Sunni Arabs'' that the insurgency could draw on. 
 Some of General Franks's moves also appeared divorced from the growing problems in Iraq. Before the fall of Baghdad, Col. Kevin Benson, a planner at the land war command, developed a plan that called for using about 300,000 soldiers to secure postwar Iraq, about twice as many as were deployed. 
 But that was not what General Franks and the Bush administration had in mind. In an April 16 visit to Baghdad, General Franks instructed his officers to be prepared to reduce forces rapidly during an ''an abbreviated period of stability operations,'' the study notes.
 ''In line with the prewar planning and general euphoria at the rapid crumbling of the Saddam regime, Franks continued to plan for a very limited role for U.S. ground forces in Iraq,'' the report says. 
 The next month, General Franks directed General McKiernan, then the senior officer in Baghdad, to leave Iraq, along with the staff of his land war command, which had helped plan the invasion and had overseen the push to Baghdad. 
 A new headquarters would be established to command the military forces in Iraq and was to be led by Lt. Gen. Ricardo S. Sanchez. He had led the First Armored Division into Iraq before being promoted and picked to succeed General Wallace as the head of the Army's V Corps, which was to serve as the nucleus of the newly established command. 
 When Gen. Jack Keane, the vice chief of staff of the Army, learned of the move, he was upset. General Keane had helped General McKiernan assemble his headquarters, which had long been focused on Iraq and had more high-ranking officers than V Corps, which had been deployed from Europe. General Keane assumed that General McKiernan's headquarters would oversee what was fast becoming a troubled occupation. 
 ''I think we did not put the best experienced headquarters that we had in charge of that operation,'' General Keane said in an interview with Army historians. ''It took us months, six or seven or eight months, to get some semblance of a headquarters together so Sanchez could at least begin to function effectively.'' 
 General Keane told the historians that he raised his concerns at the time with Lt. Gen. John P. Abizaid, who had been picked to succeed General Franks as the head of Central Command. 
 ''I said, 'Jesus Christ, John, this is a recipe for disaster,' '' General Keane told Army historians. ''I was upset about it to say the least, but the decision had been made and it was a done deal.'' 
 Asked about the decision to establish a new headquarters, General Franks told Army historians that he had told the Pentagon what was needed and that it was the Defense Department's responsibility to ensure that the headquarters was rapidly installed. 
 He said he told the Pentagon leadership that a new headquarters was needed and that it was up to them to ''figure it out.''
 General Sanchez, who has retired from the Army and recently published a book about his time in Iraq, told historians that his new command was hampered by staff shortages and by the failure to coordinate the transfer of responsibilities to his new headquarters. 
 ''There was not a single session that was held at the command level to hand off or transition anything,'' he said. 
 Summing up the episode, General Wallace told historians that the shift to a new headquarters involved a complicated transfer of responsibilities at a critical time.
 ''You can't take a tactical headquarters and change it into an operational headquarters at the snap of your fingers,'' he said. ''It just doesn't happen.''

HEADLINE: For Iraq's Oil Contracts, a Question of Motive

BYLINE: By PETER S. GOODMAN

 BODY:
From the first days that American-led forces took control of Iraq, the conquering army took pains to broadcast that it was there to liberate the country, not occupy it, and certainly not to cart off its riches. Nowhere were such words more carefully dispensed than on the subject of Iraq's oil. 
 As they surveyed facilities in the weeks after Saddam Hussein's government fell, American officials said they were merely advising Iraqis on how to increase production to finance the democratic nation being erected across desert sands that, conveniently, held the third-largest oil reserves on earth.
 Many critics of the invasion derided that characterization. In Arab countries and among some people in America, there was suspicion that the war was a naked grab for oil that would open Iraq to multinational energy giants. President Bush had roots in the Texas oil industry. Vice President Cheney had overseen Halliburton, the oil services company. Whatever else happened, such critics said, energy players with links to the White House would surely wind up with a nice piece of the spoils. 
 Behind those competing conceptions was a fundamental reality that forms the wallpaper for American engagement in the Middle East: oil, and its critical importance to the American economy, has for decades been a paramount interest of the United States in the region. Almost everything the United States has tried to do there -- propping up autocrats or seeking democracy, fighting terrorism or withstanding Soviet influence, or, in this case, toppling the dictator Saddam Hussein -- could affect the availability of oil for American markets and therefore entailed some calculation about it. 
 Today, the question hanging over Iraq is whether its natural endowment will be used to help create a sustainable new state, or will instead be managed in ways that reward the cronies and allies of the country whose army toppled Mr. Hussein. Or perhaps both at the same time.
 That basic question was yanked back to the fore recently when word emerged from Baghdad, in a report in The New York Times, that the Iraqi oil ministry was close to awarding contracts to service its oil fields to some of the largest Western oil companies. While relatively small, these contracts could serve as a foot in the door for much more lucrative licenses to explore widely for Iraqi oil. 
 Some 40 companies from around the world had jockeyed for the contracts, but they were being awarded without competitive bids, the report said. Those about to land the deals -- Exxon Mobil, Shell, BP and Total -- had held oil rights in Iraq before Mr. Hussein nationalized the fields and kicked them out more than three decades ago. They all came from countries that had either been stalwart allies of the Bush administration or -- in the case of France, which is home to Total -- had lately increased their support for the American-led campaign to isolate Iran. 
 Just as striking were the companies that failed to capture a foothold: the Russian oil giant Lukoil, which had signed a deal to exploit a huge field in southern Iraq while Mr. Hussein was still in power, only to see it revoked just before he fell, and Chinese firms with their own claims. Before the 2003 invasion, the Russian and Chinese governments had lent muscle on the United Nations Security Council toward fending off American-led sanctions aimed at the Hussein government. 
 Iraqi officials said the no-bid deals reflected nothing more than pragmatic stewardship. Iraq needs to get more oil out of the ground to finance reconstruction, they said, and the oil giants getting the contracts have the skill to make that happen.
 But those most suspicious of the Bush administration's motives fixed on the contracts as validation. They accused the administration of pulling strings and shelving concerns about preserving Iraqi sovereignty, in favor of expedient deal-making in a time of exploding oil prices. 
 ''There does seem to be pressure from American officials brought on the Iraqi oil ministry to favor friendly countries and punish unfriendly countries,'' said Michael T. Klare, a political scientist at Hampshire College and author of the recent book ''Rising Powers, Shrinking Planet: The New Geopolitics of Energy'' (Henry Holt). ''That's the way it has to look to an outsider.''
 In the days after word of the deals leaked out, three senators, including Charles E. Schumer, the New York Democrat, demanded that the Bush administration somehow cancel the contracts, arguing that they would damage American credibility. 
 The White House disowned any role and said the senators were being hypocritical. Here they were, in effect, accusing the administration of orchestrating the deals, while calling for orchestration to make them disappear. 
 ''Iraq is a sovereign country,'' the White House spokeswoman, Dana Perino, told reporters. ''It can make decisions based on how it feels that it wants to move forward.''
 Sovereignty has been a subject wrapped in thorns ever since American-led forces drove Mr. Hussein from his palace. Arguments over who really makes decisions in Iraq, and for whose benefit, cut to the heart of the very point of the war.
 This tension has often hamstrung American efforts, making it difficult for those on the ground to act decisively. When looting swept across the country after Mr. Hussein's government fell, American and British forces traced their failure to crack down against civilians in part to a reluctance to be seen as strong-armed occupiers. But their inaction instead aroused the disgust of many Iraqis when the looters dismantled much of the nation.
 Oil has been a more delicate area. Any future Iraqi government would clearly need hefty oil revenues, and that requires significant modernization.
 In the early days after the Americans took over in May 2003, I drove with a team from the United States Army Corps of Engineers in Kirkuk to meet with the head of the North Oil Company, one of two state-owned giants. The Americans were keen that North Oil hire a private security firm to guard local installations.
 On the way over, the American commanding officer reminded his men that they were there as advisers, and should treat the Iraqi executive with deference. But within minutes the Americans were haranguing the company chief for moving too slowly. Later, the Americans vented about how much easier things would be if they were simply running the show. 
 ''I like to think of us as really nice conquerors,'' one of the Americans said.
 The Pentagon dispatched Phillip J. Carroll, a former head of Shell's operations in the United States, to advise the Iraqi oil ministry. Among critics of the war, it was assumed that Mr. Carroll was there to make sure that Mr. Hussein's allies would be walled out of the future Iraqi oil business while the United States and its friends got the choice opportunities. 
 Mr. Carroll dismissed such talk when I spoke with him shortly after he arrived in Baghdad, but he signaled that the shelf life of any contract dating back to Saddam might be brief. 
 ''There will have to be an evaluation by the ministry of those contracts and a determination of whether they were made in the best interests of the Iraqi people,'' Mr. Carroll said. 
 Five years later, the Iraqi oil ministry is about to hand out secretly negotiated contracts to a few companies that Saddam Hussein removed, while excluding firms from the countries that had better relations with the dictator.
 In an interview last week, Mr. Carroll said he assumed critics would assert unsavory motives, but he said that missed the point.
 ''These companies are long familiar with Iraq and have wonderful technology and loads of money,'' he said. ''The Iraqis could develop their own skills by learning from the international oil companies.''
 But energy experts argue that Iraq is one of the easier places on earth to summon oil from the ground, making the pedigree of the companies less significant. 
 No oil law has yet been agreed upon concerning how the oil royalties will be shared among Iraq's factions. So, as the Bush administration enters its final months, much about the future of Iraq's oil remains a mystery -- expect for which companies will get the first shot at the rewarding business of extracting more of it.

HEADLINE: Higher Minimum Wage Took Switching of Sides

BYLINE: By GREGORY B. HLADKY

DATELINE: HARTFORD 

 BODY:
 CONNECTICUT'S General Assembly handed Gov. M. Jodi Rell only the second and third veto overrides of her administration when some lawmakers jumped party lines last week to increase the state's minimum wage.
 Lawmakers overcame her veto to boost the minimum wage by 35 cents to $8 per hour as of January 2009 and to $8.25 the next year. Later that day, they also overrode her veto of another measure that would adjust the minimum wage paid by restaurants and bars.
 Supporters of the minimum wage increase called it a victory for the working poor at a time when they can barely afford enough gasoline to drive to their jobs. The governor labeled the override ''a seriously shortsighted decision that -- even if well intentioned -- will have long-lasting negative consequences for employers and employees alike all over Connecticut.'' 
 The first veto override could not have happened without the votes of the governor's fellow Republicans in the Senate.
 In the House, the drama was heightened when the chamber's longest-serving Democrat, Representative William R. Dyson, who represents a New Haven district with low-income areas, voted with Republicans to sustain the veto.
 Supporters of the minimum wage increase needed 101 votes in the House to achieve the two-thirds majority required for an override. They ended up with 102, but without Mr. Dyson's help.
 Mr. Dyson, 67, has decided not to run for re-election to the seat he has held for 32 years. He was one of the 106 House members who originally voted for the minimum wage increase when it passed the legislature in April. But when it came to the override vote -- most likely his last as a state lawmaker -- this longtime social activist switched sides.
 Some Democratic lawmakers have suggested in conversations and even on political blogs that Mr. Dyson's opposition to the override was a product of longstanding bitterness over his failed attempt to win the top leadership post in the House. In 2004, he lost a heated contest for House speaker to State Representative James A. Amann, a Democrat from Milford. Mr. Dyson was later replaced as co-chairman of the legislature's powerful Appropriations Committee, a position he had held for 16 years.
 Mr. Dyson, however, said his vote was driven only by concern that raising the wage base might force employers to cut jobs.
 ''This could very well result in people being laid off,'' Mr. Dyson said. ''We are in difficult economic times. In good economic times, I might vote differently,'' he said.
 Mr. Dyson said his switch was a result of the worsening economic climate since the original vote in April.
 He wasn't the only House member to switch sides on the issue. State Representatives George M. Wilber, a Democrat from Winsted, and Penny Bacchiochi, a Republican from Somers, opposed the increase, then voted this week in favor of it.
 In the Senate, where 24 votes were needed for an override, backers of the minimum wage increase received the support of two Republicans, State Senators Sam S.F. Caligiuri of Waterbury and Anthony Guglielmo of Stafford. The final Senate vote was 25 to 9.
 ''I looked at the data,'' Mr. Caligiuri said after the voting. ''I could not conclude that previous minimum wage increases in Connecticut resulted in any significant job losses. The second question was, would it help people? I concluded it would, particularly people in my district.''
 Waterbury is the state's fourth-largest city and one of its poorest. ''I've got constituents in the part of Waterbury I represent who would be helped by this,'' Mr. Caligiuri said.
 The second veto override came later on Monday, in votes by more than two-thirds majorities in the House and Senate in favor of a measure designed to help restaurants and bars deal with the increased minimum wage.
 Under the bill, bars and restaurants could pay members of their waiting staffs 31 percent less than the new minimum wage rate, and bartenders 11 percent less. The ''tip credit'' system is based on the supposition that most waiters earn tips that push their hourly pay well above the minimum wage. Currently, people waiting tables are paid 29.3 percent less than minimum wage and bartenders 8.2 percent less.

HEADLINE: Burnishing Credentials, Obama Will Visit the Middle East and Europe

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY; Michael Falcone contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Senator Barack Obama will make his first international trip as a presidential candidate this summer, his campaign announced Saturday, traveling to the Middle East and Europe in an effort to bolster his foreign policy experience in his fall campaign against Senator John McCain.
 Mr. Obama, the presumptive Democratic nominee, will visit Jordan, Israel, Germany, France and Britain. On a separate trip, he also is planning to tour Iraq and Afghanistan, although aides declined to disclose details or the dates of his travel for security reasons. 
 While the domestic economy is a resounding issue in the presidential campaign, several major distinctions between Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain revolve around their foreign policy, particularly the United States' military strategy in Iraq. 
 Mr. McCain, who is the presumed Republican nominee, has criticized Mr. Obama for not visiting Iraq in more than two years, saying he has not seen the progress achieved in the country.
 In the middle of a presidential campaign, candidates often have shied away from taking foreign trips, investing their time instead in battleground states. But this week, Mr. McCain heads to Colombia and Mexico, following a European tour in March and a visit to Canada this month.
 ''This trip will be an important opportunity for me to assess the situation in countries that are critical to American national security and to consult with some of our closest friends and allies about the common challenges we face,'' said Mr. Obama, of Illinois. ''France, Germany and the United Kingdom are key anchors of the transatlantic alliance and have contributed to the mission in Afghanistan. And I look forward to discussing how we can strengthen our partnership in the years to come.''
 The trip was announced as Mr. Obama made a private visit to wounded American troops at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. It will be his fourth international trip since his election to the Senate four years ago. He has visited Russia, the Middle East and several countries in Africa.
 Last month, Mr. Obama declined an invitation from Mr. McCain to make a joint visit to Iraq, saying, ''I just don't want to be involved in a political stunt.'' Mr. McCain, of Arizona, has visited Iraq eight times.
 In a meeting on Saturday with President Jalal Talabani of Iraq, Mr. McCain said the United States was making significant progress in the country since American troop strength was bolstered. As he has criticized Mr. Obama's proposal to remove combat troops from Iraq at a pace of one to two brigades a month, Mr. McCain has urged him to visit Iraq and meet with American military commanders. 
 The Republican National Committee has placed a clock on its Web site, counting down the time that has passed since Mr. Obama last visited Iraq -- January 2006, as part of a Congressional delegation to the Middle East.
 On Saturday, the two senators crossed paths as they delivered separate speeches to a Hispanic political group in Washington. They did not discuss their foreign travel, but both candidates pledged to make immigration reform a priority as they sought to consolidate their support among Hispanics, the country's fastest-growing demographic group.
 Mr. McCain, whose speech was interrupted four times by antiwar protesters, spoke of his bipartisan efforts to pass a comprehensive immigration reform proposal. He has since changed his emphasis to border security.
 ''Many Americans, with good cause, did not believe us when we said we would secure our borders, and so we failed in our efforts,'' Mr. McCain said.
 Mr. Obama acknowledged Mr. McCain's work on the reform bill, but also said that his rival had shifted his position on the issue.
 ''He deserves great credit,'' Mr. Obama said. ''But what he didn't mention is that when he was running for his party's nomination, he walked away from that commitment and said he wouldn't even support his own legislation if it came up for a vote.''

HEADLINE: Luring Affluent Renters

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY

 BODY:
ONE month's free rent. Two months' free rent. No security deposit.
 How about a year's worth of storage at Manhattan Mini Storage or an appointment at a doggie day spa for Rover on moving day?
 As the rental market in Manhattan has softened in recent months, these are some of the incentives that owners of high-end buildings are offering to lure tenants. The more elaborate enticements tend to be in new buildings that landlords are trying to fill as quickly as possible, but even owners of some established buildings are offering incentives to avoid having apartments go vacant.
 ''We definitely have seen a shift in the dynamic of the marketplace,'' said David J. Wine, a vice chairman at the Related Companies, which owns and manages about 5,000 rental units in New York City. ''The frenzy of a year or two ago has abated, and we're seeing renters be a lot more thoughtful in their rental decisions.''
 Landlords have adjusted accordingly. 
 ''A lot of landlords were getting ready to increase rents for the busy season, but they're finding that those projected rents aren't attainable,'' said Daniel Baum, the chief operating officer at the Real Estate Group New York, a Manhattan brokerage. ''No one anticipated having problems on the rental side, and it's definitely forcing property owners to take a second look at marketing and to rethink their pricing.''
 Market-rate rents have continued to rise, but the rate of growth is nowhere near the double-digit increases that landlords got in recent years. Brokers and building owners say that the troubled financial markets and layoffs on Wall Street probably led to the slow start of the rental season in April. Volume had increased by late May, but professionals in leasing offices say that the incentives being offered in the prime summer rental season are a clear sign of a weaker rental market. (Rents in the city's one million rent-stabilized apartments, regulated by government and not the market, this year will be allowed to increase by up to 4.5 percent on one-year leases and 8.5 percent on two-year leases.) 
 Market-rate rental buildings offering incentives tend to be clustered in specific neighborhoods, including the financial district, Harlem, Washington Heights and areas in the far eastern or western edges of Manhattan. 
 ''If a neighborhood is far from the subway or if there is some kind of negative, then that's where the owners are going to want to do something to make it more attractive to renters,'' said Gary Malin, the president of Citi Habitats.
 At 20 Exchange Place, a 57-story bank building in the financial district that is being converted into rental apartments, the owner is offering to pay brokers' fees, giving one month's free rent and agreeing to forgo a security deposit. The building is also offering the free day at the downtown pet emporium, the Salty Paw, to help make moving day as stress free as possible for pets and their owners. Tenants began moving in earlier this month. 
 Jack Berman, a vice president at Metro Loft Management, the building's owner, developer and manager, said the incentives seemed like a good tactic. ''The market's a little bit softer than it was this time last year,'' he said, ''and we wanted to hit the ground running. There are other competing buildings as well, and we have to play along.'' 
 For Mackenzie Rosenthal, who will be a senior at New York University next year and who will be moving into a one-bedroom at 20 Exchange Place this summer, ''the perks were just kind of too good to pass up.'' She said she and her father had ''pored over the lease, saying: 'Where's the catch?' but as far as we can tell, there doesn't seem to be one.''
 When she and a roommate moved into her current two-bedroom walk-up in the East Village, they had to come up with $12,000 to cover the broker's fee, security deposit and first and last month's rent. ''That was just ludicrous,'' she said. ''But when I move into my new apartment, all I need is the first month's rent.''
 Ms. Rosenthal said that after factoring in the free month's rent, her $3,000 apartment will cost her $2,750 a month. She worries that she will not be able to afford to stay in the apartment when her one-year lease is up, but her broker, Jeffrey Carlson of Platinum Properties, said that as an original tenant, she might be able to negotiate the same rate at renewal time. 
 Whenever the sales market slows, as it has in the last year, the rental market generally improves, absorbing potential buyers who opt to rent instead. But so far, both markets seem to have hit a plateau in New York City, and brokers and landlords fault the overall economy.
 ''Like every other business, the apartment market is a little tentative right now,'' said Linda Early, vice president of New York operations for Archstone, which owns 11 luxury rental buildings in the city. ''People are being more tentative and selective, so we're having many more people coming back for second looks.''
 As in past summers, recent college graduates have arrived in the city with job offers in hand, but not apparently in the same numbers as previous years. There are no firm statistics for recent hires, but the city reported losing 4,000 jobs in May, which is the biggest monthly job loss since May 2005 when 6,700 jobs were lost, said Marisa DiNatale, a senior economist at Moody's economy.com, a research company in West Chester, Pa. ''It's definitely been getting progressively worse,'' Ms. DiNatale said. 
 The numbers are almost sure to grow, she said, because many of the people laid off by Wall Street firms will not officially become unemployed until their severance pay runs out. For the entire metropolitan area, she said, Moody's economy.com is projecting a loss of 60,000 jobs by the beginning of 2009, with about 45,000 of those jobs in financial services.
 Mr. Wine traced the change in the psyche of the rental market to the collapse of Bear Stearns in March. ''The Bear Stearns fallout froze everybody,'' he said. ''Anybody who is in the financial markets saw that unfold and said, 'Let me just take a breath.' ''
 He said that so far Related had not offered incentives across the board at any of its buildings. ''We offer incentives selectively, depending on the day, the individual unit and lots of different factors,'' he said. ''But there definitely are negotiations taking place in the marketplace.''
 Shane Kramer, director of leasing for Bond New York, said that not since the months after Sept. 11, 2001, had he seen so many building owners offering free rent and agreeing to pay brokers' fees. ''The theory is owners may be anticipating something,'' he said, ''so they're doing what they can to keep the rent rolls higher.''
 Landlords are also being a little bit more flexible about move-in dates. ''In the past, if you come in today, they might want you to sign a lease immediately and move in tomorrow,'' he said, ''but now they might be willing to let you move in two weeks.'' 
 Incentives and negotiability, of course, are not happening uniformly. Most buildings that are offering incentives are ones with higher rents, but at least two of the city's biggest luxury apartment landlords have not offered any incentives: the Glenwood Management Corporation, which has 23 luxury rental buildings in the city, and Rose Associates Inc., which manages about a dozen high-end rental buildings.
 Competition for apartments in the midmarket -- where one-bedrooms rent for about $2,500 a month and two-bedrooms fetch about $3,200 -- is also as intense as ever. 
 Jakobson Properties, which owns and manages about 2,000 midmarket apartments in Manhattan and Queens, had a busier April this year than last and did not offer any incentives, said Peter Jakobson Jr., a principal in the company. But he said that he had not increased asking rents as much as he might have in a stronger market. For a one-bedroom in Queens that had been renting for $1,800, he might have sought $1,900 for it six months ago, but it is now on the market for $1,850, he said. 
 ''We're not offering incentives,'' he said, ''but we're reducing the prices to the market.'' 
 Mr. Malin said a recent Citi Habitats search found about 70 buildings offering incentives. The owners of these buildings, he said, ''are doing what they can to make their property stand out from another property across the street.''
 Joseph Keane, a managing partner of Keane Homes Inc., which owns and manages about 450 apartments in 18 buildings in Queens, said he had started advertising one month's free rent for apartments in Astoria and Forest Hills after seeing the incentives being offered by landlords in Manhattan.
 ''When I started to see the ads in Manhattan,'' he said, ''I wanted to be on top of the curve here in Queens. I would help pay broker's commissions, too, just to fill the units up.'' 
 The incentives at 188 Ludlow, a 25-story building on the Lower East Side, have gotten better since the building started leasing apartments in September. It is now 90 percent leased and in addition to one month's free rent and paying the broker's fee, it is offering to provide and coordinate a renter's move and to pay for a year of storage at Manhattan Mini Storage. 
 ''I think we have the most comprehensive incentive package out there,'' said Scott Taylor, the building's leasing manager. ''We've been playing with it to see what incentives inspire people.'' 
 Two of the largest buildings offering incentives are conversions that are adding about 1,000 new units to the financial district: Dwell, at 95 Wall Street, and 20 Exchange Place. At Dwell, an office building being converted into 503 apartments designed by Philippe Starck, the owners are offering two months' free rent and paying a broker's fee worth two months' rent. 
 Clifford Finn, the managing director of new development marketing at Citi Habitats, which is marketing the property, said the incentives were more than typical for a new development, ''because this product is very unique and it's a very high price point for the financial district.'' Studios start at $2,665 a month, one-bedrooms at $3,890 and two-bedrooms at $6,260.
 Paying brokers' fees naturally helps to market the property, because it not only encourages brokers to bring clients to the building, but also means the agents will spend their own money to advertise it. 
 Edward Cho, an agent at Urban Sanctuary, who has listed apartments at 95 Wall Street on the Web site Craigslist, said he thought the incentives were working. ''They have a lot of units,'' he said, ''but with all the incentives they've been offering, they've been quite busy.''
 The incentives persuaded Steve Alaimo, one of Mr. Cho's clients, to rent a one-bedroom for $4,100 a month. Mr. Alaimo said he had looked at buildings across Manhattan and probably wouldn't have chosen 95 Wall without the two months' free rent. 
 ''Averaged out over 14 months,'' he said, ''the rent is about $3,500, and I know I got a lot more for my money than anything in that price range would offer.'' He was referring to the apartment's design, and to amenities like 24-hour concierge service and free breakfast served daily in a penthouse lounge.
 Looking ahead, Mr. Wine of Related said that a year from now, the Far West Side of Manhattan between 37th and 42nd Streets may be one of the busiest areas in the city for rentals.
 Related and several other major developers plan to open buildings that are expected to add 1,500 to 2,000 new apartments to the area.
 ''In that submarket,'' he said, ''there will probably be incentives for renters. Or maybe the timing will be great for the market to absorb it -- it will be a very interesting time when all those buildings come online.''

HEADLINE: A City Slicker's Urbane Makeover

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
Santa Barbara, Calif.
WITH gasoline soaring past $4 and polar bears wondering where their next ice floes will come from, the Suburbans, Navigators and Durangos that generated much of the domestic auto industry's profits have become harder to sell than trans fats. It's no wonder, then, that crossovers -- car-based utility vehicles that usually burn less fuel than their truck-based counterparts -- are replacing S.U.V.'s in the showrooms of the beleaguered automakers.
Nor, by the same token, is it surprising that Nissan has a lot riding on the redesign of the Murano, one of the first crossovers to be marketed primarily as an urban antique-schlepping alternative to backwoodsy S.U.V.'s.
Shoppers seeking a fewer-tears alternative to a midsize S.U.V. are likely to like what they see in the Murano. The 2009 model has the plush ride, tanklike isolation and high-above-the-crowd perch that the sport utility crowd has come to appreciate. But the new Murano handles far better and gets respectable, if not breathtaking, mileage. The question haunting automakers is whether the reaction to S.U.V. excess will also overwhelm the crossover market, particularly the brands lacking the cachet of, say, Lexus or BMW. 
The new Murano offers just one engine, a 3.5-liter 265-horsepower V-6 that is a variant of the power plant that drives Nissan vehicles ranging from the Altima all the way up to the Infiniti M35. The only transmission available is Nissan's Xtronic, a continuously variable unit also found in the Altima and Maxima. But buyers do have a choice of three trim levels and either front-wheel or all-wheel drive.
The entry-level Murano S, which lists for $27,075 ($28,675 with all-wheel drive) can hardly be called a stripper. It comes with, among other goodies, antilock brakes, electronic stability control, 18-inch alloy wheels, halogen headlights, power door locks, dual-zone automatic climate control, a six-speaker sound system with CD changer and MP3 inputs, trip computer, keyless entry, tire-pressure monitor and air bags galore.
Still, to add the features to which Americans have grown accustomed, one must move up to the Murano SL. The extra $1,550 gets you fog lights, a power driver's seat and steering wheel controls for the audio system, along with the opportunity to lay down more cash for an array of pricey options.
Nissan, of course, is hoping customers will avoid all those difficult choices by opting for the top-of-the-line LE, available only in all-wheel drive ($36,655). The extra $6,000 and change above the price for the SL gets you 20-inch alloy wheels along with the leather, technology and convenience packages that are options on the SL.
Still, you'll have to write an even bigger check if you want the navigation system, the two-panel moonroof or the DVD player.
I tested an LE that lacked only the DVD player -- an omission that held the sticker below $40,000.
Yet even at these heady prices, the Murano has much to recommend it.
Start with the exterior. From the beginning (in the 2003 model year) Nissan's design strategy for the Murano was to create the iconic un-S.U.V. with a fluid shape that would never be mistaken for a Honda Pilot, a Toyota Highlander -- or a Nissan Pathfinder.
The second-generation Murano is the same, only more so. Both the hood and rear window bulge in unexpected places, and the huge wheels add to the Toontown look. Only the sinister grin of the oversize toothy grille strikes an odd note. But that garish face serves a purpose: it's impossible to confuse the Murano with an Explorer.
Inside, the Murano LE was warm and luxurious, yet businesslike in its subdued colors, high-quality materials, ergonomically superior controls and seamless fit -- what Nissan's marketing gurus have dubbed the ''mobile suite.''
The pricey ($1,170) dual-panel moonroof imparts an even airier feel to the generous cabin. And happily, Nissan has gone overboard in the fit-and-finish department, perhaps to erase memories of the low-rent materials and sloppy assembly in several Nissans of the recent past, including the first Muranos.
What's more, the Murano is as comfortable inside as it is handsome. While it has S.U.V.-like ground clearance and provides a commanding view from the cabin, the Murano is relatively easy to enter. The pliant but supportive driver's seat is a keeper: my aching back prefers it to just about any seat I can remember. And the second-row seating is more than adequate, thanks to fairly generous legroom, backrests with adjustable angles, a flat floor to accommodate the middle passenger and upscale cushioning all around. As with almost all crossovers, the second-row backrest folds down in two parts to mix and match people and cargo.
Speaking of people and cargo, the carrying capacity of the Murano is modest by the standards of the breed. Unlike most midsize crossovers and sport utilities, it doesn't offer a third row of seats even as an option.
And the Murano's exuberant shape makes for less efficient use of space than the boxy competition. The Highlander, for example, has almost identical exterior dimensions but 50 percent more cargo capacity.
What the Murano loses, though, in straightforward utility, it recoups in drivability. This crossover is no sports car: the soft suspension shields passengers from the vicissitudes of irregular pavement at the price of considerable body roll. But, thanks to some serious electronic wizardry and the beautifully designed platform that it shares with the Altima, the Murano is a lot more fun to drive hard than a truck-based S.U.V.
According to Car and Driver magazine, the milkshake-smooth engine propels the two-ton Murano from a stop to 60 miles an hour in a zippy 7.3 seconds, a full second faster than the V-6 in the Hyundai Santa Fe. If not class-leading, the brakes are entirely adequate. What's more, the Murano remains surefooted and predictable in hard maneuvers, virtues that have a lot to do with the monster tires and the multitude of computerized stability features that automatically apportion power to the left and right and to the front and rear.
Few automakers have opted for continuously variable transmissions over the conventional multigear torque converter variety, because they typically impart an unpleasant rubber band feel to the accelerator and an odd whine as the engine revs up.
But while some companies (like General Motors) have backed away from C.V.T.'s, Nissan remains committed. Xtronic is now the only automatic available in the Versa, Sentra, Rogue, Altima and Maxima, as well as the Murano. And this second-generation C.V.T. doesn't disappoint.
It never intrudes on the driving experience, delivering power quietly, seamlessly and without hesitation. Yet it makes good on the technological promise of greater efficiency. During a week of driving on both mountain roads and on city streets, I often pushed the Murano to the limit and still managed 19 miles a gallon.
It's hard to know what the Murano's real competition is, because oil-shocked consumers have yet to reveal to the market what they are willing to sacrifice to economize on gasoline. All automakers are busy repositioning their relatively light S.U.V.'s as crossovers -- consider the Hyundai Santa Fe, Ford Edge and Honda Pilot. A slew of new ones, including the Dodge Journey and Toyota Venza, have either taken off or are idling on the runway.
In many ways, though, any midsize hatchback or station wagon qualifies as a substitute. For example, the all-wheel-drive Subaru Outback handles well and carries about the same volume of cargo, and the turbocharged 4-cylinder version is even faster than the Murano.
The only true crossover that beats the Murano on both drivability and sticker price is the Mazda CX-7. Indeed, it tops the Murano handily on both counts, providing performance close to that of a sport sedan for roughly $6,000 less. But there's a tradeoff: with a turbocharged 4-cylinder, the CX-7 is noisier, less roomy and much less comfortable. At least for the moment, the Murano is in a class by itself, offering an attractive compromise between the guilty pleasures of a luxury S.U.V. and the sensible shoes of a well-made station wagon.
INSIDE TRACK: Premium crossover, premium price.

HEADLINE: A Proud but Worn-out Parent, So Ready to Send the Kids Off to College

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP. 
E-mail: parenting@nytimes.com

 BODY:
''IT'S only a two-minute ride to school,'' said Adam. ''Calm down, Dad.'' He had his final final exam of high school, in economics, at 10:15 on June 17, and it was now 10:03, and how was he preparing? Reviewing his notes? No. (That's what his older brother, Ben, would do.) Sharpening those No. 2 pencils? No. (That's what his younger sister, Annie, had done that morning, before the eighth-grade state math test.)
A half-hour before the final, Adam had strolled around the corner to the deli to get himself a bacon, egg and cheese sandwich. As much as I urged him to get to school early so he'd be in the right frame of mind for the test, so he would graduate and go away to college in the fall (please, dear Lord), he would not accelerate his pace by one newton.
I had known it would come to this. It's why I'd made sure I was home that Tuesday morning. I knew I would have to bird-dog my dear twin senior boys right to the bitter end. 
You don't graduate if you don't return all your books, and for weeks Ms. Katz, in Room 317 at the high school, and I had been exchanging information on the progress of the Winerip twins' final book roundup. (At the low point, we were looking at eight lost books between the two; however, when I said that they -- not I -- would pay, we whittled the list down pretty fast.)
''It's practically mathematically impossible for me to fail,'' Adam had reassured me. I tried to make the point that not failing wasn't the goal here, but he was locked on a replay of Tiger Woods sinking a birdie putt.
''Relax, Dad,'' said his twin, Sam. ''His test doesn't start until 10:30.''
''10:15,'' said Adam.
''You idiot,'' said Sam. ''You need to go.'' And only then, when his twin had spoken, did Adam head out the door to take his final final, accompanied by Sam, who was making one last hunt for his ninth-grade biology textbook.
They graduate on Sunday. They are off to college in the fall -- separating for the first time. And though I could not love them more, I am, as my sons say, so ready. Indeed, it's hard to know who's readier, the two of them or the one of me. For months I've been waging war on senioritis and, having been double-teamed, I am worn to a nub. It got to the point that when Ms. Palmer, the dean of discipline, called the house, she didn't bother identifying herself; she knew I'd recognize her voice.
And so while most of the attention at graduation will rightly focus on the lofty principles espoused by the valedictorian and salutatorian, I am just thankful that somewhere in that great mass of blue robes will be my twins.
I know I'm not alone. At our school, there was an extensive schedule of senioritis activities. Tuesday after Memorial Day was senior skip day. (''Everyone did it, Dad, it's no big deal.'') We live on a barrier island, and on June 11 the high school sent home a warning letter saying that a ''large group'' of seniors had scaled the fence behind the school and jumped into the bay, ''an unlawful act,'' and that there would be serious consequences if it happened again. (''I swear we didn't do it, Dad, it wasn't us this time, honest, Dad.'')
My twins never had the same view of high school that I did. Through ninth grade I'd pressed them relentlessly about their class work. But as much as I yelled, as much as I grounded them, they did not become the top students their older brother and younger sister are. I don't know how to explain it. They're smart. They'd been in gifted programs.
They just weren't interested.
My wife and I would go to parent-teacher conferences girded for the update -- the homework not turned in, the quizzes and unit tests that needed to be made up. When the teachers saw my hurt, they'd talk about what good boys they were, how funny they were, how wonderfully social they were. I dismissed these as backhanded compliments. I had been a top student, and while I always had a small group of good friends, I wasn't particularly social, nor was being social something I much cared about.
And so, it wasn't until midway through this senior year that it finally dawned on me what had happened. Somehow, we had raised two of the most popular kids at the high school. This didn't help at the recent academic awards night, when they won a few small prizes and I left reminded of all my parenting failures. But at varsity sports night -- they were stars. And when I saw the yearbook, my God, the two of them were everywhere: Adam winning a pie-eating contest; Sam, so handsome in a tuxedo for the school fashion show, blowing glitter from the stage; Sam and Adam dressed in ketchup and mustard costumes, leading the seniors to victory in the class Olympics.
Sam was voted best smile; Adam best dancer. (''Adam's not really the best dancer,'' Sam had explained to me. ''He just campaigned really hard for it.'')
I can say it out loud finally, now that they've got those blue robes on: As nerve-racking as they could be, it's been a great ride. Because they're so different from me, they've taken me so many places I'd never been, good and bad, and that's made me both a smarter and humbler parent. Any parenting smugness I once possessed is long gone. I know the dean of discipline sensed this. She'd always speak to me in gingerly tones. ''Mr. Winerip, it's not that bad, I don't want to give you a heart attack.''
When this keeps happening, your parental standards shift. After a while, I could see Adam's point: ''Dad, a one-day in-school suspension is not that big a deal.''
As an education columnist, I had long advocated for vocational schools, but thanks to Adam, I saw the importance firsthand. Adam had been miserable in A.P. English Composition during junior year, but in senior year he loved the carpentry course at our county vocational school, hopping out of bed before dawn to catch the bus.
Sam may have squeaked by in calculus, but his final class project, a profile of a mathematician, was masterly. He chose his teacher, Mr. Witkin, who is leaving the classroom after 33 years. Sam took a video camera around school to interview his thousand best friends, plus his teachers. That video contained everything from a close-up of Sam's bellybutton to teachers talking movingly about what made Mr. Witkin so good.
I feel sure that, even without a firm grasp of calculus, a boy whose video can make you laugh and cry will find his niche in the world.
Still, I face this summer with dread. I know there will be constant battling. Already they've started in on me. ''Why can't we have a 1 a.m. curfew, Dad, everyone else has a 1 a.m. curfew. We're 17!''
It's the one thing we agree on, they're 17. I've explained this is my last hurrah, that when they start college, I'm not going to be there to tell them when to be in, when to study, when it's O.K. to party.
As my wife and I have done for their older brother, we will pay for their four years, except for first semester freshman year. They will each pay for that with $15,000 of their summer job earnings. Our hope is that knowing how hard they had to work to save that money -- putting in six days a week, nine hours a day lifeguarding as juniors and seniors; getting up at 6:30 to clean restroom toilets at the beach as sophomores; umpiring Little League games each spring -- they will not waste their first year of college.
That, at least, is our hope.

HEADLINE: V.A.-Backed Loans on the Rise

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
IN recent years, military veterans followed the masses who migrated toward subprime loans, rather than avail themselves of government programs meant to provide them safer, if slightly more costly, alternatives.
Now the mortgage market is flowing back to normal, and veterans are making use of more traditional help. Demand for mortgages from the federal Department of Veterans Affairs is rising sharply, the V.A. said, and more growth is expected as conventional loan programs become more restrictive and home values fall back to earth.
''I think we'll continue to see increasing volume,'' said Judith Caden, who is director of the agency's loan-guarantee service. ''We're getting the word out about the program more.'' 
In recent months, Ms. Caden said, the V.A. has been publicizing improvements to the program in military publications and elsewhere. But the rise in demand started before that. In 2007, the V.A. guaranteed 33,000 loans. It is on track to guarantee 150,000 to 180,000 mortgages in 2008.
The V.A. does not actually finance the loans -- but leaves that to more than 42,000 lenders nationwide. It can, however, guarantee a loan on the borrower's behalf, thereby diminishing the lenders' risk and paving the way for interest rates that are much lower than the borrower would otherwise obtain.
Still, those interest rates are about one-quarter of a percentage point higher than prevailing market rates, because they often require no down payment. Borrowers who put less of their own money into a mortgage are riskier for lenders.
Active service members and veterans -- who must have at least six years of military service or an honorable discharge to qualify -- must also pay a financing fee of 0.5 percent to 3.3 percent of the loan; this fee is typically factored into the monthly payment. Surviving spouses of veterans may sometimes qualify, too. More details are available at www.homeloans.va.gov/.
The higher costs are balanced by the fact that a veteran may qualify for no down payment. That had become almost a hallmark of subprime mortgages during the recent mortgage bubble, which is why so many veterans shunned V.A. loans, Ms. Caden said. ''With the subprime meltdown, we're one of the only -- if not the only -- loan programs that's a true no-down-payment loan,'' she said.
A borrower makes payments to the lender, but many lenders have instituted a new system that quickly notifies the V.A. of late payments,Ms. Caden said. In those cases, the agency often works on the borrower's behalf to renegotiate the loan and avoid foreclosure.
Demand for V.A. loans in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut has traditionally been hampered by high real estate prices, since the program covers only loans of $417,000 or lower. But with real estate prices in the New York region softening, demand has surged here, too.
In the first five months of this year, New York veterans have been obtaining these loans at a pace that is 28 percent greater than in the corresponding period last year. Demand in Connecticut is up 15 percent; in New Jersey, demand has jumped 42 percent.
Regina Garlin, an owner of RCG Mortgage in Montclair, N.J., said that V.A. loans are ideal for those who cannot get down-payment help from friends, family or other sources.
For veterans who can find such help, she said, loans guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration are an even better alternative, since they often carry lower mortgage insurance premiums than V.A. loans.

HEADLINE: Don't Forget the Middle People

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
From his break in 1992 playing Bank Nerd No. 2 in the sitcom ''Married With Children,'' to his supporting role on the HBO hit ''Six Feet Under,'' to a part in last year's ''Spider-Man 3,'' Tim Maculan has navigated Hollywood more successfully than most actors.
 Lately, though, Mr. Maculan, 45, says the actor's place in the entertainment industry's economic food chain has changed. And for middle-income working actors like him, it's not for the better. ''It's not about networks being cheap or evil,'' Mr. Maculan said. ''It's just that the industry is dramatically different than it was even five years ago.'' 
 Mr. Maculan, a sarcastic character actor with a wicked grin, rattles off a list of industry shifts that have made it harder for middle-income actors to earn a living. Reality shows have crowded out scripted programs, comedies in particular. The studios are making fewer movies, and the ones they are making are less actor-driven. Networks like NBC have virtually stopped filming pilot episodes, meaning they are hiring fewer actors. Voice-over work, once a staple for less-known actors, is outsourced to other countries or given to A-list stars. 
 The Screen Actors Guild, now embroiled in negotiations with film and television producers over a new contract, has made the plight of the middle-income actor the centerpiece of its campaign for more lucrative terms. The guild is seeking increases for everything from reimbursement rates for car mileage to continuing payments called residuals. Guild leaders say the economic situation is so severe that they have no choice but to take a militant stance at the negotiating table.
 The guild's contract, which covers about 122,000 actor members, expires at midnight Monday. Because the two sides remain far apart on most issues, Hollywood has been on edge about a strike, taking care, for instance, to wrap production on films so costly location shoots are not drawn out.
 But no strike can take place until about Aug. 1 at the earliest. Guild leaders have yet to call for a strike authorization vote, which must be put before the entire membership and approved by 75 percent of voters. Carrie White, a spokeswoman for the Screen Actors Guild, said on Friday that the process would take up to three weeks.
 The guild has strongly indicated that it will not consider calling for a strike vote until July 8, when a second actors' union, the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, releases the results of a ratification vote on its new contract. That union reached an accord with studios and networks in May and shares about 44,000 members with the Screen Actors Guild.
 ''Any talk about a strike or a management lockout at this point is simply a distraction,'' Alan Rosenberg, the president of the guild, said in a statement Sunday. He added that guild negotiators have been ''coming to the bargaining table every day in good faith.''
 The two unions have been sparring in recent weeks, with each side lining up marquee stars to push its own agenda. 
 Aftra, the smaller of the two, wants members to ratify its deal and move on; SAG thinks the rival union negotiated a bad deal, particularly on issues of digital media, and wants to keep fighting for a better one. It worries that its leverage at the bargaining table will evaporate if Aftra members approve their contract by a solid margin.
 Like most Hollywood labor organizations, SAG bears little resemblance to unions as most Americans know them.
 Most unions represent workers with wallets of similar size, but SAG is a hodgepodge of wildly varying careers. On one extreme, SAG represents stars like Will Smith, who will take home well over $20 million from his coming film ''Hancock'' once all the receipts are counted. The bulk of its members, about two-thirds, according to some estimates, make less than $1,000 a year from acting, either because they can find no work or because they have moved on to other careers but kept up their dues.
 SAG said the average annual income for its membership was $52,000 a year. The guild said it could provide no other economic statistics about its membership, however. 
 The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, the organization that negotiates on behalf of studios, said its analysis of SAG membership showed that fewer than 4,000 of its members could be considered middle-income actors, that is, people making $25,000 to $100,000 from acting in a given year. Only 5 percent of SAG's membership earns more than $75,000 a year, according to the alliance.
 The alliance rejects the notion that a richer contract is necessary to offset changes in the industry that make life harder for actors. Cast costs rose at more than twice the rate of overall production costs between the 2000-1 television season and the 2007-8 season, according to alliance statistics. Total cast costs for television rose 78.4 percent during that period, compared with a 33.6 percent increase in overall production costs. 
 ''Making a living as an actor is ultimately a function of how often someone works, and that can't be guaranteed by the minimum terms that are set by the SAG contract,'' said Jesse Hiestand, an alliance spokesman. ''Our offer to SAG contains a number of increases that will benefit actors that do work, especially guest stars.''
 He added, ''SAG's negotiators should be working with us to keep scripted TV and the film business healthy so that it generates more work for their members.''
 Sharon Sachs, an actress who has worked on hit shows like ''Weeds'' and ''My Name Is Earl,'' is all for keeping the business robust, but she believes there has been a shift in what studios consider healthy. Industry consolidation over the last decade has resulted in a more corporate Hollywood, one that Ms. Sachs and other actors complain puts a higher emphasis on immediate profit margins than on the industry's long-term health.
 ''Before, the achievements you made artistically and financially were taken into consideration'' when studios offered roles, Ms. Sachs said. ''Now, it's much more 'take it or leave it.' The business doesn't flow on relationships like it used to.''

HEADLINE: How to Put Civil Liberties in the White House

BYLINE: By GEOFFREY R. STONE. 
Geoffrey R. Stone is a professor of law at the University of Chicago.

DATELINE: Chicago 

 BODY:
 AS we approach July 4, it is worth reminding ourselves of America's foundational idea. 
 This country is set apart from the rest of the world because of its unparalleled commitment to personal freedom and the dignity of the individual. It is a vision captured in the guarantee of freedom of speech, freedom of religion, due process of law, equal protection under the law and freedom from unreasonable search and seizure and cruel and unusual punishment. 
 We do not always live up to these aspirations. Over time, we have embarrassed ourselves and tarnished our image as a country that is respectful of civil liberties. We have persecuted dissenters, interned the innocent, suspended habeas corpus, invaded reasonable expectations of privacy. We have even engaged in torture. 
 What, then, can we do to see to it that we more reliably honor our core values? Here's a start.
 Presidents have a wide range of official advisers. There is a secretary of defense, a secretary of labor, a national security adviser, to name just a few. The next president should create a new executive branch position: a civil liberties adviser. Within the highest councils of every administration there should be a respected public official whose charge it is to defend our civil liberties against all comers.
 Many administrations have included high-level officials who have been strong advocates for civil liberties, even though this was not their explicit job description. At times, such officials have made a real difference. During World War I, for example, the administration of Woodrow Wilson conducted a devastating campaign to squelch dissent. Although the Justice Department vigorously supported this campaign -- prosecuting some 2,000 people for criticizing Wilson's war policies -- several key figures in the department (most notably John Lord O'Brian and Alfred Bettman) effectively moderated the government's campaign of repression. 
 Some years later, Francis Biddle, as Franklin Roosevelt's attorney general, championed respect for individual liberties from within the White House. He vigorously opposed the prosecution of dissenters, the mass detention of enemy aliens, J. Edgar Hoover's effort to authorize unbridled loyalty investigations of Americans and the internment of Japanese-Americans. Biddle did not always prevail, but he made a critical difference in our nation's policies.
 Too often, though, presidents have excluded voices supporting civil liberties from their highest councils. The results -- from Harry Truman's federal loyalty program and Richard Nixon's prosecution of war protesters to the actions of the current administration -- have never been happy. In some sense, these failures are not surprising. The preservation of civil liberties usually involves protecting the rights of dissenters, minorities and outsiders. It is often politically expedient to look the other way when the liberties of such people are denied. But as Francis Biddle observed, every man ''who cares about freedom must fight'' to protect it ''for the other man'' as well as for himself. 
 Some may object to the idea of an official civil liberties adviser (or a Council of Civil Liberties Advisers analogous to the Council of Economic Advisers) on the ground that we already have an attorney general, a legal counselor to the president, an office of legal counsel and a host of other lawyers in the executive branch. (The president himself is often a lawyer.) But all these officials, presidents included, have mixed and often conflicting agendas and responsibilities. None is assigned the specific responsibility of articulating and advancing the cause of civil liberties. 
 Of course, the civil liberties advisers may sometimes lose the debate, or even be shunted aside. But sometimes they will win -- and at the very least, they will always be heard.

HEADLINE: Hoarding Nations Drive Food Costs Ever Higher

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER and ANDREW MARTIN. 
Keith Bradsher reported from Thailand and the Philippines and Andrew Martin from Italy and Egypt.

DATELINE: BANGKOK 

 BODY:
At least 29 countries have sharply curbed food exports in recent months, to ensure that their own people have enough to eat, at affordable prices.
 When it comes to rice, India, Vietnam, China and 11 other countries have limited or banned exports. Fifteen countries, including Pakistan and Bolivia, have capped or halted wheat exports. More than a dozen have limited corn exports. Kazakhstan has restricted exports of sunflower seeds.
 The restrictions are making it harder for impoverished importing countries to afford the food they need. The export limits are forcing some of the most vulnerable people, those who rely on relief agencies, to go hungry.
 ''It's obvious that these export restrictions fuel the fire of price increases,'' said Pascal Lamy, the director general of the World Trade Organization. 
 And by increasing perceptions of shortages, the restrictions have led to hoarding around the world, by farmers, traders and consumers. 
 ''People are in a panic, so they are buying more and more -- at least, those who have money are buying,'' said Conching Vasquez, a 56-year-old rice vendor who sat one recent morning among piles of rice at her large stall in Los Banos, in the Philippines, the world's largest rice importer. Her customers buy 8,000 pounds of rice a day, up from 5,500 pounds a year ago.
 The new restrictions are just an acute symptom of a chronic condition. Since 1980, even as trade in services and in manufactured goods has tripled, adjusting for inflation, trade in food has barely increased. Instead, for decades, food has been a convoluted tangle of restrictive rules, in the form of tariffs, quotas and subsidies. 
 Now, with Australia's farm sector crippled by drought and Argentina suffering a series of strikes and other disruptions, the world is increasingly dependent on a handful of countries like Thailand, Brazil, Canada and the United States that are still exporting large quantities of food.
 On a recent morning here in Bangkok, sweaty and heavily tattooed dock workers took turns grabbing 120-pound sacks of rice from a conveyor belt and carrying them on their heads to cranes that whisked the sacks deep into the hold of a freighter bound for the Philippines. Most of the one million tons of rice that leaves the dock here each year follows the same spine-crushing routine.
 ''I've been here 28 years,'' said the assistant port manager, Suchart Wuthiwaropas. ''This is the busiest ever.'' 
 Powerful lobbies in affluent countries across the northern hemisphere, from Japan to Western Europe to the United States, have long protected farmers in ways factory workers in Detroit could only dream of. 
 The Japanese protect their rice industry by making it nearly impossible for imported rice to compete. The European Union severely limits beef and poultry imports, and Poland goes further, barring soybean imports as well. 
 Negotiators have been working for years to free trade in farm goods, but today's crisis actually makes that more difficult for them. Food protests in places like Haiti and Indonesia that rely heavily on imported food have convinced many nations that it is more important than ever that they grow, and keep, the food their citizens need.
 ''Every country must first ensure its own food security,'' said Kamal Nath, the minister of commerce and industry in India, which has barred exports of vegetable oils and all but the most expensive grades of rice.
 But as the United States trade representative, Susan C. Schwab, noted in a telephone interview, ''One country's act to promote food security is another country's food insecurity.'' 
 International relief groups are trying to help people who can no longer afford food at today's higher prices, but it is not easy. ''We're having trouble buying the stocks we need for emergency operations,'' said Josette Sheeran, executive director of the World Food Program in Rome.
 Restrictions have delayed efforts to ramp up feeding programs in Somalia and Afghanistan. The food program had long purchased grain from Pakistani traders or national stocks. When Pakistan imposed a ban on most wheat exports this spring, the food program was forced to find a new supplier, creating months-long delays.
 ''We had to slow down the scale-up of our operation as a result of having to redesign our supply lines,'' said Ramiro Lopes da Silva, director of transport and procurement. ''That means on the ground there were beneficiaries that went without rations or went without full rations for a portion of time. In the case of Afghanistan, some didn't get into the program.''
 The current dispute over food exports highlights choices that nations have confronted for centuries. 
 One relates directly to trade: Is it best to specialize in whatever food grows best in a country's soil, and trade it for all other food needs -- or even, perhaps, specialize in services or manufacturing, and trade those for food? 
 Or is it best to seek self-sufficiency in every type of food that will, weather permitting, grow within a country's borders?
 The usual answer from economists, and the United States' position for decades, is that the world benefits most if every country specializes in growing (or servicing or making) what it can most efficiently, and trading for the rest.
 Rainfall and other limits make it prohibitively difficult for some countries to grow all their own food. ''If Egypt had to be self-sufficient in food, there would be no water left in the Nile,'' Mr. Lamy said in a telephone interview. 
 ''If every country in the world decided it wanted to produce its own food for consumption,'' Ms. Schwab said, ''there would be less food in the world, and more people would be hungry.''
 But relying on food imports becomes much dicier if other countries are prepared to shut off the tap.
 An obscure rule of the World Trade Organization requires members to notify the agency when they restrict food exports. But there are no penalties for ignoring the rule, and not one of the countries that has imposed restrictions in the past year has complied, according to the W.T.O. 
 Japan and Switzerland are leading a group of food-importing nations so alarmed by restrictions that they are seeking an international agreement preventing countries from unilaterally limiting food exports. The agreement would be part of the current, already-rocky Doha round of trade talks, named for the city in Qatar where negotiations began.
 But the proposal ran into a procedural snag right off: food export restrictions are such a new issue that they are only tangentially mentioned as part of the Doha round agenda, which is not easily modified.
 In some of the nations concerned about shortages now, past policies have discouraged farming. From Indonesia to West Africa to the Caribbean and Central America, poor countries have frequently cut farm assistance programs and lowered tariffs to balance budgets and avoid charging high prices to urban consumers. But they have found that their farmers cannot compete with imports from rich countries -- imports that are heavily subsidized.
 As a result, steps that could have taken place decades ago, resulting in more food for the world today, were abandoned. These included changes like irrigation schemes and new crop varieties.
 ''The subsidies given by developed countries to their farmers have led to lack of investment in agriculture in developing countries'' in Africa and elsewhere, Mr. Nath said.
 To make matters worse, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund frequently pressured poor countries in the 1980s and 1990s to lower tariffs and to cut farm support programs, mostly to reduce budget deficits. 
 Indeed, the World Bank concluded in 2006 that not enough attention had been paid to the negative effects of its policy prescriptions on farmers in developing countries.
 The current export restrictions, which mainly help urban consumers in poor countries, are the latest blow to farmers in the developing world.
 Arfa Tantaway Mohamed, who grows rice on three-quarters of an acre outside the bustling town of Aga in northern Egypt, is frustrated at Egypt's export ban, which is suppressing rice prices.
 ''For sure it has a negative impact,'' said Mr. Mohamed, 50, as he smoked a Cleopatra brand cigarette during a break from working his fields, while 18 members of his extended family labored nearby.
 Some countries reject the notion that restricting exports has pushed up prices on the world market, and point instead to higher prices for fertilizer, diesel and other farm expenses. India takes that position, but so does Thailand, in defending sharp markups in prices set by its Rice Exporters Association.
 ''The main cause of rising rice prices is the rising cost of rice planting,'' said Surapong Suebwonglee, the finance minister of Thailand, the world's largest rice exporter.
 India and other countries, as well as some nonprofit groups, are quick to point out that economic arguments -- that countries specialize in the production of whatever they can make most efficiently -- are unconvincing, as long as rich countries heavily subsidize their farmers. 
 In fact, negotiators have a rough framework for a possible compromise on agriculture in the Doha round talks, including deep cuts in farm subsidies. 
 One possible compromise not being discussed in the Doha round may be for countries to continue relying on trade for most food imports, but hold bigger reserves in case of crises. World rice reserves, for example, have plunged to 9 weeks' worth of consumption, from 19 as recently as 2001.
 But United Nations officials are wary. 
 ''I would not object to building up reserves,'' said Supachai Panitchpakdi, the secretary general of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. ''But like foreign exchange reserves, some countries go to huge extremes.''

HEADLINE: The Digital Doctor Will See You Now

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Our Pen-and-Paper Doctors'' (editorial, June 24), which supports a conversion to electronic medical records:
 Doctors are loath to add sensitive records to a system that uses personal health information against patients. Americans' personal health information is used to deny jobs, promotions, insurance and credit. Millions avoid treatment for cancer and mental illness, putting their lives at risk, because they have no privacy. 
 Electronic health information is a very valuable commodity, and millions of records could be stolen or transferred in a millisecond. 
 The data-mining industry makes millions selling our health information, claims data, prescriptions and genetic information to insurers, employers, researchers, drug companies and data aggregators. 
 Doctors won't buy systems that harm patients. Deborah C. Peel 
 Austin, Tex., June 25, 2008
 The writer, a doctor, is the founder and chairwoman of Patient Privacy Rights.
 To the Editor:
 Who is going to pay for a transition to electronic medical records? With Medicare reimbursements scheduled to be decreased by 10 percent on July 1 and inflation a real concern for all Americans, doctors cannot be expected to lay out tens of thousands of dollars to upgrade records. 
 Unless Congress acts to make Medicare payments to health care providers appropriate for the increasing costs of treating patients and inflationary realities, widespread use of electronic records will be slow to come.
 Eric J. Wolf
 Bronx, June 24, 2008
 The writer is a clinical instructor in ophthalmology at Columbia University and a visiting instructor at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine.
 To the Editor:
 The benefits of electronic patient records would extend beyond the ability to order prescriptions online and better clinical decisions. They would be a great benefit for epidemiological research requiring collection of data about disease incidence and prevalence, safety and efficacy of prescribed drugs after they have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration and surgical procedures. 
 Without such electronic data, epidemiological research is far more time-consuming and expensive. It can take hours to go through paper records searching for cases with a rare disease or a toxic reaction to a prescribed drug, a task that would require just a few keystrokes with electronic records. 
 Malcolm Zaretsky
 Berkeley, Calif., June 24, 2008
 The writer is a researcher in cell and molecular biology at the University of California, Berkeley.
 To the Editor:
 Your editorial says doctors' resistance is a barrier to the adoption of electronic records. Doctors recognize that electronic records are not a magical panacea. Even with the best available software, some aspects of patient care can improve while other errors or problems are introduced.
 Issues of privacy are an additional concern. As we have all learned, the possibility of releasing millions of records is all too real. 
 Our health care system makes electronic health records a technical coating on top of a deeply flawed foundation. Addressing each of these issues, including the cost, in collaboration with doctors is much more likely to increase use of electronic records and achieve our common goal of improving the quality of care for all Americans. Laura Fochtmann
 Arlington, Va., June 24, 2008
 The writer is chairwoman of the American Psychiatric Association committee on electronic health records.
 To the Editor:
 A doctor I see is one of the 4 percent of doctors who make full use of electronic records to assist their practices. It seems obvious to me that having lab results, previous clinical observations and recommendations at her fingertips enhances the care she provides.
 On the other hand, visits to this doctor involve minutes spent while she locates my health records on the computer, and minutes spent as she enters new data, all the while with her gaze and attention fixed on the computer rather than on me. The tap-tap of her fingers indicates that she is too busy to be taking in whatever I have to tell her, and that the electronic task has been elevated over the old-fashioned hands-on approach to clinical care.
 Once records are enshrined in my doctor's computer, they are available for her use and the use of other doctors in her clinic. However, they fail to travel beyond the clinic to the office of my primary care doctor because apparently the task of faxing them over is too onerous in this high-tech age. 
 Getting electronic records to my primary care doctor, who oversees all aspects of my health, requires a more basic effort: a hand-carry by the patient. 
 So much, and so little, progress!
 Joyce Adams
 Portland, Ore., June 24, 2008
 To the Editor:
 The United States health care system definitely needs to cut costs, increase use of electronic health records and improve the quality of patient care, as is happening in other countries. But those countries have something that we lack -- a national health plan. Shouldn't that tell us something? Nisson Schechter

HEADLINE: A Terrible Bust Is Born

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

DATELINE: DUBLIN 

 BODY:
 There's no escape these days, is there? Even in the land of the ''Celtic Tiger,'' whose growth rates were Europe's envy in recent years, a typical headline in The Irish Times runs: ''Enveloping sense of gloom saps consumer sentiment.''
 The recessionary Irish story is familiar, a mirror of developments in the United States, Britain and elsewhere: disappearing credit, plunging house prices, sapped consumer confidence, falling demand, lost jobs, and inflationary stirrings driven by record prices for oil and other commodities. 
 In Britain, Gordon Brown's poll ratings are the lowest for any Prime Minister since World War II, a reflection of the woes of a service-dominated economy. He makes Bush's popularity look enviable -- an achievement. The Irish economy is expected to contract this year after growing 4.5 percent in 2007.
 Bye-bye, tiger. Hello, bear.
 Yes, a bear market is upon us with the Dow Jones Industrial Average now off 19.9 percent from its October record. (A bear market is typically defined as a decline of 20 percent or more.) A terrible bust is born.
 But we had good times, didn't we? Over the past decade, China, India and Russia joined global markets, doubling the labor force (at least) and changing the relationship between capital and labor in the former's favor. Business leaders had many more cheap workers at their disposal, not least because technology eliminated distance. One result was the rich thrived.
 Another was low inflation. Imports of goods produced by cheap labor in Asia ensured that: the Wal-Mart dividend spread.
 But as with most things, there was another side to the coin. Those hundreds of millions of people emerging from poverty, moving to cities from central China or Vietnam's Mekong Delta, began to consume.
 They asked for wage rises. They started to eat two meals a day instead of one. They needed building materials for homes. After acquiring bicycles, they got scooters. Now they're starting to offload scooters for cars.
 These neo-consumers created new pressures, and not only on the environment: commodities went through the roof and oil hit $140.
 A post-cold-war wealth shock became a resources shock. Inflation returned. That's where we are.
 But not everyone is suffering as the Dow dives. That's worth recalling. The new consumers are still living better. I wrote a few weeks back that the world is no longer flat, it's upside-down. In the BRIC economies -- Brazil, Russia, India and China -- confidence persists.
 There's a reason. The four emerging behemoths' combined reserves stand at close to $3 trillion, almost ten times where they were in 2001. Their share of world output has doubled in that period to 16 percent. The military dominance of the United States is no longer matched by economic dominance.
 One way of looking at the current crisis is as an adjustment between the old economic power structures of the world and the emergent ones. It can't be resolved by the ancien regime alone. The G-8 and permanent members of the U.N. Security Council must be expanded to reflect today's realities. 
 One such reality is debt-ridden America's economic vulnerability. Many politicians, including Missouri's Republican governor, Matt Blunt, have been protesting the $46.6 billion bid by a Belgian-Brazilian company for Anheuser-Busch, maker of Budweiser.
 This Bud's for who? How can Bud fall to foreigners?
 I've got a message for panicked U.S. Budists: get used to it. InBev's bid for an American icon, championed by a Brazilian chief executive, won't be the last as the cash-rich of an upside-down world prowl for acquisitions.
 We in the West should be familiar with the predator instinct. I lunched early last year with Walter Eberstadt, a wise old Lazard hand, now retired. ''Years ago, I watched a man flogging a horse, and finally the horse just lay down and died,'' he told me. ''And that horse is our financial system. We're driving it beyond the limit. We're living as if it can produce more energy than it is able to do. Everyone's leveraged to the hilt. Whatever happened to good husbandry?''
 Of course I didn't sell. Bull markets are heady things.
 Those were the days when risk had been re-priced by banks on the basis that it did not exist. Bankers were passing around toxic mortgage securities like Grandma's cookies. They've since learned a $400-billion lesson that globalization doesn't make risk vanish, whether in New York or London or Dublin.
 Rough days lie ahead -- since 1960 the average bear market has taken stocks down 31 percent -- but out of the carnage may emerge a world where the old and new powers, as well as rich and poor, find some more reasonable balance, and American society some of its lost social coherence.
 This city, after all, is one where a great poet wrote of ''All changed, changed utterly.''

HEADLINE: Maybe I'll Get Better on My Own

 BODY:
While politicians have been debating endlessly over the best ways to reform the American health care system, the plight of American patients has rapidly worsened. A new national survey found that an alarming 20 percent of the population, some 59 million people in all, either delayed or did without needed medical care last year, a huge increase from the 36 million people who delayed or did not seek care in 2003. 
 As expected, people who have no health insurance -- there are some 47 million of them -- were most likely to make that difficult choice. But insured people also chose to go without care in ever-larger numbers. 
 According to the survey, the main reason is soaring medical costs, which have outstripped the modest growth in wages in recent years. High costs are deterring not only the uninsured from seeking care, but also many insured people who are struggling with higher deductibles, co-payments and other out-of-pocket expenses as their employers or health plans shift more of the cost burden to them.
 Many patients with insurance said they went without care because their health plans would not pay for the treatment or their doctors or hospitals would not accept their insurance. Both insured and uninsured patients said they skipped treatments because they had trouble getting timely appointments, were unable to get through on the telephone, or could not make it to a doctor's office or clinic when it was open. No doubt a weakening economy, high fuel prices, the home foreclosure crisis and general economic anxiety also played a role. 
 Sadly, previous gains in caring for low-income children have reversed, largely because their parents lost employer-sponsored coverage.
 The telephone survey of some 18,000 Americans was conducted by the Center for the Study of Health System Change, a respected nonpartisan research group, and was financed by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. It relied on respondents' views that they needed the care and did not explore what health consequences resulted. 
 Champions of so-called ''consumer-directed health care'' might argue that the market is working -- people are wisely delaying or forgoing care of low marginal value. But it is disturbing that unmet medical needs increased the most for people in poor or only fair health -- those most likely to get even sicker if they don't get treatment. 
 The new survey further strengthens the case for universal coverage, with moderate cost-sharing provisions. All Americans should be able to get medical care when they need it.

HEADLINE: Solution, or Mess? A Milk Jug for a Green Earth

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

DATELINE: NORTH CANTON, Ohio 

 BODY:
A simple change to the design of the gallon milk jug, adopted by Wal-Mart and Costco, seems made for the times. The jugs are cheaper to ship and better for the environment, the milk is fresher when it arrives in stores, and it costs less.
 What's not to like? Plenty, as it turns out. 
 The jugs have no real spout, and their unorthodox shape makes consumers feel like novices at the simple task of pouring a glass of milk.
 ''I hate it,'' said Lisa DeHoff, a cafe owner shopping in a Sam's Club here. 
 ''It spills everywhere,'' said Amy Wise, a homemaker.
 ''It's very hard for kids to pour,'' said Lee Morris, who was shopping for her grandchildren.
 But retailers are undeterred by the prospect of upended bowls of Cheerios. The new jugs have many advantages from their point of view, and Sam's Club intends to roll them out broadly, making them more prevalent. 
 The redesign of the gallon milk jug, experts say, is an example of the changes likely to play out in the American economy over the next two decades. In an era of soaring global demand and higher costs for energy and materials, virtually every aspect of the economy needs to be re-examined, they say, and many products must be redesigned for greater efficiency.
 ''This is a key strategy as a path forward,'' said Anne Johnson, the director of the Sustainable Packaging Coalition, a project of the nonprofit group GreenBlue. ''Re-examining, 'What are the materials we are using? How are we using them? And where do they go ultimately?' ''
 Wal-Mart Stores is already moving down this path. But if the milk jug is any indication, some of the changes will take getting used to on the part of consumers. Many spill milk when first using the new jugs.
 ''When we brought in the new milk, we were asking for feedback,'' said Heather Mayo, vice president for merchandising at Sam's Club, a division of Wal-Mart. ''And they're saying, 'Why's it in a square jug? Why's it different? I want the same milk. What happened to my old milk?' ''
 Mary Tilton tried to educate the public a few days ago as she stood at a Sam's Club in North Canton, about 50 miles south of Cleveland, luring shoppers with chocolate chip cookies and milk as she showed them how to pour from the new jugs.
 ''Just tilt it slowly and pour slowly,'' Ms. Tilton said to passing customers as she talked about the jugs' environmental benefits and cost savings. Instead of picking up the jug, as most people tend to do, she kept it on a table and gently tipped it toward a cup.
 Mike Compston, who owns a dairy in Yerington, Nev., described the pouring technique in a telephone interview as a ''rock-and-pour instead of a lift-and-tip.''
 Demonstrations are but one of several ways Sam's Club is advocating the containers. Signs in the aisle laud their cost savings and ''better fridge fit.'' 
 And some customers have become converts. 
 ''With the new refrigerators with the shelf in the door, these fit nice,'' said April Buchanan, who was shopping at the Sam's Club here. Others, even those who rue the day their tried-and-true jugs were replaced, praised the lower cost, from $2.18 to $2.58 a gallon. Sam's Club said that was a savings of 10 to 20 cents a gallon compared with old jugs. 
 The new jug marks a sharp break with the way dairies and grocers have traditionally produced and stocked milk.
 Early one recent morning, the creators and producers of the new tall rectangular jugs donned goggles and white coats to walk the noisy, chilly production lines at Superior Dairy in Canton, Ohio. It was founded in 1922 by a man who was forced to abandon the brandy business during Prohibition. Five generations of the founder's family, the Soehnlens, have worked there.
 Today, they bottle and ship two different ways. The old way is inefficient and labor-intensive, according to members of the family. The other day, a worker named Dennis Sickafoose was using a long hook to drag plastic crates loaded with jugs of milk onto a conveyor belt.
 The crates are necessary because the shape of old-fashioned milk jugs prohibits stacking them atop one another. The crates take up a lot of room, they are unwieldy to move, and extra space must be left in delivery trucks to take empty ones back from stores to the dairy.
 They also can be filthy. ''Birds roost on them,'' said Dan Soehnlen, president of Superior Dairy, which spun off a unit called Creative Edge to design and license new packaging of many kinds. He spoke while standing in pools of the soapy run-off from milk crates that had just been washed. About 100,000 gallons of water a day are used at his dairy clean the crates, Mr. Soehnlen said. 
 But with the new jugs, the milk crates are gone. Instead, a machine stacks the jugs, with cardboard sheets between layers. Then the entire pallet, four layers high, is shrink-wrapped and moved with a forklift.
 The company estimates this kind of shipping has cut labor by half and water use by 60 to 70 percent. More gallons fit on a truck and in Sam's Club coolers, and no empty crates need to be picked up, reducing trips to each Sam's Club store to two a week, from five -- a big fuel savings. Also, Sam's Club can now store 224 gallons of milk in its coolers, in the same space that used to hold 80.
 The whole operation is so much more efficient that milk coming out of a cow in the morning winds up at a Sam's Club store by that afternoon, compared with several hours later or the next morning by the old method. ''That's our idea of fresh milk,'' Greg Soehnlen, a vice president at Creative Edge, said.
 Sam's Club started using the boxy jugs in November, and they are now in 189 stores scattered around the country. They will appear soon in more Sam's Club stores and perhaps in Wal-Marts.
 The question now is whether customers will go along.
 As Ms. Tilton gave her in-store demonstration the other day at the Sam's Club here, customers stood around her, munching cookies and sipping milk. ''Would you like to take some home today?'' she asked.
 A shopper named Jodi Kauffman gave the alien jugs a sidelong glance.
 ''Maybe,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg's Next Battle: Revamping Senior Centers

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
After clashes with entrenched interest groups over education, firehouse closings and other knotty issues, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is seeking to bring his business-minded, results-based approach to an especially challenging constituency: the elderly.
 Mr. Bloomberg has indicated that he sees the city's sprawling array of 329 often homespun senior centers as inefficient and outdated. 
 So for the first time, senior centers, which are typically tucked into churches or housing projects and locally run, must submit plans for more health, education and culture programs to bolster dwindling attendance. The centers will also be evaluated -- and potentially penalized by having funds taken away -- based on performance measures.
 At the same time, to streamline operations, the mayor is reducing the number of centers that provide case managers, the workers who guide the elderly through everyday tasks that can range from making medical appointments to filling out tax forms. 
 The overhaul is vital, city officials say, to keep pace with a projected 46 percent surge over the next 25 years in the number of people over 60 years old, the city's fastest-growing group. 
 Among the more controversial changes is Mr. Bloomberg's aim to contract with high-volume food vendors, including some from out of state, to replace local kitchen staffs that prepare meals, whether they be kosher in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, or vegetarian at the United Hindu senior center in Jamaica, Queens. The new vendors would also provide more frozen meals, which are less costly and would require less frequent deliveries than the hot meals that come five days a week. 
 For many people, however, those hot meals are something of an inalienable right. 
 The plans are creating anxiety and a kind of culture clash in the neighborhoods, where elderly people treasure the intimacy of the centers and often enjoy meals and activities that reflect the ethnic makeup of the residents.
 ''Picture yourself as an 80-year-old person, and English isn't your native language, and you want to eat the food you're used to,'' said Bobbie Sackman, director of public policy for the Council of Senior Centers and Services, which represents 200 agencies. ''If you take away an anchor from the neighborhood, you're dismantling the world of those seniors.''
 To these critics, Mr. Bloomberg's plan is a clunky one-size-fits-all mathematical exercise that favors numbers over people, standardization over local quirks. And it reinforces a view, they said, of Mr. Bloomberg as an out-of-touch billionaire who does not fully grasp that the current community-based system is exactly what makes New York so, well, New York.
 ''The whole thing is driven by money, and people are seen as widgets or pencils or whatever,'' said Carol J. Hunt, executive director of the Jamaica Service Program for Older Adults, which has served southeast Queens for 35 years. ''They say they're not going to close senior centers. But they'll force us to do it because we won't be able to sustain our services.''
 Still, even some detractors concede that the Bloomberg administration deserves credit for thinking about the future. Though senior centers receive some federal money, the bulk of their financing is from the city. 
 Other groups that assist the elderly have adopted a less adversarial stance to the changes, hoping to influence how the roughly $150 million in the city's budget will be applied. Getting it right is crucial, they say, because of rough economic times, as exemplified by the cuts to senior programs in the budget for the fiscal year that begins Tuesday.
 ''We think the modernization of the senior services in the city is an important objective, and the seniors today are not the seniors of 40 years ago,'' said Ronald Soloway, managing director of government and external relations for UJA-Federation of New York. ''The modernization is going on in a difficult fiscal environment, but the mayor is doing what the experts in the field say is necessary to meet the aging population's needs.''
 The plan would also move New York closer to what many other cities have already been doing for many years.
 In Chicago, roughly 8 out of 9 people classified as homebound seniors have frozen meals delivered, said Joyce Gallagher, the city's senior services commissioner. And Philadelphia relies on only three vendors to prepare meals and a fourth to deliver them to 5,600 people -- roughly the number served in Queens.
 By contrast, New York's Meals on Wheels program now has contracts with 96 vendors to feed 17,000 homebound people.
 ''When people think about New York, they think about the bigness of it all,'' said Toni Clemmons, director of program management for the Philadelphia Corporation for the Aging, a private nonprofit group active in the meal-delivery process. ''I think they're looking to make the system more efficient, and that's always a good thing.''
 As with most Bloomberg initiatives, the plan is driven largely by data.
 With the population over the age of 60 projected to reach 1.84 million in 2030, the plan is a crucial component of the city's All Ages Project, aimed at making the city more livable, in terms of transportation, health care and other matters, for the elderly. Yet, with some 30,000 New Yorkers visiting the city's senior centers daily, 44 percent of the centers are underutilized, according to Edwin Mendez-Santiago, the commissioner for the Department for the Aging.
 ''We need an infrastructure in the city that's capable of meeting the incredible need,'' said Linda I. Gibbs, the city's deputy mayor for health and human services. ''It would be a disaster if we don't think and act and plan now.''
 By Tuesday the city is scheduled to finish reducing by almost 30 percent the number of senior centers that employ case managers. It has not been easy.
 In Brooklyn, case-management contracts are being given to seven centers, down from 12. And one center that lost its contract, Prospect Hill Senior Services Center in Park Slope, was forced to shed 10 of 21 employees. So for people like Frances Ferrara, 78, that means that the woman who used to help her fill out her tax forms and home-heating paperwork is now at another location in Brooklyn Heights.
 ''We were friends, so I don't know what's going to happen,'' said Ms. Ferrara, a retired secretary, during a recent lunch at the center. ''I can't believe no one's here anymore. Empty.''
 In August, the city is expected to reduce the number of meal-delivery contracts by 80 percent. To improve efficiency, the city wants to increase the number of vendors capable of delivering more than 100,000 meals a year -- a status held by only six vendors last year.
 Another goal is to increase participation. Last year, the city's senior centers delivered 8.2 million meals, down from 9.1 million in 1998. And thanks to improvements in food technology, city officials are confident that many people will eventually prefer frozen meals -- something that a pilot program in the Bronx has already demonstrated.
 ''I want mine frozen because sometimes I have to save it for later, or I don't finish it,'' said Leroy Kelley, 88, of the Bronx. ''It's a lifesaver. I love it.''
 But some advocates worry whether big vendors will be sensitive to local dietary, cultural, religious and ethnic considerations.
 In October, the city will start asking senior centers to submit plans to reinvent themselves as wellness centers to attract more, and younger, people. The city plans to measure each center's success by benchmarks like attendance and the number of flu shots and blood tests given.
 ''The senior centerswere set up as feeding programs,'' Ms. Gibbs said. ''Over the last 40 years, nobody has really asked them to do anything differently. We want them to be relevant, we want them to be future-minded, and we want them to be places that actually draw members of the community in.''

HEADLINE: Israel's Diplomatic Offensive

 BODY:
Few countries can afford the luxury of limiting their diplomacy to friendly countries and peace-loving parties. National security often requires negotiating with dangerous enemies. Fortunately, Israel's prime minister, Ehud Olmert, is now displaying a clearer grasp of such realities than President Bush has mustered. 
 Israel is increasingly willing to explore conversations with states and groups Washington would prefer to ignore and isolate. In recent weeks it has agreed to a limited, Egyptian-brokered cease-fire with the Hamas authorities in Gaza and is engaged in indirect peace talks with Syria, sponsored by Turkey. It is attempting to start similar discussions with the Lebanese government, despite -- or more likely because of -- Hezbollah's growing political influence. 
 There are clear risks. Hamas may not respect or enforce the cease-fire; there have been almost daily violations. Syria may be as unbudging as it has been in past negotiations. Hezbollah may block talks with Lebanon or use them to buy time to build up its armaments and political leverage. Mr. Olmert, politically weak and legally besieged, may not have the staying power to see any of these initiatives through. 
 Israel is still right to try. With its security and even survival at stake, it would have been irresponsible to continue to let Washington's ideological blinders constrain Israeli diplomacy. 
 To its credit, the administration has given belated support to Israel's diplomatic initiatives.
 This new burst of diplomatic activity has revived a long-running Mideast policy debate. Does real progress toward peace require constant American nudging and nurturing? Or do the parties only move ahead when their own sense of self-interest propels them? 
 It is a question with no one simple answer. True, it was Anwar el-Sadat's surprise 1977 visit to Jerusalem that led to the breakthrough peace treaty between Egypt and Israel two years later. And it was secret talks in Oslo that truly began the historic, if failed, Israeli-Palestinian peace process of the 1990s. In neither case was America trying to discourage negotiations. And in both, subsequent progress depended heavily on very active United States involvement. 
 Even when there is a strong mutual desire for peace, the history of distrust and the weakness of political leaders can be overcome only with the kind of outside help the United States can uniquely offer. Syria might be much more willing to make peace with Israel -- and cut its ties to Iran -- if it were offered the same kind of step-by-step diplomatic and economic rehabilitation that Washington has recently used to induce more constructive behavior from Libya and North Korea. 
 Israel's latest diplomatic initiatives come despite, not because of, seven years of malign Mideast neglect by the Bush administration. If any long-term good is to come of them, the next American administration will need to be truly committed to diplomacy -- and a lot more adept at it.

HEADLINE: China to Resume Talks With Dalai Lama

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH

DATELINE: SHANGHAI 

 BODY:
China said Sunday that it would soon resume talks with representatives of the Dalai Lama, weeks before the start of the Olympic Games.
 According to the state-run news agency, Xinhua, the agreement to resume the talks in early July follows a request from the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader. 
 ''Our door is always open for the dialogue with the Dalai Lama,'' the agency quoted a government spokesman as saying. The government said it hoped ''that the Dalai Lama would treasure this opportunity and give positive response to the requirements of the central authorities,'' Xinhua said.
 Thupten Samphal, a spokesman for the Dalai Lama's government in exile in Dharmsala, India, confirmed that talks would be held ''soon'' and that officials of the government in exile would meet Monday to discuss logistics, The Associated Press reported.
 Talks had been scheduled between the sides in early June but were called off after the earthquake that struck Sichuan Province on May 12. Dates for the new talks have not been disclosed.
 The rescheduling of the talks was announced during a visit to China by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. The United States and many other countries have urged China to resume discussions with the Dalai Lama.
 In March, protests and riots spread across Tibet and to neighboring provinces after monks who marched to seek the return of the Dalai Lama were arrested in Lhasa, Tibet's capital.
 China's government responded with a crackdown in which an undetermined number of people were killed. The government closed the province to foreigners, including independent observers. Last week, the government announced that foreign tourism had resumed. 
 Chinese officials also seem eager to present a picture of normality to the outside world as the Aug. 8 start of the Olympics nears. After the crackdown, several foreign leaders said they would not attend the Games unless there was a substantial improvement in the Tibet situation.
 China has faced opposition to its rule over Tibet since the Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959, after a failed uprising by Tibetans.
 International human rights groups say China has tightly restricted religious freedoms and enacted other policies that threaten Tibet's indigenous culture. Many Tibetans say China's economic plans for the province are based on increased migration to Tibet by Han Chinese, the country's ethnic majority.
 Beijing accuses the Dalai Lama of supporting secession by Tibet. Chinese officials have also accused the Dalai Lama of masterminding the March uprising, a charge he denies.

HEADLINE: Meet the New 'Press,' Without the Pinned-Down, Wriggling Interviewees

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
There was no distant replay on Sunday's ''Meet the Press.''
 Tom Brokaw, the temporary host, did not try to duplicate Tim Russert's trademark custom of digging up old videotape to catch politicians flip-flopping and contradicting themselves. 
 Mr. Brokaw, the former ''Nightly News'' anchor who will host the program until NBC finds a more permanent replacement for Mr. Russert, made a point of breaking with the past; the first segments were not even taped in Mr. Russert's studio in Washington but at a meeting of the Western Governors' Association in Wyoming. The majestic snow-capped Jackson Hole setting didn't provide for a very exciting political debate, but the changes did suggest just how difficult it will be for NBC to revamp a Sunday news program that was so shaped by the personality and passions of its longtime host. 
 This was only the third ''Meet the Press'' since Mr. Russert died this month, and in a way it was really the first. The Sunday after he died Mr. Brokaw anchored a special memorial edition of ''Meet the Press.'' And last week's show, which opened with the usual booming voice-over introduction (''This is 'Meet the Press' with Tim Russert. Sitting in today: Brian Williams''), was unfinished business served up as homage. Mr. Williams interviewed the two guests whose appearances had been pre-empted by Mr. Russert's death -- Senator Joseph R. Biden, Democrat of Delaware, and Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina -- and he stuck to Mr. Russert's original script. It included archival material of Mr. Graham, who now supports offshore oil drilling, back when he didn't. (The current price of oil changed his mind, he said.)
 Mr. Brokaw proved himself a seemly caretaker. The emeritus anchor didn't try to imitate or compete with Mr. Russert, and he kept the mood at a sober but easygoing tempo. Had NBC immediately tapped some of its more junior stars, like David Gregory, Lester Holt or Andrea Mitchell, to fill in so soon, they might have looked like ambitious careerists auditioning to take over while the chair was still warm. 
 But in the middle of one of the fiercest and most exciting presidential races in years this ''Meet the Press'' had a little too much comity. Mr. Brokaw, who was a guest speaker at the governors' conference and has a ranch in nearby Montana, invited as his guests two Democrats, Gov. Bill Ritter Jr. of Colorado and Gov. Dave Freudenthal of Wyoming, who, not surprisingly, agreed with each other on the economy, energy policy and the war and at times finished each other's sentences, a little like the medley-singing Sweeney Sisters in the old ''Saturday Night Live'' skit. 
 Mr. Brokaw asked them whether they would accept nuclear power plants in their states as an alternative energy source for oil. The governors allowed that nuclear power would be a necessary component in a national energy policy but adroitly sidestepped answering whether they would allow nuclear plants in their own backyards.
 Mr. Brokaw also spoke to Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California in a segment he taped there earlier. Despite his state's rocky economy and huge deficit, Mr. Schwarzenegger, a Republican, also managed to glide through questioning without saying anything provocative, or even that interesting. He opposes ending the federal ban on offshore oil drilling, which puts him at odds with Senator John McCain, his party's candidate for president.
 When Mr. Brokaw asked about the inconsistency, Mr. Schwarzenegger, whose wife, Maria Shriver, is an Obama supporter, gave an unassailable reply. ''That we don't agree on everything, that's clear,'' he said. ''Nor do I with my wife. I mean, it doesn't mean that we should split.''
 Mr. Brokaw did spar gently with his last guest: Chuck Todd, NBC's political director, who this year has emerged as MSNBC's most understated star, a master of exit polls, electoral maps and delegate counts. When Mr. Todd asserted quite categorically that Senator Barack Obama would not win Montana and North Dakota, Mr. Brokaw, a native of South Dakota and a veteran of the 2000 election-night fiascos, reprimanded his younger colleague. 
 ''Now be careful about what you say at this stage about what he's going to win,'' Mr. Brokaw said. It was a fair point, except that seconds before, Mr. Brokaw had asserted that Senator McCain had Idaho in the bag.
 It's hard to know whether NBC has bigger plans for Mr. Todd, who, like Mr. Russert in his early days as Washington bureau chief, is a political savant first, on-air personality second. But no single journalist in NBC's large pool of talent seems ideally suited to replace Mr. Russert. If that is impossible, then it makes sense to recast the job and return to the early days when guests really did meet the press, answering to a panel of inquisitors who together did what Mr. Russert did alone.

HEADLINE: Obama Is Betting Democrats Can Rise Again in the South

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
As they look to the fall election, Democrats face a strategic decision that has bedeviled their party for 40 years: How hard should they fight in the South?
 And how does having Senator Barack Obama at the top of the ticket affect that calculation? 
 Officials in Mr. Obama's campaign say they are bullish on the South, and they have signaled their aggressiveness with early campaign appearances in North Carolina and Virginia, major voter registration drives in the region, and television advertising in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia.
 Steve Hildebrand, the deputy campaign manager for Mr. Obama, said he saw ''tremendous potential'' in several Southern states. 
 ''If you go in and look at the number of unregistered voters in demographic groups that are important to Barack's candidacy -- younger voters, African-American voters -- the potential is just incredible,'' Mr. Hildebrand said. 
 And yet since the South began to shift away from the Democrats in the 1960s, it has become one of the biggest and reddest of the Republican strongholds. In the last two presidential elections, the Democrats failed to carry any of the Southern states. Although recent Democratic nominees have typically gotten about 9 out of 10 of the votes of Southern blacks, they still need a substantial chunk of the white vote to prevail. Political scientists put that figure at close to 40 percent, though it depends on the state, and the Democrats have rarely gotten it.
 Even after selecting a Southerner, John Edwards of North Carolina, as his running mate in 2004, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts drew 29 percent of the white vote in the region (17 percent in the Deep South). In 2000, Al Gore got 31 percent, even losing his home state, Tennessee. 
 The only times since 1972 that the Democrats have carried more than a third of the Southern white vote, according to exit polls, were when Jimmy Carter or Bill Clinton, both Southerners, were atop the ticket. In 1996, for example, Mr. Clinton got the votes of 36 percent of Southern whites and 87 percent of Southern blacks, and carried 5 of the 13 Southern states.
 Mr. Obama's Southern strategy relies on significantly increasing black registration and turnout, as he did in the primary season. Mr. Hildebrand said that by some estimates there are 600,000 unregistered black voters in Georgia alone. The higher the black share of the vote, the lower the requirement for garnering white votes. But the Obama camp argues that it can increase its share of the white vote as well by focusing on younger, more progressive whites.
 Democratic candidates have typically written off many Southern states early in the process. But when Democrats give up the South, they need to win 70 percent of the rest of the electoral votes, said Merle Black, an expert on Southern politics at Emory University. And they often subject candidates running for lower offices in the region to fierce political headwinds: it is hard for a statewide candidate to prevail when his party's presidential nominee loses by double digits.
 ''We've not only lost in Mississippi, we've lost by 20 points in Mississippi,'' said Ray Mabus, the former governor of Mississippi and a senior adviser to Mr. Obama.
 Mr. Mabus added: ''It's not only Democrats who've been writing off Mississippi. It's Republicans, too, because they felt safe.''
 The Obama campaign's interest in the South, Mr. Mabus said, is already heightening the competition there. He noted that Senator John McCain had been to Mississippi since clinching the Republican nomination. ''I don't think he would have come if he thought it was a mortal lock,'' Mr. Mabus said.
 Southern Democrats have often felt left out of their party's presidential calculations. From Reconstruction to the 1960s, the South was essentially a one-party region: Democratic. But voters' allegiance was rocked in the 1960s by the Democrats' leadership in passing civil rights legislation, and whites began to move to what Republicans asserted was their more natural ideological home. 
 This was exacerbated, many Southern Democrats believe, by the national party's habit of nominating Northern liberals who campaigned little in the region. But the Democrats who ran those campaigns said they had to devote their resources to the states where polls showed they had the best chance of prevailing.
 ''We started out with a pretty broad playing field, with the intention of putting more states in play than had been put into play before,'' said Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster who worked for Mr. Kerry in 2004, noting that the Kerry campaign competed early on in Virginia. 
 ''At a certain point, we needed to make a decision on whether to continue to compete in states that weren't likely to pay off and drain money from states that could,'' Mr. Mellman said. 
 But this time, the resources argument would be less compelling because Mr. Obama is expected to have a sizable financial edge over his rival, given his decision to forgo public campaign money and the spending limits that accompany it. And, some Democrats who work in the South argue, writing off a region is simply the wrong thing to do. 
 ''How do you tell 102 million people who live in the South that they don't matter?'' said Steve Jarding, a Democratic consultant who has worked on several Southern campaigns. This year, he added, the region should be open to a Democratic argument on economics.
 But some contend that the building blocks of a Democratic electoral majority lie elsewhere, notably the Southwest. That argument was laid out in 2006 in ''Whistling Past Dixie: How Democrats Can Win Without the South,'' by Thomas F. Schaller, a political scientist at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.
 ''The notion that the Democrats have to win in the South is just a fiction,'' Dr. Schaller said.
 Some Democrats say the Obama registration drive could have unintended consequences, spurring a higher turnout among whites planning to vote Republican. But Charles Bullock, a political scientist at the University of Georgia, said he considered that unlikely.
 ''Older whites who are most likely to have traditional racial attitudes are probably already registered and may have records of consistent participation,'' Dr. Bullock said.
 As Mr. Mabus put it, ''I'm sure some won't vote for him because he's African-American, but I'm pretty sure those people wouldn't vote for any Democrat.''
 Mr. Obama's race aside, his ideology is a significant hurdle in the South, if history is any guide. Mr. Clinton broke the Republicans' hold in 1992 in part by running as a decidedly centrist Democrat -- pro-death penalty, pro-welfare reform, for the ''forgotten middle class.'' He was also helped by Ross Perot's third-party candidacy, which drained votes from the Republicans.
 In the Republican camp, strategists say that for all the difficulties the party is facing, the South remains deeply conservative. 
 ''It would take an awful big shift in the electorate this year,'' said Mike DuHaime, a senior adviser to the McCain campaign. ''It's not like we're talking about states that were won by one or two points last time. These Southern states, with the exception of Virginia and Florida, were double-digit wins.''
 Mr. DuHaime acknowledged that Virginia, whose northern suburbs have become more Democratic in recent years, would be competitive this year. But he maintained that Mr. McCain, more than many Republicans, should have substantial appeal to moderate and independent voters.
 Gordon Giffin, a Democratic activist in the South and an ambassador to Canada in the Clinton administration, said the economy and the Iraq war had created ''more available white voters in the South this time than we've had in recent memory.'' Southern Democrats always argue for more attention from the national party, and Mr. Giffin acknowledged, ''Sometimes we know we're full of hot air.''
 He added, ''This time it's different.''

HEADLINE: The Obama Agenda

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
It's feeling a lot like 1992 right now. It's also feeling a lot like 1980. But which parallel is closer? Is Barack Obama going to be a Ronald Reagan of the left, a president who fundamentally changes the country's direction? Or will he be just another Bill Clinton?
 Current polls -- not horse-race polls, which are notoriously uninformative until later in the campaign, but polls gauging the public mood -- are strikingly similar to those in both 1980 and 1992, years in which an overwhelming majority of Americans were dissatisfied with the country's direction. 
 So the odds are that this will be a ''change'' election -- which means that it's very much Mr. Obama's election to lose. But if he wins, how much change will he actually deliver?
 Reagan, for better or worse -- I'd say for worse, but that's another discussion -- brought a lot of change. He ran as an unabashed conservative, with a clear ideological agenda. And he had enormous success in getting that agenda implemented. He had his failures, most notably on Social Security, which he tried to dismantle but ended up strengthening. But America at the end of the Reagan years was not the same country it was when he took office.
 Bill Clinton also ran as a candidate of change, but it was much less clear what kind of change he was offering. He portrayed himself as someone who transcended the traditional liberal-conservative divide, proposing ''a government that offers more empowerment and less entitlement.'' The economic plan he announced during the campaign was something of a hodgepodge: higher taxes on the rich, lower taxes for the middle class, public investment in things like high-speed rail, health care reform without specifics. 
 We all know what happened next. The Clinton administration achieved a number of significant successes, from the revitalization of veterans' health care and federal emergency management to the expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit and health insurance for children. But the big picture is summed up by the title of a new book by the historian Sean Wilentz: ''The Age of Reagan: A history, 1974-2008.''
 So whom does Mr. Obama resemble more? At this point, he's definitely looking Clintonesque.
 Like Mr. Clinton, Mr. Obama portrays himself as transcending traditional divides. Near the end of last week's ''unity'' event with Hillary Clinton, he declared that ''the choice in this election is not between left or right, it's not between liberal or conservative, it's between the past and the future.'' Oh-kay.
 Mr. Obama's economic plan also looks remarkably like the Clinton 1992 plan: a mixture of higher taxes on the rich, tax breaks for the middle class and public investment (this time with a focus on alternative energy).
 Sometimes the Clinton-Obama echoes are almost scary. During his speech accepting the nomination, Mr. Clinton led the audience in a chant of ''We can do it!'' Remind you of anything?
 Just to be clear, we could -- and still might -- do a lot worse than a rerun of the Clinton years. But Mr. Obama's most fervent supporters expect much more. 
 Progressive activists, in particular, overwhelmingly supported Mr. Obama during the Democratic primary even though his policy positions, particularly on health care, were often to the right of his rivals'. In effect, they convinced themselves that he was a transformational figure behind a centrist facade.
 They may have had it backward.
 Mr. Obama looks even more centrist now than he did before wrapping up the nomination. Most notably, he has outraged many progressives by supporting a wiretapping bill that, among other things, grants immunity to telecom companies for any illegal acts they may have undertaken at the Bush administration's behest. 
 The candidate's defenders argue that he's just being pragmatic -- that he needs to do whatever it takes to win, and win big, so that he has the power to effect major change. But critics argue that by engaging in the same ''triangulation and poll-driven politics'' he denounced during the primary, Mr. Obama actually hurts his election prospects, because voters prefer candidates who take firm stands. 
 In any case, what about after the election? The Reagan-Clinton comparison suggests that a candidate who runs on a clear agenda is more likely to achieve fundamental change than a candidate who runs on the promise of change but isn't too clear about what that change would involve.
 Of course, there's always the possibility that Mr. Obama really is a centrist, after all.
 One thing is clear: for Democrats, winning this election should be the easy part. Everything is going their way: sky-high gas prices, a weak economy and a deeply unpopular president. The real question is whether they will take advantage of this once-in-a-generation chance to change the country's direction. And that's mainly up to Mr. Obama.

HEADLINE: Traveling Overseas To Win Votes at Home

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
Colombia hardly constitutes a general election battleground. Neither does France nor Jordan. But Senators John McCain and Barack Obama are heading to those countries and others because votes can be won there.
 The votes are the reward that Americans confer for gravitas -- the stature and experience that reassures them their would-be president can safeguard them from unforeseen events. What helps the candidates in this effort are the images of them consulting with foreign leaders and giving speeches on the international stage, as well as the knowledge they glean during these travels.
 Mr. Obama, of Illinois, needs to offer that reassurance to voters to capitalize on the exceptionally favorable tailwinds behind Democratic candidates in 2008. Mr. McCain, of Arizona, needs to preserve advantages accrued from his demonstrated grit as a war prisoner and years of experience on national security issues. 
 The stakes appear highest for Mr. McCain, who otherwise has few political advantages. '' 'I've been tested,' '' noted Ed Rollins, a veteran Republican strategist, ''is the only issue he has.''
 Shifts on Experience
 The value of experience in presidential campaigns shifts with the political winds. In the 25 elections over the past century, the older candidate has won roughly two-thirds of the time. 
 In 9 of those 17 victories, the older candidate was the incumbent. President Ronald Reagan disarmed skeptics about his age in 1984 with a joking pledge during a debate not to ''exploit for political purposes my opponent's youth and inexperience,'' a reference to his opponent, Walter F. Mondale.
 But at key moments of national unease, voters have shunned the familiar figure in the White House to embrace a lesser-known candidate who offers change. That dynamic elected Jimmy Carter over President Gerald R. Ford in 1976, Mr. Reagan over President Carter four years later and Bill Clinton over President George Bush in 1992.
 In all of those cases, the challengers could at least point to the executive experience they had gained from their service as governors. 
 What makes the 2008 contest so unusual is that the major party rivals do not have experience in the Oval Office or as governor. Both are legislators; Mr. McCain has served nearly three decades on Capitol Hill, and Mr. Obama for 12 years in the Illinois Senate and the United States Senate.
 Political opponents sometimes dismiss the importance of Mr. Obama's tenure in the Illinois capital, Springfield, but Mr. McCain may not gain much from that contrast given the prevailing public disdain for Washington.
 ''Can we be so sure that the skill set picked up over eight years in a state Capitol is inferior as presidential preparation to two decades in the pompous, cordoned-off environment of the U.S. Senate?'' Alan Ehrenhalt, executive editor of Governing magazine, asked recently in Newsweek. ''I seriously doubt it.''
 The clearest difference Mr. McCain can point to is his military service, and opinion surveys suggest that it, along with his familiarity and national security expertise, gives Americans confidence that he is prepared for the presidency.
 Concerning Mr. Obama, ''The question mark for voters is on competency,'' the pollsters Peter Hart and Neil Newhouse concluded after conducting a NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey this month. ''John McCain's greatest strength is that voters can perceive him behind the desk in the Oval Office. He has cleared the competency bar.''
 Credibility in Travel
 Mr. McCain aims to reinforce that edge with his trip this week to Colombia and Mexico. Mr. Obama hopes to narrow that advantage with his coming travel to Britain, France, Germany, Israel and Jordan. (Details of his plans to visit Afghanistan and Iraq have not been disclosed, for security reasons.)
 Some Democrats argue that he needn't do much, since the value of Mr. McCain's experience remains limited at a time voters are so unhappy. ''It's a card they can play, but it can be trumped by the 'change' card,'' said James Carville, the Democratic strategist behind Mr. Clinton's victory in 1992.
 The biggest potential pitfall for Mr. Obama is an obvious mistake in imagery or rhetoric. Mr. McCain, 71, faced unflattering coverage when he mischaracterized Iran as supporting Sunni Muslim insurgents in Iraq. The 46-year-old Mr. Obama would likely pay a higher and more enduring price for a comparable flub.
 ''He's young-looking,'' said Mr. Rollins, who piloted Mr. Reagan's victory over Mr. Mondale. If Republicans can ''create enough doubt in the minds of voters in a time of war and economic crisis, then it may work,'' he added. ''But it's not an easy sell.''
