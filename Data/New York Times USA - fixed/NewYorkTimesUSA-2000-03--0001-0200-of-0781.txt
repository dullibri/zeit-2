HEADLINE: LIFE'S WORK;
How Priceless Time Flies

BYLINE: By LISA BELKIN; This column about the intersection of jobs and personal lives appears every other week. Lisa Belkin's e-mail address is Belkin@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
TIME, according to commercials from at least one credit card company, is priceless. What costs is the stuff we fill it with. Airlines, on the other hand, can tell us the exact price of our time. Or, more specifically, the price of a Saturday night.
Not long ago, my work required a five-night trip to Seattle; I would arrive late Monday and take the red-eye home on Friday so I could spend Saturday with Bruce and our boys. The friendly ticket agent explained that since I had called too late (by 12 hours) to qualify for a seven-day advance purchase, the fare would be $1,898. I, in turn, explained that I wanted to buy a seat, not the entire plane. Sounding a touch less friendly, she clicked her keyboard for a while, then asked if I might consider staying over until Sunday morning. That fare would be $366. 
 Thankfully, it was not my money I was spending, it was my employer's, and though I do not waste anyone's money easily, at least I had the option of booking the high-priced ticket. But because big businesses are able to pay, small businesses are in turn forced to pay, and the smallest business people have no choice but to give up their Saturday nights. One friend, who is completing a book, schedules all his out-of-town interviews on weekends, constantly weighing the savings in air fare against the days lost with his family. The paradox, he says, is that flying out on a Thursday and home on a Monday costs hundreds of dollars less than flying out on a Monday and back on a Thursday -- even though he is still taking up a (cramped) seat on Thursday and Monday.
Business travel is hardly the only facet of life where time can be traded for money. But most of the others make sense. Pay a few dollars more to an overnight delivery service and the package actually arrives first thing the next morning. Pay $1,532 more to an airline, and you don't get there any faster, nor is there any decrease in the level of abuse.
In the last few weeks, many airlines have announced that they will start giving "full economy" passengers a whopping three to seven more inches of legroom, and I will believe that when I see it. But even in the bigger seats, I'll bet that lunch will still be served (squashed) in a paper bag, headphones will still cost extra, and though you will get frequent-flier miles for your loyalty and your trouble, you won't get any more than the guy next to you, whose flight you are subsidizing. And just wait until it's time to redeem those miles. In early December, I tried to book our summer vacation. I was told the frequent-flier allotment of seats was already sold out on every flight to Shannon, Ireland, for the last two weeks in July.
True, if you pay a full coach fare or have enough of those hard-earned miles, there are ways of finagling your way into first class; but lately those upgrades are as hard to come by as my reward tickets to Ireland.
And true, if you have earned enough miles, the rules say you may board the plane early, meaning you might find a place for your overhead luggage; but this, too, is more theory than not. "We are pleased to preboard our Elite Card holders," the flight attendant says, and everyone in the waiting area stands up. In front of me on the "preboard" line recently was a man whose Oxford insurance card was more or less the same color as the airline's membership card. He flashed it and ambled on.
You do get two things, however, for the extra money you pay for a full coach fare. First, the fare is fully refundable. In other words, for $1,532 more, they generously allow you to cancel the flight. In the case of my Seattle trip, this was no small benefit because the person I was supposed to interview there backed out at the last minute and I had to scramble to reschedule.
The second perk is even more important. I learned about it on a January flight to San Francisco when head winds meant the plane had to take on extra fuel and the airline had to bump 30 passengers to allow for the added weight. All around me, people were outraged. "For $700, you'd think they'd treat you better." Or, "They bumped us because we're flying on a $539 fare." I had paid $1,600 for my ticket, and when I checked in, the agent did not even mention the weight restrictions. She certainly never mentioned the idea of giving up my seat.
Pay them enough money and you are actually permitted to board the plane. Now that's priceless.

HEADLINE: MANAGEMENT;
Help for the Manager's Spouse Who Slurps Soup

BYLINE: By SANA SIWOLOP 

 BODY:
The corporate executive was seeking help from Charles Sacarello, a Manhattan consultant who specializes in brushing up the images of the upwardly mobile.
The executive had a problem that threatened to derail his career: his socially inept wife. 
 Only a few months earlier, the client had been on the fast track. As a candidate for a seat on his company's board, he had been invited with his wife for dinner and drinks at the home of another senior executive. The top brass were all there.
The result was a disaster. First, his wife told some off-color jokes. Then, embarrassed by the icy response, she gulped down several drinks. The evening ended when she fell, fully dressed, into the host's swimming pool.
Not long after that, the board position fell through and the executive was told that he had gone as far in the company as he ever would. He found a new job, and now he wanted his wife to be coached on how to act like a business partner. "It became obvious to both of them that they were on display," said Mr. Sacarello, who is 45. Happily, he added, "the marriage survived."
Executives' wives -- and husbands -- are on Mr. Sacarello's mind a lot these days. Most corporate managers are used to taking courses and reading books on how to get ahead. But the advice they get usually centers on exploiting their own skills and resourcefulness.
Mr. Sacarello, though, sees a huge need for managers to pay more attention to their spouses' appearance and behavior. In his 15 years as an image consultant, he has encountered too many career stoppers, from husbands or wives with abysmal table manners to those who show up for social weekends with five suitcases.
His firm, Charles & Associates, recently rolled out a program to polish corporate spouses' public persona by teaching them everything from Continental table manners and how much jewelry to wear ("Don't look like a Christmas tree," he advises) to finding the right phrase to break the ice in awkward moments.
Other image consultants say he is on to something. They point to the growing diversity in executive suites. More women are breaking through the glass ceiling, for example, meaning that husbands as well as wives need help. And more power couples with modest economic backgrounds are sailing up the corporate ladder together, meaning that sometimes both spouses could use a little enhancement of their social graces.
Moreover, the consultants say, with the line between work and home increasingly blurring, more corporate mates are getting caught in the limelight than ever.
Scott Scanlon, an executive search consultant in Stamford, Conn., said he had noticed that spouses now receive more attention than in the past during the recruitment process. And Debra Lund, a spokeswoman for the Franklin Covey Company, a professional services firm in Salt Lake City, says that more of the companies that hire her firm to give training seminars are extending them to spouses and other family members.
"Companies are recognizing that they have more stakeholders than the people who work immediately within the walls of their companies," Ms. Lund said.
When it comes to rehabilitating wayward spouses, however, some image consultants think companies should do more.
"I think there is an undisclosed need for this type of help that hasn't been tapped, with both companies and senior managers reluctant to talk about it," said Don Kaufman, who runs an image-consulting firm in Philadelphia with his wife, Karen Kaufman.
Camille Lavington, an image consultant in Manhattan, says most corporate spouses that she takes on as clients are women and they can become unnerved by the social demands thrust upon them as their husbands rise rapidly in the ranks.
"Unless they've been exposed to heavy socialization, the average wife is so afraid that she will do something to impede her husband's success that she turns reticent and doesn't make an effort to get involved, or charitable," she said. "They're so self-conscious that they don't know how to make the other person feel comfortable."
Corporate husbands can also feel self-conscious. According to Bill Higgins, a former agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and a retired Navy captain, they can feel the need for guidance as well.
For the last 12 years, Mr. Higgins has been married to Barbara Corcoran, the founder of the Corcoran Group real estate firm. Mr. Higgins sold his own real estate business in 1997, and although he still has business interests of his own, about a year ago he began carrying a business card labeled "spouse," to give him an identity, he said. Last month, he went one step further and formed a club made up of husbands like him; four members showed up at the kickoff meeting. And he has just started a Web site, www.spouseclub.com, to provide guidance to corporate spouses.
"I don't want to be a marriage counselor," Mr. Higgins said, "but I do want to help the person whose wife is in a corporate position and who finds himself having to play the support role."
Ms. Lavington says empathy is the first thing she teaches her clients, so they can put other people at ease -- an important asset in business. And Mr. Sacarello of Charles & Associates thinks the key often is simply to bolster a spouse's self-esteem. As an example, he cited a client who held a blue-collar job and who, in the past, had made virtually no effort to provide support for his executive wife, who worked for a company that required her to socialize a lot.
"We taught this individual to value himself for what he did, and we made a list of his positive traits, like the fact that he has a good brain, personality, and can sustain a conversation, as well as hold a drink," Mr. Sacarello said. "Now his attitude is completely different, and he and his wife come across as a couple. Our goal is that when two people walk into a room, nobody needs to know who the highflier is or isn't."

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence Is Lower But Remains Near Record Level

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
With interest rates and gasoline prices rising, consumer confidence slid in February from its record-setting level of January.
Still, confidence remained high, at levels last seen in the boom of the late 1960's, suggesting that consumer spending will continue to fuel economic growth. 
 The Conference Board said yesterday that its consumer confidence index dipped to 141.8 in February from a record high of 144.7 in January. It was the first decline since October, but the reading remained above the 141.7 of December.
The results were lower than the 143 that Wall Street analysts had expected, helping cool inflation jitters, but economists still expect the Federal Reserve to push interest rates higher in March to keep the economy from overheating.
Lynn Franco, director of the board's research center, said the February figures reflected declining consumer expectations of business and job opportunities in the next six months.
"Consumer attitudes will bear watching over the next few months to gauge the impact of rising interest rates and relatively high gas prices," she said. "As for now, the index is signaling further economic growth ahead."
The index, based on a monthly survey of 5,000 American households, is closely watched because consumer spending makes up about two-thirds of the nation's economic activity.
Most analysts expect the economy to begin slowing some this quarter because the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates four times since June to try to slow the economy and head off inflation.
In addition, rapidly rising prices for crude oil have sent heating oil prices soaring and gasoline costs surging to record levels, affecting fuel-reliant industries like airlines and trucking.
The latest consumer confidence reading "may indicate a little bit of fear that higher gas costs are here for a while, maybe a little bit of fear about what the Fed might do and the stock market might do," said Bryan Jordan, an economic analyst at Banc One Investment Advisors. But "consumers are still very confident," Mr. Jordan said. "They're still out there spending, even on autos and homes which are interest-rate sensitive."

HEADLINE: Economists Readjust Estimate Of Overstatement of Inflation

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 29

 BODY:
More than three years after concluding that the Consumer Price Index overstated inflation by 1.1 percentage points a year, a group of prominent economists says changes made to the index since then have narrowed the overstatement to about eight-tenths of a percentage point a year.
Their estimate is included in a report prepared for Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat, by the General Accounting Office, which conducts investigations and audits for Congress. The report is to be released publicly on Wednesday. 
 The economists were the members of a commission established by Congress to study the price index, which is widely used not just as a barometer of inflation but to set wages in union agreements and to recalculate tax brackets and Social Security benefits each year.
The commission, headed by Michael J. Boskin of Stanford University, spent 18 months studying the index. In December 1996, the commission's five members reported that a variety of statistical problems had created an upward bias in the price gauge of between 0.8 and 1.6 percentage points annually, with their best guess being 1.1 percentage point.
Since then, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics has made seven changes in the way it calculates the index. In a letter accompanying the accounting office's report, Katharine G. Abraham, the commissioner of labor statistics, said the agency was continuing to develop and evaluate improvements to the index, but that it did not think it possible to put a specific number on the degree to which the index overstates inflation.
At Mr. Moynihan's request, the accounting office went back to the commission members and asked for their current estimates of the upward bias in the index. In addition to Mr. Boskin, whose estimate was 0.8 to 0.85 percentage point, the other members were Ellen R. Dulberger of I.B.M., who estimated 0.8 percentage points; Robert J. Gordon of Northwestern University, who estimated 0.73 percentage point; and Dale W. Jorgenson of Harvard, who estimated 0.9 percentage point. The fifth member of the commission, Zvi Griliches of Harvard, died in November.
Because of the ways in which the price index is used, even modest reductions in any upward bias could result in smaller wage increases for some workers, lower payments to Social Security recipients and higher tax bills for some people.
Mr. Moynihan used the results to buttress his case for holding cost-of- living increases for Social Security beneficiaries to a rate below the rise in the Consumer Price Index. Such a change, he said, would go far toward putting Social Security's finances on sound footing for the long run.
Reducing the cost-of-living increases by eight-tenths of a percentage point would eliminate more than half of Social Security's projected shortfall over the next 75 years, Mr. Moynihan said.
In its original report, the Boskin commission said that the overstatement of inflation in the price index stemmed from a variety of problems. One was the inability of the index to fully capture decisions by consumers to switch from one variety of a product to another when prices rise -- from Red Delicious to Granny Smith apples, for example.
Another was the difficulty of accounting for choices by consumers to avoid rising prices by switching from one type of product to another -- renting a video, for example, rather than going out to see a movie.
The biggest single problem identified by the commission was adding popular new products like computer and cell phones to the index soon enough after their introduction to capture declines in their prices, and to find a way of accounting for quality improvements.

HEADLINE: Afghan Heroin Feeds Addiction In Region, U.N. Report Declares

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 29

 BODY:
The United Nations Drug Control Program says in a report made public today that Afghanistan is now not only the largest producer of opium but is also becoming a major manufacturer of heroin, which is contributing to a rise in addiction throughout the region.
The report, prepared for a meeting here on Monday of Afghanistan's six neighbors plus the United States and Russia, says that Pakistan and Iran now have some of the world's highest rates of addiction to heroin, which is derived from opium. "Central Asian countries show alarming signs of fast-increasing abuse rates," it says. 
 Afghanistan is encircled by Pakistan, Iran, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and a far-western corridor of China.
"The number of heroin addicts in the region exceeds that of Western Europe and is still on the increase," says the report, prepared by Pino Arlacchi, executive director of the United Nations office for drug control and crime prevention. The report adds that communities of addicts in the region are seen as easy targets for organized crime and vectors for the spread of AIDS.
The report says that there is no evidence to support charges that drug profits are going either to leaders of the Taliban, who control most of Afghanistan, or to the Northern Alliance, the remains of the former government. Both forces impose taxes on traders, however, with the Taliban earning $10 million to $30 million a year, according to varying estimates, the report says. It says no estimates are available of the alliance's earnings from this source.
As a country, the report says, Afghanistan receives only about 1 percent of the global profits of the opium and heroin originating there. Poor farmers with no other easy way to earn an income do most of the cultivation, turning over crops to local traders.
The United Nations report links the increase in narcotics production in Afghanistan with the economic, political and social collapse caused by decades of civil war.
"Like viruses thrive best in frail bodies," it says, "illicit drugs prosper best in regions that are in internal turmoil with weak or nonexistent government structures and controls." Taliban leaders say that until they get help in building an economy, they cannot ask farmers to forgo the only income they have.

HEADLINE: Economic Rally Began With Reagan

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Paul Krugman (column, Feb. 23) attacks our conclusion that the United States' economic rally began in the early 1980's with Ronald Reagan, not in the early 1990's with Bill Clinton. Our premise that Reaganomics -- lower taxes, sound money, free trade and smaller government -- deserves a lot of the credit for our prosperity has been validated by the National Bureau of Economic Research, which concludes that except for a seven-month recession in 1990, the period of 1982 to 2000 has been one of prolonged high employment, low inflation and bull-market expansion. 
 Mr. Krugman asks how we can possibly credit the fast growth since 1995 to Reagan policies. We have five answers: a reduction in the capital gains tax, welfare reform, three free-trade agreements signed by President Clinton, a decline in government spending to 19 percent of gross domestic product from 22 percent, and Alan Greenspan's anti-inflationary monetary policy. These sound an awful lot like supply-side economic policies to us.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: POLITICAL MEMO;
Yes, It's Still the Economy, Stupid, but With an Asterisk

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 29

 BODY:
If Vice President Al Gore has counted on anything in this tumultuous political season, it is that the strong economy will give him the upper hand in the general election should he win the Democratic presidential nomination.
The economy remains as strong as ever. But Mr. Gore's strategy for using it to his advantage would have to change -- and could in the end prove to be less potent -- if his Republican opponent turned out to be Senator John McCain rather than Gov. George W. Bush. 
 To Mr. Gore's team, Mr. Bush, who until a few weeks ago seemed to have a lock on his party's nomination, is in many ways the ideal rival. The centerpiece of the Texan's campaign has been his big tax cut, a proposal that Mr. Gore's advisers are certain they could label fiscally irresponsible, a threat to Social Security and a gamble with the current prosperity.
When it comes to economic issues, Mr. McCain presents a smaller, more elusive target. While he supports tax cuts, they are of a scale closer to those advocated by Mr. Gore. Like President Clinton and the vice president, Mr. McCain emphasizes that saving Social Security is his first goal. And like the administration, he promotes the long-term benefits of reducing the national debt.
"McCain is not challenging the basic framework of the Clinton-Gore administration," said Will Marshall, president of the Progressive Policy Institute, a research organization created by centrist Democrats. "That will make it tougher for Gore to find points of contrast if McCain turns out to be the Republican nominee."
To Mr. McCain's supporters, his middle-of-the-road approach on economic policy is a crucial element of a driving force behind his candidacy: his argument that he is more electable than Mr. Bush.
"What McCain talks about in policy is politically doable within Washington, and it insulates him and puts him in a position of strategic advantage relative to Gore should he face him in the fall," said Representative Mark Sanford, a Republican from South Carolina who backs Mr. McCain.
"What Democrats have beaten Republicans over the head with -- with great success -- was the notion that we wanted big tax cuts to the exclusion of Social Security and Medicare," Mr. Sanford said. "McCain's plan allows us to say we agree that Social Security ought to be first, and here's how we propose to do it."
Perhaps just as important, or more so, neutralizing the economic issue could give Mr. McCain a chance to move the campaign to the ground on which he feels strongest: character and reform. Indeed, relative to either Mr. Gore or Mr. Bush, he has little interest in the details of economic policy.
"It won't be a battle over who's a better wonk," said Marshall Wittman, director of government relations at the conservative Heritage Foundation, who supports Mr. McCain. "The battle would be over who do you trust, and that's where McCain has the edge."
Mr. Gore's campaign, of course, does not see it that way. Advisers to the vice president said they would make a case that Mr. McCain is just as conservative as Mr. Bush. They also said they viewed Mr. McCain as open to attack on some critical issues, especially Social Security. Mr. McCain advocates using a big chunk of the projected federal budget surplus to create private investment accounts within the retirement system. Most Democrats have long said such a step would leave the elderly vulnerable to the volatility of Wall Street and divert money from debt reduction.
"If the issue is, as it should be, who can keep the economic prosperity going," said Chris Lehane, Mr. Gore's spokesman, "then the fact that Al Gore has been a major player in an administration that has created the longest economic expansion on record is going to be the main factor."
It is still unclear whether Mr. McCain's moderate stance on fiscal policy will win the day in the Republican primaries. Mr. Bush has not wavered in his advocacy of sweeping tax cuts as the best way to stimulate growth and, as he puts it, to keep politicians in Washington from squandering the surplus on wasteful government spending.
"People say, 'Well, your tax cut plan isn't taking hold, the exit polls don't show anything, you must abandon it,' " Mr. Bush said after his defeat in Michigan last week. "I'm not going to abandon the tax cut plan."
Mr. Bush is using Mr. McCain's moderate position on taxes to lump him with Mr. Gore and Democrats generally, and is trying to block Mr. McCain's efforts to claim the mantle of Ronald Reagan as the true conservative in the race.
"It's important for Senator McCain and Vice President Gore to hear this important fact: that taxes on working people in America are at the highest level they've been since World War II," Mr. Bush told a rally in Virginia last Friday.
In response, Mr. McCain has emphasized his conservative credentials, especially his advocacy of slashing pork-barrel spending and ending corporate tax subsidies and loopholes. His argument is that it is more conservative to keep spending in check, reduce the national debt and shore up Social Security than to enact a tax cut that would go mostly to the wealthy -- a sharp jab at Republican orthodoxy.
"There's no doubt that the Democrats will try to make John McCain carry all the baggage of his party," said Mr. Marshall, of the Progressive Policy Institute. "The question is whether this campaign will be for McCain what Bill Clinton's 'different kind of Democrat' campaign did for him in 1992, which was to show that you couldn't put him into the old categories."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Cap Gemini to Acquire Ernst & Young's Consulting Business

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: PARIS, Feb. 29

 BODY:
In a move to create a global computer services consulting firm, Cap Gemini S.A. of France announced today that it was acquiring the consulting practice of Ernst & Young, one of the world's largest accounting firms, in a deal worth $11.1 billion.
Cap Gemini said it would pay 375 million euros, or $362 million, in cash and issue up to 43.5 million new shares, if all the consulting businesses of Ernst & Young accept the offer. 
 The stock will be divided among Ernst & Young's 1,000 consulting partners, who will then work for Cap Gemini, and the 4,000 accounting and tax partners that will remain with the auditing firm. About a third of the shares will go to the consulting partners and another third to the accounting and tax partners, who must sell their stock within five years. The remainder will go to finance Ernst & Young's pension plan and to pay for a variety of other expenses, including tax bills and transaction costs.
The deal represents the latest attempt by the accounting industry to try to address competitive pressures facing consultants and to allay regulators' concerns about the integrity of corporate audits. If it succeeds, it will be the first time one of the largest accounting firms has sold its major consulting business and will afford Cap Gemini, the biggest European computer services company, a major entry into the United States.
Paul Hermelin, a Cap Gemini director, said the combined companies would transform Cap Gemini into a "real global firm." Combined revenue, he said at a news conference to announce the deal, would amount to as much as $7.5 billion.
Philip A. Laskawy, chairman and chief executive of Ernst & Young who will remain as the head of the auditing practice, said the companies complemented one another "from a strategic and geographic perspective" and were equally committed "to the development of e-offerings."
In recent years, the world's biggest accounting firms have come under growing pressure to separate their accounting and consulting businesses. The latter has become their most profitable and fastest-growing area, but friction between consultants and accountants has grown. The consulting business requires significantly more capital than a firm's traditional auditing practice, and firms have scrambled to retain and attract their consulting employees. The Securities and Exchange Commission has also been pressing firms to avoid the conflicts of interest that come when supposedly independent auditors are tempted to make compromises in reviewing a company's books rather than risk losing lucrative consulting contracts.
Earlier this month, PricewaterhouseCoopers, which advises and audits many of the world's biggest corporations, said it planned to separate its auditing and consulting practices into two or more separate entities. Its biggest rivals, including KPMG, Arthur Andersen and Deloitte & Touche, are all trying to devise other solutions.
While the sale by Ernst & Young represents a possible answer to the problem of auditor independence, the transaction has not yet been approved by the S.E.C.
Ernst & Young's audit partners will still own a sizable piece of Cap Gemini, and regulators may view the arrangement as one that continues to pose a conflict of interest for the firm's auditors.
The move will catapult Cap Gemini into the big league of global computer service consultants, a field now dominated by American giants like I.B.M., Electronic Data Systems, Andersen Consulting and Computer Sciences. Pierre Hessler, president of Gemini Consulting, said he expected the combined group to generate roughly a fourth of its revenue from Internet companies this year, up from about 16 percent in the past. The deal will also strengthen Cap Gemini's position in the United States, which will account for about a third of the group's revenue, and reinforce its status in Germany, another major market.
But some industry analysts say Cap Gemini may face a challenge in keeping Ernst & Young's clients happy. In the United States, Cap Gemini's image was bruised recently after several major computer installations failed to live up to expectations. In January, the company reached an amicable settlement with the United Way of America over a failed $12 million project; last summer, the United States Chamber of Commerce canceled a $75 million contract with Cap Gemini, contending that one of its systems failed to deliver what was promised.
Still, Cap Gemini's bid would create a consulting giant with a strong position in the financial and insurance industries, as well as in the media and telecommunications businesses.
Analysts said that the combination made sense, given Cap Gemini's strong presence in Europe, while Ernst & Young has a solid position in the United States and Germany, a European market where Cap Gemini has been struggling to develop a significant presence. Moreover, the alliance would enable both companies to provide better service to the Internet economy, which is enjoying sustained growth and strong profitability.
Investors appeared to agree. Cap Gemini shares soared almost 14 percent at the start of trading in Paris today, to a record 291.9 euros, or $283.14. The price has risen almost 50 percent since early December, when the companies began serious talks.
The deal with Cap Gemini involves its consulting practices in the United States, Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Spain, countries where Ernst & Young generates roughly 85 percent of its total consulting revenue of $3.4 billion. Other countries are expected to be included later, including Belgium, the Netherlands, much of Scandinavia, Australia and New Zealand. The deal requires the approval of Ernst & Young's partners, who will vote country by country in coming weeks. The results are expected in April. Cap Gemini shareholders will then vote on the arrangement.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Technology Shares Lift Nasdaq Index to Another Record

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Stock prices staged a broad, sharp advance in heavy trading yesterday. Demand for technology stocks was especially intense, and the Nasdaq composite index rose to a record.
Led by networking and computer-related stocks, the Nasdaq jumped 118.84 points, or 2.6 percent, to 4,696.69. 
 The gain capped an amazing month for the index: in February, the Nasdaq rose more than 19 percent. For the year, the index is up 15.4 percent.
"Technology, telecommunications and biotechnology are areas where it is hard to argue with a good story and big promises," said Michael Clark, head of United States stock trading for Credit Suisse First Boston. "The market loves the story, the growth and the promise."
The gains were not limited to stocks listed on the Nasdaq.
For a second consecutive session, blue-chip stocks moved higher.
The Dow Jones industrial average, helped by big gains in Hewlett-Packard, AT& T and General Electric, rose 89.66 points, or 0.9 percent, to 10,128.31.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 18.37, or 1.4 percent, to 1,366.42, led by big gains in Texas Instruments, Motorola and Oracle.
The Russell 2000 index of small- cap stocks soared and set a record.
Demand for small but fast-growing technology and biotechnology companies helped to propel the Russell 2000 index by 20.03, or 3.6 percent, to a record 577.71. The Russell's technology index has jumped 39 percent this year.
Trading was heavy. Volume on the Nasdaq stock market set a record yesterday, at 2.07 billion shares. On the New York Stock Exchange 1.2 billion shares changed hands.
Faced with the specter of additional moves by the Federal Reserve Board to raise short-term interest rates, most analysts said gains in sectors of the market that are sensitive to rising rates are likely to be somewhat limited.
"We have been in a trading range on the Dow of between 10,000 and 12,000 for much of the last year, " said Philip Orlando, chief investment officer at Value Line Asset Management. "We are likely to stay within that band for a while longer."
Mr. Orlando said that recently he had been a buyer of stocks like Wal-Mart, International Paper, General Electric and Johnson & Johnson.
Micron Technology, the biggest domestic maker of computer memory chips, surged 17 15/16, to 96, encouraged by a 10 percent rise in chip prices over the last week.
Motorola, which signed a licensing deal with Psion P.L.C., Europe's largest maker of palmtop computers, gained 12, to 170 1/2. The company later announced a three-for-one stock split.
3Com, another contributor to the S.& P. 500's advance, jumped 18 15/16, to 98.
The stock, which has been a big winner so far this year, soared again yesterday in advance of the initial public offering of its Palm division.
Biotechnology shares were higher.
Genentech rose 11 3/8, to 192 7/8. Immunex closed at 197 7/16, up 6 11/16. And Biogen gained 3 1/16, to 107 5/16.
Oil stocks also did well. Exxon Mobil rose 11 13/16, to 75 5/16. Among oil service stocks, Halliburton was up 3 5/16, to 38 3/16. Schlumberger gained 4 33/64, to 73 55/64. And BJ Services closed at 57 1/16, up 4 1/4.
Retailing stocks, which have been under selling pressure so far this year, did better. Wal-Mart, a Dow component, gained 2 3/4. to 48 7/8. Staples was up 2 1/8, to 27. And Circuit City rose 4 5/8, to 40 7/16.

Treasury Prices Rise
 
By Bloomberg News
Bond prices rose yesterday as investors added longer-term debt to portfolios to mirror changes in a benchmark index, while notes fell a second day as stocks advanced.
The price of the 30-year bond rose 22/32, to 101 18/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.14 percent from 6.19 percent on Monday. Money managers matched an extension in duration in the Lehman Brothers Treasury Index for March, analysts said.
"You have some index rebalancing for March," said Ted Neild, who helps invest $40 billion at the Nuveen Advisory Corporation in Chicago. "People look to the easiest place" to reconfigure their portfolio, and that's the 30-year bond, he said.
Two-year Treasuries, which are most vulnerable to interest rate rises by the Federal Reserve, led notes lower. Its price fell 1/32, to 99 31/32, while its yield rose to 6.52 percent from 6.50 percent. Many investors expect the Fed to raise rates next month to slow the economy.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of a one-year bill:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)
 
Price: 94.095
High Rate: 5.84%
Coupon Yield: 6.19%
Low Rate: 5.79%
Median Rate: 5.83%
Total applied for: $29,797,451
Accepted: $15,611,821
Noncompetitive: $1,082,552
 
The one-year bills mature March 1, 2001.

HEADLINE: India Increases Its Military Budget by 28 Percent

BYLINE: By BARRY BEARAK 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, Feb. 29

 BODY:
With relations between the bitter foes India and Pakistan at their worst point in three decades, New Delhi announced a 28.2 percent increase in military spending today. It is the largest single-year increase in the nation's history.
"We shall not shrink from making any sacrifice to guard and protect every inch of our beloved motherland," Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha said in presenting the country's annual budget to Parliament. 
 The announcement comes less than three weeks before President Clinton is scheduled to arrive in New Delhi on a mission that is at least partly intended to ease the strain between the world's two newest nuclear weapons states.
A big jump in military spending is no surprise. It has been expected since India fought intense battles with Pakistani-backed forces in the frigid mountains of Kashmir six months ago. The Indians drove off the invaders, but the incursion revealed weaknesses in the nation's defenses. The military complained that a decade of belt-tightening had left it without needed funds for basic supplies, surveillance equipment and upgraded weapons.
Tensions have only grown worse. Pakistan's military overthrew the elected government. Guerrilla attacks have become epidemic in Kashmir. India blamed Pakistan for the hijacking of an Indian airliner on Christmas Eve.
"India is sending a message with the new budget," said George Perkovich, author of the new book "India's Nuclear Bomb" (University of California, 1999). "It's saying to Pakistan, 'O.K., you may want to use a bellicose strategy against us, but you're broke and we're not. We're going to spend 28 percent more. Can you match that?' "
Indeed, Pakistan is deeply in debt. But India, too, has a ballooning fiscal deficit. The budget for the year beginning April 1 calls for tax increases on higher-income people, a review of state subsidies and cuts in the government payroll.
Manpower cuts will not include the military, which will now have an allowance of $13.5 billion. Nearly half the money will go to the army. It is unclear how much will be devoted to nuclear weapons, though the Pakistanis will no doubt fear the worst.
"It's really mind-boggling how a country could increase a budget 28 percent if it was just for conventional forces," said a spokesman for Pakistan, Maj. Gen. Rashid Qureshi.
In May 1998, India tested a nuclear device and Pakistan followed 17 days later. Ever since, there has been fear of an arms race.
The rise in India's military budget is a victory for the nation's hawks, who want to beef up the armed forces. However, it is also a repudiation of their earlier views, when they argued that nuclear weapons would buy a better defense for less money.
Others see a bigger military budget as an overdue payment. "India has a one-million-man army, a two-fleet navy and a 35-combat-squadron air force -- and that takes money," said Uday Bhaskar, deputy director of the Institute for Defense Studies and Analyses in New Delhi.
In 1990, when India was experiencing a financial crisis, the military budget was cut back as a percentage of the gross domestic product, Mr. Bhaskar said.
The decline largely continued, though the largest increase in recent years was 14 percent in 1998.
Fighting last summer in Kashmir was a jolting reminder, Mr. Bhaskar said. "All that's happening now is that we're catching up," he said.

HEADLINE: Nassau to Reassess Property, Treading Political Minefield

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER 

DATELINE: GARDEN CITY, N.Y., Feb. 29

 BODY:
Faced with a fiscal meltdown and a major lawsuit challenging Nassau County's antiquated property tax system, two Republican county officials reversed course today and agreed to press for the reassessment of all 415,000 residential and commercial properties in the county.
The reversal by the officials, County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta and Charles O'Shea, chairman of the Board of Assessors, makes reassessment, a longstanding political hot potato that recently won the support of the Democrat-led County Legislature, a near certainty. And it sets in motion what is likely to be a long, politically perilous process that will increase taxes in many of the wealthiest areas of the county. 
 Until now, reassessment had been considered too politically risky, largely out of fears that it would raise property taxes, especially those of wealthy homeowners who vote, leading them to take out their anger at the polls.
But the county's continuing financial crisis, which has led rating services to downgrade the county's bonds to a level just above junk, and a lawsuit challenging the current assessments as racially discriminatory forced the county to act. The county's budget deficit is estimated at $100 million to $190 million this year.
Residents of wealthy communities along the North Shore of Long Island, including Great Neck, Manhasset and Port Washington, stand to see tax increases, officials say. Homeowners in poorer areas along the South Shore, like Roosevelt, Freeport and Hempstead, will probably see their taxes fall.
But the political fallout remains unclear because both Democrats and Republicans now have their fingerprints on the reassessment proposal, and because the process, which is expected to take at least two years, will not be completed before November 2001, when all 19 county legislators and the county executive are up for re-election.
A study by the Nassau Citizens Budget Committee, a nonprofit fiscal watchdog group, found that roughly a third of county taxpayers would see their taxes rise, a third would see their taxes fall and a third would see no change.
Right now, houses in Nassau County are assessed based on land costs from 1964 and earlier and building costs from 1938 -- before the Long Island Expressway was built, before acres of farmland were sold to developers, and before the construction of Levittown ushered in a new era in suburban living.
Those tax assessments have remained the same ever since, even though houses in wealthy, mostly white areas have increased in value much more than houses in poorer, mostly black and Hispanic areas. The result is that the owner of a $300,000 house in Garden City can pay the same $8,000 in property taxes as the owner of a $110,000 house in Roosevelt.
Mr. O'Shea made his call for reassessment less than a month after defending the current system as "fair" before a County Legislature hearing. He explained his switch by saying that members of a commission he formed last year to study the system recently told him that while their work was not done, they had concluded that reassessment was overdue. "Reassessment will give fiscal stability to Nassau County by putting into place a modern assessment system that takes into account changes in property values," he said.
His announcement led to an even more stunning turnabout, as Mr. Gulotta said for the first time in his 13-year tenure that he would strongly support reassessment. "While I have traditionally opposed reassessment," he said in a statement, "the county's fiscal condition mandates we stop the hemorrhaging and undertake reassessment with procedures that provide maximum protection for our homeowners."
Judith A. Jacobs, presiding officer of the legislature, said she believed that the newly elected Democratic majority, which took over in January for the first time in 80 years amid voter dissatisfaction over the county's finances, paved the way for today's announcement by calling for a reassessment in January.
She praised some of her Democratic colleagues for calling for reassessment even though they represent communities along the North Shore where taxes could go up. "This system is literally bleeding the county," she said. "We should be thrown out of office if we don't do this."
But Republican legislators, who blame their party's losses at the polls largely on two tax increases they passed before the election, took a more wait-and-see approach.
Peter J. Schmitt, the minority leader, said he wanted more details from Mr. O'Shea before making up his mind. "If he can come up with a proposal that saves this county money," said Mr. Schmitt, who represents Massapequa, "then I'm for it. If he comes up with a proposal that saves the county money at the expense of people in my district, I'm not for it."
The announcement came less than a month before opening arguments are scheduled in a lawsuit filed by the New York Civil Liberties Union, the state attorney general's office and the Justice Department. The suit charges that the current tax system discriminates against black and Hispanic residents. While the town has said that residents are free to challenge their tax assessments, lawyers for the minority homeowners say only the wealthy have the time and resources to do so.
County officials said they were not admitting that the current system was discriminatory.
Leon Friedman, a lawyer working on the case, said he wanted to make sure that the reassessment proposal was fair before he and his colleagues agreed to a settlement.
The county's financial problems are compounded each year when it refunds roughly $100 million to residents and businesses that successfully challenge their tax assessments. Those payments have been cited as a major drain on the county's coffers by the state and county comptrollers and by Wall Street bond-rating agencies.
Mr. O'Shea's announcement raised almost as many questions as it did answers. He offered few specifics about how the reassessment would work and did not say whether it would be based on the full current market value of a property or a fraction of its current market value. He did say that his office was preparing to seek bids from assessors and that he would soon ask the legislature to appropriate money for the job.
Reassessing the county could cost between $30 million and $50 million, officials said. But Ms. Jacobs said it would more than pay for itself in the first year after it was complete, when the county would not face tens of millions of dollars in tax challenges.
The costs of the current system have been high. In 1999, the county borrowed $95 million to pay back homeowners and businesses that had successfully challenged their property taxes, according to figures from the county comptroller's office. The county paid $47 million more in debt service on its debt of $831 million in bonds issued to cover tax refunds.
But elected officials have long feared the political costs of reassessment. "It takes political courage," said Neal Lewis, executive director of the Long Island Neighborhood Network, an advocacy group. "Clearly the type of people who go to political fund-raisers and contribute to campaigns are likely to have more valuable homes that could see an increase. But I believe that people are willing to pay their fair share."
News of the reassessment plan made some North Shore residents nervous. "I'm very negative," said Jack Brown, 34, an investment fund manager who moved with his wife into a $400,000 house in Great Neck three years ago. Mr. Brown said his property taxes, at $5,300 a year, are low for the area. "But if they went to $7,000, that's $150 a month. That's real money."
In Freeport, meanwhile, homeowners were hopeful. Walton Bird, 38, who makes $18,000 a year, said he pays $4,000 to $5,000 in taxes on a house that is worth about $130,000. "I feel that the poor neighborhoods and the poor people are getting the worst end of the stick," he said.

HEADLINE: Gary Journal;
City Known for Trouble Sees Hope in a Pageant

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: GARY, Ind., Feb. 29

 BODY:
Better known for violence, rust and urban decay than as a destination for beautiful women wearing sequins and gold lame, Gary, Ind., an aging, gritty city just east of Chicago, entered a contract today to be the site of the nationally televised Miss USA Pageant.
The announcement that the pageant would be held here for three years starting in February 2001 was seized on as another sign of hope by a town sometimes known to its detractors as Scary Gary. Eleven days ago, Mayor Scott King signed an agreement to bring a Continental Basketball Association team, Steelheads, here beginning in November. Two months earlier, Pan American Airlines began daily service to Orlando and Portsmouth, N.H., from the Gary/Chicago Airport, which for years did not provide commercial flights. And Gary is negotiating with minor league baseball officials to bring a team here in 2002. 
 The turnaround is occurring as Gary, a city of 114,256 that Money magazine in 1998 named the most dangerous city in the United States, is making inroads against crime. In 1993, 1995 and 1996, Gary tallied more homicides per capita than any other American city.
Homicide is down 24 percent from 1997 through 1999, from 98 to 74 killings. For the same period, rape fell 81 percent, armed robbery decreased 24 percent and aggravated battery declined 62 percent.
Among those killed last year was Mayor King's 17-year-old nephew, shot after a fistfight with another youth. Nonetheless, the mayor is encouraged by the drop in crime, and is quick to attribute much of the decline to an F.B.I.-led anti-gang unit sent in 1997 by Attorney General Janet Reno. The unit has made more than 500 arrests and federal prosecutors have won more than 200 convictions.
Although Gary has become safer, it has not become much prettier.
The main thoroughfare, Broadway, is 45 blocks of mostly abandoned buildings and boarded-up storefronts. Nearly three downtown blocks are entirely vacant, the result of a fire in 1996 that leveled churches, stores and an auditorium. Wide swaths of the city are dotted with abandoned housing.
But Mr. King, two months into his second four-year term, said he believed Gary was about to rebound from the hard times wrought by the 1980's recession in the steel industry that left thousands here without jobs and the crime wave wrought by street gangs in 1990's fighting for control of the crack trade.
Unemployment in Gary, 8.2 percent in 1999, is still above the state average of 3.2 percent, but less than half of the 17.8 percent high in 1989.
"We've built a solid foundation," Mr. King said. "Now we need to put up the framing."
Maureen J. Reidy, the president of the Miss Universe Organization, which produces the Miss USA pageant, said Gary's past troubles had no impact on selecting it over 11 other cities -- including Branson, Mo., and Shreveport, La. -- to play host to the pageant. Ms. Reidy, who was at Mr. King's side during a news conference today, said she was "pleasantly surprised" by the city.
Though Gary offered the best financial package -- the city will pay $1.2 million in travel, lodging, and other pageant costs -- it was not solely money that helped tip the scales in Gary's favor. Donald J. Trump owns one of the city's two casinos. The Miss Universe Organization is co-owned by Mr. Trump and CBS, which broadcasts the show.
City officials said they did not know how much money the pageant might attract. It may be hard to persuade those who know Gary only from its violent image to visit, said Spero Batistatos, the president of the Convention and Visitors Bureau of Lake County, which includes Gary. Though the pageant will be held in the city's 6,000-seat Genesis Convention Center, pageant workers and visitors probably will stay in hotels up to an hour's drive away because Gary has only one 200-room hotel.
"There will be some bumps along the way," Mr. Batistatos said. "You're talking about a solid 30 years of brainwashing by the media about the negatives in the city. A lot of those negatives are gone. As good as this is, it's going to take some time to change those perceptions."

D.O.A. at the I.M.F.

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
Nothing in the bylaws of the International Monetary Fund says that its managing director has to be European. Still, there is a long tradition to that effect -- part of a gentlemen's agreement that gives the considerably less critical directorship of the World Bank to an American.
But on Monday, when European Union finance ministers formally endorsed Caio Koch-Weser -- a Brazilian-born German official who has spent most of his career at the World Bank -- the United States promptly and bluntly rejected that choice. 
 To appreciate why the Americans decided to be so ugly, you need to understand that the head of the I.M.F. is one of the most crucial economic officials in the world, right up there with the chairman of the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Treasury Secretary. The managing director not only needs to be smart and experienced; he also needs to be diplomatically forceful. It's not a job for an ordinary bureaucrat.
Unfortunately, people who should know regard Mr. Koch-Weser as, well, an ordinary bureaucrat. He is, by all accounts, intelligent and likable. But he has spent his career at the wrong kind of institution; the World Bank is not a place to get experience in financial firefighting. More important, insiders I spoke to described Mr. Koch-Weser as someone who got along by going along -- someone who never expressed strong ideas of his own, who always seemed to say what he thought his superiors wanted to hear. That's not exactly the kind of man you want in the hot seat when the next global crisis breaks out.
So why did the Europeans select such a weak candidate? That's where the story gets awfully funny -- that is, it's funny, but it's also awful.
The problem begins with the French. France has long been an ardent advocate of the idea of Europe -- a Europe led by Frenchmen. And Paris has been ruthless in its determination to put its nationals in charge of everything from the I.M.F. to the European Central Bank.
At some point, however, Europe's largest nation was going to demand its turn. Given that a Frenchman has headed the I.M.F. for the last 22 years (and for 32 of the last 37 years!), the Germans figured that it was about time they got a chance. The trouble was that they didn't have any qualified candidates.
No, they aren't a nation of dummkopfs; it's a question of background. Germany does not have an elite civil service like the French or the British; nor does it have the kind of cross-pollination among business, academia and government that produces a Robert Rubin or Larry Summers. Nobody I talked to could come up with any German candidate he regarded as suitable for the job. Mr. Koch-Weser was the best Germany could find -- and he wasn't good enough.
Even the British and the French made their disappointment clear, withholding their endorsement for three months after the German government began pushing Mr. Koch-Weser. What finally concentrated their minds was the horrifying prospect that the job might actually go to the right person.
Last week a coalition of developing countries forced the issue by formally nominating Stanley Fischer, the I.M.F.'s first deputy managing director. Mr. Fischer (a former teacher and colleague of mine) has every conceivable qualification but one. An eminent economist, he is also an experienced policy maker -- he was the point man in the Asian crisis -- who has been noteworthy for his tact, discretion and ability to stay cool under fire. Even those who have criticized some of the I.M.F.'s decisions regard him as perfect for the job. But though born in what is now Zambia, Mr. Fischer is a naturalized U.S. citizen.
That apparently does not bother the African, Latin American and Middle Eastern (!) nations that have championed his candidacy. But the Europeans want a European, though most of them don't really want Mr. Koch-Weser. (Everyone suspects that Britain and maybe even France were willing to give lip service to an unsatisfactory candidate only because they counted on the Clinton administration, which is having trouble defending the I.M.F. against a hostile Congress in any case, to veto him.)
Now the truth is that there are plenty of qualified Europeans; there are citizens of Britain, Italy, Sweden, Poland who could do the job. Still, one wonders: Is it too late for Mr. Fischer to acquire a German passport?

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE CONTEXT;
McCain Again Falters Within Party

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: RICHMOND, Va., Feb. 29

 BODY:
Whatever else Senator John McCain of Arizona achieved in his short, sharp foray into Virginia this week, he certainly moved no closer to the Republican presidential nomination. His long-shot attack on the leaders of the religious right bore no immediate fruit.
Today's primary here was a victory for Gov. George W. Bush of Texas in more than one sense. 
 He piled up an imposing margin and took all 56 delegates in the nation's 12th-most-populous state -- a Southern state, like South Carolina, where Mr. Bush won just 10 days ago, but a much less provincial one, with huge military installations as well as wealthy Washington suburbs where some of the nation's fastest-growing high-technology companies are based.
The triumph was the Texan's first in a large, economically and politically diverse state with aspirations to national leadership.
More important, he once again denied Mr. McCain the kind of showing among Republican voters that the Arizonan desperately needs. Mr. McCain took only 26 percent of the Republican vote in South Carolina and only 29 percent last week in Michigan; after a week of proclaiming himself "a proud Reagan Republican" in television advertisements, he did no better in Virginia.
In a state where 55 percent of the voters described themselves as conservatives, Mr. McCain did poorly among them. Twice as many self-described conservatives voted for Mr. Bush as for Mr. McCain.
Adherents of the religious right were not so numerous in Virginia as in South Carolina, accounting for only about 20 percent of the electorate, but they exerted a potent influence on the outcome. Mr. Bush won the backing of an overwhelming percentage of them -- almost 8 of 10, according to the exit polling -- while he and Mr. McCain ran even among voters who said they did not identify with Christian conservatism.
Mr. McCain did well, and Mr. Bush badly, among Democrats and independents who crossed over into the Republican primary. That brought no cheer to Bush backers, because the Texan has been striving to picture himself as the man who can lead the Republicans to victory in November.
Governor Bush seems unable to break out of a right-wing box, even though he has begun re-emphasizing "compassionate conservatism." Tonight, however, in a victory speech delivered in Cincinnati, he asserted that "we are expanding our base without destroying our foundation."
No doubt Mr. McCain has galvanized much of the country, including many people who have been alienated from politics in recent years. His national approval rating in the most recent ABC News/Washington Post poll has risen to 60 percent, from 36 percent at the end of October, while Mr. Bush's has been slipping. He is well situated for a general election contest.
But as Prof. Larry Sabato of the University of Virginia commented: "You can't possibly win the Republican nomination with just Democratic and independent votes. You need Republican as well as Democratic and independent support."
Moreover, Democrats and independents will be barred from voting for Mr. McCain (or any other Republican) in the New York primary on Tuesday or in California's delegate-selection election on the same day.
Polls show Mr. McCain trailing in both of those states, as well as in Texas and Florida, which will vote on March 14. Those four states, the nation's four most populous, will among them choose more than 45 percent of the 1,034 delegates needed for the Republican nomination.
The week between the Michigan primary and the voting today -- the state of Washington also held a primary, and North Dakota held caucuses -- was marked by frantic repositioning efforts. Mr. McCain tried hard to counter suggestions that he was insufficiently or unreliably conservative, and Mr. Bush struggled against suggestions that he was anti-Catholic.
But not much changed in the pattern of voting. The same acute ideological split that has shown up elsewhere was evident in Virginia, with Mr. Bush winning most of those who oppose abortion and attach great importance to moral issues, for example, and Mr. McCain winning most of those who back abortion rights and care more deeply about taxes and foreign policy.
Some of Mr. McCain's supporters had suggested that his speech on Monday in Virginia Beach, in which he denounced Pat Robertson and the Rev. Jerry Falwell, two of the Christian right's best-known leaders (and both Virginians), would prompt an outpouring of liberal and moderate Republicans in his behalf. According to exit polls, nothing like that happened; indeed, of the small number of voters who said they had decided at the last minute, most went to Governor Bush.
Others in the McCain camp hinted that the senator had been looking beyond Virginia to New York and California, hoping to win the backing of the numerous centrist voters there who object to the religious right. From that perspective, it is too early to evaluate the Virginia Beach speech.
The debates over which candidate was the real reformer and which was more honest, so steamy only a few days ago, seemed not to have fazed most Virginians. They said both were reformers and both talked straight.
Mr. McCain had hoped for a victory here to build upon his Michigan upset, and if he had brought it off it could have demoralized the Bush campaign on the eve of the biggest test of the year, the voting next Tuesday, which will include primaries in Ohio, Georgia, Massachusetts, Missouri and other states as well as California and New York. But no Republican has won on two big election nights in succession this year, and the pattern held.
With the backing of Gov. James S. Gilmore 3d and Senator John W. Warner, Mr. Bush was always the clear favorite; indeed, before Michigan, Mr. McCain had seemed ready to give Virginia a pass. By not doing so, he made the contest seem more important than it otherwise would have.
 
How the Poll Was Conducted
The Election Day poll was based on questionnaires completed by voters leaving voting stations throughout Virginia yesterday. The poll was conducted by Voter News Service, an organization created by ABC News, CBS News, CNN, Fox News, NBC News, and The Associated Press.
The results are based on 1,832 Republican primary voters in 35 randomly selected sites across the state.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, the results from such polls should differ by no more than plus or minus three percentage points from what would have been obtained by seeking to interview all primary voters who turned out yesterday.
Results based on smaller subgroups have a larger potential sampling error. In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of voter opinion on Election Day, like the reluctance of some voters to take time to fill out a questionnaire, may introduce other sources of error into the poll.

HEADLINE: Study Finds Racial Bias in Public Schools

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN 

 BODY:
Black students in public schools across the country are far more likely than whites to be suspended or expelled, and far less likely to be in gifted or advanced placement classes, according to a study of 12 large public school districts released yesterday by the Applied Research Center, a left-leaning nonprofit public policy group in Oakland, Calif.
The study, which comes at a time of heightened attention to racial differences in education, found inequalities in the districts studied: Austin, Tex., Boston, Chicago, Denver, Durham, N.C., Los Angeles, Miami, Columbia, S.C., San Francisco, Missoula, Mont., and Providence, R.I. 
 "Parents often feel that these are individual issues," said Libero Della Piana, a senior researcher at the center and a co-author of the report, "that it's just their kid having a problem, that it's about this teacher or that administrator, but when you look at the data, you see it's a systemic issue along race lines."
In every district studied except Missoula, Mont., where the data were unavailable, black students were suspended or expelled at a higher rate than their white peers. In Los Angeles, for example, black students made up 14 percent of the student body, but 30 percent of those suspended or expelled. The study did not offer details about whether students at the same school received similar punishments for similar acts.
Last fall, the racial skew in expulsion rates became a national issue after six black students in Decatur, Ill., were expelled following a brawl in the bleachers at a high school football game, and the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson's Rainbow/Operation PUSH Coalition filed a civil-rights lawsuit. The case was dismissed and the expulsions upheld, but the testimony showed that blacks accounted for more than 80 percent of the district's expulsions over the last four years, even though they make up less than half of the student body.
That kind of racial skew is common in several aspects of education, the study found. In all nine districts that provided statistics on academic placement by race, the study found, white students were disproportionately represented in advanced placement and gifted programs, and minority students underrepresented.
In San Francisco, the study found that blacks and Latinos make up 42 percent of the student body, but only 14 percent of those in advanced placement and gifted programs. And in Durham, N.C., where blacks and Latinos make up 62 percent of the students, they represent only 27 percent of the students in academically advanced classes. While few of the districts studied had large Asian-American populations, the Asian-American students in most districts were overrepresented in advanced classes and underrepresented among those who were disciplined.
The study asserts that the disparities amount to "a deep pattern of institutional racism." But many education experts took issue with that conclusion. While the inequalities described in the study are distressing, they say, those differences, like the well-documented racial gap on test scores, do not necessarily add up to institutional racism.
"Unfortunately, we have a lot of history and evidence that schools tend to reproduce the economic and social disparities of the larger society," said Robert B. Schwartz, president of Achieve, a school reform group made up of governors and corporate executives. "We look to schooling to be this great equalizing engine, but history hasn't been terrific on that score. Can one deny that racism persists? Of course not. But I think it's more complicated than racism alone. Obviously, class plays into this, and other factors."
The study examined 10 indicators, including the dropout rate, graduation rate, suspensions and expulsion, advanced and gifted classes, college admissions and the racial demographics of the teachers compared with those of the students.
In all the districts, the percentage of white teachers was higher than the percentage of white students, often by a huge margin. In Denver, more than three-quarters of the teachers, but less than one-quarter of the students, were white. And in Los Angeles and Chicago, about half the teachers, but only about one in 10 students, were white.
While federal regulations require the reporting of some data, including the racial makeup of the student body, there is no nationwide mandate to keep other statistics, like expulsions and suspensions, or the number of students admitted to a college, by race. And of the 12 districts included in the study, 9 either did not keep, or would not disclose, all the data requested. For example, 3 of the 12 districts did not report data on the racial makeup of their advanced placement and gifted classes.
But more data by race may be forthcoming. Partly because of the experience in Texas, where school results have improved since achievement was tracked by race, many legislators, both Democrats and Republicans, are supporting efforts to tally education statistics by race.
"Texas has been an important model for this," said Gary Orfield, a professor of education at Harvard. "Requiring more data by race doesn't produce a solution, but it means the problems can't be covered up."

 BODY:

THE REPUBLICANS
 
BOB JONES RESPONDS -- Bob Jones University, the fundamentalist Christian institution that has become a lightening rod since Gov. George W. Bush of Texas visited it during the South Carolina campaign, has responded on its Web site to attacks against it. The university described Senator John McCain of Arizona, Vice President Al Gore and former New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley, as "the political 'three tenors,' " who together "sing the same off-pitch tune of the liberal left." The university previously declined to respond to requests for comment. "Isn't it really a compliment to Bob Jones University that the likes of John McCain, Al Gore and Bill Bradley seethe and fulminate against us?" the statement said. The university said its policy against interracial dating was based on its understanding of the story of the Tower of Babel. "The university wishes to give God the benefit of the doubt and avoid pursuing any direction that would give assistance to the renewed efforts of man to create a one-world community, consisting of one religion, one economy, one government, and one race," the statement said. The university denied that it hates Catholics, saying instead it believes it had a biblical mandate to preach salvation by faith alone to Catholics, Jews, Buddhists, Mormons, Muslims, atheists and "unbelieving and religiously liberal Protestants." The statement said it regarded Catholicism on theological grounds as "false." Gustav Niebuhr (NYT) 

BETWEEN GOVERNORS -- Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma has some neighborly advice for Mr. Bush. Mr. Keating, a devout Roman Catholic and early supporter of Mr. Bush, has suggested that the Bush campaign schedule a speech at a major Catholic university to counter any hint of anti-Catholic bias that might have emerged after Mr. Bush's appearance at Bob Jones University in the South Carolina primary campaign. Noting that Mr. Bush was at a Catholic center in Cleveland yesterday, Ari Fleischer, a campaign spokesman, said, "We do appearances at faith-based organizations all the time, so we rule nothing out." Ross E. Milloy (NYT)
 
THE DEMOCRATS
 
GORE IN LOS ANGELES -- Campaigning in Los Angeles today, Vice President Al Gore referred only briefly to his rival, former Senator Bill Bradley, criticizing his health care plan. He had an interview with Univision, which he was asked to conduct in Spanish. He declined, saying, though, that he once "was completely fluent." At a fund-raiser where he raised $100,000, he paid homage to the "wonderful mosaic" in the audience of Indians, Pakistanis, Jews, Koreans and Latinos. Katharine Q. Seelye (NYT)
 
THE POLLS
 
OHIO LEANS TO BUSH -- In Ohio, the first independent statewide poll of likely Republican voters taken since the primaries in South Carolina and Michigan showed Mr. Bush ahead of Mr. McCain, 53 percent to 36 percent. The poll of 386 likely Republican voters, questioned on Wednesday through Sunday, was released on Tuesday by the Institute for Policy Research at the University of Cincinnati. A similar poll of likely Democratic voters showed Mr. Gore ahead of former Mr. Bradley, 66 percent to 22 percent. The margin of error is plus or minus five percentage points. In Maryland, another state with a March 7 primary, Mr. Bush led Mr. McCain 47 percent to 40 percent in a Potomac Survey Research poll of likely voters for The Baltimore Sun. The poll, released yesterday, showed Mr. Gore ahead 58 percent to 23 percent. The margin of error was plus or minus five percentage points. David E. Rosenbaum (NYT)
 
THE WEST
 
GAY MARRIAGE OPPOSED -- Most Californians support a proposition to keep the state from recognizing same-sex marriages performed elsewhere. The latest Field Poll found 53 percent of respondents favored the ballot measure and 40 percent were opposed. Seventy-seven percent of Republicans supported it, 16 percent were opposed. Forty-two percent of Democrats supported it, 45 percent opposed it. James Sterngold (NYT)

HEADLINE: A Theater Goes the Way of Arenas, With an Airline Name

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN 

 BODY:
Broadway's historic theaters have been named for actors and actresses, playwrights and critics, producers and patrons of the arts. Not until today have any of them been named for airline companies.
But in an $8.5 million dollar deal that may well foreshadow the corporate renaming of a host of Broadway houses, the nonprofit Roundabout Theater Company is rechristening the venerable Selwyn Theater on 42nd Street the American Airlines Theater. 
 Meanwhile, the Winter Garden Theater, where "Cats" is expected to close in June after nearly 18 years, may soon become the Cadillac Theater or the Cadillac Winter Garden. The Shubert Organization, which owns the theater, has been in discussions with General Motors about the possibility of such a deal.
And with some trepidation over whether widespread corporate renaming will cheapen the theater district, officials at Broadway's two other major chains say they are open to putting the logos of corporations and products on their theaters as well.
Traditionalists may shudder at the thought of corporations' buying their way onto the marquees, but theater owners and marketing experts say these alliances will grow and could become a widespread and lucrative practice.
"It's going to change both the face and the economics of Broadway," said Lindsey Gruson, the president and chairman of STET, a marketing group that has been advising the Shuberts on the Cadillac deal. "It's a marriage made in heaven."
But even among some of those who would stand to benefit financially there is uneasiness. "The name of the game is maximizing the value of your assets and branding them," said Rocco Landesman, president of Jujamcyn, which owns five Broadway theaters. "But if you take a long-term view of our properties, we certainly have other interests besides that, like maintaining the dignity and quality of the experience of going to the theater and protecting the buildings and protecting the American theater.
"We're not just marketers," Mr. Landesman continued. "We're also producers and custodians of a proud theatrical tradition. The Walter Kerr still sounds a lot better to me than 'the AT&T.' "
The interest has arisen since Times Square's recent transformation into a family-friendly destination as well as a wave of corporate namings of sports stadiums, bowl games, shopping centers and out-of-town theaters that left the historic Broadway houses, almost all of which have official New York City landmark status, intact. Only 42nd Street's combined and rebuilt Lyric and Apollo playhouses took on a corporate name -- the Ford Center for the Performing Arts -- when Livent Inc., opened the house with "Ragtime" in early 1998.
Money, of course, is driving the naming trend. Roundabout's deal with American provides for the airline -- represented by the marketing firm Entertainment Management Group (EMG), which has handled several musical tours and Broadway productions -- to contribute $850,000 a year to the theater over a period of 10 years. The funds will help underwrite the operations of the 35-year-old Roundabout, which has an annual budget of about $20 million. The Selwyn, which was built in 1918 by Edgar and Arch Selwyn, has been renovated at a cost of $21 million over the last two years. To date the company has raised about $17.5 million from donors including the city, board members and subscribers. It will open for use on April 11 with previews of a new production of Chekhov's "Uncle Vanya."
American's name will remain on the marquee for the duration of the partnership as well as on other materials associated with theater, including all tickets and advertising.
Todd Haimes, the artistic director of the Roundabout company, said that naming the refurbished house the American Airlines Theater seemed no different to him than naming it for an individual benefactor, as the company did when it named a theater after Laura Pels.
"I think it's wonderful that a major corporation would support the arts and want their name on our theater," Mr. Haimes said. "I don't have a philosophical problem with it."
An executive at American, which has attached its name to sports arenas in Miami and Dallas, said the naming would underscore its presence in New York, where it has begun construction on a $1.3 billion terminal at John F. Kennedy Airport. "It's one of our most important markets," said Tom Gleason, the regional vice president for American's eastern division. "We wanted to look at a different way of being part of the community."
The theater's focus on classics and musical revivals already reduces the risk of controversial content, but what happens if the Roundabout's artistic content comes into conflict with the airline's corporate agenda?
"We certainly made it completely clear that we have to have complete control over what appears on our stage," Mr. Haimes said. "And they were completely comfortable with that."
Jack Birch, a senior vice president at Octagon Marketing in Stamford, which has been working with the Shuberts, said that Gerald Schoenfeld, chairman of the Shubert organization, had been urged by his friend Mr. Gruson, a former correspondent for The New York Times, to reach out for corporate alliances.
Mr. Schoenfeld said the deal was nowhere near consummation and declined to discuss details. "This is a matter that has to be submitted to the board here," he said. "I cannot tell you anything now."
Mr. Birch said he was fairly certain that the Shubert partnership with General Motors would come to pass, though he said he suspected that the Shubert Organization would leave the names of most of its 16 theaters intact.
"I think they're going to do it," Mr. Birch said. "You never know what's going to happen, but we have met about it a few times and it's clear that the concept works."
Mr. Birch said that the theater in general offers corporations an attractive group of upscale, cultured consumers. "I think they realize that theater is a great target market and it's relatively uncluttered," Mr. Birch said of Cadillac.
Gust Kouvaris, a managing director at GM R*Works, a promotion and special events company, who has been involved in the discussions, did not return calls.
He added that the Shubert organization was a particularly attractive partner because in addition to its theaters it owns Telecharge, the telephone ticket service. "They own a lot of terrific, leverageable assets," he said.
This, Mr. Birch said, means that Shubert has a direct line to theatergoers by mail and telephone, providing a company like General Motors with easy access to potential customers. "One could ask them, 'Would you be willing to take a test drive of an automobile to get a free ticket along with one you buy?' " he said.
To some extent, these developments are a logical extension of the growing corporate presence on Broadway, which includes new producers like Disney, Cablevision and SFX Entertainment, which about a year ago renamed the Palace Theater in Chicago the Cadillac Palace. Livent, which had a short life on Broadway, led the corporate naming drive by setting up Ford Centers not only in New York but in Chicago, Vancouver and Toronto.
Even the Broadway establishment has turned increasingly to a corporate marketing. The League of American Theaters and Producers has established partnerships with as the "official airline of Broadway" and with Visa U.S.A. as the "preferred card of Broadway."
At the Minskoff theater, where "Saturday Night Fever" is playing, the Nederlanders have made a deal with Mercedes-Benz to place a car in the lobby.
"The whole issue of sponsorship is becoming an active conversation for all theater owners," said Nick Scandalios, executive vice president of the Nederlander Organization.
Mr. Scandalios said his company would nevertheless tread lightly in deciding whether to rename any of its nine theaters. "It's always a tricky thing," he said. "We certainly aren't going to look at renaming the Richard Rodgers and put a beer title over it. You have to look at the value of a name."

CORRECTION-DATE: March 3, 2000, Friday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Wednesday about renaming the Selwyn Theater for American Airlines omitted the name of another air carrier promoted as the "official airline of Broadway" in a deal with the League of American Theaters and Producers. It is Continental Airlines.
A picture caption with the article misidentified a building that is being renovated. It is the former Selwyn Office Building, not the Selwyn Theacalled the New 42nd Street Studios and will house the entrance to the theater, which is behind it.

HEADLINE: Agony of Domestic Violence at the Office

BYLINE: By ABBY ELLIN 

 BODY:
After her husband smashed the liquor bottle over her head, after the blood dried and her two young sons stopped crying, Rosa Schirripa realized the marriage was over. Although she got emotional support from her friends, she was afraid to approach the one person who might have given her the most practical help: her boss.
She said she feared that he would view her as weak or stupid for staying with her husband for so long and that he would try to get rid of her. Eventually she did talk to him and, to her surprise, he gave her a few days off, at his convenience. Before that talk, however, she felt she had nowhere to turn for advice and protection. Instead, she spent a lot of time sobbing in the office bathroom and asked her colleagues to cover for her when the divorce lawyers called. Anything so her boss would not know. 
 Ms. Schirripa, a 38-year-old New Yorker whose ordeal ended in divorce two years ago, said she knew of other people who stayed in abusive relationships because they were afraid to go to their boss. "They're afraid of the stigma," she said, "afraid that they'll be replaced."
That attitude appears to be changing, though, as more companies become aware of how domestic abuse affects workplace morale and productivity, and as more cities and states consider legislation to protect victims against discrimination.
A decade ago, only a handful of companies in the United States had formal policies to help employees deal with domestic violence, but today hundreds do, said Donna Norton, manager of the Workplace Resource Center in San Francisco.
The Philip Morris Companies, with 57,000 employees, has been active in the campaign for greater awareness of the problem, holding workshops and conferences around the country. Last spring, it joined with Liz Claiborne Inc., the American Express Company and the Bell Atlantic Corporation to sponsor Safe at Work, a coalition of companies, labor unions and government agencies that seeks to spread the word about domestic violence and its effect on the workplace.
A number of state and local governments have also taken action. Since 1998, Rhode Island and California have enacted laws prohibiting employers from terminating employees who take time off to get restraining orders against abusive partners. Similar legislation is pending in Congress.
Maine and Dade County in Florida enacted legislation last year to provide unpaid leave for domestic violence victims. Ten states, including California, Connecticut, New York and New Jersey, recently passed legislation making victims eligible for unemployment insurance if they lose their jobs. Mark Green, New York City's public advocate, says he plans to introduce a bill soon to broaden the rights of city employees in the event of domestic violence.
When it becomes known that employers cannot retaliate, "more women will come forward," Mr. Green said.
Domestic violence is probably a greater drain on productivity than most employers realize. Ten years ago, the Bureau of National Affairs, a private company that monitors workplace trends, estimated the cost of domestic violence in lost output at $3 billion to $5 billion a year. And a study commissioned by Liz Claiborne in 1994 estimated that family disputes, including domestic violence, kept a million Americans off the job every day. Last year, Victim Services, a nonprofit assistance agency in Manhattan, received 95,000 calls from women who needed help because of abusive partners.
"Many of the callers talk about issues at work, because for women that's a prime place where domestic violence happens," said Bea Hanson, a director at Victim Services. "We get calls from women who are being stalked by their boyfriend or husband at their job, or they've gotten repeat phone calls that prevent them from focusing on their work. We get calls from women whose partners come in unannounced and demand they leave. Most women don't feel safe to talk about this issue at work, so it's important for women to know they can disclose this information and not lose their job."
That sort of uncertainty once haunted Brooke McMurray. Ms. McMurray, a vice chairwoman of Victim Services, worked at Time Inc. for more than 20 years before leaving in January. She was in an abusive relationship for 12 of those years, she says, but never sought help at work. "You didn't talk about it then," said Ms. McMurray, who is 50. "The guy operating the freight elevators was the only one I told," and that was because she used the freight elevator for years when her husband used to wait in the lobby for her. Time does not have a formal domestic-violence policy, a spokesman said, but it does now have an employee-assistance program that can help victims.
Such a self-imposed wall of silence as Ms. McMurray's can come tumbling down at a company that advertises its eagerness to help people in her predicament. Janice Munson, a Philip Morris employee in upstate New York, says the company's policy helped save her sanity. Shortly after joining Philip Morris in 1990, she was divorced. Abusive calls and letters kept coming in, she says, but in the open atmosphere at Philip Morris she was able for the first time to talk to her superiors about her plight and to get help. She was encouraged to supply a description of her former husband to the security desk. She even got the mailroom to throw out letters from him so she wouldn't have to see them.
Ms. Schirripa, the woman who was hit over the head with a liquor bottle, is now a full-time administrative assistant at the College of Staten Island and is taking courses in social work there. She also makes speeches and works as needed for Mr. Green's office as an advocate for more enlightened workplace policies.
"Let the employer give the employee a chance, let her get on her own two feet," Ms. Schirripa said. Unpaid leaves are a big help, she said. Speaking for victims of violence, she added: "I'm not even asking for pay. I'll lose the money, but if I lose my job I lose my lifeline."

 CORRECTION:
An article on the Management page in Business Day on March 1 about changing attitudes in the workplace toward victims of domestic violence misstated the length of time that Brooke McMurray, a vice chairwoman of Victim Services in Manhattan, was in an abusive relationship. It was 6 years, not 12.

HEADLINE: GAME THEORY;
It's a Video Game, Certainly, but Is It Art?

BYLINE: By JULIE FLAHERTY

 BODY:
AS entertainment, it has faced its share of criticism: that it is all technological gimmickry, a useless diversion for people with nothing better to do than sit for hours in front of a screen.
A movie screen, that is. For that is how some critics described the fledgling motion picture industry at the turn of the last century. But by the 1920's, movies were being seriously discussed as an art form. And the discussion hasn't stopped. 
 Are video games, now at the quarter-century mark themselves, at the same crossroads, between developing into a widely appreciated art and remaining an amusement for a select group? Henry Jenkins, director of the comparative media studies program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, would say they are. Dr. Jenkins has spent 15 years studying the cultural and historical relationships among film, television and, more recently, digital media. At a recent conference on the future of video games he organized at M.I.T., he proposed that the time had come to discuss video games as an important art form.
Dr. Jenkins argues that this digital pastime will soon shake off its label as a diversion for adolescent boys. In 1999, according to the Interactive Digital Software Association, about 69 percent of PC gamers and 54 percent of console game users were 18 or older. Women accounted for 43 percent of PC video game players, a bigger percentage than ever before.
The industry is already recognized in terms of money. It was a $6.1 billion business last year, up from $5.5 billion the previous year and almost double what it was in 1995. According to the software association, the day is not long off when money spent on video games will be on a par with money spent on movie tickets.
For 1999, domestic box office revenues totaled $7.3 billion, while video game software sales brought in $6.2 billion.
And so, Dr. Jenkins says, it is time to give Pokemon, Super Smash Brothers and Spyro the Dragon -- three of the best-selling games of the last year -- some respect for their aesthetic and cultural value.
As a media researcher, Dr. Jenkins has only to look at his students, the first generation of adults who grew up playing video games, to see the influence of Pac-Man and Frogger. Ten years ago, most of his students wanted to direct films. "Right now, he said, "more of them are interested in being game designers than movie makers." They discuss game strategy "the way a decade ago students were talking about David Lynch or Peter Greenaway."
But many things need to happen before video games reach the same artistic level of movies, Dr. Jenkins said. Like video games, many of the first movies revolved around action -- car chases, pratfalls and pies in the face. But cinema quickly "developed a sense of the richness of its own formula," Dr. Jenkins said, something the digital medium is still struggling with. Human emotion, for example, is still limited in games to expressions like the grunt of the football player who fumbles or the yelp of joy of a warrior who captures the enemy flag.
"I rarely play a video game that makes me cry," Dr. Jenkins said.
Other aesthetic improvements might be easier to achieve. Music, which is now used as little more than background noise in games, will be used to provide tension, much as it does in movies. When a group of Dr. Jenkins's students presented a 30-minute montage of video game clips at the conference, it felt a lot like a movie trailer, complete with operatic soundtrack.
Perhaps the measure of whether video games have come of age is how deeply they have embedded themselves in our culture. The students presented game clips that traced the evolution of video games through games that included Pong and Myst. The clips began with the plain text "you are standing in an open field west of a white house," the opening line of the Zork I text adventure game, circa 1981. The phrase elicited the same nostalgic murmuring from the audience that the words "a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away" would from film enthusiasts.
The grip that video games and their characters have on their fans mirrors the way movies and their stars mesmerize their audiences. Just as Clara Bow was proclaimed the first silver screen star to have "it," or sex appeal, Tomb Raider's Lara Croft is the "it" girl of the digital age.
But where are the German Expressionists of the game world? And the Charlie Chaplins? And can game creators overcome the inherent repetition in their work, perhaps through advances in artificial intelligence?
Dr. Jenkins talks about creating a critical vocabulary to discuss these questions. Right now, the only term he sees in that lexicon is "violence," a word that was often linked to video games in the wake of the Columbine High School shootings.
"It is the predominant story out there today about this form, whether or not this game or that game is violent," said Dr. Jenkins, one of the few defenders of video games at a hearing on Capitol Hill last spring. "There is a huge universe of important questions that need to be addressed about this medium precisely because of its economic importance, its cultural importance, its social importance. If the only articles ever written about cinema were 'all movies are violent,' we would think the critics, the journalists, had missed something that was vital about the emergence of that form."
Dr. Jenkins's point is that sociologists might find more to study in video games than a possible link to aggressive behavior. Geoffrey Goldstein, a psychology professor at the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands who has studied video games, said at the conference that video play was not a sport for loners because even if people don't play together, they discuss playing with friends. It turns out to be not just a phenomenon among competitive little boys, Dr. Goldstein said. In a study in which he asked women in a nursing home to play video games, he soon found them bragging about their Tetris scores every day over lunch.
Maybe it will be the grandmothers who pull gaming into the circle of social respectability and push newspapers to review games alongside films and television shows on their culture pages. Without some helping hand, the games could just as easily go the way of comic books, which came of age in the 1920's. They are another popular entertainment, but they have never expanded their niche market much beyond the backs of adolescent boys' closets.

Banks Ease Pain of Handyman Specials

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON

 BODY:
ONE family bought a $2.25 million five-story brownstone on the Upper West Side -- and then had to find $800,000 more to fix it up.
Another family closed on a $632,500 colonial-style wreck in Scarsdale, N.Y., and then had to figure out how to borrow $200,000 to make it livable. 
 A couple with three children wanted to move to a bigger house but couldn't find anything they thought was a good investment, so they decided to put a $200,000 addition onto the house they already owned. The traditional solution -- refinancing the house -- would have been a disaster at today's higher interest rates.
Until recently, all these would-be renovators would have been in a heap of trouble.
For the first time in bankers' and mortgage brokers' memories, some banks in the Northeast are writing separate mortgages based not on the current value of the property but on its future value. That is, the loans are based on the enhanced value of the property when the renovations are done. And banks are writing them as second mortgages, even if another bank holds the first mortgage.
"We're frankly looking for the business," said Douglas Bowman, vice president of wholesale lending at Webster Bank. Mr. Bowman said his bank decided this week to start advertising the new second mortgages for renovations, which it has quietly been writing for at least a year. Several other banks are writing the loans, although they are not advertising the practice, said Melissa Cohn, president of the Manhattan Mortgage Company, one of New York State's largest mortgage brokers.
Because of the rise in rates, banks have been dreaming up new ways to entice customers, who are now paying more than a percentage point above what they might have been paying just a year ago. The construction second mortgages are just the banks' latest trick.
But beware: there is a price for separating out the renovation segment. The interest on the special second mortgages averages about half a point higher than on normal purchase mortgages.
Even so, Ms. Cohn said, they are rising in popularity. "I would say I'm writing five times the number of these loans as I did last year," she said. "As people are discovering them, they're becoming more prevalent."
It's not only that homeowners and buyers are discovering them. It's that they're needing them.
With the prices of apartments and houses so high -- and no relief in sight -- many homebuyers are looking at wrecks in fancy neighborhoods. Although places needing T.L.C. no longer offer the huge savings of a decade ago, the savings may be enough to let buyers move into a neighborhood they can't otherwise afford. Or to add an extra bedroom.
Until a year or so ago, banks would not have written two different loans for someone to buy and to improve a property.
The homeowner trying to add on may be even more grateful for the new loan. Until recently, somebody trying to find the money for an addition would have been forced to take out a home improvement or home equity loan, or to refinance the whole house.
But refinancing works only if the value of the house has increased substantially since it was bought. For example, if a couple took a 30-year, $200,000 mortgage to buy a house four years ago, they might be paying 6 or 7 percent interest. But if they wanted to put on a $75,000 addition, they would have an unpleasant surprise: they might have to take out a new mortgage -- at 8 5/8 percent, the going rate.
But under the new loan programs, the rate of 8 5/8 percent plus half a point would apply only on the $75,000, saving them close to $200 a month.
The new second mortgages are different from home equity loans in two important respects. First, the home equity loan is based on the current value of the home. And second, the Internal Revenue Service lets you deduct the interest only on the first $100,000 of a home equity loan. With the new renovation loans at Webster, Mr. Bowman said, you can borrow up to $450,000, and because it's a mortgage, the interest is usually fully deductible.
Home improvement loans have disadvantages, too. First, they are smaller: most lenders limit them to $25,000. Second, they are similar to installment loans, lasting no more than 10 or 15 years. And last, they cost more: 10 to 11 percent, these days.
Naturally, when you apply for the new kind of second mortgage, the banks won't take your word for what your property will be worth after the work is finished. They use appraisers trained in estimating the future value of the property, based on your plans. And needless to say, you'll pay for the appraisals, which cost $225 at Webster. But you would have to get a new appraisal if you refinanced, too.
And as with any construction loan, the bank will monitor your construction -- very carefully. In fact, as the job progresses, it will probably dole the payments out to the general contractor.
So you might have to kiss your trip to the Riviera goodbye.

From 'Elektra' to Electric, Throngs Come Out in Sydney

BYLINE: By John Shaw

DATELINE: SYDNEY, Australia, March 1

 BODY:
This city's summer festival season opened to the conventional crescendos of grand opera and will close on Saturday with a three-hour gay and lesbian parade.
After two weeks of performances by Vladimir Ashkenazy, Philip Glass, the Netherlands Dance Theater, the Royal Court Theater and 30 other mainstream performers, the city's gays have taken over with a three-week Mardi Gras, a collection of 130 diverse events including body piercing and concerts by performers in drag. 
 That prompted the city's Anglican and Roman Catholic archbishops to issue a joint statement last week denouncing the celebration as "an exercise in gross exhibitionism that promotes a homosexual lifestyle and does not merit our presence or support."
The president of the Madri Gras, David McLachlan, replied that he was raised as a Catholic and that for him "it was sad to see how out of touch these church leaders are in helping people deal with their sexuality."
For the mainstream Sydney Festival, which ended on Jan. 31, about 130,000 tickets were sold, bringing in $2 million, and a million or more other spectators attended free concerts and exhibits. A light show bathed the sail-shaped roof of the Sydney Opera House with kaleidoscopic colors each night.
The Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras, which has a budget of about $3 million, has brought in some $750,000 in theater and party tickets, and about 250,000 people attended free events, said its general manager, Mark Goggin.
About 600,000 spectators are expected to line the two-mile downtown route to watch the 200 floats and 6,000 costumed participants in the festival's finale on Saturday. Television and Internet rights to the parade, including live and recorded coverage, have been sold in Australia, the United States and Europe for a total of $350,000.
Sydney is bursting with crowd-attracting festivities this year. The Summer Olympics, which start here on Sept. 15, will have their own cultural festival.
During the Sydney Festival the Berlin State Opera's high-energy production of Richard Strauss's "Elektra" filled a 2,000-seat theater at premium prices, said the festival's director, Leo Schofield. The Netherlands Dance Theater was another box-office success, and the London production of "The Weir" by the Irish writer Conor McPherson was sold out.
Three local plays gave the festival some Australian flavor. In "Small Poppies" Geoffrey Rush depicted a 5-year-old's first day at school. Six untitled sketches presented by Daniel Keene and Arielle Taylor recalled the Beckett style, with bleak urban tales played in half-light. "The Sunshine Club" was a feel-good musical about interracial dating and dancing in the 1940's.
Mr. Schofield said Sydney's January season of music and drama, which he has directed for three years, was similar in some ways to the Lincoln Center Festival. An added attraction is this city's 25-year tradition of free evening concertsin the Domain, a 100-acre downtown park ringed with giant fig trees. About 80,000 people turned out with hampers and wine for an 11-group night of jazz; a Sydney Symphony Orchestra program of undemanding favorites, including the "Tannhauser" and "1812" Overtures, attracted about 140,000 under a full moon.
Perhaps the major event of the Sydney Festival was an exhibition of 242 drawings of the human figure, "Michelangelo to Matisse," which was held over through Tuesday so more people could view it.
The city's Mardi Gras has evolved from a kind of civil rights march to an Australian institution that bills itself as the world's largest gay carnival. This year's program emphasizes spectacle and sponsors more than it does slogans, although social concerns underlie the frills and frivolity.
Critics of Mardi Gras, including the Council of Churches, oppose the increasing involvement of public institutions like Sydney's main museum. The museum has organized an exhibition of body art that is considered the festival's most controversial event.
Some activists regard the criticism as a remnant of intolerance. Tony Knight, a longtime Mardi Gras participant who supervises the acting program at the National Institute of Dramatic Art, said: "Mardi Gras has become an institution, but it remains a political statement. Rights have been won, but there is no cause for complacency. Prejudice still exists."
The glossy 140-page Mardi Gras catalog, paid for by sponsors in the travel, media and liquor businesses, lists camp comedy, feminist concerts, "queer culture, soft-porn exhibitionism, artful bad taste," social satire, sidewalk painting and plays with messages from the gay world's frontiers.
The 5,000 Americans visiting Sydney for the festival will see some familiar acts, among them New Yorkers like Lypsinka, the drag diva, and Patty Chang, a performance artist, as well as Randall Wong, a male soprano from San Francisco.
All this, taken in laconic stride, seems remote from the Sydney of 1978, when homosexuality was illegal here (with penalties ranging to 14 years in prison). Demanding changes in the law, about 1,000 gay Sydney men staged a a street demonstration that year. Police officers arrested 53 of the marchers, but the courts dismissed the charges. The protest developed into an annual rally in a campaign that led to decriminalization of homosexuality in 1984.
Sydney, a multilingual melting pot of immigrant cultures, is now considered a notably tolerant city. "Inclusivity through diversity" is the buzz phrase here and the theme chosen this year by the Mardi Gras artistic director, Jonathan Parsons.
Still, acceptance of Mardi Gras is far from unanimous. Australia's prime minister, John Howard, declined to issue a message of support for the celebration. But Sydney politicians praise the carnival for contributing to acceptance and harmony, not to mention generating about $60 million for the city's economy this year.

Technology Shares Produce Modest Gain for Blue Chips

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Soaring telecommunications and technology stocks pushed the Nasdaq composite index further into record territory yesterday and helped the Dow Jones industrials eke out a modest gain.
The technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index rose 87.39 points, to 4,784.08, topping the closing record of 4,696.69 it set Tuesday. 
 The Dow Jones industrials added 9.62 points, to 10,137.93. The blue-chip Dow index has risen in three consecutive sessions -- the first such performance since Jan. 12 to 14. But yesterday's slim advance came after the Dow spent much of the session in negative territory.
Broader stock indicators were mostly higher. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 12.77 points, to 1,379.19.
After two days of relatively broad gains on Wall Street, the market reverted to its familiar divergent pattern, with technology stocks leaping higher while old-line industrial stocks slid.
Lucent Technologies rose sharply on the New York Stock Exchange after announcing plans to spin off the units that sell corporate phone systems and make wire cabling for office networks. Analysts said the spinoff would allow Lucent to focus on its fast-growing fiber optics and Internet equipment businesses.
On the Nasdaq, 3Com and Sun Microsystems rose, as did biotechnology companies, including Chiron.
Technology stocks gave the Dow its only real spark. SBC Communications rose on rumors the company would combine its wireless phone operations with those of BellSouth. That would allow the companies to compete with rivals with nationwide wireless networks. BellSouth also rose on the Big Board.
"These companies are going to be real players in the new economy, which depends on technology," said Barry Hyman, senior equity analyst at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum in New York. "People are willing to pay up for tech stocks because that's where the growth is."
Apart from SBC, most Dow components were lower as investors remained wary of the prospects of blue-chip companies in an environment of rising interest rates. Home Depot and Merck fell.
The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates four times since June, hoping to slow economic growth enough to stave off inflation. After the chairman of the Fed, Alan Greenspan, suggested last month that central bankers remained poised to raise rates further, investors found little reason to buy blue chips, analysts said.
"His hawkish interest rate comments have folks running from stocks that borrow a lot of money and are heavily affected by overall economic activity," said Alfred E. Goldman, chief market strategist at A. G. Edwards & Sons Inc. "This depression among the old-economy stocks has caused the manic buying of the new-economy stocks."

Europe Plans to Collect Tax on Some Internet Transactions

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, March 1

 BODY:
Testing the ability to enforce national tax laws in cyberspace, the European Commission is planning to collect sales taxes on music and software delivered over the World Wide Web.
Though not yet complete, the proposals would eliminate what European officials view as a big loophole that benefits American companies. 
 Some of those American companies have already begun to complain that they would be saddled with onerous responsibilities that could stifle electronic commerce in Europe.
But the debate has also exposed practical difficulties in adapting national taxes to a world in which music and art fly across borders.
Under proposals developed by the European Commission in Brussels, companies would have to collect what is known as a value-added tax, a type of sales tax, on products they sell and distribute over the Internet.
At issue are products like computer software, music and videos that can be turned into digital code and downloaded by customers anywhere.
Value-added taxes are a major source of revenue for most European governments, and tax rates vary by country from about 12 percent to more than 20 percent.
When it comes to physical goods, like books or clothes, the taxes have been collected by stores and mail-order companies or by customs officials if the products were to be shipped across national boundaries.
In those transactions, the tax rate is based on the rate of the country where the product originated.
But "virtual" products defy that system, because they can be sent just as easily from the United States or an off-shore tax haven like the Cayman Islands as they can from a local store in France.
European officials say that this gives American software companies an unfair advantage over European competitors. They are also worried that online vendors of all types will shift growing volumes of sales from sources outside the European system for tax collection.
Under proposals that officials are debating in Brussels, products sold in digital form would be taxed based on the rate in the customer's country, meaning that companies operating in the United States would have to collect the taxes on all sales to European customers.
"Without any changes, American companies would unquestionably have an unfair advantage," said Oliver Sume, a director of the Electronic Commerce Forum, an industry association in Cologne, Germany.
"This is a step in the right direction, toward a global framework for electronic commerce."
But American companies say efforts to extend the existing tax system will prove extremely complicated and prove unenforceable anyhow.
"This is an area that is still developing, and Europeans should not rush in to develop a solution right away," said Howard Liebman, a lawyer who heads up a working group on tax issues at the American Chamber of Commerce in Belgium.
Among other things, Mr. Liebman said, companies would have to determine where a customer actually lives, distinguish between 15 tax regimes and differentiate between private individuals and companies, because the two types of customers are treated differently for tax purposes.
To make things easier for businesses, some European officials have suggested requiring companies to register for business in one European country and turn their tax receipts over to that country.
But that idea is opposed by many European financial ministers, because it raises difficulties of distributing the tax money back to the correct countries.
Experts on both sides of the Atlantic warn that an overly demanding system could backfire, because many companies will simply ignore the tax rules altogether and run their Internet sales operations from offshore tax havens.
"There may be requirements, but this is still a system based on voluntary compliance," said Volker Kebish, a senior researcher on tax law at the University of Munster in Germany, who is part of an advisory group to the European Commission. "Increasing the complexity could discourage businesses outside the European Union from complying."
I.B.M. is lobbying against the tough new proposals. Smaller dot-com companies are worried as well.
"Everyone says that to grow e-commerce they need to increase market access, but I fear that this would be an impediment to market access," said Peter Harter, a vice president at EMusic.com Inc. of Redwood City, Calif., which sells music over the Internet and owns 20 percent of Crunch.com, a British music distributor. "It would be very invasive for us to track down where all our customers are."

HEADLINE: In Congress, Scorn for U.S. Oil Diplomacy

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 1

 BODY:
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson faced sharp questions today over the high price of oil products as legislators heaped scorn on his cautious forecast that oil-exporting countries would increase production later this month and reverse a steep yearlong climb in fuel costs.
Testifying before the House International Relations Committee, Mr. Richardson rejected calls from lawmakers to draw down emergency government oil reserves, a move that advocates say would lower prices. He said, however, as President Clinton did on Tuesday, that that option was still "on the table." 
 With the price of oil nearly tripled, to $31.77 a barrel in the last year, and with drivers facing $2-a-gallon prices at the gasoline pump this summer, the administration is under increasing pressure to dip into the 600 million barrel Strategic Petroleum Reserve in Louisiana and Texas.
But Mr. Richardson repeatedly urged patience while talks continued with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other important producers like Mexico.
"We've got to be prudent and not overreact," he said, pointing out that the emergency stocks were meant to be used only when national fuel supplies were disrupted.
"I'm guardedly optimistic that OPEC will increase production when it meets on March 27," Mr. Richardson said, noting that the Mexican oil minister said today in Paris that he favored a production increase.
OPEC is considering increases of 1.2 million to 3.1 million barrels a day, an about-face from production cuts of 4.3 million a day that began in 1998 after the financial collapse in Asia. The cartel now produces about 26 million barrels a day, or 35 percent of the world's oil production.
But lawmakers, mainly from the Northeast, Midwest and California, dismissed the encouraging statements that Mr. Richardson had elicited in talks with oil officials from Kuwait, Mexico, Norway, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela on a weeklong trip.
"Bill, you came back with nothing," said Representative Donald Manzullo, an Illinois Republican. "You got no promises."
"Congressman, I came back with quite a bit," Mr. Richardson, a former Democratic representative from New Mexico, replied. "Thirty days ago, OPEC was saying its production cuts would continue. Now, key members are saying they'll consider increases."
Even if OPEC votes to raise output at its March meeting, the big questions are when and by how much. Typically, it takes six weeks for production in the Middle East to pass through refineries and reach local gas stations. "We're running out of time," said Representative Bill Delahunt, a Massachusetts Democrat.
Several Democrats and Republicans expressed frustration that Mr. Richardson apparently did not use at least the threat of tapping the strategic reserves to wring concessions from oil producers.
"Why on God's green earth didn't you add to your leverage by opening that spigot?" demanded Representative Sam Gejdenson of Connecticut, the panel's ranking Democrat.
"Because using the Strategic Petroleum Reserve means intervening and manipulating the market," responded Mr. Richardson, who said earlier that the negotiations were meant to "convince, not coerce."
"What makes sense," he said, "is to let the results of our energy diplomacy work."
Mr. Gejdenson retorted: "This isn't the marketplace at work. This is OPEC flexing its muscle."
Some lawmakers, like Representative Dana Rohrabacher, a California Republican, criticized Kuwait and Saudi Arabia for cutting back output and driving up prices at a time when United States forces are protecting those countries.
"How can we keep troops in these countries when they're part of an international price-fixing conspiracy to shaft the people of the United States?" Mr. Rohrabacher said.
Representative Benjamin A. Gilman, a New York Republican who heads the committee, announced that he would introduce legislation this week that would require the president to cut off arms sales and other United States aid to any oil-producing country that was engaged in price-fixing.
As he fended off verbal volleys from the legislators, Mr. Richardson underscored efforts that the administration took in recent weeks to soften the blow of the soaring fuel costs.
Last month, for instance, President Clinton said he would order that the remaining $125 million in a low-income home energy assistance program be made immediately available. That is on top of $200 million already released. Mr. Clinton said he would ask Congress for $600 million in additional emergency funds for states hardest hit by the winter cold.

HEADLINE: Notes From 1994 Show Fed's Inner Workings

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 1

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve began its last big round of interest rate increases, in 1994, without any clear sense of how strong the economy was, how many rate increases would be needed or how the stock and bond markets would react, according to transcripts released today of the central bank's policy meetings for that year.
The transcripts show the sway held over the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee by the central bank's chairman, Alan Greenspan, and reveal how concerned Mr. Greenspan was even then with the possibility that stock prices were becoming out of hand. 
 After five years in which the Fed had cut rates and then held them at low levels to nurse the economy through a downturn, Mr. Greenspan recommended a quarter-point increase in the benchmark federal funds target rate in February 1994, to 3.25 percent, to forestall the threat that a recent surge in growth would generate inflation.
He immediately came under pressure from interest rate "hawks" to approve a half-point rate increase. But Mr. Greenspan pressed the committee to go along with him, warning about the perils of a split within the Fed and saying too big a move would destabilize the financial markets.
In the end, the committee voted unanimously to raise rates by a quarter-point, as Mr. Greenspan wanted. It went on to raise rates six more times in the next year, doubling the federal funds rate to 6 percent.
Even then, nearly three years before Mr. Greenspan began worrying publicly about "irrational exuberance" in the stock market, the Fed chairman was clearly concerned that investors were creating a bubble in stock prices.
Indeed, when both the stock and bond markets fell sharply after the February rate increase, Mr. Greenspan said the Fed had "partially broke the back of an emerging speculation in equities."

HEADLINE: Auto Sales in February Near Monthly Record

BYLINE: By MICHELLE KREBS

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 1

 BODY:
The United States auto industry is poised to have its second-best month for sales ever after the General Motors Corporation, the Ford Motor Company and DaimlerChrysler A.G. reported higher vehicle sales for February today.
The seasonally adjusted annual selling rate is expected to be about 19 million cars and light trucks when the few remaining companies report sales on Thursday. That would put February sales in second place after September 1986, when the rate was 21.2 million vehicles. 
 Every automaker that reported February sales today posted an increase, and most set February records. A half-dozen companies, including BMW and the smaller Asian carmakers, are scheduled to report sales Thursday.
G.M. had its best February since 1988, with vehicle sales totaling 467,010 cars and light trucks, up 16.1 percent, compared with results in the month a year earlier. Trucks led the way, rising 20.9 percent, to 223,503 units. Car sales increased 12.1 percent, to 243,507 vehicles. G.M.'s sales were lifted partly by a $500 loyalty coupon offered to current owners on the purchase of a new vehicle. The coupon expired on Tuesday and will not be extended.
Ford reported it sold 348,510 cars and light trucks, an increase of 3.9 percent from the month a year earlier. Car sales increased to 4.6 percent, to 146,074 vehicles. Truck sales climbed 3.3 percent, to 202,436.
DaimlerChrysler said it sold 250,230 cars and light trucks in February, an increase of 5.5 percent compared with sales in the month a year earlier. The automaker sold 168,813 light trucks, up 9 percent. Car sales fell 1.1 percent, to 81,417 units, because of decreases in the sales of the Chrysler group cars. Mercedes-Benz car sales increased.
Likewise, Toyota Motor, Honda Motor and Mitsubishi Motors set February sales records. Volkswagen had its best February since 1975. Nissan Motor, Subaru and Isuzu Motors also reported higher sales.
Auto analysts pointed to the strong economy and increasing consumer wealth as factors keeping vehicle sales humming in early 2000 after a record-setting 1999.
At a news conference, Paul Ballew, G.M.'s general director of market and industry analysis, also attributed higher sales to the affordability of vehicles. Intense competitive pressures have prevented price increases and have led manufacturers to offer attractive incentives, including cash rebates and low-interest loans.
Gas prices, which hit record levels during the month, and climbing interest rates appeared to have no effect on vehicle sales. Sales of vehicles like full-size pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles that use gas heavily as well as luxury automobiles, were brisk during the month. Ford's F-Series pickup trucks and its sport utility vehicles had their best February in history. G.M. broke records in every truck segment, including pickups, sport utility vehicles and vans.
Forecasters expect the pace of vehicle sales to slow somewhat from February's scorching rate. Still, they predict the final tally for 2000 car and truck sales to rival the 1999 record of nearly 17 million vehicles.

HEADLINE: 2 New Signs Of Hot Pace In Economy

BYLINE: Bloomberg News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 1

 BODY:
The nation's factories stepped up production in February and construction spending on homes and highways surged as an economy entering its record 108th month of expansion showed little sign of cooling, according to reports issued today.
"The economy's a hot house," said Tim O'Neill, chief economist with the Bank of Montreal and Harris Bank in Toronto. Federal Reserve policy makers will meet on March 21 and are widely expected to raise interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point. 
 The National Association of Purchasing Management said today that its factory index rose to 56.9 in February from a January reading of 56.3, where analysts had expected it to remain. An index on prices paid by factories for materials like plastics jumped to a five-year high of 74.1, pressuring companies to charge consumers more.
A reading higher than 50 on the factory index means that most companies surveyed reported improved business. The index has been at 50 or higher for 13 months. Economic growth overseas has helped fuel already strong demand.
In another report, the Commerce Department said that construction spending rose 2.7 percent in January after increasing 2.1 percent in December. The gain in January was paced by work on houses and apartments and an 11.4 percent surge in road building. The increase in overall spending was the largest since June 1998.
The factory report showed companies were feeling the pinch of rising costs for energy and materials. The rise in the index of prices paid, to 74.1 in February from 72.6 in January, indicates that more companies reported price increases during the month. The January index was the highest since a 74.5 reading in April 1995.
Though productivity gains and competition have eased the impact, some companies have begun to pass along cost increases. Goodyear Tire and Rubber, the world's largest tire manufacturer, said early last month that it would raise prices this year because it is paying more for materials like rubber and oil.
The Commerce Department said spending on construction of houses, town houses and apartments rose 2.5 percent in January after a 1.3 percent increase the month before. "This underscores the risk that higher interest rates are not generating the needed response from the economy's most interest-rate sensitive sector -- housing," said Hai Hoang, an economist at Banc of America Securities in San Francisco.
Nonresidential commercial projects rose 3.2 percent, the biggest rise since a 3.9 percent increase in June 1998. Spending on publicly financed construction rose 3.2 percent.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
Supply Is Low As Gas and Oil Prices Increase

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
THE price of crude oil jumped 4 percent yesterday, to more than $31 a barrel, and gasoline prices leaped 6 percent. What is more, inventories of both are so low that a moderate increase in output from major crude oil producers would provide only a little price relief.
If crude oil prices stay over $30 a barrel, the Clinton administration might finally pump some out of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, as members of Congress are urging. Though that would not bring immediate relief for drivers, who are paying 53 percent more at the gasoline pump than they were last year, it might send an unmistakable signal to major oil producers that they have strained the patience of the United States. 
 Energy Secretary Bill Richardson opposed such a move yesterday, saying at a Congressional hearing that it would be unwise to tap the petroleum reserve while major oil producers were still discussing production increases ahead of a March 27 meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Still, he warned that the world is consuming about two million barrels more a day than it is producing. "We cannot sustain this imbalance between supply and demand without risking serious repercussions for the world economy," he said.
Two wisps of bad news about petroleum supplies helped push up prices yesterday. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for April delivery rose $1.34, to $31.77 a barrel, while the April gasoline futures contract jumped 5.80 cents, to 99.38 cents a gallon. It was the highest price for crude oil since January 1991, at the time of the Persian Gulf war, and the highest for gasoline futures since October 1990.
The first problem came in the form of fresh reports from the American Petroleum Institute and the government's Energy Information Administration that showed declines in gasoline inventories, which are now down 15 percent in the last year by the petroleum institute's estimate. The institute also reported that crude inventories had fallen, while the energy administration's report showed a slight increase. But both reports show crude inventories down 12 percent to 13 percent from a year earlier.
The second piece of bad news was a denial of reports that Venezuela and Saudi Arabia, two leading producers in OPEC, had agreed with Mexico, a major producer not in OPEC, to raise crude oil output.
Early in the day, several news services reported that the three countries had agreed to propose a production increase effective April 1. The amount of the increase ranged from 1 million to 1.4 million barrels a day in the reports. But later in the day, a Venezuelan oil official said there was no such agreement.
Such talk of increases in crude oil production has come and gone for weeks. In fact, the Mexican energy minister issued a statement yesterday saying that Mexico and Norway, another non-OPEC producer, thought that a production increase should be discussed. He gave no indication of the size of any increase.
But analysts and government officials say they expect major producers to start pumping more oil soon. Mr. Richardson, who has just returned from lobbying for more oil in Kuwait, Mexico, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, said, "I believe the odds are good for production increases to take place."
Michael Rothman, the senior energy analyst at Merrill Lynch, said that he also expected an increase but that OPEC ministers "will keep their cards close to their vests to the last moment" before their meeting on March 27.
Despite these expectations of increased production, crude oil and gasoline prices are moving higher. That is because a million or so more barrels a day will not be enough to rebuild global inventories to a comfortable level. At the end of last year, Mr. Rothman said, inventories of crude oil and products for the 29 countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development had fallen to 2.53 billion barrels, a level that he said was 99 million barrels below normal.
Oil production would have to increase more than 10 percent to ease the price pressure, he said. That would mean an increase in daily production of crude oil of 1.7 million barrels, effective in April, followed by an increase of 1.5 million barrels after OPEC oil ministers meet again in September.
Oil traders, Mr. Rothman said, "see the impending squeeze that is already there."
The euro did something unusual yesterday. It rallied against the dollar, rising to 97.48 cents from 96.55 cents on Tuesday.
But it is not clear if the euro has reached the bottom of a 14-month month slide that has erased 16.4 percent of its value. And it is getting harder and harder to explain.
Nicholas P. Sargen, the global market strategist for private clients of J. P. Morgan, says one would have expected the euro to rally this year. After all, European economies are finally turning around, and their stock markets are outperforming the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
He suspects that one reason for the decline is that the 11 nations behind the euro, which was introduced in January 1999, have no one person to speak for the currency. Usually, a country's finance minister does the job. But 11 finance ministers cannot speak together, and they often contradict each other.
So, traders have been looking to Wim Duisenberg, the president of the European Central Bank, as the substitute. Mr. Duisenberg, who has also sent some mixed signals, could show that someone cared about the beleaguered euro, Mr. Sargen says. How? The central bank could raise its interest rate target at its meeting today.

HEADLINE: Despite Criticism, Giuliani Pursues Ballparks as Economic Catalysts

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
In Coney Island, the steel skeleton of the Parachute Jump stands like a 250-foot-tall grave marker to bygone glory. On Staten Island, a muddy parking lot sits at the water's edge next to the dilapidated St. George ferry terminal.
In each place, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani wants to build a publicly financed minor league baseball stadium: a $31 million ballpark in Brooklyn for the Mets and a $71 million complex on Staten Island for the Yankees. 
 With a combined 72-game home schedule each season, the mayor says, the stadiums would revive these faded or rundown neighborhoods with relatively inexpensive family entertainment and draw newcomers to the area.
The two stadiums would stand as the Giuliani administration's most visible effort to generate economic development in the boroughs outside Manhattan.
Yesterday, even as city officials continued to negotiate the terms of a lease with the Mets, the City Planning Commission approved zoning changes for the Coney Island stadium, on a grassy field bound by Surf Avenue and the Coney Island Boardwalk, between West 16th and West 20th Streets. The proposal will now go to the City Council for a final vote.
The Staten Island proposal already has Council approval. Both projects, however, have provoked criticism from economists and urban planners who reject the notion that the sports teams would spawn new business, especially ones that play fewer than 40 games each during a three-month season, and in the case of the Mets, battle with community groups.
Economists said that the mayor's $112 million initiative, which includes spending more than $10 million on temporary ballparks to house the teams, was expensive and unlikely to produce new private investments in Coney Island or on Staten Island.
The city, they said, would be far better off creating back-office space on the waterfront in Brooklyn and Queens to stem the loss of companies to Jersey City, or industrial parks for technology companies at the old Navy base on Staten Island or on Governors Island.
"Baseball stadiums don't really have much of an economic impact," said Ronnie Lowenstein, chief economist for the city's Independent Budget Office. "Some restaurants or retail stores may shift around, but they generally don't lead to the creation of new hotels, office towers or what any of us would think of as economic development."
But the Giuliani administration contends that a Coney Island stadium, like the one on Staten Island, could be a boon to the community, both as a magnet for new visitors and projects and as a resource for high school and college baseball teams, concerts and fairs.
Coney Island could again be a recreational mecca, city officials said, much as it was in the 1940's, before it succumbed to urban redevelopment and competition from Jones Beach. "Coney Island is an underutilized asset that greatly needs a shot in the arm," said Michael G. Carey, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation. "The stadium could serve as a catalyst for further economic development along the Boardwalk. It could be the precursor to a lot of private development."
The minor league stadium initiative sprang not from the mayor's economic advisers, from a public cry for more baseball or from demands by the teams themselves.
"It's an initiative the mayor seized upon," Mr. Carey said. "The mayor sees it as a way to extend the benefits of baseball to Coney Island. The Mets see it as an opportunity to expand their fan base."
Cities and towns eager to capture a professional sports team almost always grant generous terms, but most economists contend that the sports deals generally provide a meager return for such a large subsidy from taxpayers in a project that will have limited use.
In New York, Mayor Giuliani has proposed building new stadiums for the Yankees, the Mets and possibly the Jets football team, as well as the minor league stadiums.
The minor league stadium for the Mets still faces a potential lawsuit from residents who live next to St. John's University in Queens, where the city wants to build a temporary ballpark, and opposition in Coney Island, where some residents fear that the mayor's proposed stadium would displace a long-planned amateur sports complex.
In recent days, the administration has worked on a compromise that it hopes will sidestep opposition from the Brooklyn borough president, Howard Golden.
Under the terms of a tentative deal with the Mets, which does not require City Council approval, the Mets would pay a modest rent and control the 6,500 seat stadium year-round. The city would have the right to hold at least 20 public events at the stadium, but the Mets, like the Staten Island Yankees, would get all the ticket and parking revenue, half the advertising revenue and 70 percent of the revenue from events booked into the stadium during the nine months of the year the team would not play there. The two sides are negotiating the split on concessions.
The city has said that non-baseball events would also attract new visitors and generate tax revenue and new businesses on Surf Avenue, where flea markets, the Cyclone roller coaster and a dwindling number of other rides are all that remain of the once-bustling amusement district.
"This will be an asset the city, and the Mets will seek to generate as much activity as possible," Mr. Carey said.
Minor league ballparks have drawn new fans because of their small, intimate settings and the ability of young fans to talk to players between innings. According to the city's environmental impact statement, the Mets' ball club would draw a total of 210,000 fans to 38 games, an ambitious goal that would establish the club as the most popular of the 40 teams in the short-season Class A league. (Last year, the Staten Island Yankees drew 120,954 playing at the College of Staten Island.)
The team would pay $350,000 in rent and create the equivalent of 57 full-time jobs.
The city estimates that each fan would spend about $18.71, including the price of admission, at a game, and less than half that outside the stadium. Most fans, however, would come from among the half-million people who already head to the Coney Island beach on summer weekends.
"The incremental impact is probably so small it doesn't make any difference," said Robert A. Baade, an economist at Lake Forest College in Illinois who is an expert in sports franchises. "We're talking about a neighborhood team. I doubt very much that with all the entertainment options in New York, you'll see people traveling from other boroughs to see a minor league team.
"Rather than utilizing fewer facilities more often, you're building more facilities and using them less often. It's the opposite of sound economics."
In what is the city's best deal with professional sports, the United States Tennis Association built a $234 million stadium and 15 new tennis courts, albeit with $150 million in tax-exempt bonds, at Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in Queens.
The complex, which is open to the public 300 days a year, paid $6.4 million in rent and fees to city over 10 years ending in 1998, the last year for which figures are available. But at Yankee Stadium, the team controls the ballpark, where the city did a $120 million renovation in the 1970's, and paid a net rent of $5.4 million in the same period, under a lease that allows the team to deduct maintenance costs from the rent.
There is little question that the waterfront in Coney Island could use Mr. Carey's shot in the arm. And Mayor Giuliani has gone to great lengths to put a minor league club there. First he had to forge a peace treaty between the Yankees and the Mets, so that neither side used its territorial rights against the other, as when the Yankees prevented the Mets from putting a team on Long Island.
Despite a $71 million price tag, the plan to build the most expensive minor league stadium in the country on Staten Island provoked little public opposition. But the Coney Island plan collided with a 15-year effort to build an amateur sports complex on the same site, the former Steeplechase amusement park.
The local community board and Mr. Golden, the borough president, complained that Brooklyn deserved both the sports complex and a higher-caliber minor league team, which would play more games and have a greater economic impact. Mr. Golden, who has questioned the mayor's decision to deal exclusively with the Mets and the Yankees, said that two independent minor leagues, which play more than 70 home games a season, have expressed interest in Brooklyn.
"The mayor's proposal not only jeopardizes the sportsplex," Mr. Golden said, "but it doesn't provide the greatest economic benefit for Brooklyn and the city."
But in the tangled web of Brooklyn politics, Janis Leibowitz, co-chairwoman of a Coney Island civic group, said her organization favored the stadium, whose use would be consistent with the seasonal nature of Coney Island amusements, over the complex, which, she said, would draw too many people to the area.
Mr. Golden blocked the Giuliani administration from building a temporary ballpark for the Mets at the parade grounds near Prospect Park, even after the mayor promised to spend $12 million cleaning up the site.
In January, the administration abruptly switched to St. John's University in Queens, where it plans to build a temporary ballpark on school land. But now, the residents of Jamaica Estates are preparing their own legal challenge.
In recent weeks, the Giuliani administration has quietly negotiated with members of the City Council on a Coney Island compromise that could leave Mr. Golden out in the cold. According to people involved in the talks, city officials said that the administration might back the sports complex if the foundation sponsoring the project removed its chairman, Peter J. Kiernan, who had been critical of the Giuliani effort. With no fanfare, Mr. Kiernan, who did not return telephone calls requesting comment, stepped down on Feb. 15.
Rather than Mr. Golden, Peter F. Vallone, the City Council speaker, and Herbert E. Berman, who heads the Brooklyn Council delegation, would be able to take credit for a modified complex if they were able to strike a deal with the Giuliani administration.
Still, the cost of Mr. Giuliani's plan to build two minor league stadiums has tripled since his original $40 million estimate.
"As a Dodger fan in the 1950's, I love the thought of baseball returning to Brooklyn," said Mark Green, the city's public advocate. "But the city can't offer a blank check when we are faced with crumbling schools and increasing budget shortfalls."

HEADLINE: Jobs Data for 1999 Paint a Rosier Picture for Upstate New York

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON

 BODY:
Upstate New York, where the economy remained bleak even as an economic boom swept the rest of the nation, suddenly spurted ahead of much of the country in terms of job creation, according to new data for 1999 released yesterday by the New York State Department of Labor.
And because job growth in and around New York City continued at a white-hot pace last year, employment in New York State as a whole grew faster than the national average for the first time since 1983, state officials said yesterday. 
 The number of private-sector jobs upstate grew by 2.5 percent last year, while downstate -- in the city, Long Island and the northern suburbs -- private-sector employment jumped 3.2 percent. Nationally, jobs grew by 2.3 percent.
New York State added almost 200,000 jobs last year, and is now ranked seventh in terms of employment growth, behind Sun Belt states like Nevada and Florida, but ahead of Texas, state officials said.
Those rankings are subject to change, economists cautioned, as other states revise their 1999 economic figures to take account of new data. It was just such a revision that pushed New York's numbers up so sharply; in January, state data suggested that employment in New York was still growing more slowly than the national average.
The new jobs numbers could change the political climate in the state, because the woes of the upstate economy have already become an issue in the race for the United States Senate.
Just last month, Hillary Rodham Clinton said, "If upstate New York State were an independent state, it would consistently rank in the bottom fifth of job growth." In 1998, the number of jobs upstate grew by just 1.7 percent, while nationally jobs grew by 2.8 percent.
Using the new 1999 data, upstate would rank about 13th, said Stephen Kagann, chief economist for Gov. George E. Pataki. At a news conference yesterday, the governor called the new data "clear proof that this state is back."
The huge divide between upstate and downstate may also be closing, at least economically. While New York City's job creation and its suburbs continued at rates not seen since the 1950's, the city's growth was outpaced last year by much of the Hudson Valley and by Utica. The number of jobs increased in every major metropolitan area, and the only city reporting slower growth than in 1998 was Elmira.
"There used to be a big dichotomy, but there's more of a convergence now," said Jason Bramm, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
Exactly why or how the upstate economy has improved remains unclear, although Governor Pataki suggested that his administration's tax cuts and regulatory reductions had played an important role.
Manufacturing, which is extremely important to cities like Buffalo and Rochester, continued to decline last year, cutting almost 19,000 jobs statewide, or 2.1 percent. But service businesses, whose employees range from computer technicians to security guards, added 124,000 positions, an increase of 4.4 percent. And construction has been particularly strong, Mr. Kagann said.
Despite the huge revision -- the department of labor has increased the job count for last year by about 60,000 from its preliminary number, released in January -- economists generally consider jobs data to be fairly reliable. Information is collected from 18,000 companies around the state, and later replaced with complete figures culled from records for the unemployment insurance tax.
The biggest revisions were in upstate cities like Buffalo, Rochester and Albany, Mr. Bramm said. "Has upstate suddenly staged a rebound? No," he said. "We suddenly realized upstate has staged a rebound."
Economists are less confident in unemployment figures, which are based on a far smaller survey and cannot be crosschecked against tax records. In recent years, the unemployment data have not tracked the job creation figures, either nationally or in New York.
For example, despite the big increase in new jobs last year, unemployment upstate has not budged from the 4.1 percent level, adjusted for seasonal factors, reported in January of 1999. In New York City, by contrast, the unemployment rate has fallen to 6.1 percent from 7.4 percent during the last 12 months.
Nationally, unemployment averaged 4.0 percent in January, down slightly from 4.3 percent a year ago. In New Jersey, the unemployment rate in January fell to 3.9 percent, from a revised 4.6 percent in January 1999.

HEADLINE: HOUSE BACKS END TO EARNINGS LIMIT ON SOCIAL SECURITY

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 1

 BODY:
The House voted 422 to 0 today to allow most Social Security recipients for the first time to earn as much money as they want without sacrificing any of their retirement benefits, repealing a Depression-era policy intended to discourage older people from holding jobs so younger workers would have a chance.
The unanimous vote was a rare display of bipartisanship, and reflected a consensus that the earnings limits placed on Social Security recipients had long since become counterproductive. 
 The Senate, where there is broad support for the change, plans to take up a similar measure soon. President Clinton has said he would sign the legislation, which would not have any long-term effect on the financial health of the Social Security program. Under current law, people 65 through 69 years old lose $1 of their Social Security benefits for every $3 they earn above $17,000. A 67-year-old man who earned $20,000 last year, for example, would have lost $1,000 of his Social Security retirement benefits.
The earnings limit, which does not apply to people 70 and oldler, is already scheduled to rise to $30,000 in 2002, but the legislation passed today by the House would eliminate the limit altogether.
If enacted under the terms of the House bill, the change would apply retroactively to earnings since the beginning of this year.
About 800,000 people 65 or older lost some or all of their benefits last year because they earned more than the limit, according to the Social Security Administration.
Those people would benefit immediately from the change, and other people might decide to remain in or re-enter the work force because of the opportunity to hold a job without sacrificing any of their benefits. But the real significance of the shift might emerge only over the next few decades as the 76 million baby boomers grow older, creating a vast new pool of retirement-age people more willing and able than previous generations to continue working.
Republicans have long sought repeal of the earnings limit, saying it amounts to a tax. They were blocked for decades by Democrats, who at various times have cited objections from labor unions, the costs and the fact that relatively well-off people would be the biggest winners.
But opposition from Democrats has melted away over the years as the population has aged and the economy has grown healthier. The two parties agreed in 1996 to raise the earnings limit, and Mr. Clinton called last year for the limit to be repealed.
The bill's sponsors said repealing the earnings limit would benefit the entire economy right away by removing a disincentive to work at a time when the unemployment rate, at 4 percent, is so low that employers are having trouble filling all the jobs they are creating.
They said the change also reflected increases in life expectancy and the fact that more and more people 65 and older continue to work at least part time by choice or necessity. But they said the main justification for the change was simple fairness, calling it unconscionable for the government to deny workers benefits they had earned over their careers because they chose to work.
"Why in the world would we want to discourage any American -- whether they're 17 or 67 -- from working?" said Representative Bill Archer, Republican of Texas, who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. "Americans are living longer now," Mr. Archer said. "Older Americans can work, they want to work and they shouldn't be punished by an outdated law if they choose to work."
Researchers have found evidence that raising or eliminating the earnings limit will bring more people into the work force and lead older people who already have jobs to work more. But there is disagreement over how much of an effect any change has, with some economists saying repeal could create a huge new pool of available labor and others saying the effects would be negligible.
"There is only a limited amount of evidence on the overall effect" on the labor supply from repealing the limit, Kenneth S. Apfel, the Social Security commissioner, told Congress last month. But, Mr. Apfel said, it was plausible that eliminating the limit would "lead to a modest increase in work activity."
Even as they voted for the bill, some Democrats said they were troubled by the fact that it would help relatively high-earning people while doing nothing for retirees who subsist entirely on their Social Security benefits. And some members of both parties said they hoped that today's action would not be a substitute for addressing the long-range financial problems of the retirement system.
The provisions that the bill would repeal are more complex than today's debate on the House floor would suggest.
While Social Security recipients lose some of their benefits in years in which they earn more than the limit, they get some or all of the reduction back after age 70, when their benefits are readjusted to reflect their decision to continue working.
Moreover, the change would not apply to people who take early retirement benefits from Social Security, which they can do at 62 at a reduced rate. These people, 62 through 64, would continue to be subject to a strict earnings limit, losing $1 in benefits for every $2 in earnings above $10,080 a year. About 230,000 people in that age category lost all or part of their benefits last year because earnings exceeded the limit.
Both parties agreed to leave the earnings limit in place for early retirees -- effectively encouraging people not to take Social Security before 65 -- because research has shown that people who take a reduced Social Security benefits at age 62 are more likely to end up in poverty than those who work to full retirement age. The problem strikes particularly hard at widows of men who retired early and who rely on their late husbands' benefits.
Some members of both parties acknowledged that they found it uncomfortable to be enacting what amounted to an election-year benefits increase in Social Security for some people at the same time that Congress and the Clinton administration are deadlocked over how to assure the retirement system's long-term solvency. Without any changes, Social Security is projected to run short of money to pay benefits starting in 2033.
Under an earlier set of changes made in the 1980's to help bolster Social Security's financial condition, the age at which workers can claim full retirement benefits is already increasing gradually over the next few decades to 67. Many of the proposals to put Social Security on sounder footing call for further increases in the retirement age.
Repeal of the earnings limit would cost Social Security $22.7 billion in additional benefit payments over the next decade. But it would not have an effect on the retirement system's financial condition over the long run.That is because the benefits increases would eventually be offset by a reduction in the deferred benefits that would have been paid to workers starting at age 70 to make up for the reductions in benefits paid from age 65 through 69.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
PepsiCo calls on J. Walter Thompson to develop a $10 million campaign for its bottled water.

BYLINE: By Constance L. Hays

 BODY:
WITH bottled water -- no color, no flavor, no image to speak of -- turning out to be one of its star performers, growing far faster than colas and other carbonated soft drinks, PepsiCo plans to spend millions of dollars to promote its Aquafina brand in the coming year.
Signaling the next stage of the bottled water wars, Pepsi chose the J. Walter Thompson agency, a part of the WPP Group, to develop a campaign, expected to include television and print ads and a new tag line, for Aquafina, which Pepsi began selling nationwide a little more than two years ago. The size of the campaign, estimated at $10 million and announced in December, shows how rapidly bottled water has gained the respect of Pepsi executives and how big the expectations are for Aquafina's expansion. 
 "Having been in the lucky position of being the No. 1 water, we are trying to lead the movement back toward branding and fewer, bigger brands dominating the business," said Dawn Hudson, Pepsi's senior vice president for strategy and marketing, noting that marketing budgets for most water brands have been $2 million or less, until now. "It will go from being a commodity business to a branded business."
In the fourth quarter of last year, sales of Aquafina rose 75 percent, compared with declining sales of Pepsi-Cola and a lower double-digit growth rate for Mountain Dew. That was accomplished with next to no marketing, compared with the millions spent on advertising the soft-drink brands. In a conference call with analysts last month, Roger A. Enrico, PepsiCo's chairman, said the company wanted to increase supermarket sales, adding to its success in vending machines and convenience stores, where people tend to buy just a bottle at a time.
"We're just now in the process of getting the creative concepts together," a Pepsi spokesman, Larry Jabbonsky, said of the ads, which are expected to be on the air by summertime -- prime water-selling season. "They will focus on Aquafina's purity and its approachability, with a humorous edge."
These won't be the first ads for Aquafina. Pepsi briefly broadcast a television spot last year that showed a well-sculptured runner, implicitly an imported-water drinker, who comes to an untimely end against the side of a truck. Meanwhile, two "regular guys" are shown drinking Aquafina. It was supposed to underscore the generic appeal of the brand. The Aquafina tag line, "Take me to the water," is likely to be replaced, Mr. Jabbonsky added.
Across the United States, which only recently embraced bottled water as an alternative to soda, sales of the nonsparkling variety have soared, from 750 million gallons in 1997 to more than 1.2 billion gallons last year. The annual growth rate over the last five years has been about 30 percent. "Even the very strong 1990's U.S. stock market performance pales in comparison," said Michael Bellas, chief executive of Beverage Marketing, a firm that tracks beverage sales. He called bottled water in containers of 1.5 liters or less "the star category of not only the bottled water industry, but also the entire beverage industry."
Water has been good for Pepsi. Aquafina is now the top-selling brand in the small-bottle category, although it accounts for only about 80 million cases a year, compared with about 1.4 billion for Pepsi-Cola. The company makes money from each sale through royalties paid by its bottlers. Using its existing distribution network, Pepsi shipped Aquafina to the thousands of convenience stores and gas stations where it already delivered other Pepsi products, and its sales spiraled upward.
Coca-Cola noticed the trend, too, and put its own bottled water, Dasani, on the market last spring. The structure is different, however; Coke sells packets of mineral additives, which are added to the water, to its bottlers. But like Pepsi, Coke gets most of its raw material from municipal water sources, not any fancy-sounding natural spring. Between their distribution systems and their choice of sources, both Coke and Pepsi are likely to have the biggest-selling national water brands within the next year or so, analysts say.
A Coke spokesman said the company planned a print campaign for Dasani this year, emphasizing relaxation and gardening. The ads will appear in women's magazines.
Meanwhile, consolidation and other changes are shaking up the bottled water market. In January, Groupe Danone, which owns the Evian and Dannon brands, announced it was buying the San Francisco-based McKesson Water Products Company, makers of Sparkletts, Alhambra and other brands, for $1.1 billion. Naya Inc., which has a popular water that was distributed for years by Coca-Cola Enterprises, Coke's chief United States bottler, declared bankruptcy in December, although it continues to sell its product. The company's problems were largely caused by a drop in sales that came when it lost its Coca-Cola Enterprises distribution a few months before Coke rolled out Dasani.
"We think the top four or five companies are going to control 80 percent of the market," Mr. Bellas said. "It's changing now to the marketing wars."
Ms. Hudson said Pepsi's efforts would go beyond the ad campaign. "It's not just about advertising," she said. "It's presence marketing, getting into more locations, having more types of packages available, being part of more sports events." She called water "the ultimate thirst quencher" and said Pepsi's goal was "to sustain the momentum of the brand as the No. 1 brand."
Back in 1994, when Pepsi put an initial toe into the market by testing Aquafina in Wichita, Kan., it was considered a risky move. After all, what's the point of offering consumers water if you can get them to drink higher-margin Pepsi or Mountain Dew? And to make matters worse, Pepsi practically bragged about the fact that Aquafina came not from an exotic-sounding mountain spring but was simply tap water, cleaned up in a bottling plant. Where was the appeal?
It turns out American consumers don't really care about the source. And if bottlers don't have a Coke or Pepsi brand to sell, they will find some other brand to meet the demand for water. "What Pepsi taught the industry was that coming from a spring was not a requirement," said Jennifer Solomon, a beverage analyst for Salomon Smith Barney. "It was a big gamble, and it paid off."
It's not clear whether bottled water is capturing market share that once belonged to sodas or whether it is displacing tap water that people used to drink. Either way, "Coke and Pepsi's entry into this business is going to have a profound impact," said John D. Sicher, editor of Beverage Digest, an industry newsletter. "In the years to come, a lot of the smaller regional spring waters will have a more difficult time competing, even regionally, with the big brands. The big ones will be marketed more heavily, and consumers will demand them, and they will take up more and more shelf space."
But there may be one niche market that the biggest players are overlooking, said Scott Wilkins, a beverage analyst for Deutsche Bank. "If you buy into this health-conscious movement, which is pretty well documented, there will be a market for nonpurified, spring-based water that neither Coke nor Pepsi is addressing," he said. "Maybe the economics don't work for them to buy a source, but Perrier and Danone are doing it all over the world."

HEADLINE: HEAVY POSTURING SEEN IN I.M.F. RIFT

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 1

 BODY:
When President Clinton pledged this week to block a German finance ministry official from assuming the top post at the International Monetary Fund, in effect vetoing the man the European Union had chosen for the job, he seemed to risk a diplomatic confrontation across the Atlantic.
What really happened, Clinton administration and some European officials now say, is that the president agreed to play the heavy because both American and European diplomats had trouble communicating across the Rhine. 
 For four months Germany aggressively promoted the official, Caio Koch-Weser, to take over at the I.M.F., ending with formal endorsement by the 15-nation European Union. But during that time, officials from the United States, Britain, Italy and France had regular conversations in which they agreed broadly on two things: The next head of the I.M.F. should be a European, and that the European should not be Mr. Koch-Weser, several Clinton administration officials and European diplomats said.
Both American and European officials said that Mr. Koch-Weser, a genial 55-year-old state secretary in Germany's finance ministry, lacked the gravitas and financial expertise to lead the I.M.F. at a time when it was arguably more powerful than ever before. The problem for fellow Europeans, and later for Americans, was that Germany ignored some early signs of unease with Mr. Koch-Weser and started the nation's most aggressive diplomatic campaign in years to install him as head of the monetary fund.
"By choosing to peddle politeness as openness," said a senior administration official, "they backed us into a corner."
That description of events serves United States interests, of course, by cloaking an unusual and potentially explosive decision in the garb of a broader diplomatic imperative. It also contradicts public statements that European ministers have made in recent days, including several comments chastising Washington for its hubris.
But European officials confirmed in interviews that they supported Mr. Koch-Weser mainly to preserve European unity in the face of an unyielding German campaign rather than because they agreed he should head the I.M.F., a post held by a European since the institution was created just after World War II.
Moreover, even as they publicly rallied behind Mr. Koch-Weser, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin of France and Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema of Italy have been calling each other to discuss new candidates for the job, diplomats told about the conversations said.
"The tradition in Europe is solidarity on decisions of this kind," one European diplomat said. "But there is also an understanding of the position of the United States. There is certainly no crisis."
Though the world often has a hard time selecting leaders for the main international institutions -- successions at the United Nations and the World Trade Organization have been contentious as well -- the search for a head of the monetary fund shows how diplomatically delicate, and deeply flawed, the search process has become, administration officials and outside experts say.
If there is a single lesson from the search, it is that the current process, whereby interested countries nominate their own citizens for crucial posts and then use their diplomatic influence to support them, needs fixing.
The United States rejection of Mr. Koch-Weser -- and its decision at this stage not to back anyone else -- means that when the monetary fund conducts an informal vote on Thursday, there will almost certainly be no winner. Aside from Mr. Koch-Weser, there are two other candidates. Stanley Fischer, the American who serves as the I.M.F. deputy managing director, was nominated by a group of 20 African and Arab countries. Japan has nominated Eisuke Sakakibara, a former finance ministry official.
What happens after that is uncertain. Clinton administration officials and European officials say that they hope German officials will realize after the straw poll, if they have not already, that the nomination of Mr. Koch-Weser was a mistake. That would clear the way for other possible European candidates, including the British and Italian finance ministers and the head of the Bank for International Settlements, who are more likely to generate broad support, according to American and European officials.
The search for a new I.M.F. leader began last October, when it became clear to top financial officials that Michel Camdessus of France, who led the monetary fund for 13 years, planned to retire two years before the end of his term. The post immediately attracted several potential European candidates. But the strongest push came from Germany, which had made clear its intention of taking a larger role in international institutions and felt that the French, who have named most I.M.F. directors, should not claim this one.
The Germans immediately put forward Mr. Koch-Weser. On paper, at least, he had the perfect resume. An economist who worked for a quarter-century at the World Bank, Mr. Koch-Weser had extensive contacts in financial circles around the world, spoke six languages and was perhaps the most cosmopolitan of Germany's financial bureaucrats. Mr. Koch-Weser also had good political ties at home, people who worked with him said. He left the World Bank in Washington, where he had risen to managing director, one of the five most senior posts, to return to Germany soon after the election of Chancellor Gerhard Schroder. The new chancellor named him state secretary at the finance ministry, the No. 2 position.
But Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers made clear from the start, including in conversations with Mr. Koch-Weser during meetings in Europe and Tokyo, that he did not favor the German's bid. The two had known each other when both were working at the World Bank in the early 1990's. Mr. Summers's main concern was that Mr. Koch-Weser was a specialist in poverty relief and had no expertise in finance. Moreover, the German was seen as a go-along-get-along type, who thrived at the World Bank by working well with the bureaucracy, not by leading it, administration officials said.
Initially, Mr. Koch-Weser's candidacy did not ring alarm bells at the Treasury Department. Administration officials said the European reaction to Mr. Koch-Weser was even cooler than their own. He was given low odds.
The United States was drawn directly into the European fray by Mr. Schroder himself. Early last month, he called Mr. Clinton and lobbied him directly. Mr. Clinton used diplomatic language to convey to Mr. Schroder that Mr. Koch-Weser had not demonstrated that he had broad support. Yet, in part because administration officials still believed Mr. Koch-Weser's chances of getting European backing were slim, Mr. Clinton assured Mr. Schroder that the United States had no objections to a German candidate per se.
Germany began promoting Mr. Clinton's friendly words as a tacit endorsement, administration officials said. Mr. Schroder promptly flew to Paris to meet with President Jacques Chirac and Mr. Jospin. The French, who had been the only Europeans publicly to challenge Mr. Koch-Weser's qualifications, were told that Mr. Clinton had no objection to Mr. Koch-Weser provided he became the unified European choice, according to people told about Mr. Schroder's conversation with the French.
As the campaign gathered steam, Clinton administration officials began fretting that they had been too passive early on. Mr. Summers; Gene Sperling, the president's national economic adviser; Samuel R. Berger, the national security adviser; and Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright had a series of phone calls to debate strategy. Sensing a confrontation with Germany might be inevitable, Mr. Berger and Mr. Sperling began doing their own research on Mr. Koch-Weser. If they were going to risk German ire, they wanted to be certain that Treasury's opinion of Mr. Koch-Weser was right, officials said. Both Mr. Sperling and Mr. Berger ended up agreeing with the Treasury view, administration officials said.
Mr. Berger was the most reluctant of Mr. Clinton's top advisers to risk a diplomatic split with Germany, administration officials said. But as the European Union endorsement became inevitable last week, he agreed that it was better to try to stop the candidacy now than to stay silent and possibly set off a bigger, public confrontation later.
This time, President Clinton initiated a call to Mr. Schroder. The message was unmistakable: The United States wants a European for the job, but not Mr. Koch-Weser.

PAREXEL CUTS 500 JOBSBECAUSE OF LOST CONTRACT

BYLINE: Bloomberg News

 BODY:
The Parexel International Corporation, a drug research company in Waltham, Mass., said yesterday that it would cut as many as 500 jobs and it lowered its earnings estimates through 2001 because Novartis A.G. had canceled a contract. Parexel shares, down 64 percent in the last year, fell $5.125, to $8.50. The cancellation by Novartis, the world's third-largest drugmaker, will cause Parexel's clinical-research unit to have reduced revenue and earnings. Novartis canceled the contract because of changes in its drugs in research, Parexel said.

HEADLINE: Money Laundering Prompts U.S. Drive For a Tougher Law

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 1

 BODY:
The Clinton administration plans to ask Congress for sweeping new powers to combat money laundering including the authority to ban financial transactions between United States banks or brokerage houses and off-shore financial centers, administration officials said today.
The request is the centerpiece of administration efforts to tighten money-laundering laws after the Bank of New York was found to have served as a conduit for about $7 billion in Russian money, some of which investigators believe was derived from illegal activities. The administration has also been searching for ways to make it harder for drug traffickers to funnel their profits through American banks. 
 Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers plans to announce proposed legislation in a speech to bankers on Thursday, officials said. The legislation would give his department a broad range of powers to investigate and in serious cases forbid transactions between American financial institutions and individual foreign banks or entire foreign countries.
Administration officials say that current laws do not provide enough authority to fight money laundering, the practice of filtering profits from illegal activities through banks to disguise their origin. Short of having Congress declare emergency sanctions against countries deemed to be a national security threat, the officials said, they are mostly confined to waving a finger at nations that tolerate money laundering and urging American banks to be wary of doing business with such places.
"The issue of money laundering is so prominent and public that it can't be ignored anymore," a senior official said. "We need to be able to target the root problems without unnecessarily hindering legitimate economic activity."
The effort to seek new powers is clearly a response to Russia, where financial mismanagement has been a problem for the Clinton administration and the International Monetary Fund. Some analysts and members of Congress have complained that widespread corruption in that country -- helped in part by the ease of transferring funds abroad -- undermined multibillion-dollar foreign aid programs and left one of the administration's top foreign policy priorities a shambles.
The proposed legislation also appears to be an attempt to broker a compromise between Congressional proposals and private financial companies. Both the House and the Senate are weighing bills that would impose draconian restrictions on foreign banks that hide money and, in some cases, new enforcement duties on domestic banks and brokerage houses. Financial companies have complained that such laws threaten to make them uncompetitive against foreign rivals.
Members of Congress had a mixed response to the Treasury's proposal after briefings by Clinton administrations officials today. Representative Jim Leach, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the House Banking Committee, said the Treasury proposals were exactly what he had been seeking. He said he would introduce the bill as his own when it is sent to Congress next week.
Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York and a member of the Senate's banking committee, was less enthusiastic. He said the Treasury proposals were a watered-down version of legislation he has introduced that would mandate the isolation of foreign banks that make hiding money their forte.
"When you leave this up to their discretion, diplomacy will prevail over cutting off money laundering," Mr. Schumer said. "The Treasury seems to be taking a step in the right direction. But we are going to toughen it up."
The new legislation would give the Treasury Department the right to take any number of steps, along a progressive scale, to fight laundering. On the light end of the spectrum, the department wants the power to ask American companies to collect data on all kinds of transactions with an off-shore bank or financial company. That would help law enforcement officials track suspicious activity, and would also make American banks wary of doing business with such places, officials said.
In cases where foreign governments stubbornly shield their banks from prying eyes and act as havens for criminal funds, the department wants the power to simply cut them off from the American financial system, without seeking Congressional approval for such action each time.
Although that would not necessarily force those nations to tighten enforcement, the loss of access to the American market would cripple any legitimate banking activity there and make it a much less attractive destination for criminal elements as well, the officials said. Moreover, officials hope that the United States action in such cases will serve as a model for other developed countries, putting further pressure on the laundering haven.
Ever since the act of money laundering first became a crime, in 1986, Treasury officials have often been sympathetic to private sector concerns that the old way of fighting money laundering -- putting a burden on banks and brokerage houses to police their clients -- might simply drive banking business to nations that do not demand as much. But the rise of multilateral efforts to counter illicit flows of money through the international banking system in recent years has made it possible to tighten restrictions at home without driving too much legitimate banking activity abroad, officials said.
Treasury officials already have sought to step up antilaundering activities through the one tool they now have in their arsenal: moral suasion, or as the Treasury calls it, name and blame. When a foreign bank or nation repeatedly refuses to abide by generally accepted standards to make sure they are not being used by criminals to launder money, Treasury has made that known to domestic banks, usually through advisories. Those put the banks on notice that they should be wary of money that flows into their coffers from such sources. The advisories do not have the force of law.
Legislation before Congress would add processing the proceeds of official corruption to the list of foreign crimes that fall under the money-laundering statute. American financial institutions are now barred from handling the proceeds from a narrow group of offenses committed abroad, including drug trafficking, kidnapping and bank fraud.
An advance copy of a speech Mr. Summers prepared for delivery on Thursday identifies several countries that have served as either sources of illicit money or havens for bank secrecy and laundering.
Russia, Colombia, and Nigeria, he says, are among the biggest sources of such funds. The islands of Dominica, Nauru and Antigua are among the biggest destination spots, with laws that make it possible or actively encourage criminals to do business there.
Administration officials said they believed that such moral suasion works. Antigua, Nauru, Russia and Colombia are all working with the United States to toughen their laws, Mr. Summers says in his address. After Clinton administration officials raised public concerns about Nauru earlier this year, citing its role as a chief haven for Russian money laundering, some American banks decided on their own to stop doing financial-correspondent business with banks chartered in that country.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE EVALUATION;
For McCain, It Was Black Tuesday

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr.

DATELINE: RICHMOND, Va., March 1

 BODY:
Before Washington State's votes rolled in late Tuesday, aides to Senator John McCain tried to minimize Gov. George W. Bush's victory in Virginia, which had reported earlier.
The only place Mr. Bush had shown any strength, McCain aides said, was in the most conservative section of the country, the South, with victories in South Carolina 10 days earlier and now Virginia. Mr. McCain himself chimed in, "Seems as if he has a Southern strategy here." 
 But in fact Mr. McCain was comprehensively beaten on Tuesday: in a big Southern state with one foot in the mid-Atlantic region, Virginia; in a small, isolated Midwestern state whose economy is based on agriculture, North Dakota, and in a Northwestern state with a progressive tradition, Washington.
It was by some margin the biggest wipeout of the Republican presidential campaign, and it came just one week before 13 states hold Republican primaries and caucuses in what may prove to be the decisive moment of the fight for the party's nomination.
New polls taken in a number of those states since Mr. McCain's victory in Michigan a week ago, but before Mr. Bush's sweep on Tuesday, show tough going ahead for the Arizonan. He has taken a narrow lead, within the margin of error, in three New York surveys, and he has an enormous lead of 36 points in Massachusetts. But he trails Mr. Bush by 21 points in the latest Los Angeles Times poll of Republican voters in California, the nation's most populous state, and Mr. Bush also holds double-digit leads in Maryland, Missouri and Ohio.
A week ago Mr. Bush's campaign looked wobbly. Now he has regained the initiative, and he said he felt a spring in his step this morning as he began campaigning in Georgia.
Senator McCain's biggest problem is his inability to shake Mr. Bush's hold on Republican loyalists, whose votes will decide the allocation of New York and California delegates.
"What the Washington primary tells me," said David Olsen, a political science professor at the University of Washington, "is that Bush has done what he needed to firm up his base, but the cost may be the election in November. Bush had to move so far to the right he may have trouble getting back to the center in the fall."
Clearly, Mr. Bush is having problems in attracting crossover votes, which he would need to beat the Democrats. But he has months to try to overcome that shortcoming; Mr. McCain has only a week left to woo Republicans.
"It looks like neither Bush nor McCain made much headway here on the other guy's turf," said Stuart Elway, an independent pollster in Seattle. "It was the same old stalemate that we have seen in the other states."
In the popularity contest in Washington, which was open both to Republicans and to independents, Mr. Bush led Mr. McCain by only 9,000 votes, with more than 200,000 absentee ballots still to be tallied. But among Republicans, whose votes were the only ones counted in selecting delegates, Mr. Bush trounced his rival, 58 percent to 38 percent, gaining 7 of the 12 delegates at stake. Mr. McCain took 5. Twenty-five more will be named in caucuses next week.
Mr. McCain made his strongest showing in King County (Seattle).
The Washington system is similar to that in California, where some politicians have suggested that Mr. McCain will do well in the popularity contest while Mr. Bush gets most of the 162 delegates, the largest bloc at the Republican convention.
North Dakota uses a caucus system, and the turnout was small on a frosty night. But Mr. Bush thoroughly trounced the field, beating Mr. McCain by 76 percent to 19 percent and taking 14 delegates to 4 for Mr. McCain and 1 for Alan Keyes, the former State Department aide who has hung on doggedly.
In Virginia as in Washington, it was the Republicans who propelled Mr. Bush to victory, which gave him a fat packet of 56 delegates. Mr. McCain prevailed among Democrats in the Old Dominion, 87 percent to 11, and among independents, 64 percent to 31. But Republicans constituted more than 60 percent of the electorate in the primary, and Mr. Bush took the votes of two-thirds of them.
The disparity was even more marked between voters who identified themselves with the religious right, fully 80 percent of whom went for Mr. Bush, and those who did not, who opted for Mr. McCain by a narrow margin, 52 percent to 45 percent. Mr. McCain certainly did not help himself, and may have damaged his chances, with his attack on Pat Robertson and the Rev. Jerry Falwell, the two Virginians who are among the most prominent Christian conservative leaders.
When voters were asked, without any particular target specified, whether Senator McCain had made unfair attacks, almost half said he had, and Mr. Bush won the votes of three-quarters of them. Only a third said Mr. Bush had made unfair attacks.
The figures on the religious right came from an exit poll by a consortium of the television networks and The Associated Press. No comparable figures were available for Washington, where no such poll was taken. So it is difficult to judge what effect, if any, Mr. McCain's harsh criticism will have in the Northern industrial states with no particular affinity for the religious right whose primaries are scheduled next Tuesday.
Mr. McCain raised the stakes in Virginia by spending heavily in its most expensive media market, the Washington suburbs, and making several campaign stops in the state. From that perspective, his showing was a disappointment, and Gov. James S. Gilmore III, who backed Mr. Bush, gloated that Mr. McCain's campaign bus, the Straight Talk Express, "ran out of gas in Virginia."
But with the entire Republican establishment arrayed against him, and with a very late start in organization, Mr. McCain made a contest of it. He lost by nine percentage points, considerably less than the polls had suggested, and he did very well in Norfolk, Virginia Beach and the rest of the Hampton Roads area, where several vast military installations are situated. He carried Charlottesville, home of the University of Virginia, and the Virginia suburbs of Washington, including Arlington, Alexandria and Fairfax County.
That was not enough, though, in the face of huge Bush majorities in the suburban Richmond counties of Henrico and Chesterfield.
Virginia is a must-win state for the Republicans in November, and one party leader here said on Tuesday night: "Clinton lost the state by only a couple of points four years ago. I worry that if McCain and Bush keep battering each other, the way Reagan and Ford did in 1976, the result will be the same. They let Jimmy Carter in, and these guys may end up electing Al Gore."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE DEMOCRATIC DEBATE;
Gore and Bradley Sing in Harmony in Latest Meeting

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO and KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, March 1

 BODY:
Meeting in their last debate before more than a dozen states vote in primaries and caucuses on Tuesday, Vice President Al Gore and former Senator Bill Bradley appeared uncharacteristically harmonious together tonight, going out of their way to agree on virtually every issue and avoiding the kind of attacks that characterized their raucous debate just over a week ago in Harlem.
Mr. Bradley signaled early that he would barely criticize Mr. Gore when he passed up a chance to fault the vice president, as he usually does, as failing to do more to combat racial profiling, and they both then talked about their own proposals, forgoing their usual potshots at each other. 
 Tonight's was the most conciliatory of their encounters, reflecting the recognition of both that, with Mr. Bradley's failure to win a single primary contest so far, the race was likely to end soon.
In one poignant moment, Mr. Bradley was asked what mistake in his life had taught him the most. A Rhodes Scholar and Olympic gold medalist before he was 22, Mr. Bradley talked about how he learned about failure from his rookie year with the New York Knicks, when he had been heralded as the team's savior, only to be booed and spit on by fans when he played poorly. Some of his supporters have likened that traumatic year to the dismaying struggles of his current campaign.
"I knew I wouldn't save the Knicks," he said. "It caused me to ask myself really, well, you have to come to terms with this. That meant I worked harder in order to achieve things. It also meant I began to see that life is not all good, not all bad, that individuals are not all good or all bad."
Mr. Gore, revising his answer after Mr. Bradley answered, said his biggest mistake was not being kind.
With both reining in the harshness that has for so long characterized their campaign, the two revealed just how ideologically similar they are. Both were given a chance to condemn the evangelical right wing, which they did. Both called for legal recognition for gay partners, although both oppose legalizing gay marriage. Both condemned racial profiling. Both praised their wives.
And both defended the Rev. Al Sharpton, who has been criticized by some people as divisive.
Eight times Mr. Gore said he agreed with Mr. Bradley.
For those who have watched any of the eight previous meetings between Mr. Gore and Mr. Bradley, many topics might have seemed familiar, even if they answered the questions less combatively. Last week in Harlem, for instance, Mr. Bradley said that the vice president had shown a lack of leadership by not pressing President Clinton to sign an executive order to ban racial profiling by federal law-enforcement agencies.
But when the question was raised tonight, Mr. Bradley avoided conflict. "I believe that this is the civil rights issue of our time," he said, not mentioning Mr. Gore. "It is no longer blocking people from schools. It is no longer trying to eat in a restaurant. It is having the justice system in this country finally provide equal justice for all."
Mr. Gore agreed. "I think it has to stop. I want to be tough on crime. I want to be tough on discrimination, too."
Mr. Bradley also passed on the opportunity to criticize Mr. Gore for sending mixed signals on whether to allow China to join the World Trade Organization. A few days ago, the former senator asserted that the vice president had put "the nail in the coffin" of the treaty that would bring China into the trade group when Mr. Gore suggested to A.F.L.-C.I.O. officials that he might renegotiate the treaty if elected president.
But tonight, Mr. Bradley declined to make that argument when a question was asked about China and Taiwan relations.
And though he has repeatedly criticized Mr. Gore as a "risk" to the Democratic Party because of his role in the campaign fund-raising abuses of the 1996 presidential campaign, Mr. Bradley did not even mention Mr. Gore's problems tonight, though his aides view it as the vice president's Achilles' heel.
Instead, when a question about money in politics was asked, Mr. Bradley spent more time talking about the differences between himself and Senator John McCain, the Republican presidential candidate who has made an overhaul of the system a centerpiece of his campaign. He noted that Mr. McCain was a conservative on issues like abortion or the environment.
Once again, Mr. Gore agreed, saying, "It is one of the major issues in this campaign." Then, apparently secure that Mr. Bradley was on his side, Mr. Gore tried to use the issue to present a united front against the Republicans. "It unites us, but it divides the two Republican candidates," he said. Mr. McCain's opponent, Gov. George W. Bush, opposes revamping the finance rules.
The tone of the debate was so amicable that Mr. Bradley was asked if he was repudiating his relentless criticism of the past against Mr. Gore's congressional voting record, particularly against federal funding for abortion, against certain gun control measures and in favor of tobacco subsidies. He replied that Mr. Gore's record could be used against him by the Republicans.
"He has evolved, I'm glad he has evolved," Mr. Bradley said.
Later, in the only rancorous exchange, Mr. Bradley said that Mr. Gore's record of voting to support tax-exemption for religious institutions like Bob Jones University would make it hard for the Democrats to criticize Republicans like Mr. Bush for visiting that college, where interracial dating is prohibited. "I guarantee we should be attacking them for that," Mr. Bradley said. But, he continued, "then they're going to come right back and point to those votes and it's going to be very difficult.
Mr. Gore then squabbled with Mr. Bradley over what exactly he had voted for, but the moment only highlighted how they otherwise so thoroughly agreed.
Just minutes before the debate started, the Rev. Jesse Jackson announced that he was endorsing Mr. Gore, whom he called "the most qualified and experienced candidate in a generation." "The Clinton-Gore team has sparked the greatest economic boom in the history of this country," Mr. Jackson said. "Therefore, the vice president is perfectly positioned to continue this growth."
The endorsement ends months of courtship by the two Democratic candidates for his support. And while it is not clear how many voters he might sway on his own, his endorsement is just one of several by high-profile Democrats in recent days that have added to the impression that the vice president has united the party behind him.
Mr. Jackson declined to urge Mr. Bradley to quit the race, praising him for having raised important issues in the campaign and having recruited athletes, including Michael Jordan, into the party fold.
Mr. Jackson has his own history of bitterness with Mr. Gore. In 1988 when both men ran for the Democratic nomination, Mr. Gore and his supporters criticized Mr. Jackson's position on Israel, and other issues, prompting Mr. Jackson to accuse Mr. Gore of negative campaigning.

HEADLINE: Oil, Politics And a Blacklist

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 1

 BODY:
Standing in a light rain under the watchful eye of police, the protesters waved signs and shouted: "Aliyev is a murderer! Aliyev is a dictator! Aliyev, go home!"
But inside a lecture hall here last month, Heydar Aliyev, the president of Azerbaijan, could not hear a word of it. Showing multicolored maps on an overhead projector to demonstrate what he called Armenia's aggressive ways, Mr. Aliyev, a former Soviet deputy premier and leader of the local K.G.B., held court over an assembly of influential foreign policy experts. Without a doubt, he seemed to have the upper hand over his opponents outside. 
 In reality, however, it was the band of protesters who had the political muscle behind them, frustrating Mr. Aliyev's recent attempts to end a Congressional ban on United States government aid to Azerbaijan, a measure passed to punish the country for its blockade of Armenia.
Azerbaijan has been on a government blacklist since 1992 -- the only former Soviet republic to be punished in this way -- thanks to a well-coordinated lobbying effort by Armenian-Americans and a strong coalition of supporters of Armenia in Congress.
But the Azerbaijanis are pushing back. Mr. Aliyev himself has engaged in face-to-face lobbying, and some high-powered hired professionals are doing the same behind the scenes. Adding to the effort, some of the most powerful American oil companies have been acting quietly on Azerbaijan's behalf.
Most of this country's big oil companies have an interest in the energy-rich region. Three American companies, Exxon Mobil, Unocal and Pennzoil-Quaker State, are part of the Azeri International Operating Company. Other companies, like Chevron and Texaco, are active in other parts of the Caspian Sea region.
One United States oil company executive, who spoke only on the condition that he not be identified, said the restrictions on government assistance to Azerbaijan were interfering with the efforts of American companies to develop oil there. At the same time, the oil companies have sought to avoid becoming involved in the Azerbaijan-Armenia conflict, he said.
The U.S.-Azerbaijan Business Council, a group that promotes business ties between the two countries, has worked to overturn the restrictions. Jayhun Mollazade, president of the council, said that the restrictions were a "political irritant between Azerbaijan and the United States" and that they also interfered with business. Mr. Mollazade said his group received some financing from oil companies but has much broader support.
Despite these efforts on Azerbaijan's behalf, the restrictions on aid remain in place. The Armenian-American community, which numbers about a million people, is well organized in its support for the restrictions. Bound together by remembrances of the 1915 massacre of a million Armenians by the Turks, Armenian-Americans are wise to the ways of grass-roots activism: letters to lawmakers, campaign contributions and even protests in the rain.
Mr. Aliyev made his case directly to President Clinton last month during a 45-minute meeting at the White House that included both Mr. Aliyev's entourage and Mr. Clinton's top foreign policy advisers.
If Mr. Clinton's view had been the only one that mattered, Mr. Aliyev would have accomplished his mission. The White House contends that the ban on American assistance to Azerbaijan is counterproductive and ought to be lifted. But despite entreaties from administration officials, the majority of Congress has a different view.
What makes the conflict so important to Washington policy makers is the strategic importance of Azerbaijan, which shares borders with Iran on the south and Russia on the north. To the American business community, the geography that matters most is Azerbaijan's claim over vast oil reserves in the adjacent Caspian Sea.
In an interview during his visit, Mr. Aliyev showed the volatile nature of the country he rules. He accused the Russian intelligence service of masterminding a string of assassination attempts against him, including failed attacks on his presidential aircraft and a bridge he was crossing.
Mr. Aliyev also expressed interest in someday shipping oil through Iran, an alarming idea for United States officials backing a route that sticks to nations friendly to the West.
Flanking Mr. Aliyev at a long conference table during the interview was Hafiz Pashayev, Azerbaijan's ambassador to the United States, and the president's son, Ilham Aliyev, who is first vice president of the state-run oil company. There is open speculation in Baku, Azerbaijan's capital, that Mr. Aliyev, who is 77 and underwent quadruple bypass surgery last year, is grooming his son to succeed him. The president's trip to the United States mixed official business with cataract surgery.
Mr. Aliyev reassured Mr. Clinton during his meeting, according to aides to both men, that he continues to stand behind the development of a pipeline that would ship oil from Baku through Georgia and Turkey to the Mediterranean port of Ceyhan. Clinton aides see the ban on aid to Azerbaijan as a hindrance to their efforts to ensure an oil pipeline route that will not give Iran or Russia a chokehold.
"We would have major concerns about Azerbaijan looking south" to Tehran, an administration official said, stressing that such a notion never came up in his discussion with Mr. Clinton.
The ban on American assistance stems from the bitter conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh, an enclave of ethnic Armenians in southern Azerbaijan that has been seized by the Armenians. The two sides reached a cease-fire in 1994 and despite flare-ups continue to engage in peace talks.
"I think he's serious about coming to a peaceful settlement to the conflict," said Representative Frank Pallone Jr., a Democrat from New York and co-chairman of the 89-member Congressional caucus on Armenian issues.
But despite Mr. Pallone's view of Mr. Aliyev's good intentions, the congressman contends that the restrictions ought to remain in place until Azerbaijan lifts the blockade on its rival.
Armenian officials agree. Armen Kharazian, deputy chief of mission at the Armenian Embassy, argued that lifting the aid restrictions would send the wrong message to Azerbaijan. The two neighboring countries have no trade or diplomatic relations, Mr. Kharazian said, noting that the border is closed and most railroads and pipelines between the two states are shut down.
Mr. Aliyev demonstrated clearly that hard feelings remain. After the White House meeting, he told reporters that he was working to reach a settlement with the Armenians but vehemently argued that the aggressors were the Armenians.
"Over one million citizens of Azerbaijan have been ousted forcibly from the occupied lands and they have been living in hard circumstances in tents," Mr. Aliyev said, a contention that Mr. Kharazian of Armenia dismissed as "propaganda."
In the White House meeting, Mr. Clinton repeated his opposition to the restrictions on aid, known as Section 907 of the Freedom Support Act. But Mr. Clinton also let his counterpart know that his hands were tied.
Mr. Clinton could waive the restrictions if he made a finding that Azerbaijan had made progress toward ending the blockade. But mindful of the strong opposition among Armenian-Americans, he has left it to Congress to lift the ban.
"They haven't wanted to take the heat," said Charles H. Fairbanks Jr., an expert on the region who heads the Central Asia-Caucasus Institute at Johns Hopkins University.
The standoff leaves Mr. Aliyev -- who came to power in 1993 after a military coup and won election in 1998 in a contest the State Department said was "marred by irregularities" -- with an up-close look at democracy in action. In the interview, Mr. Aliyev expressed both an understanding of, and an annoyance with, Congress.
After his White House visit, Mr. Aliyev stood in the driveway outside and railed against what he regarded as an "unfair, unjust law passed by the Congress." But showing an understanding of how lawmaking operates here, Azerbaijan has also hired two lobbying firms to press its case on Capitol Hill.
Edwin C. Graves, who calls Mr. Aliyev "a real source of stability in the region," is a sole practitioner who receives $36,000 every six months to push for the repeal of Section 907. Baker, Donelson is a law firm that represents the Azerbaijan government on legal and political matters. George Cranwell Montgomery, the firm's managing partner, arranged a dinner last April for Mr. Aliyev to meet leading senators, according to his filing with the Justice Department made under the Foreign Agents Registration Act.
The dinner came just before a crucial Senate vote that nearly toppled the restrictions. Senator Sam Brownbeck, a Kansas Republican who has been a strong backer of the Azerbaijanis' cause, attached the measure ending the ban on Azerbaijani aid to a spending bill for foreign operations. But advocates of Armenia rounded up the votes to defeat the effort, and legislative aides expect no follow-up measure in either chamber any time soon.
The Azerbaijanis are mulling their next move. They intend to continue pressing for a lifting of the ban, but they have as their fallback position more relaxed restrictions. Already, humanitarian assistance has been exempted and oil companies have successfully pushed through provisions to allow for some government aid -- through the Overseas Private Investment Corporation and the Trade Development Agency -- aimed at helping American companies doing business in Azerbaijan.
During his Washington visit, Mr. Aliyev made a point of condemning what he called the outsized influence of the Armenian lobby. But Mr. Aliyev's vehemence did not sit well with a member of that lobby, Ross Vartian.
"We're impassioned and focused, clearly," agreed Mr. Vartian, who is executive director of the Armenian Assembly of America, a Washington-based nonprofit group that pushed for the ban on aid to Azerbaijan. "But I wouldn't call us formidable. Yeah, we have a large grass-roots operation. But we also have the facts on our side.
"We're the David in this," Mr. Vartian added. "We aren't the Goliath."

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on March 2 about Azerbaijan's attempts to end restrictions on United States aid referred incorrectly to a company that is part of a consortium of oil corporations, which have an interest in the energy-rich region. The company is a former operation of Pennzoil that was sold to the Devon Energy Corporation but still uses the name; it is not Pennzoil-Quaker State.

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW;
A Legendary Filmmaker, But Without His Camera

BYLINE: By GRACE GLUECK 

 BODY:
"Drawing and dancing are branches of the same tree," wrote the Russian filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein (1898-1948). "Of course, they are just two varieties of the same impulse." It was the movement of line in the two disciplines that excited his imagination.
He was not very good at dancing, he confessed (except for one fox trot, which, though jerky, he had performed he said "with great panache" in Harlem). But at drawing, entirely self-taught, he excelled. If the stage and then the cinema had not claimed him, he could surely have made it as a graphic artist. 
 As it was, he drew -- in a wide range of styles, from caricature to Cubo-Futurism to Expressionism to Surrealism, and sometimes all at once -- for most of his life, even while pursuing weighty film projects like "Alexander Nevsky" (1938). For him drawing came as easily as talking. What he saw in his head begged to be embodied. "I form very sharp pictures of what I am reading or thinking about," he wrote. "These acutely visual images cry out intensely and painfully to be expressed on the page."
It was the same thrust that led to filmmaking. Like many of his cinematic colleagues, he sketched sets and lines of action on paper, but most of his drawings, from caricatures to erotic jokes to spiritual and religious imagery, did not relate directly to his films. They are vital artworks in their own right.
Some 5,000 of Eisenstein's drawings belong to the Russian State Archives of Literature and Art in Moscow, which has lent most of the more than 100 on view in "The Body of the Line: Eisenstein's Drawings," at the Drawing Center in SoHo. Also included are designs for costumes and sets from a private collection assembled by Lydia Naumova, a member of the production crew for Eisenstein's "Ivan the Terrible" (1946).
Ranging from student sketchbooks through the fruits of an ebullient Mexican period to his last works on paper, this exhibition gives Eisenstein's drawings their first museum exposure in the United States. It was produced by the Daniel Langlois Foundation for Art, Science and Technology in Montreal, and organized by Jean Gagnon, curator. (Lincoln Kirstein assembled a smaller show in a New York gallery in 1932.)
As a youth in Riga, the son of prosperous parents, Eisenstein made impish observations in line, like "Petrograd's Animals" (1915), a panel of cartoons with sardonic captions. In one, next to a drawing of a slumbering sloth and referring to the local government, he wrote: "They are found mainly in the Duma of the city and generally in places where there is a lot of work to be done." An accompanying parrot, a stand-in for journalists, is described as trying "to awaken the sloth in vain."
After studying architecture and engineering, Eisenstein served in the Red Army during the revolution, decorating propaganda trains, then gravitated to Moscow, where he worked to impressive effect with several theater groups as a designer and producer. His vivacious sketches for productions from 1918 through 1922 range from an Indian and clowns for an adaptation of Jack London's story "The Mexican" to a plump, snooty Polish grande dame in a ball gown and an architectural hairdo for a production of the Offenbach opera "Tales of Hoffmann."
A seven-year break in his drawing occurred between 1924-31, a period devoted largely to making films: "Strike" (1924), "The Battleship Potemkin" (1925), "Ten Days That Shook the World" (1928) and "Old and New" (1929). But in 1931, on a trip to Mexico, he took it up again. His drawing, he wrote, "underwent an internal catharsis, striving for mathematical abstraction and purity of line." But sensuality, too, played an important role.
Stimulated by Mexican art -- from Mayan reliefs to the popular illustrations of Jose Guadalupe Posada -- and what he described as the "actual, astonishing linear structure of the Mexican landscape," he made renditions of bulls and toreadors, Virgins and Christs spring to life on the page. In one, "Viva Christo Rey," a grotesque, Picassoid Jesus hangs from the cross; in another, "The Pardon," a crucified bull bends down to kiss a humbled toreador who kneels, hands bound, before him. At its best, Eisenstein's agile line glides fluently in its delineation of contour and its interlocking of shapes to produce strong, complex motifs.
Old Testament scenes also entered his repertory. In "Salome" (1932), the proud perpetrator admires the head of John the Baptist as his discarded body sits wanly in a corner. That same year Eisenstein drew a bizarre "Self-Portrait" whose double heads and torsos proclaim him half man, half woman, one head kissing the other as the crucified Christ and a Virgin figure stand nearby and a shrouded body lies on the floor.
The vigor of this portrait is balanced by several other images suggesting the malaise of a creative artist, perhaps occasioned by his struggles with Stalin's regime. (Until he made "Nevsky," the pressure of his work was compounded by carping at his lack of true revolutionary fervor.)
In "May It Die, This Dumb Nothingness" (1937), robotic dancers cavort on a round table, supported on the shoulders of one of them whose head pokes through a hole in the table's center. "I Look Into Nothingness," done the same day, portrays another robot bending over to examine a big, empty balloon.
In a lighthearted way, he contemplated death. Four drawings done in a single day in 1939 deal with the subject of life leaving the body. In one, life -- in the form of a skinny but vibrant creature with bright eyes above a functioning heart -- casts off a limp form that resembles a rag doll more than a human being. And yet his strength is reasserted in earthy drawings of performers, like the cartoony "Unemployed Circus Workers" (1943) and the sinuous "Harlem Snake Dancer" (1944).
In his 40's Eisenstein developed coronary problems; he died of a heart attack at 50. In some of his last drawings, too weak to pursue film projects, he seemed to muse on the, well, ineffable lightness of being. One day in December 1947, less than two months before his death, stroking the paper gently but firmly, he drew some sprightly individual nudes, each reaching up to catch a symbol of nature -- an apple, a butterfly, a dragonfly. Delicate as the drawings are, they convey a spirited affirmation.
 "The Body of the Line: Eisenstein's Drawings" is at the Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 219-2166, through March 18.

HEADLINE: THEATER REVIEW;
Putting the Nation on Trial For a 19th-Century Rampage

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
Potent history doesn't always make compelling drama, but in the case of "Defending the Light" the blood of the drama runs hot with issues and lessons that resonate across the decades of American life since the horrific events of the night of March 12, 1846.
In the premiere production, by Woodie King Jr.'s New Federal Theater, the playwright Ron Milner speaks to today's America through a murderous rampage carried out by a black man against a white family in Auburn, N.Y. 
 Part history, part tract, part sociological portrait, part courtroom drama, "Defending the Light," based on the Earl Conrad novel "Seward for the Defense," proves never less than interesting and thought-provoking, even though its cargo of combined relevance, injustice, controlled rage and questions about responsibility falls shy of theatrical combustion.
Mr. Milner, the author of such plays as "Checkmates" and "What the Wine Sellers Buy," invokes historical figures like William Seward, a former governor of New York and later Lincoln's Secretary of State, and the New York State Attorney General, John Van Buren, son of the former President, Martin Van Buren, in telling the story of the arrest and trial of the accused murderer, a young black named William Freeman. In so doing, Mr. Milner tries a nation on charges of extinguishing the bright lights among its young blacks, depriving them of education and hope of equality and condemning many of them to brutal prisons to nurture the economies of towns like Auburn, rife with discrimination and the impulse to impose death, lawfully or by lynching.
Mr. Milner asks: Could not such treatment by such a society drive a man mad? Does not such treatment hold a mirror to the society that inflicts it? Then as now the insanity defense proves controversial, and Seward, an outspoken liberal lawyer and political hopeful, risks his future in raising it when he comes to Freeman's defense.
In the smooth staging by Jay Broad on Robert Joel Schwartz's two-level planked set, which conveys 19th-century rusticity while it serves as various homes, clubs and the courtroom, "Defending the Light" uses flashbacks as it tells Freeman's story. Noteworthy performances are contributed by Eddie Robinson as Freeman, Ned Coulter as Van Buren, Lex Monson as the majestic Patriarch of the black community and Kathleen Turco-Lyon as the quick-witted and supportive Mrs. Seward.
The drama plays itself out in the context of its time and the political rivalry between the abolitionist Seward (James Kiberd) and the populist Van Buren. By all accounts, including those of the members of Auburn's black community, Freeman was a bright and industrious child with a yearning for knowledge and a promising future. As the old Patriarch says, he had the light: "He saw things in things."
But as a young man Freeman was sent to prison on flimsy evidence for a crime he swore he never committed, stealing a horse. By the time he emerged, after beatings, whippings and hours under torrents of frigid water, he was not the same. He was deaf, unable to find steady work and ranting about wanting to be paid.
When captured after the fatal knifings of a white man and the man's wife, mother-in-law and baby son, Freeman was a constantly smiling, hunched and twitching figure who said he did not believe that the law covered people like him. "The law is for everyone," Seward insists. "No one is outside the law."
"Defending the Light" suggests that this premise remains unresolved.

A Hundred and One Nights
Conjuring grand allusions, Agnes Varda's film salutes 100 years of movies with scores of clips from films and reflections from the stars.
For example, Marcello Mastroianni argues about bathtub scenes with Michel Piccoli (left), who presides over the film in a baronial chateau. 
 One of the odder movie bits shows Robert De Niro floating along in a swan boat with Catherine Deneuve to the tune of "Sentimental Journey."
Nevertheless, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, "whenever Ms. Varda galls her audience with such fluff, all she needs is a clip from 'Pickpocket' or 'The General' to make things right."
 
1995. Winstar. $89.98; DVD, $89.98. 101 minutes. French with English subtitles. No rating.
 
The Best Man
Harper (Taye Diggs) is the kind of novelist who has his book chosen by Oprah Winfrey's book club and floats in a candlelit bath full of rose petals. Titled "Unfinished Business," his novel has a character closely resembling an old flame (Nia Long), whom he re-encounters and has a tryst with in New York. Back home, his loyal love (Sanaa Lathan) stays true blue, demonstrating that "current movies about upscale black characters have much more solid traditional values than ones about catty white teenagers" (Maslin).
 
1999. Universal. $107.37; DVD, $24.98. 118 minutes. Closed captioned. R.
 
A Dog of Flanders
Missing no opportunity to oversentimentalize, Kevin Brodie's adaptation of the children's tale by Ouida, set in 19th-century Flanders, takes a poor boy named Nello (Jesse James as a 7-year-old and Jeremy James Klissner in later years) and his shaggy sheep dog, Patrasche, on a bumpy trip to the realization that Nello may be a rich kid after all. After an unpromising apprenticeship hauling milk for his grandfather (Jack Warden), Nello is taken in hand by the painter Michel La Grande (Jon Voight), who sees artistic promise in the lad. But a charge of arson and eviction into a blizzard don't make the going easier in a film "clogged with sticky-sweet pieties cooed to saucer-eyed tots" (Stephen Holden).
 
1999. Warner. $19.98. 90 minutes. Closed captioned. PG. Release date: March 7.
 
Sitcom
Francois Ozon's film begins promisingly with the sounds of screaming and gunfire disturbing the suburban calm. It seems the Father (Francois Marthouret) is displeased with his surprise birthday party. Through flashbacks we meet the Mother (Evelyne Dandry), a fusser and fretter, and their son (Adrien De Van), who declares himself gay, and daughter (Maria De Van), who has an erotic encounter with a rat, jumps out a window and becomes a paraplegic dominatrix. Though filmed with the look of a television comedy, "Sitcom" can't conceal "a sour streak that eventually poisons its humor" (Maslin).
 
1999. New Yorker. $94.98. 80 minutes. French with English subtitles. No rating. Release date: March 7.
 
STRAIGHT TO VIDEO
 
Other new titles of interest, some of which may have had a theater release, appeared on television or been on videocassette in earlier editions.
 
A FINE ROMANCE and two other British television comedies, NO, HONESTLY and COLD COMFORT FARM, are available in three boxed sets. In the 1980's series "A Fine Romance" (three cassettes, $39.95, 225 minutes), a high-powered translator (Dame Judi Dench) and a landscape gardener (Michael Williams, Dame Judi's husband) are thrown together by a matchmaking sister and brother-in-law. Going back a decade earlier, "No, Honestly" (three cassettes, $39.95, 175 minutes) matches an unemployed actor (John Alderton) and a debutante and aspiring writer (Pauline Collins) who look back on the rocky beginnings of their relationship. Adapted from Stella Gibbons's 1932 satire, the BBC's 1968 "Cold Comfort Farm" (three cassettes, $39.95, 135 minutes) stars Sarah Bedel as the orphaned London urbanite who retreats to rural Sussex and undertakes to salvage her Gothic agrarian relatives.

BYLINE: By Jesse McKinley

How About McGarden?
The Winter Garden Theater won't be changing its name after all.
Gerald Schoenfeld, the chairman of the Shubert Organization, which owns the theater, said yesterday that his company had ended discussions with General Motors about changing the name of the Winter Garden, home to "Cats," to the Cadillac Winter Garden, or some variation thereof, in exchange for corporate sponsorship. 
 No explanation was given for the abrupt end to the discussions, which had been continuing for about three years and which seemed to be close to fruition.
The announcement came just a day after the Roundabout Theater Company announced it was selling off the name of the historic Selwyn Theater, its new home, to American Airlines, a deal that was greeted on Broadway with a mix of approval and skepticism. The airline will pay $8.5 million (and, one would hope, a lifetime supply of free peanuts).
As for the Winter Garden, Mr. Schoenfeld offered no additional comment, and a call to General Motors was not immediately returned.
 
Vamoose, 'Vanya'
The new name notwithstanding, it's apparently taking a little longer than expected to get the Selwyn -- er, the American Airlines Theater -- ready for takeoff.
The theater formerly known as the Selwyn, at 229 West 42nd Street, is in the midst of a $21 million overhaul but nonetheless was scheduled to open its doors on April 11 for the first preview of "Uncle Vanya."
Now comes word that the construction isn't proceeding as quickly as expected, and that the company is in discussions with the Nederlander Organization to shift the run of "Vanya" to the Atkinson Theater.
Todd Haimes, the artistic director of the company, said that the possible move was a precautionary measure to assure that the show opens by the Tony deadline, which is May 3.
A shift would not be completely unexpected; the company has delayed the opening once. Still, it is sure to be a disappointment for the Roundabout, which had planned an array of events around its opening. The timing, too, is not ideal, coming just after the American Airlines deal.
The prospective shift of "Vanya" is made possible by another production decision: "Enigma Variations," which opened on Feb. 24 in Toronto, will not come to Broadway this season. The production had mainly favorable reviews in Toronto, but its producer, Emanuel Azenberg, has decided to pass on bringing the show to the Atkinson, where it was tentatively scheduled to open, opting instead to take it to London. "The economics over there are stultifyingly different," he said.
London productions are generally much cheaper than those in New York, owing to Broadway's steep labor and landlord costs. Mr. Azenberg said he was considering a possible autumn run in the United States.
 
Welcome to the Club
The staff of the Manhattan Theater Club can be excused for feeling a little emotionally drained. In the last six weeks, after all, it has closed one production ("Y2K"), transferred a second to a commercial run ("Fuddy Meers") and watched as the prospects of a third ("The Wild Party") were dashed by a round of sub-par reviews.
Still, Tuesday night's opening of "The Tale of the Allergist's Wife" provided a spurt of invigorating energy for many at the theater club. The play, an urban comedy by Charles Busch, received a round of strong notices.
Particular praise was saved for Linda Lavin, who plays Marjorie Taub, the Sartre-quoting depressive at the play's center. It is a character that this veteran New York actress says she understands instinctively. "This woman loves the drama of her life," Ms. Lavin said, adding with a laugh, "I know this woman."
The drama of Ms. Lavin's life may get even more high-stakes in coming weeks. The reviews for "Allergist" have given rise to talk of a longer run, with producers reportedly inquiring about two midsize Broadway houses where the current tenants are doing moderate business.
Whether those rumors pan out or not, Ms. Lavin is expected back on Broadway next spring in rotating revivals of Neil Simon's "Brighton Beach Memoirs" and "Broadway Bound," reprising her Tony-winning turn as Kate Jerome, the narrator's long-suffering mother.
 
Coming Attractions
Two ambitious additions to the spring schedule were announced this week.
Both are Off Broadway. At the New York Theater Workshop the artistic director, James C. Nicola, said two newly rewritten works by John Guare would be performed in repertory in May. They are the plays formerly known as "Gardenia" and "Lydie Breeze," first produced in 1982 and both about the lives of a group of friends in a 19th-century utopian commune.
Neither was well liked then, but Mr. Nicola said that after directing a well-received version of both plays in Washington in 1983 he had become convinced that they constituted "a 20th-century American classic."
Now the plays are being combined into one cohesive five-hour script, reworked by Mr. Guare, to be played over two nights, and renamed "Lydie Breeze, Part 1: Bulfinch's Mythology" and "Lydie Breeze, Part 2: The Sacredness of the Next Task." (There will be a quiz.)
Another surprise reprise is under way at the Irish Repertory Theater, where the artistic director, Charlotte Moore, announced that "Our Lady of Sligo," a hit at the Royal National Theater in London in 1998, would arrive in April.
The play, by Sebastian Barry, is part of a series of biographical works about his family. The "Lady" in question is Mr. Barry's grandmother, a part to be played by the Irish star Sinead Cusack. Max Stafford-Clark will direct.
Speaking from London, Ms. Cusack described the character as "damaged and damaging," traits familiar to characters of many recent Irish dramas. Why are her countrymen so ripe for humor and pain? "I think that's a universal condition," Ms. Cusack said. "The Irish are just more overt."

European Central Bank Holds Interest Rates Steady for Now

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, March 2

 BODY:
Despite worries about inflation and the euro's slump to a record low this week, the European Central Bank decided today not to raise interest rates, while warning that it would probably do so soon.
"The risks are increasing," said Wim Duisenberg, the president of the central bank, after a meeting here of the board of governors. "There can be no doubt in anybody's mind about the direction of monetary policy." 
 Mr. Duisenberg acknowledged that he was concerned about the euro, the single currency adopted a year ago by 11 European countries. Though conceived in part as a rival to the American dollar, the value of the euro has tumbled from $1.18 at its debut to 96.63 cents today.
On Monday, the euro dropped to nearly 94 cents before recovering a bit amid speculation -- apparently wrong -- that the central bank had intervened on its behalf.
European leaders insist they have no intention of propping up the euro through direct intervention, and Mr. Duisenberg explicitly denied the central bank had moved into currency markets on Monday.
But the persistent decline of the new currency has been disheartening, and Mr. Duisenberg said he was troubled by it on two counts.
The first concern, he said, is that the currency weakness will generate inflationary pressures by increasing the prices of imported goods. A second concern, he continued, is about "possible psychological effects" on the credibility of the currency itself.
The main reason for the decline against the dollar, most economists agree, is that the American economy is growing so much faster than that of Europe.
On top of that, the United States Federal Reserve has raised American interest rates more rapidly in recent months than the European Central Bank.
Mr. Duisenberg is now caught at one of the trickiest junctures he has faced since the introduction of the euro on Jan. 1, 1999.
The anemic growth in Europe's biggest economies has finally improved, and conditions are among the best they have been in years. At the same time, however, inflationary pressures are clearly building. Across the 11 euro nations, consumer prices climbed at an annual rate of 2 percent in January. That is right at the limit of what the European Central Bank considers acceptable.
Prices are climbing considerably faster than that in Europe's smaller but faster growing countries. Inflation is running at 4.4 percent a year in Ireland, while in Spain the rate is 2.9 percent. Italy, one of Europe's biggest yet weakest economies, has a rate of about 2.2 percent. Much of that reflects the surge in oil prices.
The European Central Bank has come under increasing criticism for sending mixed signals about its priorities. Until recently, many economists were convinced that it would raise interest rates today in another pre-emptive strike against rising prices.
Part of that expectation came from hawkish statements in the most recent monthly bulletin of the central bank. But in a newspaper interview published Monday, the bank's vice president, Christian Noyer, cautioned that people were reading too much into its bulletin and hinted that the bank was not yet ready to become more tightfisted.
"It seems like they are aiming at a broad consensus of all the members of the governing board," said Elga Bartsch, an economist with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in London.
In the 14 months since it assumed control of monetary policy for the euro countries, the European Central Bank has struggled to maintain its credibility in global markets even as it has watched the euro decline steadily the entire time.
Initially determined to run a hard-nosed policy aimed at preventing inflation above all else, it was forced to open its spigots last year, when European growth stalled as a result of financial crises in Asia, Russia and Latin America.
Last November it swung back to a hard-line stance, raising interest rates by half a percentage point, to 3 percent. In January, it followed up with a second increase, to 3.25 percent.
That still leaves baseline interest rates in Europe well below those in the United States, though its inflation rate is slightly lower as well.
At the moment, all signs point to a strong rebound in European growth. Germany, Europe's biggest economy but also its most sluggish, is growing at an annual rate of more than 2.5 percent -- a big improvement from 1999, when it grew a total of 1.5 percent.
For the euro zone as a whole, economists predict that growth will average about 3 percent in 2000, and perhaps slightly more.
"Economic conditions and perspectives in the euro area appear to be better at present than at any time in the past decade," Mr. Duisenberg said today, a sign that he is not worried that a tougher policy will put Europe back into a tailspin.

HEADLINE: Sales of New Homes Fall 4.2%, To Lowest Level in Four Months

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 2

 BODY:
Sales of new homes fell to the lowest level in four months in January, government figures showed today, signaling that higher borrowing costs are starting to discourage buyers.
Sales declined 4.2 percent in January, to an annual rate of 882,000 homes, after rising 4 percent in December, the Commerce Department said. The number of homes for sale, 326,000 at an annual rate, was the highest in more than three years, and the average price, $154,400, was the lowest in a year. 
 Higher interest rates "may have kept housing from getting stronger," said Tim McGee, chief economist at Tokai Bank Ltd. in New York. Still, overall consumer spending is growing as "the wealth created by the stock market has been enough to offset the moderate rise in rates over the last year," he said.
The Conference Board, the business-financed research group based in New York, said today that its index of leading economic indicators rose in January -- a sign that the nation's economic expansion, now in a record 108th month, will continue. The index increased 0.3 percent, the same as in the previous month.
January's rate of new-home sales was the lowest since 848,000 in September, with sales falling in the Midwest, the West and the South and rising in the Northeast.
The average price of a home in January declined to $154,400 from $164,000 in December.
"Interest rates have led to the flattening of the housing market the last few months," said Greg Jones, chief economist at Briefing.com in Jackson, Wyo.
Mortgage rates, which are often tied to the 10-year Treasury yield, are already higher after four rate increases by the Federal Reserve since June. This week, the average interest rate on a 30-year fixed home mortgage fell to 8.27 percent, still close to a 3 1/2-year high of 8.42 percent, according to Freddie Mac, the buyer of United States mortgages. Since reaching a recent low of 7.67 percent on Nov. 12, the mortgage rate has risen 60 basis points.

Some Oil Producing Countries Agree Output Should Rise

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: LONDON, March 2

 BODY:
With the high cost of oil and gasoline spreading alarm through Western economies, oil ministers from Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Mexico -- all among the world's major exporters -- met here today and agreed that production should be increased to stabilize prices, but they declined to make firm commitments on the timing or the amount.
Oil traders interpreted the absence of such commitments as an indication that producers might not meet demands by the United States and other oil-consuming nations for a substantial increase in output. 
 Oil prices, which have risen to nine-year highs in recent weeks and jumped 4 percent on Wednesday, ended little changed today on the vague outcome of the oil ministers' meeting in London. The London price of Brent crude for April delivery rose to $29.47 a barrel before settling back to $29.22, up 10 cents. In New York, oil for April delivery briefly rose to $32.15 a barrel before retreating to settle at $31.69, down 8 cents.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is scheduled to meet in Vienna on March 27 to decide whether to increase production or to maintain the present reduced output, as some exporters led by Iran, Libya and Algeria are demanding.
"OPEC still has moderates and still has price hawks," said Peter Gignoux, an oil analyst with Salomon Smith Barney here. "We still need to get a consensus. I think we are looking at high oil prices for a bit to come."
The Saudi oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, acknowledged today that "there is need for additional production," adding, "The issue is when and how much."
"Uppermost in our minds is to maintain stability in the market," he said, but refused to specify the likely scope of a production increase. "I think the number will be put forward when we finish our consultation with all other members.
"If you are seeking the number, you are not going to get it today," he told reporters. He also declined to say whether he was aiming at a specific price level and would not comment on suggestions that producers want oil prices in the United States to sink below $25 a barrel. "We are going to leave that up to the market for now," he said.
Delegates at the discussions here have said privately they expect production to be increased next month by 1 million or 1.2 million barrels a day; the United States would like to see production increase by 2 million to 3 million barrels a day.
World oil consumption runs at around 77 million barrels a day but, since OPEC agreed to deep production cuts last March, output has dropped to 75 million barrels a day. The shortfall of two million barrels a day has tripled oil prices since December 1998, when they had fallen to $10, the lowest in 12 years.
Retail gasoline prices have reached an average of $1.421 a gallon in the United States, the world's biggest oil consumer, and there is some expectation prices will reach $2 by the summer driving season, when demand is highest.
The United States energy secretary, Bill Richardson, who has just returned to Washington after a visit to major oil producers, has called the rising prices and dwindling supplies a threat to global economic growth.
Those views were echoed today by the French industry minister, Christian Pierret, who also warned producers that high prices would strangle their own markets in the West. "As far as France is concerned, the persistence of high prices could affect world economic growth and weigh on the inflationary pressures that might appear," he said.
OPEC's production cuts are set to expire on March 31. Historically, however, demand for oil falls in the second three months of the year with the arrival of spring in the Northern Hemisphere, and prices tend to weaken. That cyclical shift has provided OPEC's hawks with the argument against increased production.
"I accept that oil prices are high at the moment, but they will fall in the second quarter when we expect demand to drop by 2.8 million barrels per day," said Hossein Kazempour Ardebili, an Iranian oil ministry official. "If we increase output while demand is falling, it will be detrimental to prices."
Iran has previously called for the OPEC production cuts to be maintained through September and the official's remarks seem to signal continued deep division within OPEC about raising production levels.
"There's clearly no decision taken yet," said Frederic Lassere, an analyst at Societe Generale in Paris, who argued that of the three oil producers meeting here, Mexico was probably under greatest pressure from the United States to increase output.
Mexico is not a member of OPEC, which accounts for around one-third of worldwide oil production, but has agreed to cooperate with the group's decision at its Vienna meeting later this month. "We will wait to see this consensus before making our independent decision," the Mexican oil minister, Luis Tellez, said.

HEADLINE: Consumers' Spending Spree Continues Online and in Stores

BYLINE: By LESLIE KAUFMAN 

 BODY:
Even though the Federal Reserve raised interest rates, oil prices increased and the stock market grew more volatile, American consumers continued their spending spree in stores and on the Internet, two reports showed yesterday.
Rushing to stores to buy their jean jackets and tropical-print spring fashions early, shoppers gave merchants a stronger-than-expected month. Sales in stores open more than a year, a key industry measurement, rose 5.1 percent in February, according to the Goldman Sachs retail composite index. 
 "There were enough factors that together they could have caused the train to go off the track," said Jeff Feiner, a retail analyst for Lehman Brothers, "but consumer confidence has remained high, and we are optimistic about the first quarter."
The other good news came as the Commerce Department released its first official estimate of electronic commerce retail sales, which had previously been included with overall sales. The study found that $5.3 billion worth of goods and services were sold online in the fourth quarter of 1999. Although that number accounted for only 0.64 percent of the total retail economy of $821 billion for the quarter, the data confirmed sharp growth in Internet commerce.
The Commerce Department based its numbers on a survey of 12,000 Internet merchants selling products as diverse as cars, furniture and groceries. But the survey did not include travel services, financial brokers and dealers and ticket sales -- categories consulting firms often included in online predictions.
February is not a significant month on the retail calendar, accounting for only about 6 percent of sales in a year. As a result, most analysts were not adjusting profit predictions for the companies despite the results. "Even though most of my companies have outperformed, I am not changing earnings estimates," said George Strachan, a Goldman, Sachs retail analyst.
Retailers that performed strongest last month were at opposite ends of the price spectrum. On the luxury side were Saks Inc., whose sales rose 8 percent, and Neiman Marcus, up 11.2 percent. Among the discounters, Costco continued its red-hot streak, with an increase of 13 percent.

HEADLINE: Saul Steinberg: A Model for Today's Internet Barons

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
HOT stocks traded for hundreds of times their earnings, if they had any. Companies with concepts that caught the eye of eager investors could acquire companies many times their size. Public enthusiasm for stocks was higher than at any time since the 1920's.
The late 1960's, memorably termed the Go-Go Years by the great financial writer John Brooks, are largely forgotten now. They shouldn't be. 
 No man better exemplified that era than Saul P. Steinberg. He was the survivor, a man wise enough in his youth to both come up with a concept that would captivate investors and then to realize that the riches bestowed upon him would be ephemeral if he did not use his ridiculously overvalued stock to buy something that had real value.
Mr. Steinberg, now just 60 years old, announced this week that he is stepping down as chief executive of Reliance Group Holdings, the insurance company that he took over in 1968, although he is staying on as chairman.
His departure is not exactly being mourned, for Reliance is in dreadful shape, with its stock trading as if its remaining insurance operations were worth less than nothing. He did far better for himself, taking generous salaries and bonuses, than he did for Reliance's public shareholders. He was much better at identifying values than he was at running companies.
But it is not for what he did lately that Mr. Steinberg will be best remembered. It was in 1961, at the tender age of 22, that he pioneered the computer leasing business. I.B.M., which made the computers, was not interested in offering long-term leases, and Mr. Steinberg saw a niche. Whether or not that business would be profitable in the long run depended on how well old computers would hold their value, but with the right accounting assumptions his company, named Leasco, could and did show instant profits. It went public in 1965 and the stock zoomed. Three years later, that hot stock enabled Leasco to take over Reliance, a dull but prosperous insurance company that was nearly 10 times its size.
Leasco, it turned out, was not worth anything close to what Wall Street thought it was. But Reliance was a real asset, and Mr. Steinberg had an operation that would keep him in business even when that era vanished.
The beginning of the end of the Go-Go Years may, in fact, be dated to Mr. Steinberg's disastrous 1969 attempt to have Leasco take over Chemical Bank of New York, then the sixth-largest bank in the United States. Suddenly Leasco's inflated stock came under attack, and Mr. Steinberg had to withdraw his offer as Leasco's share price withered. "I always knew there was an Establishment," he said later. "I just used to think I was part of it." Within a few years the country was in recession, the stock market had collapsed, and the public had lost interest in stocks.
In later years, Mr. Steinberg tried more raids, but the really big targets, such as Disney before Michael Eisner turned it around, eluded him. He took his empire private in 1982, when stock prices were very low, and then sold stock in Reliance to the public in 1986, when the bull was roaring.
It is not easy for a company with a sizzling stock to go against the Wall Street grain and use those shares to buy an unloved company. Some America Online owners are outraged that its Internet operations will be diluted by boring assets, and AOL is down 24 percent since it agreed to buy Time Warner. But the people running many a hot Internet company now would do well to ponder Saul Steinberg's staying power, and to follow his example.

HEADLINE: RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE;
A Luxury Condo Project on Fifth Avenue Is Attracting Buyers

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
Scaffolding covers a former 11-story office building at 838 Fifth Avenue and East 65th Street as it is transformed into one of Manhattan's newest and more expensive condominiums, complete with separate staff apartments and wine and storage units.
When work is finished in a year, the building will have 10 condominium apartments, including a penthouse, ranging from 4,522 to 5,423 square feet and from $9 million to $18 million. To make apartments of the desired size possible, the developers are expanding the landmark limestone building, built in 1950 for the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, by adding one floor and a 10-story addition along 65th Street. 
 The building will have seven ground-floor studio apartments for staff members, measuring 257 to 339 square feet and selling -- but only in conjunction with the purchase of a larger apartment -- for an average of $500,000 each. Nine 45 square-foot wine cellars and 15 storage units, with 30 to 111 square feet, will be in the basement. Prices for those units are $50,000 and $30,000, respectively.
Since sales started in September, five apartments, each occupying a full floor -- except the penthouse, which fills two floors -- have been sold and a sixth is under contract to be sold, said Bret S. Bobo, director of sales for 838 Associates L.L.C., the development group of the $79 million project. Principals in the development company are A. Alfred Taubman, chairman of both Sotheby's and the Taubman Group, a shopping center development and management company, and Louis M. Dubin and Metin Negrin, both of the Athena Group, a real-estate investment and development company in Manhattan.
Residential brokers say the sales at 838 Fifth Avenue reflect the demand for large luxury apartments at the highest rung of the market, which they describe as units priced at $3 million or more. "It is the smallest segment," said Kirk Henckels, a senior vice president at the Manhattan brokerage of Stribling & Associates, who specializes in the sale of such apartments. "But the demand is incredible, particularly for condos, which has been enhanced by the lack of prewar co-ops and buyer frustration with board approval for purchasing and renovating units."
Despite this demand, the number of condominium units being built has decreased. According to the Real Estate Board of New York, there were 113 plans for condominiums, with 3,696 units, filed last year with the New York State attorney general's office, down from 125 plans, with 4,105 units, in 1998. In 1986, at the peak of the last building boom, plans were filed for 6,463 units.
Mr. Henckels said the constraints were tighter on large luxury units in "top-tier locations" like Fifth and Park Avenues and Central Park West, pushing developers, and by extension buyers, into "emerging locations" like Third Avenue and parts of downtown.
In turn, prices are rising. Stribling's 1999 year-end report on the luxury market found that prices had risen at least 25 percent over the preceding year, with condos generally selling for $1,800 to $3,100 a square foot. Mr. Henckels said that while current prices for luxury condos as well as other housing types "seem high, in reality incomes have risen faster than real estate prices." He added that, assuming a stable economy and stock market, "prices have room to increase still further."
At 838 Fifth Avenue, the sale prices per square foot "are where they should be" at $1,660 to $3,369 for the apartments, most with direct views of Central Park, Mr. Bobo said, noting that the average price for the units already sold was $2,400 a square foot.
He said the developers were drawn to the building because "it was the only opportunity left in a prime location," on Fifth Avenue with Central Park frontage between East 60th Street and the upper 90's, "to convert to condominiums."
In October 1998, 838 Associates bought the building for $30 million from the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, which moved to 633 Third Avenue at 40th Street. Though the union first sold the building through a sealed bid to Beit Yaakov, a Sephardic congregation, which had wanted to rebuild it as a synagogue, that sale never closed, and ultimately the building was sold to the development group.
To create the apartments the developers envisioned, they also purchased, for $7 million, the adjacent property at 2 East 65th Street, which has been razed, and combined it with the 20-foot-deep rear yard behind 838 Fifth Avenue to provide room for the 10-story addition. A 12th floor will be added to the original building to form the penthouse. The project was granted a certificate of appropriateness from the Landmarks Preservation Commission last August.
Most of the interior of the former office building has been demolished and is now being reshaped to apartments with mostly nine-foot-high ceilings. Layouts of the units, designed by Schuman Lichtenstein Claman & Efron, a Manhattan architectural firm, also include three to five bedrooms, corner living rooms of up to 20 by 47 feet and libraries with wood-burning fireplaces. Buyers who choose to finish their own space are given credit off the purchase price, Mr. Bobo said.
Planned amenities include a rooftop terrace. Monthly common charges, including real-estate taxes, for the apartments are expected to be $9,676 to $13,879. The cost for one each of the staff apartments and wine and storage units adds $573 to $708 more to the monthly fee.
The project's architect, Beyer Blinder Belle of Manhattan, will clad the exterior of the 10-story addition with limestone from the same quarry in Indiana that provided the stone for the original building. New windows and limestone embellishments will be added to that building's facade to give it a more residential look.
But when residents start moving in next March, they will find that one of the most notable details of the old facade has been preserved: the inscription "Love Thy Neighbor as Thyself."

HEADLINE: U.S. Sends Rescue Team to Help Flood-Ravaged Mozambique

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 2

 BODY:
The United States began sending search-and-rescue teams to Mozambique today and sent additional emergency supplies in response to weeks of severe flooding in southern Africa.
The American aid is expected to eventually involve about 500 people, five MH-53 cargo helicopters and five C-130 transport planes, according to Capt. Bob Pritchard, a spokesman for the United States European Command in Stuttgart, Germany. 
 Ten military specialists from Europe are en route to Mozambique to join a dozen others already there, Captain Pritchard said.
President Clinton said in a statement, "All Americans have been deeply moved by the tragic events in southern Africa."
The United States had already pledged $12.8 million for the flood relief effort, including money for a 14-member team from the Miami-Dade Fire Rescue Department, to travel to Mozambique. The team will be taking three inflatable rescue boats and three small trucks.
"Our primary mission will be rescuing people from the high areas and taking them to the shelters," said Lt. Louie Fernandez, a rescue team spokesman in Miami.
The MH-53 helicopters, which can carry about 38 people and have infrared systems for operating at night, are suited for search and rescue, a Pentagon spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, said.
The C-130 aircraft will conduct in-flight refueling of the helicopters, enabling them to travel much greater distances, Mr. Bacon said. Most of the flood zone can be reached only by helicopter.
About 2,400 blankets, 6,000 water cans and 160 rolls of plastic sheeting to build emergency shelters have already been flown into Mozambique by an American C-17 aircraft.
Those supplies, which were provided by the United States Agency for International Development, were to be distributed by the United Nations, the government of Mozambique and South African military units.
The American aid package will also provide $7 million worth of food as well as sandbags, shovels and wheelbarrows.
The flooding is the result of several weeks of torrential rains that have killed more than 150 people in Mozambique, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Swaziland and Botswana.

HEADLINE: High U.N. Official Sees Loss of Rights in China

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING, March 2

 BODY:
The United Nations' top human rights official expressed deep concern here today over what she called a deterioration in China's human rights practices.
"I am concerned about three areas, of expression, freedom of religion and freedom of association," Mary Robinson, high commissioner for human rights, said at a news conference after meeting senior Chinese officials. 
 She gave her assessment less than three weeks before the annual session of the United Nations Human Rights Commission, starting on March 20 in Geneva, where the United States plans to offer a resolution to censure China's rights record.
Ms. Robinson declined to comment on the resolution. Her remarks here may bolster the American case. But the resolution has little chance of passing, diplomats said, because China can muster a majority of countries to oppose it as unwarranted meddling in its internal affairs.
In meetings today with Deputy Prime Minister Qian Qichen and other officials, Ms. Robinson presented her concerns about developments over the last year and a half. Those included the arrests and lengthy prison sentences given to democracy advocates, what Ms. Robinson termed "a notable clampdown on religious expression," and the repression of labor organizers and the Falun Gong spiritual movement.
She gave the government a written report detailing violations of international rights standards and listing numerous individuals who had been imprisoned without fair legal procedures.
At the same time that Ms. Robinson spoke, the Foreign Ministry said in a regular press briefing that only the people of China had the right to judge whether their rights were worsening or improving.
"The Chinese people are satisfied" with the freedoms they enjoy, said a spokesman for the ministry, Zhu Bangzhao, who called on Ms. Robinson to cooperate with China "on the basis of mutual respect."
Ms. Robinson, a former president of Ireland, was clearly mindful of China's prickliness and offered praise for what she called the country's continued progress in "economic and social rights" and efforts to improve criminal procedures. But she was frank in her critique of the record in the core freedoms and legal safeguards enshrined in international declarations.
Ms. Robinson had hoped for agreement this week on a long-discussed program of technical cooperation with China, to study how its laws and criminal practices can be brought into compliance with the two international rights covenants that China has signed but not ratified.
No such agreement was announced today. But Ms. Robinson said she had been assured that the Chinese expected to sign on to the program this year.
Ms. Robinson said she was encouraged that the Chinese Parliament had begun discussing the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which China signed in 1997. But she said no such progress was evident in the case of the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, signed in 1998, and warned that China would have to make wide-ranging changes to bring its legal practices in line with international standards.
Among other changes, Ms. Robinson said, the notorious system of "reform through labor," in which accused criminals and opponents of the state are sent to labor camps for up to three years without trials or basic legal protections, would have to be phased out. As of 1997, according to government figures, 230,000 people were held in such labor camps, and the government has given no sign that it would seriously consider abolishing the system.
Ms. Robinson said she had been alarmed to hear of proposals for a new law to govern the reform-through-labor system, as though that would raise its legitimacy. "Bad law can be a tyranny," she said.
Ms. Robinson was here for a United Nations workshop on human rights in Asia. The Chinese press today featured the workshop as a sign of progress and carried President Jiang Zemin's congratulatory message to the forum in which he praised the global development of human rights, in keeping with the cultural traditions and needs of each country.
"China has made tremendous efforts on the human rights front, and it has achieved successes that have astonished the world," he said.
Last week, after the State Department had in its annual report on rights castigated China for regressing, China issued its own report on human rights violations in the United States like racism and prisoner mistreatment. China's newspapers have prominently covered the trial of four New York City police officers who fatally shot Amadou Diallo, a West African immigrant, and were acquitted of all charges.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Major U.S. Markets Tread Water Waiting for Jobs Report

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks moved higher yesterday while the Nasdaq market sagged as traders await a jobs report that the Federal Reserve will probably consider when mulling more interest-rate increases.
"It is certainly nice to see sponsorship of the old-economy stocks," said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Company. "Throwing 29 points off the Nasdaq is like throwing a deck chair off the Titanic. It doesn't really do much. We are going to be on pins and needles going into the employment numbers." 
 Before the market opens today, the Labor Department will release employment data for February, with analysts expecting the jobless rate to remain unchanged at 4 percent.
The estimates also call for 206,000 jobs to have been created outside the farm sector.
The Dow Jones industrial average ended up 26.99 points, or 0.27 percent, at 10,164.92, led by AT&T , which rose 6 5/16 , to 54 1/8, on investor interest in United States telecommunications.
SBC Communications, a Baby Bell, advanced 2 1/2, to 44 1/2. Telecommunications shares have been active recently on reports of strategic partnerships and other business initiatives.
The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index edged up 2.57 points, or 0.19 percent, to 1,381.76.
The Nasdaq composite index lost 29.57 points, or 0.62 percent, to 4,754.51. The technology-laden index lost ground after Palm Inc., one of this year's most-talked-about initial public offerings, made its Wall Street debut. Palm, which makes the line of hand-held organizers that can connect to the Internet, was offered to select investors at $38 and ended at 95 1/16 , after opening at 145.
But its parent company, 3Com, slid 22 5/16 , to 81 13/16 , with the stock the most actively traded on Nasdaq.
3Com has more than doubled from $40 a share to more than $100 a share since Dec. 13, when it announced the spinoff of the Palm division.
"The Palm I.P.O. may mark a near-term top for Nasdaq because there was so much anticipation building up," said Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Ltd. "People buy on the expectation and sell on the event, and there's an awful lot of room for profit taking in some sectors after the last two weeks of strong performance."
Wall Street brushed off positive news on the inflation front. The Commerce Department reported that Americans bought new homes at a slower-than-expected pace in January, a sign that higher borrowing costs may be starting to weigh on one of the most interest-rate-sensitive sectors of the economy.
Traders instead are awaiting the February payroll numbers.
The tight labor market has been one of the Federal Reserve's biggest concerns, with Wall Street still predicting that the central bank will raise interest rates this month to slow down the economy. A stronger-than-expected jobs report could fan fears of aggressive Fed action to stop inflation.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	Treasuries Trade Narrowly
By Bloomberg News
Treasury bonds prices traded in the narrowest range of the week yesterday, a day before an employment report that investors and analysts expect will point to faster growth and inflation.
"You have a red-hot economy and the raw material for inflation," said Alan Kral, who helps manage $800 million at Trevor Stewart Burton & Jacobsen.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 8/32 , to 101 18/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.14 percent from 6.15 percent on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Nothing Left to Buy?;
Pondering the Indiscreet Charm of the Superrich

BYLINE: By LAURA M. HOLSON 

 BODY:
Rex Golding, a partner at Softbank Technology Ventures, has made a lot more money than he had ever expected. But even among the circle he associates with, things are getting a little out of hand.
"My 6-year-old is starting to say things like, 'their house is bigger,' " Mr. Golding said, recalling a recent drive through his neighborhood in Menlo Park, Calif., in the heart of Silicon Valley. "She knows the different cars. It is troubling to me." 
 Peter Kiernan, a senior executive at the Goldman Sachs Group, attended an Ivy League party last fall where one recent graduate boasted he would own a fleet of personal airplanes by age 30. " 'I don't just want wealth,' " Mr. Kiernan said the young man told him. " 'I want plane wealth.' "
Keeping up with the Joneses used to mean buying a vacation home, a BMW perhaps, first-class airplane tickets. But your own fleet of planes? These days, though, even the superrich are finding that the rules of the game are being rewritten with each stock market move. In a world of instant windfalls where companies go public without ever earning a profit, a 10-figure fortune buys more freedom than nine, an eight-figure sum buys more than seven. So much so that at least two distinct classes among the rich have emerged -- the haves and the have s'mores.
Even the nearly newest of nouveau riche -- those who made their millions a decade ago in the Wall Street gold rush -- feel out of sorts with the fresh-faced generation filling its coffers today. And that angst pervades almost every conversation about their generally younger, often richer peers from the 90's.
Just ask Nelson Peltz who, in his heyday, was a confidant of Michael R. Milken, the former Drexel Burnham Lambert junk bond maven. Mr. Peltz made much of his wealth investing in troubled companies in the 1980's. No pauper, he caused a stir when he bought the singer Mariah Carey's $20 million estate in Westchester County, N.Y., and he has appeared on the Forbes list of richest executives for almost a decade, with a net worth estimated at $890 million.
"I'm like old money these days," Mr. Peltz complained one afternoon at his office on Park Avenue in Manhattan. "You see these young guys worth $3 billion to $4 billion, and you think to yourself, 'What have I done wrong?' I feel like the guy who has to say to his kids 'Go back to work because we can't make ends meet anymore.' "
O.K., he is joking -- at least a little. But an even bigger contrast between then and now is that people like Mr. Peltz were vilified a decade ago for flaunting their wealth in what was often called the Greed Decade. Not so today. The rich now, an overwhelming number of whom have profited from the technology boom, seem to be lauded as new-economy celebrities and have yet to experience the backlash of a disapproving public. And while some fear that is bound to happen, for now at least the benefits to the economy from new technology is helping to insulate the dot-com wunderkinds from attack.
Yet even this era's more restrained haves, it seems, have lost perspective in this time of fast, abundant riches. Consider Dave Welsh. As senior director for corporate development at Portal Software in Cupertino, Calif., he said, he has a stock option package worth tens of millions of dollars. But that is small change compared with the options given to John Little, Portal's chief executive and founder, who is now worth more than $1 billion.
"I don't have John's money," Mr. Welsh said, almost apologizing. "I'm normal."
True, being worth millions does not count for as much these days. Even the billionaires' club is getting a little crowded. Forbes magazine, in its annual effort to name the richest 400 Americans, counted 267 last year with a net worth of more than $1 billion, compared with just 13 in 1982. But it is not just the growing number that is causing the stir, but more importantly the very visible way in which those riches, mainly derived from stock ownership in newly public companies, can be monitored almost hourly by market watchers and journalists.
"It has created this mania to be rich," said Edward Wolff, a professor of economics at New York University. "The focus on other people's money has created a materialistic and self-serving milieu."
If anyone would know, Mr. Wolff would. For several years, he has been studying wealth and its impact on American society. The number of households with a net worth of more than $10 million, according to his research, has grown fourfold the last decade from about 67,700, to almost 350,000. And corporate executives are pocketing a lot of that money. In 1988, for instance, the average chief executive's salary was 40 times that of the average employee. A decade later, Mr. Wolff said, a chief executive made 400 times what the average employee did.
The wealthy are hitting the jackpot at younger ages, too. Today, 5 of every 100 people in the top 1 percent of the wealthiest Americans are 35 years or younger, compared with a fraction of a percent just 17 years ago. "Wealth today is more of a result of entrepreneurial activity than inheritance," he said. "It's not just the coupon clippers anymore."
If any executive has fast become the model of the new monied class it is Meg Whitman, chief executive of eBay, the online auction site. Two years ago, Ms. Whitman was a little-known marketer selling Teletubbies at the toymaker Hasbro. But today she is seen almost as often as that other most-talked-about female billionaire, Martha Stewart.
In the last year, Ms. Whitman has been on the cover of five magazines (she was anointed one of the most powerful women executives by Fortune); appeared almost 20 times on CNN and CNBC; sat through 15 photo shoots, including sessions for Vanity Fair and Glamour; and been mentioned hundreds of times in major newspapers and magazines. Her net worth (she had stock options worth close to $1 billion, according to recent government filings) is fodder for online chatter.
But that intrusion into her personal life is wearing a little thin. One evening, Ms. Whitman and her family were trapped at an ice cream shop in Palo Alto, Calif., delayed after several strangers grabbed her to chat. And at restaurants, diners whisper and point when she walks in the room.
"You know how you watch movies and you follow a star's career?" she recently mused. "You feel like you know them. But when you meet them, you have to hold yourself back. I think that is a little bit of what is going on now."
As the focus of where wealth is generated most quickly has shifted from Wall Street and Hollywood to Silicon Valley, the scale has escalated as well. Remember when Mr. Milken was chided for making $550 million in salary and bonuses in 1987? Pierre Omidyar, who founded eBay so that his wife would have a place to trade Pez dispensers and is now worth billions, owned stock options worth $661 million the day eBay went public in 1998.
At Harry Winston, the high-end jewelers at Fifth Avenue and 56th Street in Manhattan, a growing army of Internet millionaires barely out of college are splurging on diamond engagement rings at $125,000 to $1 million each.
And one young entrepreneur who could not be with his friends on New Year's Eve had his own affair last fall -- a black-tie dinner at Windows on the World at the World Trade Center in lower Manhattan, where 200 people danced until a wall-size clock brought in for the evening struck midnight. The cost? About $120,000, or $30,000 an hour.
Of course, many on Wall Street have been the beneficiaries of selling shares in Internet companies like eBay to an eager public. But some cannot help missing the spotlight they once enjoyed.
"All these cyberbillionaires, in a perverse way, have put Wall Street in its place," said Michael Biondi, chief executive of Wasserstein Perella & Company, the investment advisory boutique that helped mastermind many of the corporate takeovers of the 1980's.
Dinesh D'Souza, a research scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and author of a forthcoming book, "The Moral Conundrum of Success," said that among the monied class, wealth is less about a dollar figure than how secure a person feels about it. Much of the wealth created these days is tied up in stock option packages that are subject to the vagaries of a volatile stock market. So while a billionaire is assured the same grand life even if his stock price drops in half, someone who is worth, say, $50 million, may not feel so comfortable.
George Bell, chief executive of the Internet portal Excite@Home, acknowledges that he used to track his stock options several times a day after each market tick. But that exhilaration wore off as soon as his wealth became the talk of the party circuit.
"One of the first things people ask is: 'How much are you worth?' " he said. "You kind of laugh at first. But now it has gone out of my psyche. You've got to get over it."
That is not so easy to do. Unlike earlier generations, many of the new rich were raised in middle-class homes and seem awestruck by their good fortune. Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon.com, for instance, likens his success to winning the lottery.
But there is a practical side to such humility, too. "The new money doesn't want to separate itself from the population at large," Mr. D'Souza said. "They are not sure they can defend their extravagances."
Mr. D'Souza said the most affluent Americans have an income of at least $10 million a year and assets of $100 million or more. The merely rich earn $1 million to $10 million a year, with assets of $10 million to $100 million. The difference between the two is scale. The rich own two homes, he said, while the superrich own homes around the world. And besides, the superrich get something the merely rich do not. "Great wealth, even if it is paper wealth," he said, "propels people into celebrity."
On a Sunday afternoon last December, a crush of cars filled the parking lot in front of Buck's restaurant in Woodside, Silicon Valley's equivalent of Morton's in West Hollywood. For years, entrepreneurs and wealthy venture capitalists gathered weekdays to discuss ideas over coffee and toast. But Saturdays and Sundays have lately been given over to camera-carrying tourists and television news crews eager to catch a glimpse of a Silicon Valley billionaire, who is now more likely to be holed up in his home miles away.
Such notoriety is producing some fear among many in the entrepreneurial class who are beginning to sense a rising tide of resentment toward those who became too rich, too fast. Most hope they will not be remembered as many of their predecessors of the 1980's were.
"In 20 years if all these people go out and make a difference, there will be no backlash," Mr. Little, the chief executive of Portal Software, said. "But if all they end up with is 14 cars, 3 houses, and the jet -- the symbols of wretched excess -- there will be."

HEADLINE: Accused Killer of 3 Is Linked to Racist Writing

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WILKINSBURG, Pa., March 2

 BODY:
A black man accused of killing three people and wounding two in a shooting rampage had anti-white writings in his apartment and singled out whites during the attack, reassuring a black woman in his path, "Not you, sister," the authorities and witnesses said today.
A third victim of the rampage died tonight; two others remain in critical condition. 
 "The general tenor was that he wasn't shooting anybody but whites," Lt. John Brennan said today of the man, Ronald Taylor.
Tonight, the police charged Mr. Taylor with ethnic intimidation, Pennsylvania's term for a hate crime, accusing him of setting fire to his apartment and shooting the men with malicious intent "toward white males," court documents said. The Federal Bureau of Investigation also said it had initiated a civil rights investigation.
District Justice Alberta Thompson asked Mr. Taylor if he had any history of mental illness. He replied yes. No details were available.
Mr. Taylor was initially charged with two counts of criminal homicide, an umbrella charge covering murder and manslaughter in Pennsylvania. The police took him before Judge Thompson tonight and charged him with the hate crime, five counts of aggravated assault, one count of arson, a firearms violation and one count of causing a catastrophe. He is being held without bail on the homicide charges.
Mr. Taylor, a 39-year-old jobless man, is accused of shooting a maintenance worker at his apartment building and four other people at two fast-food restaurants on Wednesday in working-class Wilkinsburg, a town of 22,000 six miles east of Pittsburgh. All five victims were white men.
Mr. Brennan said that when the police searched Mr. Taylor's home on Wednesday night, they found anti-white writings.
Joyce Ambrose, who was briefly held hostage by Mr. Taylor said he told another black woman, "Not you, sister," as he threatened to shoot others.

HEADLINE: In Talks, Union Seeks Big Raise From City

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Leaders of a union representing New York City school safety officers and housing authority workers took a tough line yesterday when they met with city officials to kick off a new round of citywide labor negotiations.
Carl Haynes, president of Teamsters Local 237, demanded that the 18,000 city workers he represents receive a wage increase substantially above inflation and a cash bonus to compensate for the two-year wage freeze the workers accepted in their old contract. 
 Mr. Haynes's local was the first of 100 municipal unions to begin bargaining with city officials as part of a new wave of negotiations that will cover teachers, police officers, firefighters, sanitation workers and others -- close to 300,000 workers in all. Through coordination by the Municipal Labor Coalition, an alliance of municipal unions, each union has agreed to demand a raise substantially higher than inflation.
"For two years, we've witnessed and heard endless discussions about the economic prosperity the city, state and federal governments are enjoying," Mr. Haynes said, "but none of that prosperity has trickled down to city workers. We're saying, 'It is about time.' "
Mr. Haynes's local represents school safety officers, police officers at city-owned hospitals and more than a dozen categories of housing authority workers, including maintenance workers, superintendents and heating technicians. The contract for some of those employees expired on Dec. 31; for others, the contract will expire on March 31. The union's workers make from $20,000 to more than $40,000 a year.
A delegation of 100 representatives from the union met for 90 minutes yesterday with James F. Hanley, the city's labor commissioner. Mr. Haynes and Mr. Hanley said the meeting was devoted to the union's presenting its demands.
"We'll take a look at them, we'll analyze them and we'll get back to them with our own proposals," Mr. Hanley said. "It was an uneventful first session."
Mr. Hanley said that at the next session, which has not been scheduled, he would present the city's demands, including Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's demand that all wage increases be based on merit. Mr. Haynes denounced that idea, saying managers would award raises based on favoritism and patronage.
Mr. Giuliani announced yesterday that a newly named deputy mayor, Robert M. Harding, would oversee the city's collective bargaining.
One of Mr. Haynes's key demands was for no layoffs in any new contract. He also called for reducing employees' pension contributions, having a cost-of-living adjustment for pension benefits and having a 401(k) retirement plan with an employer match. He also demanded on-site child care and expanded vacations and sick leave.
The Giuliani administration has often said that it will not grant raises unless unions agree to productivity increases that finance the raises. But Mr. Haynes proposed that the city and union share any savings from past and future productivity increases.
"City workers have had no real wage increases in the last 20 years," Mr. Haynes said. "We have answered the city's call time and again for cooperation, taken benefit reductions, deferred funds owed to us, and now it's time for the pendulum to swing the other way. We want our fair share of the pie. We've earned it."

HEADLINE: NYC;
Who Needs Diplomacy In This Town?

BYLINE: By Clyde Haberman 

 BODY:
THREE years ago, apparently feeling that he could always use a few more enemies, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani went on a crusade against the United Nations and its many diplomats who sniffed at New York's parking laws with the disdain they might give an indifferent Burgundy. You may remember how the mutual nyah-nyah's flew.
The mayor was so exercised about unpaid parking fines that he allowed how he didn't care if the United Nations packed up and moved elsewhere. Never mind that his own administration put the diplomats' contribution to the city economy at more than $3 billion a year. 
 For their part, some General Assembly delegates threatened to take the parking dispute to the World Court in The Hague, where issues run more along the lines of NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia and the legal status of the Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet. Talk about dumbing down diplomacy, some New Yorkers said.
Eventually, the dust settled. Outrage on Manhattan's East Side, the heart of diplo-land, has turned of late to Donald J. Trump's monster apartment tower on First Avenue, which will dwarf the United Nations complex and everything around it.
But the Great Ticket Tiff seemed worth revisiting, if only because the issue is a hardy perennial, like the circus coming to town or Darryl Strawberry's nose for trouble. If you want to get some New Yorkers' blood boiling, just whisper "diplomats" and "tickets" in the same sentence.
Well, an interesting thing has happened. Mr. Giuliani's browbeating, often an irritant to much of the populace, produced impressive results on this one. Since he made a big deal about foreign scofflaws, the number of parking summonses slapped on diplomats' cars has gone down -- way down.
Last year's total was 44,079, according to the mayor's Office of Operations. That is less than one-third the 1996 figure, 143,508. Naturally, the money owed also declined sharply. The 1996 total was $15.8 million. In 1999, that shrank to $4.8 million, a sum so small it would not keep the city government running for 70 minutes.
This is not a case of the police suddenly sitting on their ticket-writing hands, city officials and diplomats agree. Rather, they say, foreign missions and consulates got the message that the days of blithely tossing summonses into the trash or the paper shredder were over.
Some of the more notorious scofflaws of the past, like old Soviet-bloc countries and Israel, now rent spaces in garages instead of leaving cars wherever they feel like on the street. The results, in some instances, almost qualify for a Ripley's entry.
Russia, long the scofflaw king, received a staggering 32,350 parking summonses in 1996. Last year, it got a paltry 372. Ukraine in the same period dropped to 224 from 2,689; Belarus to 46 from 1,987; Israel to 311 from 4,739.
In the last two years, the city's figures also show, the scofflaw parade has been led by Egypt, followed by three countries whose oil wealth has not kept them from being deadbeats: Nigeria, Indonesia and Kuwait.
"We have spoken with our people and underlined that good relations with the city is one of our main goals," said Kirill Speransky, a spokesman for the Russian Mission. An Israeli official made a similar point. So did Ambassador Sotirios Zackheos of Cyprus, who is chairman of the United Nations Committee on Relations with the Host Country.
"We are more sensitive in respecting the traffic regulations," Mr. Zackheos said. "There is nothing like the crisis situation of three years ago." That goes for the police, too, he added. Officers have been known to single out cars with diplomatic plates, even when legally parked. That sort of harassment has faded, the ambassador said.
MIND you, many countries still refuse to pay the tickets they get. "Give me parking or give me death" remains the attitude at some consulates, a city official said. There is not much that the mayoral bully pulpit can do about it.
Enforcement lies with the State Department, which registers diplomats' cars in every American city. City officials complain that the department has not followed through on an agreement to yank the registration of any car with a year's worth of outstanding tickets.
Still, the improvement is there, enough for Barry Schneider, chairman of Community Board No. 8 on the East Side, to suggest that the police shift gears. "If they're not spending as much time writing tickets for diplomats," he said, "maybe they can go after other violators. There are plenty of them."

HEADLINE: Military Rumblings Over Taiwan

 BODY:
The triangular relationship between China, Taiwan and the United States seems to veer from one crisis to the next. The latest one was provoked last week by Beijing's threat to take over Taiwan by force if island leaders do not soon agree to reunification on the mainland's terms. Now Taiwan and its supporters in the Pentagon and Congress want Washington to provide the island government with four American destroyers equipped with sophisticated Aegis radar and antimissile technology. There must be a more constructive way to manage the sensitive issue of Taiwan's future status. 
 A showdown over Taiwan is in no one's interest. Any Chinese effort to take control of Taiwan by force would risk an armed confrontation with the United States. Taiwan on its own could not long resist a Chinese attack, even with advanced American weapons. An escalation of Chinese threats and American arms sales to Taiwan can only make the equation more explosive. Yet Washington will have little choice but to accept that escalation if China persists in trying to intimidate Taiwan. Fortunately, there is time to pursue other options.
China, which set off this crisis, needs to modify its course. Beijing's pressured approach to reunification is not productive. Someday it may be possible to work out a political arrangement that both mainlanders and Taiwanese find acceptable. But that is not feasible today. China should back off from its threats before they do lasting damage to its important relationship with the United States.
Taiwan has recently shown greater sensitivity in its own approach to the reunification issue. It has stepped away from provocative suggestions that its leaders were preparing for independence. But at this point it should not be clamoring for the Aegis destroyers, one of America's most technologically advanced weapons systems and one that has never been sold abroad completely equipped. Even with these destroyers, which would probably not be delivered for five years and not become operational for several more, Taiwan would not, on its own, be able to withstand a full-fledged Chinese attack.
Washington, for its part, should urge moderation on both sides, while not stepping back from its promise to treat any forcible attempt to reunite Taiwan with the mainland as a matter of grave concern to the United States.
It would be beneficial to America, China and Taiwan to see Beijing admitted to the World Trade Organization under the reasonable terms negotiated last year. But China is now pressing its luck in Washington. Its bullying attitude toward Taiwan will increase Congressional opposition to W.T.O. membership. The longer-term risk is that continued Chinese threats could lead to dangerous military tensions in the Taiwan Strait. That would be the least promising way to deal with Taiwan's future.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Directors Fail to Rally Around Any New Leader in Poll

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 2

 BODY:
Directors of the International Monetary Fund failed today to rally around any of the people who want to lead the world financial institution, and expectations rose that Europe would search for a new candidate to keep its half-century lock on the job.
The European, American and Japanese contenders for the fund's top post all fell short of a majority of the votes in a straw poll. No further poll was scheduled, and people involved in the selection process said it could now take weeks to choose a replacement for Michel Camdessus, the Frenchman who recently retired as managing director. 
 The vote result, which was not a surprise, confirmed that Germany had misjudged its chances of rallying support for Caio Koch-Weser, a deputy finance minister whom Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany aggressively pushed for the job during a four-month campaign. Germany backed Mr. Koch-Weser despite public opposition from the United States and a lukewarm endorsement by European allies.
Mr. Koch-Weser got 43 percent of the votes in the straw poll, people involved in the process said. That was a modest margin over the nearly 37 percent of the votes that the European Union controls. Stanley Fischer, the American candidate nominated by a coalition of African and Arab countries, placed a distant second, with 12 percent. The Japanese favorite, Eisuke Sakakibara, a former finance ministry official, got 9 percent.
The United States abstained, as did many other countries, and 36 percent of the votes were not cast for any candidate.
European Union officials expressed hopes that Germany would admit defeat and allow the 15-nation European Union, which had formally endorsed Mr. Koch-Weser earlier this week, to search for a new candidate. Romano Prodi, the European Commission president, told European reporters today that Mr. Koch-Weser's candidacy was effectively dead and that Europe should find someone the United States could support.
German officials sent no clear signals about their next move. European and American participants in the process speculated that Germany, which has surprised people with the tenacity of its campaign so far, could try to force a second vote.
At the least, these people said, Germany could seek to extract diplomatic concessions from European partners before agreeing to clear the way for a new I.M.F. candidate. The fear was that such maneuvering could take weeks, leaving the I.M.F. leadership in limbo.
Even so, attention quickly turned to other possible European candidates. Clinton administrations officials have said that they intend to back a European for the job, a tradition that dates to the founding of the monetary fund just after World War II. Americans have historically run the I.M.F.'s sister institution, the World Bank.
President Clinton, speaking before the vote, reiterated that line today. "I am completely committed to having a European head of the I.M.F.," he said. In an apparent attempt to soothe wounded German pride after the United States rejected Mr. Koch-Weser, Mr. Clinton also said he would like see other German candidates.
"I'd like to see Germany play a bigger role in all these international institutions," the president said.
While there are no other publicly declared European candidates, speculation has focused on five people. Gordon Brown, Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, is considered a possibility if he is willing to put aside ambitions to succeed Tony Blair as prime minister. Andrew Crockett, a Briton who heads the Bank for International Settlements in Switzerland, has a solid reputation in financial circles. There is a question, however, whether Germany could accept him, because he is not viewed as having substantially greater political stature than Mr. Koch-Weser.
The French have a potential heavyweight candidate in Jean-Claude Trichet, the head of the Bank of France. But Mr. Trichet would have to sacrifice plans to head the European Central Bank to take the I.M.F. post. Two Italians, Treasury Minister Giuliano Amato, and Mario Draghi, a senior Italian Treasury official, are both seen as experienced in finance and likely to be interested in the I.M.F. job.
Aside from Germany, the big losers in the process were the 20 African and Arab countries that on their own decided to nominate Mr. Fischer, the popular deputy director of the fund, risking German contempt for failing to support its choice. Delegates of those countries had clearly hoped that their bid would sooner or later attract the support of the United States. Mr. Fischer, a former professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is highly regarded by the Treasury Department.
President Clinton appeared to rule out the Fischer possibility today. He said that he admired Mr. Fischer, but would not turn away from Europe. "I will not support an American candidate even though I have enormous respect for Mr. Fisher," he said.
Still, some people involved said there was a set of circumstances in which Mr. Fischer could get the job. In this case, Europe would decide that it needed more time to settle on a qualified candidate and would agree to throw its weight behind Mr. Fischer, perhaps for an interim term of two years.

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK;
From Old Buenos Aires to a Brave New World

BYLINE: By HERBERT MUSCHAMP 

 BODY:
BUENOS AIRES 1910: Memories of the World to Come" is the latest ripple in a wave that has been undulating through art, architecture and entertainment for almost a generation: the rise of the City as an icon for cultural globalization. In museum shows, scholarly books and MTV dance marathons, not to mention tourism promotions, individual cities are being recast as the neighborhoods of one vast cosmopolitan condition. Images of Moscow, New York, Prague, Brasilia, Berlin, Vienna, Lisbon, Chicago, Havana, Dublin, Lagos, Macao, Barcelona and others are converging like segments of an ever-expanding Baedeker map. The Buenos Aires show, on view at the World Financial Center, adds a few new folds.
First presented last year in Buenos Aires, the show was organized by Margarita Gutman, a professor of urban history at the University of Buenos Aires, in association with the Getty Research Institute for the History of Art and the Humanities. Incorporating more than 500 photographs, drawings, maps and miscellaneous ephemera, "Buenos Aires 1910" documents one of the 20th century's most dramatic stories of urban growth. In 1910, Argentina staged a massive nationwide celebration to honor the centenary of its independence from Spain. The modernization of the capital city was the main focus of the event. Architects and engineers drew up extensive plans -- some practical, others fantastic -- to guide Buenos Aires into the future. The remaining vestiges of colonialism were to be cast aside as the city remade itself in the image of a modern cosmopolis. 
 In 1895, 15 years after Buenos Aires became Argentina's capital, the city's population was 663,000. Today, the metropolitan region is home to 12 million souls. The pivot for this explosive growth was 1910, a moment when the city gave itself permission to face the future. Like the 19th-century industrial cities in Europe and the United States, Buenos Aires confronted the need for physical expansion beyond a dense historical core. Local opinion was divided over what form the expansion should take. One group favored a grid of straight streets. Another faction fought for diagonal avenues.
In 1909, the government adopted the Centennial Plan, devised by Joseph M. Bouvard, chief of public works in Paris. Incorporating a grid overlaid with diagonals, like Pierre L'Enfant's plan for Washington, Bouvard's plan was arranged in the form of a fan, with the Plata River port lying at the handle end of the design. The diagonal avenues radiated inland from the riverfront, which is in the southwest corner of the city. In effect, the plan was a microcosm of the entire country, with the port occupying the position of Buenos Aires on the map. Only portions of this plan were realized.
Drawings and photographs of public spaces and transportation infrastructure make up the core of the show. Massive new bridges, a subway system, parks, avenues and highways, along with industrial fairs dedicated to the cars that would use them: these feats of engineering, landscape and industry laid down the capital's connective tissue. Examples of iron fabrication, like the hulking black piers of the Nicolas Avellaneda transport bridge, were permanent versions of the scaffolding that covered much of Buenos Aires in 1910, when the city was an immense construction site.
In counterpoint to the city's mostly horizontal infrastructure, the show presents a series of images that point the way toward the development of Buenos Aires as a vertical city. Elevated highways, train viaducts, airplane and balloon corridors are layered above the streets to serve the city as its buildings increased in height. One particularly imaginative plan published in a leading newspaper depicts an elevated train in the form of a roller coaster ride that soars and dips precariously over the roofline.
Like the fantastic renderings of New York in the same era, these pictures lie halfway between architecture and advertising. They are posters in a campaign to promote an image of progress as yet unsullied by the social upheaval and environmental degradation that technology would bring in its wake. The new Buenos Aires was to be more than a symbol of national pride. It represented a bid for membership in the international community of advanced industrial production. In effect, the city became a permanent world's fair, dedicated to international trade. As one writer observes in the show's impressive catalog, the city was the country's calling card on the world stage.
Photographs of the centennial events are among the show's most captivating images. Anticipating the rise of the theme park metropolis, they depict the citizens surging through streets adorned with banners and festive lighting, as if they were a grand opera chorus. Other sections of the show document more ephemeral forms of the urban spectacle. Pop songs. Newspapers. Centennial souvenirs. Nightclubs. Cafes. An appearance by Halley's comet. And that rousingly theatrical vision of stylized sex, the tango, a dance that has done infinitely more than architecture to broadcast the idea of Buenos Aires abroad.
In 1910, it took two men to tango. The show is somewhat coy about this social arrangement. We are shown a provocative picture of male couples dancing, big bruisers dressed in butchers' aprons. But we are not told why a dance considered too racy for women to perform in public would be acceptable when danced by men. We can speculate about the reasons, but it would be useful to have the phenomenon explained. How a culture handles dualisms in one area of life can shed light on others. It took two to design Buenos Aires, too, as we see in the implicit dichotomies between architecture and engineering, vertical and horizontal, the grid and the diagonal plans.
Tucked away toward the rear of the show is a section on social conflict, featuring pictures of striking workers, brandished copies of left-wing newspapers and an anarchist bomb explosion at the grand Teatro Colon in 1910. The section illustrates the severity of political oppression during the centennial events. The creation of an industrial society was contingent on the fear provoked by censorship, mass arrests and other police operations. The classical order of Beaux-Arts architecture represented the unattainable ideal of a society torn apart by its progressive ambitions.
Craig Hodgetts and Ming Fung, two architects based in Los Angeles, designed the show's installation for its original presentation in Buenos Aires last year. Their design's handsome metal armature has been retained for New York, but the show's setting is otherwise disagreeable. The presentation has been split in two. One half is installed on the northern pedestrian bridge of the World Financial Center, the other on a balcony-level gallery adjacent to Cesar Pelli's Winter Garden. This arrangement creates problems with continuity and access. In addition, the bridge is in the midst of a remodeling. The gallery looks like an afterthought to the restaurant court below. It is disheartening that New York cannot provide a more receptive venue for such an intelligent exhibition.
There are, however, lessons to be gained from contrasting the show to its surroundings. The appeal of City shows like this one lies in their representation of cultural difference. The message at the World Financial Center, by contrast, is homogenization. With its corporate architecture, mall-like shops and airport-style eating spots, the Winter Garden is Manhattan's foremost example of the monoculture, the prefabricated environment brought into being by mass tourism, business travel and industrial standardization. The retro design of Battery Park City's apartment buildings adds to the theme park effect.
In this alien setting, visitors are unintentionally prompted to see the growth of Buenos Aires as symptomatic of the monoculture's industrial roots. Although the city tried to shed its colonial image, it packaged its future in a Beaux-Arts image. This was the image pursued by many European and American cities in the late 19th century. It was, by design, an international style. Difference mattered less than similarity. All the calling cards were printed in the same cursive script.
It is not that big a stretch from this way of thinking to the outlook embodied at the World Financial Center, which is essentially an airport without planes. In this complex of buildings designed by Mr. Pelli (a native of Argentina, coincidentally), the Beaux-Arts model has been run through an edge-city processor. The place offers the illusion of public space within a high-security environment patrolled by private guards.
This context puts a sinister spin on the use of urban history to enrich the promise of cultural globalization. The tendency today is to look at the emerging global culture in optimistic terms. Many of us look forward to a time that will respect cultural difference, a time when the West will surrender its colonial insistence on judging other civilizations according to our terms. Ideally, shows like "Buenos Aires 1910" should support global diversity.
It could be, however, that shows like this are just diversions from the homogenization of everything urban. At the World Financial Center (home of American Express), we stand on the brink of a time when older urban centers have themselves become edge cities, providing hotel rooms, work stations, duty-free shopping and "authentic" historical entertainment. Urban populations, meanwhile, are transformed into the Mickeys, Minnies, Snow Whites and Goofys of their hometowns. Airplanes may not fly through the streets, as envisioned by the architects of Buenos Aires, but entire cities may be reduced to picturesque service centers for air carrier hubs. In fact, the consortium Aeropuertos Argentina 2000 is credited as national benefactor for the New York presentation of this fine traveling show.
"Buenos Aires 1910: Memories of the World to Come" is at the World Financial Center, Courtyard Gallery and North Bridge, 225 Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan, through March 26. In conjunction with the exhibition, there will be free performances celebrating Argentina's music, dance, literature and cultural heritage. Information: (212) 945-0505.
All around, hopeful entrepreneurs are treasuring new patents like geese ready to lay golden eggs. Stephen D. Messer, for example, is building an Internet business called LinkShare around a patent he got in November on managing referral fees for traffic between affiliated Web sites. His sister, Heidi Messer, a lawyer who is now LinkShare's president, encouraged him to apply for the patent on his idea. "When he told it to me, I thought it was profound," she says.
He's a believer in patents now. "Without the patent system, I never would have done what I did," he says. "Without the patent system you create a world where pirates have the advantage and pioneers are penalized."
As for one-click ordering, a final verdict could be years away, and in the meantime, online merchants will have to be careful. Mothernature .com already has one-click remedy packs. Safe Harbor has one-click ordering of digital video products. Are they patent infringers?
"I think the beauty of the patent law is, it encourages innovation, because it says, look, we challenge you to come up with a better way," says Heidi Messer.
"Somebody out there," says Stephen, "I guarantee you, probably sitting in a garage right now, has an idea that does zero-click."
Heidi laughs. "Telekinetic!"
Telekinesis would be worth patenting. Meanwhile, much of the value of the patent system lies in the disclosure of technologies that might otherwise be hoarded as trade secrets. But when Barnes & Noble decided to implement one-click ordering, its programmers did not need to see Amazon's patent. The software techniques are transparent. Any Internet company with a decent programmer at hand could imitate Amazon's system without breaking a sweat and without copying its actual code.
This isn't rocket science, in other words. I say as much to Commissioner Dickinson. He is unruffled; evidently he has heard it before. "We don't patent only rocket science," he says. "We patent football-helmet mailboxes." And indeed they do. Sportsbox Inc., a k a a couple of guys in Richmond, Ky., owns the patent for mailboxes built in the shape of football helmets; before you make one, you'd better get their permission.
Dickinson, who practiced as a corporate intellectual property lawyer for 25 years before taking over the patent office, says the law prohibits him from discussing any particular patent. (The patent office forbids its examiners to speak to the press at all, and the examiners who did talk about their work for this article insisted that their names be withheld.) Still, he can't resist revealing some pride in the progress of the Amazon case so far. "It's interesting because it's one of the first Internet patents to come to at least one conclusory stage of the litigation process," he says. "A federal judge found that the patent was sufficiently valid to issue a preliminary injunction, which is a rather extraordinary thing, right in the face of the Christmas holiday season. I thought that was kind of amazing, to be honest, and tends to suggest that the patent has validity."
In making her preliminary finding that Barnes & Noble infringed the Amazon patent, Judge Marsha J. Peckman in Seattle did not have to examine the underlying software code. Just how Barnes & Noble implemented one-click ordering doesn't matter. Any single-action ordering system violates Amazon's exclusive rights, she found. She also expressed a public-interest argument: "Innovation will be discouraged if competitors are permitted a free ride on each other's patented inventions," she declared.
The commissioner agrees. "The patent system has done its job for two centuries of protecting and nurturing and rewarding innovation. The system has worked."
But the digital revolution worked without patents. The great bursts of technological innovation of the past two decades, the rise of personal-computer software and the spread of the Internet, took place in a freewheeling and competitive climate, with ideas bouncing at light speed from one place to another. A little head start in this world goes a long way; in the digital economy, "first movers" gain a tremendous and possibly long-lasting advantage, without extra government fortification. The greatest successes, like Microsoft and America Online, had nothing to do with patent protection. Amazon did not need patents to grow from Jeff Bezos' garage to its current pre-eminence.
Only Congress can now return the patent system to its time-honored role as a catalyst for innovation, rather than a concentrator of economic power. "For limited times," the Constitution says -- and the generations of technology pass much more quickly now than they did in 1790. We want to reward inventors with a head start, not a lifetime entitlement. "Perhaps on the Internet, patents should last one 'Internet lifetime,' which is about two years," says Greg E. Blonder, a longtime researcher and vice president at Bell Labs and now "entrepreneur in residence" at AT&T Ventures.
This is a crowded and densely packed world; when a software engineer at I.B.M. comes up with a new idea, it's usually safe to bet that hundreds of software engineers in cubbyholes around the world are thinking along the same lines. Blonder himself has more than 60 patents to his name: toys, consumer electronics, software and business methods. He often gathers technologists for daylong brainstorming sessions; typically, these groups produce hundreds of useful "ideas," of which perhaps one in 10 turns out to be truly novel. "Problem is," Blonder says, "had I gathered together a different group of a dozen people, they'd come up with practically the same list. Arguably, any idea generated so easily and frequently is both obvious and a dubious candidate for a 20-year government-sanctioned monopoly."
Patents should be the exception, not the rule, he says. "As to my own business-process patents, well, as long as everyone in town is carrying a gun, I have to be armed as well. But I'd be glad to see the system change."
One thing is certain: the modern Internet entrepreneur is not a species in need of extra government incentives. If one-click ordering had not been patentable, surely Jeff Bezos would have invented it anyway in May 1997, put it to work in September 1998 and seen it copied in subsequent years by Barnes & Noble and thousands of other Internet merchants, all learning from his success, to the benefit of consumers. Surely he would have become a very rich man; and his future success would depend on his ability to continue outperforming his competitors, and to continue innovating.

 CORRECTION:
A Critic's Notebook article in Weekend on March 3 about the exhibition "Buenos Aires 1910: Memories of the World to Come," at the World Financial Center in Lower Manhattan through March 26, misstated the location of the Plata River port in Buenos Aires. It is on the east side of the city, not in the southwest corner.
An article on Page 44 of The Times Magazine today about patents and Amazon.com's patented 1-Click method of online shopping makes several references to the 20-year duration of patents and the potential for stifling innovation in e-commerce. On Thursday, after the magazine went to press, Jeffrey Bezos, the chairman of Amazon.com, proposed that patents for software or business models expire after three to five years, and that the change be retroactive, covering his company's patents.

HEADLINE: Job Growth in February Way Off the RecentPace, U.S. Says

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Job growth suddenly weakened in February, the Labor Department reported yesterday, but almost nothing in the unexpectedly sharp decline suggested a softening of the economy itself.
Employment grew by 43,000 jobs, way off the recent pace of 250,000 or more a month, and the unemployment rate edged up to 4.1 percent from 4 percent. But the February performance was mostly a result of abnormal weather, economists said. An unusually warm January had caused a surge in outdoor jobs, especially in construction, and those jobs disappeared in the colder February weather. 
 "This is one of the more remarkably irrelevant job reports that we have seen for some time," said William Dudley, chief United States economist for Goldman, Sachs & Company. "There are plenty of indicators that show the economy is still really quite strong."
Stock market investors, however, took a different tack. They seemed to see in the weak employment report a sign that the Federal Reserve would not have to raise interest rates that much after all because the economy was beginning to slow on its own. So they bought stocks with abandon, driving up the Dow Jones industrial average by 202.28 points, or 1.99 percent, to 10,367.20. Nasdaq, where most Internet stocks are traded, jumped even more, to another record.
That bullishness may turn out to be self-destructive. The Federal Reserve seeks to slow the booming economy to avert inflationary shortages of goods and services. But the Fed also seeks to slow the stock market, on the ground that the growing market wealth encourages people to spend freely, and thus contributes to the inflationary shortages.
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Fed, made these points in Congressional testimony last week. He warned, in effect, that the Fed will raise interest rates in coming months partly to cool the stock market. Stock prices plunged after his remarks, but they have been recovering all this week and the February employment report only fed the bounceback -- almost in defiance of Mr. Greenspan's warnings.
"The market could compel the Fed to raise interest rates even more than it had planned," said Richard D. Rippe, chief economist at Prudential Securities.
The Clinton administration stressed the economy's strength. Alexis Herman, the Labor Secretary, noted that although job growth in February was the smallest number since last May, when only 28,000 new jobs were created, the performance is much better when viewed over a longer period. The surge in January created 384,000 new jobs, so the monthly average for January and February was 214,000, she said, and that was not much below the 1999 average of 226,000.
"I don't think there is anything in this report that shows the economy is weakening," Ms. Herman said.
The wage measure included in the employment report also showed no sign of rising. Average hourly earnings for production workers -- one measure of whether a tight labor market is forcing employers to raise wages -- went up only 6 cents, or 0.3 of a percent, leaving this measure of wage growth hovering, as it has for months, at a mild annual rate of 3.6 percent.
What stood out in this report were construction workers. In the unusual January weather, the construction industry added 116,000 jobs, but in February it lost 26,000 jobs -- a huge downward shift.
Much slower growth in service sector jobs, however, was harder for economists to explain. The overall rise in this category was only 62,000 jobs -- way below the monthly norm of 200,000 or so, and the smallest increase since August 1997. The biggest falloff was in the service category that includes office work, computer processing, ski resorts, amusement and recreation, health care and temporary-help agencies. Here the job growth was only 6,000, the smallest increase since April 1991, at the end of the last recession.
"This may suggest that we have had some softening in consumer spending on services in February relative to the very strong showing in January," said Kenneth J. Matheny, senior economist at Macroeconomic Advisers, a forecasting and data gathering firm in St. Louis.
Some of the falloff was also weather related: outdoor work in restaurants and amusement centers fell, for example. But so did jobs in transportation, particularly trucking, where rising fuel prices appear to be taking a toll. And rising mortgage rates appear to have reduced employment in the mortgage industry, said Thomas Nardone, chief of the division at the Bureau of Labor Statistics that prepares the employment reports.
Manufacturing jobs, on the other hand, are beginning to revive, rising by 5,000 last month and 31,000 since October after having fallen by 527,000 over the previous 18 months. Overtime in manufacturing also edged up. And with energy prices rising, a more profitable oil and gas industry added 9,000 jobs last month.
For the country as a whole, the small February gain in new jobs, while pushing total employment to 130.33 million, produced very little change in the unemployment rates for men, women, blacks and Hispanics. Teenage unemployment rose to 14.1 percent from 12.6 percent.
For the labor force as a whole, however, the pool of people who might be drawn into seeking and taking jobs seemed smaller than ever.
The work force as a percentage of the total population is now a record 64.8 percent, the level reached in January from 64.4 percent in December. The labor force participation rate -- that is, not only all those employed but also those who are unemployed but actively seeking jobs -- rose to a record 67.6 percent of the population from 67.5 percent in January.
For unemployed workers, the average time they remained without landing a job has fallen to 12.5 weeks from 13.8 over the last year, the lowest level since the last recession. And the unemployment rate among people with less than a high school education is now only 6 percent, the lowest level since the Bureau of Labor Statistics began tracking this group in 1992.

HEADLINE: New York's Economy, Through Another Lens

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Jobs Data for 1999 Paint a Rosier Picture for Upstate New York" (news article, March 2):
It may be a little premature for Gov. George E. Pataki to herald the turnaround of the upstate economy. At least 40 percent of the private job gain last year occurred in industries like retail and social services, where the average wages are 40 percent below the average for all workers in New York State (leaving aside Wall Street jobs where the pay is off the charts). 
 With many of these new jobs paying about $25,000 a year, the state has a long way to go before it can make up for the 400,000 middle-income jobs that it has lost over the last decade.
It is also puzzling that Mr. Pataki links job growth to his tax cuts, since more than one in five of all jobs added last year occurred in sectors (health and social services and education) heavily affected by government spending.

Uncertainty in Thailand Over a Big Bankruptcy Case

BYLINE: By WAYNE ARNOLD 

DATELINE: SINGAPORE, March 3

 BODY:
A bitter bankruptcy court struggle between Thailand's largest corporate borrower and its creditors has generated considerable uncertainty over the fate of billions of dollars in unpaid loans in the country where the Asia financial crisis began.
For the last two years, Thai Petrochemical Industry has been talking with creditors about how to begin repaying $3.5 billion in debts it defaulted on when the crisis struck. In early February, the company balked at a deal that would leave its family owners in charge but declare it insolvent. It was not insolvent, Thai Petrochemical protested. Exasperated lenders, which include not only Thailand's largest bank but the World Bank's International Finance Corporation and the United States Export-Import Bank, petitioned Thailand's fledgling bankruptcy court to let them take over the company. 
 The court said Thursday that it would decide on March 15, but more than the company's fate appears to hang on the outcome. As the dispute escalated last month, foreign investors headed for the exits, sending Thailand's benchmark stock index tumbling almost 20 percent last month, to four-month lows.
"The big issue here is debt restructuring," said Therapong Vachirapong, a strategist at Merrill Lynch in Bangkok. "People now realize it's a bit more difficult than they thought."
The strength of investors' reaction is giving some economists a sense of repetition: only weeks ago, the International Monetary Fund declared Thailand's financial crisis over and said that the economy could expand by 5 percent this year.
Thailand's banks have already restructured about one trillion baht, or $26.4 billion, in loans, according to the central bank's corporate debt restructuring advisory committee.
But so far, the restructuring agreements have been largely consensual. Now comes the hard part, analysts say. The problems at Thai Petrochemical trouble investors not only because the company is Thailand's largest corporate debtor, but because of what it may mean for attempts to recover some of the two trillion baht in nonperforming loans that remain and the more than 400 lawsuits to recover them filed by creditors in Thailand's new bankruptcy court.
"People are worried about whether the court is going to work," said Donaldson Hartman, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in Bangkok.
Thai Petrochemical was established in 1978 by an ethnic Chinese family of rice traders, the Leophairatanas. To this day Prachai Leophairatana remains the chief executive, overseeing a plastics and gasoline business that turned the family members into billionaires in the mid-1990's.
The devaluation of the baht in July 1997, however, nearly doubled Thai Petrochemical's debt as measured in local currency. Talks with creditors quickly degenerated into what has become a bitter soap opera, as Mr. Prachai and the company's nearly 150 lenders feud over how much ownership the family must surrender.
About a year ago, the two sides reached a tentative agreement that in exchange for $300 million to $400 million in accrued interest, the company would give creditors a 30 percent stake and reduce the family's stake to 40 percent from roughly 60 percent. Mr. Prachai would retain control, but if the company failed to meet interest payments, lenders could raise their stake to 75 percent.
In December, Mr. Prachai sought to change the terms. Creditors refused and set a January deadline for Mr. Prachai to agree to a court-supervised restructuring deal or be taken to court involuntarily. The company objected and a court hearing began Wednesday.
Legal experts say the case highlights remaining weaknesses in Thailand's bankruptcy and foreclosure laws. Though both laws were strengthened after the financial crisis struck, the bankruptcy law still has problems inherent in the original version that Thailand adopted decades ago from Britain, according to Sutee Supanit, a law professor at Thammasat University in Bangkok. Foremost among its shortcomings, experts say, is that the creditor must prove that a company is insolvent.
Thai Petrochemical's defense is that it is not insolvent: assets exceed liabilities. Creditors dispute that interpretation, saying the company has not paid debts in two years and is therefore insolvent.
In English, both conditions fit the definition of insolvent. The problem is that in the Thai legal lexicon, Mr. Sutee said, the word for insolvent means liabilities that exceed a debtor's assets. An inability to pay debts on time, on the other hand, is described by a different Thai word that translates roughly into "overindebtedness" and is not provided for under the law.
To decide in favor of Thai Petrochemical's lenders, Mr. Sutee said, the judge hearing the case will have to expand the interpretation of insolvency.
The dispute has helped accelerate an exodus of foreign money from Thailand's stock market.

HEADLINE: Clinton Calls for Stronger Measures to Protect the Privacy of Computer Users

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY 

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif., March 3

 BODY:
President Clinton said today that he considered cyberspace too insecure for him to correspond privately by e-mail with his daughter, Chelsea, who is away at college. In the same speech to high-tech executives here in the heart of Silicon Valley, Mr. Clinton also called on the industry to enhance computer privacy to reassure many people like himself who are still wary of the new technology.
And the president issued a memorandum to the heads of federal departments, urging them to increase the safeguards of federal computers against intrusions like the recent attacks that overloaded and shut down major Web sites. 
Privacy rights in cyberspace received renewed attention this week with the decision by DoubleClick Inc., the nation's largest online advertising company, to back off from a plan to combine information it collected about Internet users' Web surfing habits with data about their offline consumer behavior.
During a technology forum at the offices of Novell Inc., a software company, Mr. Clinton said the federal government ought to get involved in protecting the privacy of financial information and medical records on the Internet. But he called on the industry to police itself in other areas. Already, Mr. Clinton said, 66 percent of the commercial Web sites have privacy standards, up from 15 percent a year ago.
"We know we have to keep cyberspace open and free because it sparks creativity and innovation, because its infinite networks can do so much to bring us together," he said. "But we also know that cyberspace must be a community of shared responsibilities and common values."
Eric Schmidt, chairman and chief executive of Novell and one of Mr. Clinton's supporters in the industry, said, "What was new was the emphasis on privacy and security. It was the first time he had talked about that with that kind of coherence as an initiative."
Asked whether those were areas better left to self-regulation by his industry, Mr. Schmidt said: "There are certain things the government can do, and the president clearly stated what those are -- medical records, financial records, children. As long as the role of government is properly defined, I think most people would agree with that."
At the forum, organized by the Aspen Institute, Mr. Clinton told the high-tech executives that computer users deserved notice about what personal information was being collected and how it would be used, and should be able to choose whether the data would be shared with others.
"You know, ordinary folks, even people who aren't online yet, are very excited about the prospects of this age so many of you have done so much to create," Mr. Clinton told the executives, including the executives of such Silicon Valley powerhouses as Yahoo, Cisco Systems and Siebel Systems. "But they are really concerned about this. They are afraid they will have no place to hide."
After his speech, Mr. Clinton said in a brief interview that he was one of those people wary about sending information through cyberspace.
"I won't send e-mail to Chelsea because I don't think it's secure," he said.
The president added that once he left office next year he would probably not be as concerned about his electronic communications.
Mr. Clinton admits he is a novice when it comes to the Internet. Just last week, during a fund-raising visit to Florida, he marveled at something as mundane as a screen saver. Before Christmas last year, Mr. Clinton ordered some gifts over the Internet, an experience he still talks about in his speeches.
"Yesterday, we got a new benchmark for the new economy when the Department of Commerce released its first ever quarterly report on e-commerce," he said today, "telling us the Internet sales from the fourth quarter of last year, the holiday season, were $5.3 billion -- about $65 of those attributable to the president."
Mr. Clinton's anxiety over e-mail messaging will clearly not stop him from communicating with his daughter. He said they spoke on the phone, and in between a string of fund-raisers in San Francisco and Los Angeles tonight and Saturday that will raise $1.6 million for the Democrats, Mr. Clinton plans to spend time, face-to-face, with Chelsea in Palo Alto, Calif.

The Menace Of A.T.M.'s: Convenience

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY 

 BODY:
THE New York City Council is about to consider banning a baffling new menace to consumers. What's baffling is the way it afflicts its victims. They succumb in a two-step process:
1. They go to an A.T.M. at a bank where they don't have an account, and must therefore pay a surcharge. Typically it's $1 or $1.50 -- an "unfair and unconscionable" amount, according to a report by the Council's staff. Because of this "price gouging," the report notes, "consumers may find themselves paying fees that are a large percentage of the money they are desperately attempting to save." 
 2. The next time they need cash, these gouged and desperate consumers cannot be bothered to go to a machine at their own bank.
How to explain such behavior? If you were not a member of the City Council, you might think it is similar to paying extra for orange juice at the corner store instead of walking to the supermarket. Perhaps $1.50 doesn't strike people as an unconscionable fee for convenience. Since the surcharges were introduced in 1996, the number of new A.T.M.'s has soared to meet consumer demand.
Are consumers being hoodwinked? Even though the machines explicitly warn them of the surcharge, do they remain unaware of it? No, according to the Council's own survey of 800 New Yorkers. It found that 90 percent of the people using machines not operated by their own banks knew they were paying a surcharge.
You might also think that banning the surcharges, as council members are promising to do, would leave consumers with fewer choices. It would presumably become unprofitable to operate the machines in some out-of-the-way places that didn't have them before the surcharges.
Some banks in New York might also stop allowing outsiders to use their machines, just as banks in California did after the surcharges were banned there. Chase Manhattan, which operates the largest network of A.T.M.'s, has already raised the obvious question: Why would it make its customers wait in line behind noncustomers who aren't paying the surcharge?
You don't have to be a banker to entertain these thoughts. Robert H. Frank, an economist at Cornell University, drew a blank when he was asked to suggest a colleague of any political persuasion who would defend the City Council's legislation.
"I can't think of a single reputable economist who would speak in favor of that kind of regulation," Dr. Frank said. "One thing that has made travel so much easier these days is that A.T.M.'s have eliminated the frantic stop at the bank on the way to the airport. But cash machines are costly, and if regulators succeed in protecting us from being charged for using them, banks won't continue to serve out-of-town travelers."
Those concerns were dismissed by Councilman Walter L. McCaffrey, one of the chief sponsors of the legislation.
"I can't believe that the banks here will alienate the public by taking out A.T.M.'s or cutting off access," he said. He also dismissed the possibility that the legislation would discourage the installation of more machines.
"In the city of New York," he said, "I think we already have a maximum build-out for A.T.M.'s." He did not explain how he had divined that the current network is precisely the maximum size for a city of seven million, now and forever.
WHY does the City Council have any more right to set A.T.M. fees than it does to set the price of orange juice at the corner store, or the price of this newspaper?
Mr. McCaffrey said banking is different because the industry is already regulated. He also pointed to the public's desire to ban the surcharges, as evidenced by the passage of a referendum in San Francisco.
"People voted 2 to 1 in favor of it in San Francisco," he said. "What are you supposed to do? Ignore public opinion? Tell people that their votes don't matter?"
That's a good question. You could argue that this sort of populist uprising is not so much democracy as tyranny of the majority: a majority of voters willing to appropriate money from the small number of bankers and other people who invested in setting up the cash machines.
But you could also argue that the majority has a right to impose price controls, no matter how stupid and counterproductive they seem to economists. If the economists are right, the people will just have to make do with fewer cash machines and longer lines. They will have won the right to inconvenience.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Race Challenges Loyalties, and Families

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD 

DATELINE: EASTCHESTER, N.Y., March 2

 BODY:
The Odyssey Diner here is one of those old-fashioned political hangouts, where establishment pols, mostly Republicans, gather at the counter or in a side room to hash things out over the famous cheesecake and coffee courtesy of the affable Doukases, who have run the place for 27 years.
But the stiff competition among the G.O.P. candidates and the approach of the New York primary on Tuesday have enlivened the discourse here, even among the Doukas family. They unwittingly served up an example of the split among Republican voters in this 336-year-old town of mansions and Cape Cod-style homes when it comes to George W. Bush and John McCain. 
 George Doukas, the proprietor, scoffed at the televised face of Senator McCain as he spoke during a television news report while Mr. Doukas played backgammon. Mr. Doukas firmly declared his commitment to Governor Bush, aligning himself with the county Republican establishment, including this Westchester County town's supervisor, James E. Cavanaugh, who is the newly anointed county party leader and a firm Bush man.
"I think Bush has the better chance of winning," said Mr. Doukas, 65, who owns the diner with his family. "He seems to have done a good job in Texas and has a good record there."
But just as the G.O.P. as a whole has not united behind Mr. Bush, neither have the Doukases. Standing a few feet away at the register, Angela, Mr. Doukas's wife, just as firmly declared her commitment to Mr. McCain, of Arizona.
"When he lost in South Carolina he made that speech and what he said stuck in my heart," said Mrs. Doukas, 61. "He said we will go forth, but he congratulated Bush even though they fought so much. It just showed what a strong gentleman he is.
"I think he will look out for the older people, for Medicare."
While far from being a scientific sounding, 28 interviews with registered Republicans over two days here and in the two self-governing villages this town encompasses -- Tuckahoe and Bronxville -- suggested an electorate tuned to the primary campaign but sometimes ambivalent about the choices a few days before the Tuesday primary.
There was hope for Mr. McCain in people like Mrs. Doukas, willing to buck the conventional wisdom and even to risk domestic bliss for their man.
But Mr. Bush can take comfort, too, in the likes of Mr. Doukas and William Carlson, a 69-year-old semi-retired sales representative who said he was turned off by reports of Mr. McCain's negative campaigning by telephone. Besides, Mr. Carlson said, Mr. Bush stands firm on conservative principles and served as governor of a large "tough state."
"He has done a lot of good things in Texas," Mr. Carlson said. "He has used the death penalty a lot and I think we need more of that."
Not many people could articulate policy positions of the candidate they favored. Lower taxes, keep the economy cruising, do something to improve access to health care -- these emerged as the more common requests, but few could explain what their candidate might do to achieve such goals.
The issues that have consumed the news media and the pundits -- like whether it was right for Mr. Bush to visit Bob Jones University or for Mr. McCain to lash out at the Christian right -- did not seem to make as firm an impression on voters.
And the often strident back and forth on display at debates has fed a sense of cynicism in this town of 19,000, a mix of the wealthy and the middle class where commerce centers on mom-and-pop stores as well as on shopping malls.
"Everyone gets up there and tries to prove you're a liar," said Frank Campamatio, a retiree shopping at the Vernon Hills mall.
But many more were like Rosemarie Princiotta, 59, a secretary who has paid faint attention to the campaign and finds it difficult to express why Mr. Bush appeals to her.
"He just gives the impression that he is warm like his mother and father," Ms. Princiotta said. "I liked his father. He was outgoing and truthful."
Ms. Princiotta was not alone in tying her support for Mr. Bush to former President George Bush.
"I liked Bush's father so this Bush is fairly credible," said Art Reid, 70, the retired fire chief of Eastchester, as he sat in a pub. "McCain is real honest but I don't think he is going to make it. Bush has more money than him and money is a key factor."
The Bush name may be an asset to some voters, but to others it is a liability. "He is relying on his father's name and record," said Constantine Despotakis, a 47-year-old lawyer leaning to Mr. McCain, who he said had "a sense of honesty and integrity. He comes across as untainted." Mr. Despotakis said he was dismayed that Mr. Bush did not seem to have a command of world affairs, noting that he had failed to name several world leaders when a television reporter presented him a pop quiz a few months ago.
"He needs a better grasp of these issues," said Mr. Despotakis, who like many McCain supporters said he would consider voting for a Democrat in the fall. "People will always vote their pocketbooks and the economy has been doing very well," he said.
Mr. McCain's post-New Hampshire primary surge entranced some who otherwise would have supported Mr. Bush because he was so far ahead.
"I think it is still an open race," said Kevin Scully, an Internet entrepreneur from Bronxville. "I didn't think of McCain before when Bush was the primary candidate, but now I'm starting to get serious about thinking of McCain. I'm still not able to clearly get his message, but I will be paying more attention now."
Marvin L. Cooperman, 53, a physiotherapist, said he thought Mr. Bush was "spending too much time attacking, and I don't like those tactics." This comment came a day before the Bush campaign began broadcasting radio advertisements and disseminating fliers questioning Mr. McCain's record on financing for breast cancer research.
While favoring Mr. McCain, he said both candidates had disappointed him by not fully explaining how they would improve the delivery of health insurance, particularly for the poor. Mr. Cooperman has a personal stake in that; he said he had seen too many patients unable to afford his services because they did not have insurance or were underinsured.
Now, Mr. Cooperman finds himself wondering about the fall. He predicts Mr. Bush will win the nomination and face Vice President Al Gore, for whom he is tempted to vote. He crossed over and voted for President Clinton in 1996.
"The way the economy has been going for the past eight years, I don't know if it's because of the Democrats or Alan Greenspan or whatever," he said. "But since there has been a Democratic president, I have been very happy."
How such sentiments will translate in the voting booth remains anybody's guess.
Mr. Cavanaugh, the party leader, acknowledged Mr. McCain's draw. "I am not the least bit dismissive of McCain's challenge," he said. "He is making a strong challenge and there are people who are enamored of him. I am not saying Bush has it in the bag. We all have to work for him."
Other veteran vote watchers were even less confident of Mr. Bush. Michael R. Edelman, a Republican consultant, predicted that Mr. McCain would prevail in the county.
"John McCain has become extremely appealing to the moderate Northeastern Republican voters," said Mr. Edelman, who once favored Mr. Bush but switched after what he called the governor's embrace of the right wing in South Carolina. "I think McCain will win Westchester by 10 points, assuming voters when they go into the voting booth can discern which delegates are McCain delegates."
That is no small point. Rather than selecting candidates directly, under New York's Republican ballot voters select delegates -- whose names are listed in larger type -- who are backing the candidates.
As is the case elsewhere in the state, Mr. Bush's delegates here in the 18th Congressional District, which includes Eastchester, are by and large recognizable officeholders, including State Senator Nicholas Spano of Yonkers, the former county Republican leader. Mr. McCain's delegates are all unknowns. That undoubtedly will have an impact on voters like Marissa Barile, a 23-year-old legal secretary who is admittedly not well versed on the issues and who said she traditionally followed the course of leading Republicans. "I haven't heard much but I think I will probably go with Bush," she said.
For the undecided and even those with a bent, the race could hardly be described as the same-old, same-old. "With all these choices, it's hard to keep up," said Robert Frederick, a 38-year-old computer scientist who said he planned to take the next few days reading about the candidates before deciding.
"I am a fiscal conservative but sort of moderate on social issues," Mr. Frederick said. "Bush and McCain both say they are fiscal conservatives, and it's hard to keep up on where they stand on things like abortion, which I think they both oppose, but then they may have said things like it's OK in certain cases, or something like that.
"I'm pro-choice and think the Democrats have done good with the economy," he said. "Where does that leave me?"

Campaign Briefing

 BODY:

THE REPUBLICANS
 
HISPANIC VOTE INFLATION -- The share of the Hispanic vote that Gov. George W. Bush of Texas received in his 1998 re-election campaign seems to be creeping upward. In Thursday's debate with Senator John McCain, Mr. Bush said he had received "over 50 percent of the Hispanic vote." The William C. Velasquez Institute in San Antonio says the actual figure is 39 percent. "He's inflating it a little, but the important point is that he did very well for a Republican among Hispanic voters," said Antonio Gonzalez, president of the institute. Ross E. Molloy (NYT) 

THE DEMOCRATS
 
FOCUS ON BLACK VOTERS -- Worried about overconfidence, the Maryland Democratic establishment is putting a homestretch effort into the Super Tuesday primary race in the face of polls showingVice President Al Gore with a 2-to-1 lead over Bill Bradley. The party's state leadership, headed by Gov. Parris N. Glendening, is focusing on a weekend drive to get out the vote among blacks in Prince George's County, one of Washington's most politically active suburbs. Mr. Glendening intends to capitalize on a Gore lead measured among blacks in the latest Mason-Dixon poll as 69 percent to Mr. Bradley's 12 percent. Statewide, the Gore lead is 59 to 28. Francis X. Clines (NYT)
 
THE WEST
 
EDUCATION AND TAXES -- California voters will have to reconcile their desire for education reform with their longstanding antipathy to property taxes. While education has been ranked in some polls as the most important issue to voters this season, the Proposition 13 ballot measure that rolled back property taxes in 1978 has long been regarded as untouchable. But on Tuesday, voters will be asked to support Proposition 26, which would reduce the approval threshold to pass school bond measures to a simple majority of the vote from two-thirds. The chief backer is the California Teachers Association. (NYT)
 
THE SOUTH
 
DEATH WATCH -- With 453 inmates on death row in Texas, campaigns for three judgeships on the state's Court of Criminal Appeals might be expected to be among the hottest contests on March 14, in part because Texas has received increased scrutiny during Gov. George W. Bush's presidential bid. But political analysts predict that the judges will be elected by only 4 percent to 5 percent of the voters. One candidate, Sally L. Ray, is married to a judge on the court, and told The San Antonio Express News she hopes to win because she has "a short name and an inoffensive name, which we all know makes a big difference." Ross E. Molloy (NYT)
 
HOLIDAY HOPES DIM -- Chances that South Carolina would join the rest of the country in enacting a state holiday on the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday dimmed this week. On Thursday, Republican legislators added a provision to the holiday bill that would require the state to declare the Confederate flag a symbol of heritage, not of racism. A bill to enact the holiday had passed the state Senate; Democrats accused Republicans in the House of adding the unrelated flag section to kill the holiday. The bill could be revived later in the session, but legislators say growing tensions over racial matters may prevent any consensus. David Firestone (NYT)
 
A PROMISE KEPT -- One of Gov. Jeb Bush's electoral promises has come about: the crime rate dropped in Florida last year, and by a record 10.8 percent. Mr. Bush attributed the decline state's falling crime rate, the lowest since 1973, to a toughening of Florida's crime laws, prison construction and an end to early release programs for violent criminals. The drop was the most drastic since the Florida Department of Law Enforcement began collecting crime data in 1971. Rick Bragg (NYT)

Amtrak has settled a racial discrimination suit for the second time in nine months, the latest one alleging that white supervisors had created a hostile work environment for black engineering employees in the Northeast.
Amtrak admitted no wrongdoing in the settlement announced today, but the national railway did agree to change personnel policies. The settlement, which must be approved by a federal judge, sets up a $16 million fund to provide economic relief to 800 to 1,000 black employees who suffered discrimination since 1995 and as many as 4,000 black job applicants who were turned away by Amtrak. 
 The suit claimed that Amtrak had discriminated in hiring, disciplining, training and promoting blacks.
In July 1999, Amtrak settled a suit filed by black managers and employees seeking management positions. The railway agreed to change company policies and set up an $8 million fund to compensate those who sued.

HEADLINE: Cities Reduce Crime and Conflict Without New York-Style Hardball

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD 

 BODY:
With the city's stunning drop in crime in the 1990's, many New Yorkers have come to assume that aggressive police tactics and crime reductions are inextricably linked.
But a look at other cities around the nation suggests that large reductions in crime can be achieved in places that rely less on the confrontational law enforcement measures New York has used, like the stopping and searching of thousands of people for guns by the Street Crime Unit, four of whose officers were acquitted in the killing of Amadou Diallo. 
 In fact, some cities, notably San Diego and Boston, have recorded as big or even larger drops in violence while employing strategies that rely on close cooperation between the police and the community and have ended up improving race relations.
In the eyes of many police chiefs and criminologists, San Diego and Boston have become the national models of policing, and while New York's accomplishments are also studied and admired, there is a sense of sadness that a great opportunity has been squandered.
"To see crime rates down but people still fearful of the police is not a healthy situation," said Jeremy Travis, the director of the National Institute of Justice, the research arm of the Justice Department, and a former deputy police commissioner in New York. "The national challenge is to bring crime down while simultaneously enhancing public confidence in the agencies of justice, and that is what dropped out of the picture in New York."
Rana Sampson, a former police sergeant in New York who is director of public safety for the University of San Diego, said: "New York has paid a huge price. What the N.Y.P.D. did was throw people at the problem, putting cops on every corner, but who wants to live in a society like that?"
But New York City police officials dispute suggestions that the department is more confrontational than others, and they say that its outreach efforts do not receive enough attention. "The commissioner and the precinct commanders do community meetings all the time," said Maureen Casey, a deputy commissioner for policy and planning. "Not only is the feedback positive, but consistently the thing that the community asks for is more police officers."
Statistically, New York, Boston and San Diego have all achieved enormous declines since crime began dropping nationally in 1991. From 1991 to 1998, the murder rate fell 76.4 percent in San Diego, the largest decline of any major city, with New York second at 70.6 percent and Boston third at 69.3 percent, according to Alfred Blumstein, a professor of criminology at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. Their robbery rates showed a similar pattern. During those same years, the robbery rate dropped 62.6 percent in San Diego, also the steepest decline, and 60.1 percent in New York and 50.2 percent in Boston.
But the three cities employed very different strategies. New York stressed tough enforcement, San Diego pioneered community and problem-solving policing, and Boston developed an approach combining careful research, participation by local ministers and selective action against the worst criminals.
Several other large cities have also reported sharp decreases in crime -- the murder rate fell 62.8 percent in San Antonio from 1991 to 1998, 61.3 percent in Houston, 59.3 percent in Los Angeles and 52.4 percent in Dallas -- without as coherent a strategy as those in New York, San Diego or Boston.
Indeed, law enforcement experts acknowledge that they are baffled by the decline in Los Angeles, whose Police Department has been plagued by scandals and low morale and has seen a drop in arrests. This suggests some, or much, of the nationwide reduction in crime may well stem from factors beyond better policing, like longer prison sentences, the improved economy and changes in the attitude of young people toward drugs and crime.
One way to understand the variations in police tactics in different cities is to look at the cities themselves and their leaders, said Herman Goldstein, a professor emeritus at the University of Wisconsin Law School and perhaps the most widely respected authority on policing. "A community gets the policing it deserves, or demands," he said.
In New York, under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani -- a former federal prosecutor -- and his first police commissioner, William J. Bratton, there was a two-pronged approach. They began a new emphasis on the rigorous collection of crime statistics and holding precinct commanders accountable for addressing them.
At the same time, they created the Street Crime Unit to patrol for violent armed criminals and to stop large numbers of people in high-crime neighborhoods to check for guns, and they instructed all officers to crack down on petty crimes like graffiti. Community policing, which makes citizens the allies of the police, was scorned as social work by Mr. Giuliani and abandoned by his second commissioner, Howard Safir.
"They tried to do all this too quickly," Professor Goldstein said, "without the investment of years of groundwork in refined training and supervision and discipline. Historically, this is a prescription for runaway police organizations."
San Diego took almost the opposite approach, he said. By the 1990's, it had already invested heavily in careful training and was already using the kind of statistical crime mapping that Mr. Bratton brought later to New York.
"Our basic premise was, we didn't have enough police officers to do it all, so we needed participation by the community," said Jerry Sanders, who retired as San Diego's police chief last year. San Diego has 1.7 officers per 1,000 residents, compared with 5 per 1,000 in New York.
So San Diego adopted community policing. After a series of meetings with citizens, the police divided the city into 99 neighborhoods, with a police team assigned to each, so that residents could get to know their police officers and feel comfortable giving them information. The city also recruited l,200 volunteers, many of them retired, to watch over neighborhoods. They receive police training, wear policelike uniforms and drive official vehicles.
In addition to using crime figures, Mr. Sanders decided to measure his department's success with an annual survey of public satisfaction. The most recent one showed approval at 89 percent, he said.
Boston's approach began with an effort to figure out the real source of crime in the city and how to reduce it with the least racial confrontation. David Kennedy, a senior researcher at Harvard, was hired to help, and he advised focusing on gun violence, not on gangs or drugs, a seemingly small distinction, but a crucial one for enforcement.
Mr. Kennedy, along with a team of Boston police officers and representatives of the district attorney's office, the United States attorney's office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, began tracing how guns got into the hands of criminals and discovering who the most serious offenders were. They then began consulting black ministers to win their cooperation in going after the ringleaders.
The team, including the ministers, began inviting known criminals, drug dealers and young gang members to what they termed "call-ins," meetings at which they were warned the violence had to stop or there would be federal prosecutions. The few who did not heed the warnings have been arrested and are now facing long federal sentences. The number of arrests and confrontations on the street with the police were minimal, Mr. Kennedy said.
The program has been so successful that in the past two-and-a-half years, only one juvenile has been killed by gunfire in Boston.
Mr. Bratton, who was appointed by Mr. Giuiliani in December 1993 after serving as Boston's police commissioner, said that given New York's high crime rate, an aggressive approach was needed at first. But then as crime dropped, he said, "the mayor made a conscious decision not to put in place the other half of the strategy, reaching out to the black religious and political leaders."
The former commissioner, a frequent critic of Mr. Giuliani since his ouster, added, "If we had reached out in New York the way we reached out in Boston, we could have not only solved the crime problem, but we could have begun to resolve the race problem too."
The Boston model, which evolved over time, has succeeded in several other cities, including High Point, N.C., Indianapolis, New Haven, Memphis and Portland, Ore. In High Point, where it has been directed by Walter Holton Jr., a United States attorney, a team like Boston's has called in 150 known criminals and given them warnings. Since it started in December 1998, Mr. Holton said, there has not been a single drug- or gang-related murder, after nine murders each in 1997 and 1998. The number of citizen complaints against the police has been cut in half.
"It's a very nontraditional approach to law enforcement," Mr. Holton said, and it benefits from the cooperation of the black ministers, who have told criminals that if they do not stop breaking the law, "don't expect to come hide in my church."

An article on Saturday about several cities that have reduced crimewithout the aggressive police tactics used in New York misstated the origin of the New York Police Department's Street Crime Unit. It was created in the 1970's by Police Commissioner Patrick Murphy and greatly enlarged in the late 1990's under Howard Safir, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's second police commissioner. It was not created during the tenure of Mayor Giuliani's first commissioner, William J. Bratton.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: NEW ENGLAND;
McCAIN IS STRONG IN NEW ENGLAND

BYLINE: By PAUL ZIELBAUER

DATELINE: HARTFORD, March 3

 BODY:
On paper, New England ought to be George W. Bush country. Not only does he have roots here -- his father was raised in Greenwich, Conn., and his family has a home in Maine -- but he also enjoys broad support from New England's Republican machines.
The governors of Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island are supporting Mr. Bush. In stark contrast, his chief rival for the Republican presidential nomination, Senator John McCain, has no state-level official supporting him in Connecticut, and only a scattering of relatively obscure state legislators, former congressmen and retired military veterans working for him in all of New England. 
 In Maine, for instance, Mr. McCain's state campaign chairman is a retired marine from Dresden who coaches college softball.
And yet, polls show that Mr. McCain has a chance of winning all five New England primaries on Tuesday and their 102 collective delegates, one more than are at stake in New York on the same day.
"I think McCain will sweep New England," said Darrell West, a political science professor at Brown University in Providence, R.I. "This is a segment that has a tradition of going for mavericks."
But even if that tradition works in Mr. McCain's favor -- polls indicate Mr. Bush has a good shot only in Connecticut and Maine -- there are 613 delegates at stake on Tuesday and some formidable obstacles.
No wonder that before today, neither Mr. Bush nor Mr. McCain had set foot in New England since Feb. 1, the day of Mr. McCain won the New Hampshire primary by 19 points.
There are bigger prizes elsewhere on Tuesday. Mr. Bush is strong in California and Georgia, with 216 delegates, and the races in Ohio and New York, with a total of 168 delegates are tight.
Jay Malcynsky, Mr. Bush's Connecticut campaign manager, said of the New England states, "They don't have the number of delegates to deliver to one candidate or another."
"If McCain is able to win most or all of New England, the rest of the races, particularly California, New York and Ohio, will pull him through," Mr. Malcynsky said of Mr. Bush.
But, he conceded, "it's been a battle for Bush in New England since New Hampshire."
Perhaps more than any other region, the five New England states of Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Vermont offer Mr. McCain tailor-made, fiercely independent, moderate voters whose counterparts delivered Mr. McCain primary victories in New Hampshire and Michigan. In every New England state except New Hampshire, independents outnumber Republicans and Democrats, and only in Connecticut are non-Republican voters banned from voting in the Republican primary. Such voters have been among Mr. McCain's main supporters in earlier primaries.
More than 30,000 voters in Massachusetts have switched registration in time for Tuesday's primary, mostly Democrats changing to independents, state officials said.
Such momentum does not seem to have waned after Mr. McCain's triple primary defeat last week in Virginia, Washington and North Dakota, said Scott McLean, a political science professor at Quinnipiac College in Hamden, Conn.
"Those elections were in different parts of the country, and I don't see them slowing him down in Connecticut," Mr. McLean said in an interview this week. "I'm not sure anyone even paid attention in Connecticut."
In Massachusetts, where Mr. McCain was trailing Mr. Bush last September by 30 points, he now leads by more than 20. In Rhode Island, where the Republican Party is weak and more than half of all voters are independents, he is leading by more than 20 points. In Vermont, Mr. McCain's campaign chairman bragged this week that victory was a foregone conclusion.
A poll in Connecticut by Quinnipiac College after Mr. McCain's resounding win in New Hampshire but before Mr. Bush's win in South Carolina, showed Mr. McCain ahead, 52 percent to 39 percent. But a Zogby poll of 361 likely voters released today showed Mr. Bush ahead, 45 percent to 42 percent, with a five point margin of error.
In Cheshire, Conn., an affluent town southwest of Hartford, several Republicans interviewed today said that they would vote for Mr. McCain Tuesday, mostly because of their perceptions about his character and willingness to shake up Washington's political establishment.
"I don't want George Bush's son in office; I've had enough of Bush," said Sue Paulik, 59, who works in a Cheshire drug store. "I think his policies would follow Reagan and what happened under his father. The economy really suffered under his father."
Even Gov. John G. Rowland, Mr. Bush's foremost Connecticut booster, has a less zealous outlook on winning Connecticut, whose 25 delegates are second in New England to the 37 of Massachusetts.
The cooling became notable 10 days ago, after Mr. Rowland criticized as "stupid" Mr. Bush's visit to Bob Jones University, a South Carolina college that espouses anti-Catholic views.
Asked about Mr. Bush's chances yesterday, Mr. Rowland, who is Roman Catholic, said, "Governor Bush as a candidate is back on the offensive, back on message," and he criticized Mr. McCain as taking "inappropriate advantage" of Mr. Bush's Bob Jones debacle.
Whichever way New England voters go on Tuesday, they will do so largely without the benefit of having a chance to see either Mr. Bush or Mr. McCain in person. Both are far more obsessed by their battle for New York's 101 delegates, and until today, neither had set foot in New England since flying out of New Hampshire on the night of its primary.
This afternoon, Mr. McCain diverted his New York campaign briefly to deliver a speech at Sacred Heart University in Fairfield, Conn. Mr. Bush's wife, Laura Bush, has stumped for her husband in the state. On Saturday, Mr. Bush is expected to speak at a rally at Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks.
Regardless of what each man wins in New England, experts and even devout McCain supporters say they believe Mr. McCain's candidacy may decline rapidly after Tuesday.
"I just think he's cool, fresh," said Denny Maisano, 47, a banking consultant from Cheshire who plans to vote for Mr. McCain, but "I don't think he has a broad enough appeal or enough money."
Mr. West, the political science professor at Brown, went further, predicting that after a loss in California on Tuesday, "the media begins to turn against him, McCain's money dries up and he's forced out the race."

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article yesterday reported that despite George W. Bush's ties to New England, John McCain was finding wide support in polls there. But it also reported that the hurdle for Mr. McCain might be harder in other states' primaries on Tuesday, citing California, Georgia, Ohio and New York.
The front-page headline, "McCain Is Strong in New England," accurately summarized the report. But the headline of the continuation, raising the possibility that Governor Bush might have to "survive" a "5-State Sweep by McCain," reflected a comment by only one person quoted in the article and exceeded the article's emphasis and conclusions.
A front-page article on Saturday about the primary campaigns in New England referred incorrectly in some copies to the Maine voting rules. Party members may vote only in their own primaries, not in another party's. Nonaffiliated voters may enroll in a party at the polls.

HEADLINE: Agency Rejects High Duties on Imported Steel

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 3

 BODY:
In a stinging and unusual disappointment for United States steel producers and workers, a federal trade agency refused today to levy punitive import duties on a variety of steel products from Japan and five other countries.
The ruling, by the United States International Trade Commission, cancels plans by the Commerce Department to impose duties on hundreds of millions of dollars worth of imported cold-rolled steel, which is used in a wide spectrum of products from cars to household appliances. 
 The commission decided, on a vote of 5 to 1, that imports from Japan, Argentina, Brazil, Russia, South Africa and Thailand were not a threat to the United States steel industry. The ruling broke a string of recent cases in which the trade agency had sided with domestic companies and workers in roughly similar circumstances.
Reactions to the ruling, which can be appealed in federal court, ranged from elation to bitter disappointment.
"This is a great victory for open trade," said Hidenori Tazawa, chairman of the Japan Steel Information Center, a New York-based advocacy association for Japanese steel exporters. "Ultimately, this is good for both the American and the global economy."
But Roger Shagrin, a Washington lawyer who represented several United States steel companies and an independent union in the proceeding, called the decision "difficult to understand" and said it would cost some Americans their jobs -- "no question."
The United Steelworkers of America, which had also sought the duties on imports, expressed disappointment. "It demonstrates the continual failure of our trade policies," said Gary Hubbard, a union spokesman in Washington.
Companies and workers have often complained in recent years about what they call the flooding of United States markets with steel that is priced below fair-market value to lure away customers, a practice known in trade law as dumping. Thirty United States producers employing nearly 22,000 workers in a dozen states make goods comparable to the imports that are affected by the decision today, the trade commission said.
But the agency noted that by law, it is not supposed to assume that any problems felt by a United States industry are a result of imports. Rather, it must find firm evidence to reach that conclusion, and the agency said today that after a nine-month investigation it could not. Indeed, the agency said, domestic steel makers' output of products like the ones under consideration has actually gone up slightly in recent months.
Foreign competition is a highly charged issue this election year, and steel companies and their workers have heavily lobbied the White House and Congress to protect American interests. Last month, after the trade commission could not reach a decision, President Clinton imposed punitive tariffs on wire rod, pipe and other imported steel products from South Korea, Brazil, Germany, Japan and other countries.
The trade commission's members serve nine-year terms. They are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. No more than three can be of one political party. The agency has broad investigative powers and is supposed to advise Congress and the president on trade policy.
Lynn M. Bragg, the chairwoman of the agency, was the only member to vote today for imposing higher duties. She is a Republican who has been on the commission since 1994.
The commission's rulings can be appealed to the Court of International Trade in New York, and then to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. A commission spokesman said no case from the commission had gone to the Supreme Court.
A former senior official for the trade commission said the agency might have decided as it did today because several recent rulings the other way gave it more cover to do so. Moreover, he noted, in a global economy in which Americans invest in overseas companies and foreigners invest in the United States, it is not so easy anymore to say exactly which companies are "American" and which are "foreign."
Investigations are under way to determine whether high duties should be imposed on steel from Indonesia, China, Slovakia and Taiwan. "These issues don't go away," the former official said.

An article in Business Day on Saturday about duties on imported steel referred incorrectly to actions taken last month by the United States International Trade Commission. The commission split, 3 to 3, on whether relief should be provided to makers of wire rod and voted 5 to 1 in favor of relief for pipe makers. Both recommendations were sent to President Clinton, as required by law, and he decided to impose duties. The commission was not unable to reach a decision.

HEADLINE: Warning: This Is a Rights-Free Workplace

BYLINE: By Barbara Ehrenreich; Barbara Ehrenreich is author of the coming "Nickel and Dimed: Surviving in Low-Wage America."

 BODY:
If the laws of economics were enforced as strictly as the laws of physics, America would be a workers' paradise. The supply of most kinds of labor is low, relative to the demand, so each worker should be treated as a cherished asset, right? But there have been only grudging gains in wages over the last few years, and in the realm of dignity and autonomy, a palpable decline.
In the latest phase of America's one-sided class war, employers have taken to monitoring employees' workplace behavior right down to a single computer keystroke or bathroom break, even probing into their personal concerns and leisure activities. Sure, there's a job out there for anyone who can get to an interview sober and standing upright. The price, though, may be one's basic civil rights and -- what boils down to the same thing -- self-respect. 
 Not that the Bill of Rights ever extended to the American workplace. In 1996, I was surprised to read about a grocery store worker in Dallas who was fired for wearing a Green Bay Packers T-shirt to work on the day before a Cowboys-Packers game. All right, this was insensitive of him, but it certainly couldn't have influenced his ability to keep the shelves stocked with Doritos. A few phone calls though, revealed that his firing was entirely legal. Employees have the right to express their religious preferences at work, by wearing a cross or a Star of David, for example. But most other forms of "self-expression" are not protected, and strangely enough, Green Bay Packer fandom has not yet been recognized as a legitimate religion.
Freedom of assembly is another right that never found its way into the workplace. On a recent journalistic foray into a series of low-wage jobs, I was surprised to discover that management often regarded the most innocent conversation between employees as potentially seditious. A poster in the break room at one restaurant where I worked as a waitress prohibited "gossip," and a manager would hastily disperse any gathering of two or more employees. At the same time, management everywhere enjoys the right to assemble employees for lengthy anti-union harangues.
Then there is the more elemental and biological right -- and surely it should be one -- to respond to nature's calls. Federal regulations forbid employers to "impose unreasonable restrictions on employee use of the facilities." But according to Marc Linder and Ingrid Nygaard, co-authors of "Void Where Prohibited: Rest Breaks and the Right to Urinate on Company Time," this regulation is only halfheartedly enforced. Professionals and, of course, waitresses can usually dart away and relieve themselves as they please. Not so for many cashiers and assembly-line workers, some of whom, Linder says, have taken to wearing adult diapers to work.
In the area of privacy rights, workers have actually lost ground in recent years. Here, too, the base line is not impressive -- no comprehensive right to personal privacy on the job has ever been established. I learned this on my first day as a waitress, when my fellow workers warned me that my purse could be searched by management at any time. I wasn't carrying stolen salt shakers or anything else of a compromising nature, but there's something about the prospect of a purse search that makes a woman feel a few buttons short of fully dressed. After work, I called around and found that this, too, is generally legal, at least if the boss has reasonable cause and has given prior notification of the company's search policies.
Purse searches, though, are relatively innocuous compared with the sophisticated chemical and electronic forms of snooping adopted by many companies in the 90's. The American Management Association reports that in 1999 a record two-thirds of major American companies monitored their employees electronically: videotaping them; reviewing their e-mail and voice-mail messages; and, most recently, according to Lewis Maltby, president of the Princeton-based National Workrights Institute, monitoring any Web sites they may visit on their lunch breaks. Nor can you count on keeping anything hidden in your genes; a growing number of employers now use genetic testing to screen out job applicants who carry genes for expensive ailments like Huntington's disease.
But the most ubiquitous invasion of privacy is drug testing, usually of urine, more rarely of hair or blood. With 81 percent of large companies now requiring some form of drug testing -- up from 21 percent in 1987 -- job applicants take it for granted that they'll have to provide a urine sample as well as a resume. This is not restricted to "for cause" testing -- of people who, say, nod or space out on the job. Nor is it restricted to employees in "safety-sensitive occupations," like airline pilots and school-bus drivers. Workers who stack boxes of Cheerios in my local supermarkets get tested, as do the editorial employees of this magazine, although there is no evidence that a weekend joint has any more effect on Monday-morning performance than a Saturday-night beer.
Civil libertarians see drug testing as a violation of our Fourth Amendment protection from "unreasonable search," while most jobholders and applicants find it simply embarrassing. In some testing protocols, the employee has to strip to her underwear and urinate into a cup in the presence of an aide or technician, who will also want to know what prescription drugs she takes, since these can influence the test results.
According to a recent report from the American Civil Liberties Union, drug testing has not been proven to achieve its advertised effects, like reducing absenteeism and improving productivity. But it does reveal who's on antidepressants or suffering with an ailment that's expensive to treat, and it is undeniably effective at weeding out those potential "troublemakers" who are too independent-minded to strip and empty their bladders on command.
Maybe the prevailing trade-off between jobs and freedom would make sense, in the narrowest cost-benefit terms, if it contributed to a more vibrant economy. But this is hardly the case. In fact, a 1998 study of 63 computer-equipment and data-processing firms found that companies that performed both pre-employment and random drug testing actually "reduced rather than enhanced productivity" -- by an eye-popping 29 percent, presumably because of its dampening effect on morale.
Why, then, do so many employers insist on treating their workers as a kind of fifth column within the firm? Certainly the government has played a role with its misguided antidrug crusade, as has the sheer availability of new technologies of snooping. But workplace repression signals a deeper shift away from the postwar social contract in which a job meant a straightforward exchange of work for wages.
Economists trace the change to the 1970's, when, faced with falling profits and rising foreign competition, America's capitalists launched an offensive to squeeze more out of their workers. Supervision tightened, management expanded and union-busting became a growth industry. And once in motion, the dynamic of distrust is hard to stop. Workers who are routinely treated like criminals and slackers may well bear close watching.
The mystery is why American workers, the political descendants of proud revolutionaries, have so meekly surrendered their rights. Sure, individual workers find ways to cheat on their drug tests, outwit the electronic surveillance and sneak in a bit of "gossip" here and there. But these petty acts of defiance seldom add up to concerted resistance, in part because of the weakness of American unions. The A.F.L.-C.I.O. is currently conducting a nationwide drive to ensure the right to organize, and the downtrodden workers of the world can only wish the union well. But what about all the other rights missing in so many American workplaces? It's not easy to organize your fellow workers if you can't communicate freely with them on the job and don't dare carry union literature in your pocketbook.
In a tight labor market, workers have another option, of course. They can walk. The alarming levels of turnover in low-wage jobs attest to the popularity of this tactic, and if unemployment remains low, employers may eventually decide to cut their workers some slack. Already, companies in particularly labor-starved industries like ski resorts and software are dropping drug testing rather than lose or repel employees. But in the short run, the mobility of workers, combined with the weakness of unions, means that there is little or no sustained on-site challenge to overbearing authority.
What we need is nothing less than a new civil rights movement -- this time, for American workers. Who will provide the leadership remains to be seen, but clearly the stakes go way beyond "labor issues," as these are conventionally defined. We can hardly call ourselves the world's pre-eminent democracy if large numbers of citizens spend half of their waking hours in what amounts, in plain terms, to a dictatorship.

HEADLINE: The Capitalist Cell

BYLINE: By Tom Vanderbilt; Tom Vanderbilt last wrote for the magazine about reality-based television.

 BODY:
Driving through downtown Rochester on a January evening, the barren streets caked with exhaust-tinged snow, Heath Row, 27, is talking about anarchism and assessing the strength of a local cell.
"Tonight will be interesting," says Row, clad in green suede Pumas, Trotskyesque glasses and a tangle of self-cut hair. "The cell is relatively small and it hasn't been particularly active. I'm hoping a couple of people will step up as emergent leaders." 
 Row is sort of a scholar of the way anarchist groups form, or, as he puts it, of "emergent leadership in connection with antihierarchical self-definition." Yet he has not come to Rochester to advance a strain of anarcho-syndicalism. While members of the cell he is meeting no doubt consider themselves revolutionaries, their call to arms is Fast Company, the rapidly growing magazine that began in April of 1995 with a bold series of declarations blending Situationist sloganeering with Madison Avenue exhortations. "Work Is Personal." "Computing Is Social." "Knowledge Is Power." "Break the Rules."
The job of Heath Row is to journey to cities like Rochester and meet the local "cells" of what the magazine calls its Company of Friends. The brainchild of Row, the company began as a way of linking Fast Company readers. There are now more than 25,000 members in 120 cities worldwide; 1,000 members a month are added.
But the cells promise more than the chance to get together with strangers and hash out the subtle distinctions of Tom Peters. Most immediately, the cells are a living embodiment of Fast Company, an incubator of the magazine's revolutionary fervor. Members, like readers, tend to view themselves as like-minded people disenchanted with mainstream corporate life. They talk of "reinventing the workplace," bringing "passion" and "values" to their companies. They share the vision that the New Economy has "soul," i.e., that it is about more than pecuniary gain, because "this generation would not sell out for money." They share an equally utopian vision that top-down managerialism will not work in an economy where real power resides with the "brand called you."
Of course, the rapid-fire growth of the groups, as well as the magazine's own rise in circulation (this year's projection: 500,000, up from 100,000 just a few years ago), says much about the appeal of Fast Company's vision of "democratic capitalism." The cells would seem the vanguard of that revolution, a spontaneous cult of Fast Company ideologues. "The Company of Friends is the Grateful Dead of the New Economy," says Daniel Pink, a Fast Company contributing editor. "I'm expecting local cells to start selling bootleg tapes of their meetings to one another." But is all the excitement of the cells really about social change? Or are they merely the New Economy's version of the old-boy network, threatening at any moment to sink into self-parody?
From the beginning, Fast Company billed itself as more movement than magazine, which probably helps explain why it -- and not Wired, Business 2.0 or The Industry Standard -- has been able to mobilize such a sizable off-page community of readers with comparatively little effort or money in such a short time.
While most business magazines were busy charting the convulsions of the New Economy in terms of mergers, pinstriped protagonists and economic indicators, the founders of Fast Company, Alan Weber and William Taylor, understood that new technologies would create a new business culture, which would in turn require a new magazine. Fast Company billed itself as a "workstyle" magazine, tying the rising obsession with work to the aspirational nature of lifestyle magazines, and indeed the pages of Fast Company are populated with people whose lives are meant to seem fantastic but faintly attainable. The magazine also addresses the commonplace concerns of "knowledge" workers the way Good Housekeeping circa 1954 spoke to the housewife: "But what if you arrive at a meeting with a laptop full of killer slides -- only to find that your host doesn't have a projector for you?" Stories like "Do You Hate Your Boss?" at times read like "Can This Marriage Be Saved?"
Not surprisingly, many Fast Company readers describe the magazine as a revelation. Row, who joined the magazine in 1997 as an associate editor, began to notice this discovery moment speaking to readers at the magazine's "RealTime" conferences. "They were saying things like, 'I didn't know I could have a job like that,' or 'I didn't know I could run a company like that.' They were talking about the magazine almost as if they were talking about meeting somebody."
Row recognized in this sense of connection an incipient community. One of Row's models was the salons organized by Utne Reader in the early 1990's after the magazine ran a cover article on the dying art of conversation. The salons, focused on topics ranging from spirituality to ethical business, seemed as much a product of their time as Fast Company does now. Like the Utne salons, the cells initially revolved around magazine articles. But they soon evolved. "Some of them were turning into business support groups," says Griff Wigley, the creator of Utne's salons, who later organized the first Twin Cities cell of the Company of Friends. "People would bring particularly thorny problems at their companies and the group would try to brainstorm solutions."
Carla Stroud, a project manager at the Seattle office of the law firm Perkins Coie, describes a survey taken several years ago in which her department scored near the bottom in morale and similar factors. In response, the firm embarked on a number of management initiatives, one of which was an enthusiastic embrace of Fast Company. After a manager passed around copies of the magazine, an in-house cell was formed; it meets monthly in the firm's offices. "We take ideas out of the magazine and say, O.K., maybe this is the culture in an Internet start-up but it doesn't mean we can't tweak it for our organization," says Stroud. Like many readers, she is convinced that the magazine is heralding an inexorable change in managerial culture, driven by presumably unbounded opportunity of an ever-vibrant entrepreneurial economy. "I work in the 'Silicon Forest' -- there are stock options everywhere," Stroud says. "For those companies that don't offer stock options, how are you going to attract talent? People want to have exciting work, and they want to have a voice too."
The cells' popularity also points, however, to the questions Richard Sennett raised in his book "The Corrosion of Character: The Personal Consequences of Work in the New Capitalism." What happens to the individual in an economy where attachment and loyalty are replaced by flexibility and perpetual reinvention? Where does connection come from in a post-secure world where one is loyal to oneself or a project rather than a company, and social bonding extends only as far as contingent "teams"?
In one sense, the growth of the cells challenges Sennett. People can resiliently adapt themselves to the social and economic formations of the New Economy -- the cells are meeting people's desire for connection. Yet are they truly a vehicle to foment real workplace change, or merely a way for the brand called you to move up the career ladder? Moreover, the magazine, like most manifestoes, often offers a skewed view of reality. Fast Company projects no downside to the New Economy; rather, it paints a persistently upbeat world of "e-lancers" and "change agents," a world where individuals morph into nonhierarchical teams, which are then whisked together to work on "wow projects" before disbanding to spend meaningful time with their families or at Canyon Ranch. It is a concordantly boosterish, quasi-mythical universe in which managers are enlightened, labor unions are unnecessary and any ill social or economic consequences the New Economy might augur are safely ameliorated with gently prim reminders on the order of: "Those who have the talent to succeed in the New Economy have a responsibility to address its harsh side effects." Phrases like "work is personal" are not seen as Orwellian declarations that imply there is little time left for anything personal outside of work; they are bold affirmations.
In Rochester, the Company of Friends meets at the Empire Brewing Company, a cozy brew pub within view of Kodak's headquarters -- in Fast Company's world, the very symbol of hierarchical control.
The shadow of Kodak, the city's largest employer, hangs over tonight's meeting for another reason. Today Kodak released a healthier-than-expected earnings report, attributed in part to a recent series of layoffs -- it is a faster company. Clustered at the bar, the cell -- a group of about 20 who have come from Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse -- gossips about Kodak ("the dinosaur," they call it ) with the mixture of awe and scorn a revolutionary group might use to discuss the governing power. No Kodak employees are in attendance.
Indeed, the table at which Row and I sit is New Economy Central Casting: there's the C.E.O. of an Internet services company who happens to be the youngest person in the room; there's an ebullient public-relations consultant and self-professed Fast Company evangelist whose card reads Czarina of Buzz. And there is Claire Crittenden, a 52-year-old consultant profiled in Fast Company who picks up on the ostensibly revolutionary theme of the evening. "I'm really the classic hippie that never lost that," she says. While Crittenden says she could have "made a fortune" in the personal-growth movement of the early 1970's, she instead turned to business, "the very vehicle that shapes this country."
This is classic Fast Company stuff -- the revolutionary zeal of the 1960's and the therapeutic language of the early 1970's have been seamlessly assimilated by the business world. Revolution and change now involve making alterations to flow charts, building "extreme teams" and dropping words like "zoomwidth." Against the Fortune 500, Fast Company has the same aura of cool the yippies exuded against mainstream America. The question of how a business magazine -- or business itself -- could acquire revolutionary trappings or an aura of cool speaks to the social transformation that made Fast Company possible. As numerous pundits have argued by now, this is based on a larger realignment of business and society in which business is replacing politics as a force for social change.
The Rochester meeting seems less a revolutionary enclave than a standard, if casual, business luncheon. Neither insurrectionist rhetoric nor socially conscious agitating is promoted. From this meeting, at least, the Company of Friends would appear to be not all that far from the Kiwanis or Elks Club. In the world of the New Economy as chronicled by Fast Company, these service clubs of the past are anachronistic, with their rigid bylaws and entrance requirements, their costly brick-and-mortar lodges and male-dominated aura. And to be sure, in Fast Company cells, membership is fluid and available simply by showing up; participants cross gender, age and profession; and the initial organizing takes place on the Internet. Yet as with all revolutionaries, the test for Fast Company and its cells is how quickly it begins acting like the status quo.

HEADLINE: The Artist in the Gray Flannel Pajamas

BYLINE: By Michael Lewis; Michael Lewis is a contributing writer for The Times Magazine and the author of "The New New Thing."

 BODY:
If you pick up one of the many books written about American business in the 1950's, you will find a typical corporate employee who is unrecognizable today. The Organization Man, the Man in the Gray Flannel Suit -- whatever you call him, he seems as freakish today as a bearded lady or a six-toed foot. The worker who is willing to subordinate his identity to some giant corporation is so deeply unfashionable that, for cultural purposes, he might as well not exist. Where did he go? One answer is that he was set free.
A few years ago I began to notice that people I was introduced to were suddenly describing their work, not saying who they did it for. The senior vice president of the Chase Manhattan Bank had somehow vanished. In his place had arisen any number of people with baffling new job descriptions: migrant Web master, kernel hacker, creative director. For about six months it seemed as if half the people I met called themselves software consultants. What the hell was that? As best as I could tell it meant piercing some highly unlikely body part and cultivating an air of total independence. 
 Actually, what these people all were, or appeared to be, were artists. They kept artists' hours. They wore artists' clothes. They had preserved the sort of odd habits that membership in any group -- other than the group "artists" -- tends to drum out of people. Maybe the most interesting thing about them was their lack of obvious corporate attachments. Corporations usually paid for their existence, but otherwise seemed to have no effect on their lives. If forced to discuss the companies that paid the bills, these people tended to be dismissive or, at the very least, ironic.
Here were the prosperous children of the great American economic boom, an amorphous, un-pin-down-able labor force. They were not full-time employees of big companies, just temps. But there was now sufficient glory in being a temp -- rather than a full-time employee with hours and a boss -- that a temp was no longer a temp. He was, in new-economy parlance, a free agent.
Of course, most of the 131 million or so workers in the United States civilian labor force are not free agents. Only about 12 million people fit the description of "workers with alternative arrangements," according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Moreover, the fastest growing job title is not "independent contractor" but "cashier" -- a fact that anyone who sets out to make sweeping generalizations about the changing nature of work in America must come to grips with. I mention the more conspicuous free agents not because they are exactly typical but because they point to something that is: a general drift away from old-fashioned corporate order and a tendency toward individualism in work life, especially among those who tend to invent new lifestyles for everyone else -- Wall Street, Hollywood and now Silicon Valley.
Back in 1984, an M.I.T. economist named Martin Weitzman published a short, powerful book called "The Share Economy," in which he suggested that the solution to unemployment was to change the way people were paid for their work. Most unemployment, he argued, was caused by inflexible wages; if workers would only accept pay cuts in bad times, they could keep their jobs. Because they tended not to do this, the only way for companies to reduce costs in bad times was to lay off or fire workers.
Why not get around this dilemma by mov-ing away from a wage-based pay structure? Weitzman asked. Why not make some large portion of a worker's pay dependent on the fortunes of the company, so that in good times workers would be paid more and in bad times workers would be paid less? In other words, Why not pay them with stock?
In 1984 this sounded like one of those theoretical fantasies economists were forever dreaming up for other people to ignore. Still, in Weitzman's tract lay the intellectual origins of the single most powerful trend in American work: employee ownership. Oddly, the trend had its practical start on Wall Street in the 1980's. Remember leveraged buyouts? One result of these buyouts was that companies ended up (via stock) in the hands of the people who worked for them -- mostly the people who worked at the very top, true enough, but they were, after all, employees, too. The general idea was that people worked harder and smarter when they had a stake in their businesses, and that is an idea widely held today.
Whether or not the investment bankers and corporate managers who did the deals actually believed what they were saying -- their actions often suggested they did not -- their argument had a couple of consequences. The first was to undermine the moral authority of the corporate executive class. The willingness of top executives to put their companies at great financial risk for personal gain raised an obvious question in workers' minds: why should I devote my career to a company that my boss treats like a private lotto?
But the other consequence of the leveraged-buyout bonanza was to cause lesser executives to demand their own stock packages. By the mid-1990's, the idea that employees should also be owners had trickled down to the rank and file. In 1974, 200,000 workers had equity in their companies. In 1999, 10 million held company stock. For the most part, employees have been purchasing modest numbers of shares through employee stock-ownership plans; in New Economy firms, though, even the secretaries tend to have options. One way or the other, Martin Weitzman's fantasy has become the new reality, and its consequences are all around us. But they aren't, at least so far, what anyone expected them to be. Here are a few of them:
The decline of corporate loyalty. Oddly, equity stakes have not created what you might think they would create: stable, loyal work forces. True, a company whose share price rises inexorably has a greater ability than most to keep its workers. There are currently employees at Microsoft who are the equivalent of the 1950's Organization Men, known as Rest and Vesters. They hang around dutifully and wait for the stock options they have been promised to be awarded to them, simply because it would cost too much for them to quit. But Microsoft is more the exception than the rule in the current boom. More typical is the stale old company whose stock price lags the Nasdaq, or the manic-depressive start-up whose stock price gyrates wildly.
For these sorts of companies the ubiquity of stock options has actually made employees jumpier. Many corporate employees behave less like old-fashioned workers than they do like investors. Rather than think, I need to stay here and do my best because I have an investment in this company, they think, I am going to keep a close eye on this ship, in case it starts to sink and my options become worthless. It is no accident that the world's capital of stock options, Silicon Valley, is also the world's capital of job-hopping. Silicon Valley employees perpetually scrutinize their companies for dark signs. When things go slightly wrong employees race out to find jobs that offer stock options that might be worth more. With so much at stake they cannot afford to be loyal. They cannot afford to succumb to old-fashioned tricks used by companies to promote worker loyalty. Which brings us to a second change in worker attitudes:
A new skepticism toward the company's argument that it serves some purpose higher than itself. Fantastic booms like ours create new forces of selfishness. The higher the price of working for something greater than yourself, the less easily people will be persuaded that they must do so.
Actually, there's a model for corporate employees in the 1990's boom: Wall Street employees in the 1980's boom. Until the early 1980's most Wall Street firms had been partnerships, and the most ambitious people who worked for them were roped to the business by the dreams of becoming a partner. The implicit goal of every Wall Street person circa 1979 was to spend his career with a single firm, which he believed to have some mythical superiority to other firms. To reach the goal required years of slogging, and at least the pretense that you were willing to subordinate your selfish interests to those of the group.
Then, in the early 1980's, the great old partnerships (Lehman Brothers, Morgan Stanley, Salomon Brothers) sold stock in themselves and became public corporations. At the same time that the Wall Street executives were preaching the virtues of employee ownership they were selling their own companies to the public, and turning themselves and their employees into hired guns without much stake in their own businesses. The incentive to devote oneself to the long-term glory of the employer was suddenly gone.
It is instructive to see how quickly moral codes change when the conditions that gave rise to them vanish. Just a few years earlier faith that one's Wall Street employer was engaged in some higher activity had seemed like principle; now it was just another one of those archaic customs, along with the edict against borrowing money you couldn't clearly repay and the belief that the customer was always right. At all levels of the company the quest for partnerships was replaced by the quest for huge year-end bonuses. The question that the newly tightly strung Wall Street worker asked himself at the start of each year was no longer "What do I do this year to further my career at my company?" It was "How do I maximize my take for the year?" One of the stranger psychological hazards of work on a trading floor was the new and widespread sense that one was doing his company a favor by working for it. There was a great whooshing sound in the heart of capitalism as all sorts of attitudes and unwritten rules were blown away.
In retrospect, it's clear what happened on Wall Street: the labor market opened up. The status of the ordinary worker was transformed, as it was no longer dictated by his company but by the market. Professional athletes and Hollywood movie stars -- to take the two most obvious examples -- had broken free of restraints on their trade. But the collapse of the old order had not yet affected serious businesspeople -- perhaps because they were closer to the center of that order.
Since then, the markets for lots of other sorts of jobs have also opened up. The rise of market forces in the outside world has been mirrored inside the corporation. Chicken-and-egg changes in social attitudes and technology have left a lot of workers better informed of a) their market value; b) their corporation's relative prospects; and c) the nature of life inside other rival companies. The Internet boom has been the great promoter of free-labor markets, not only in the enticements it offers to employees to quit their jobs in companies with slow-moving stock prices but also in the information it arms them with to do so.
The most obvious beneficiaries are the highly skilled workers who already have it best -- life has never been so good for computer programmers. But there is no reason why the new freedoms cannot also be a boon to certain kinds of low skilled workers -- like cashiers. In a booming economy a good cashier is hard to find; a good cashier will benefit from knowing his options; perhaps he will even figure out a way to get some. Interestingly, two giant slow-moving companies, Ford Motor and Delta Air Lines, have announced plans to give their employees computers and printers and Internet access (for nominal fees). In handing their workers the tools they need to do their jobs they are also handing them weapons to advance their self-interest at the expense of the corporation. How long will it be before Ford and Delta employees create notice boards on the Internet to exchange helpful tidbits about jobs at General Motors and American Airlines and damning information about their bosses? Which brings me to a third curious feature of modern work life:
The boss is no longer the boss. Countless American comedies have depended on the need of some wage slave to please his boss. Companies, it was rightly assumed, were tiny fascist states in which the workers were meant to feel lucky to have citizenship. Today no decent scriptwriter looking for character motivation would dare to use fear of the boss. It hardly exists.
Authority has not exactly vanished from corporate America, but it isn't what it once was. The boom has turned employers into buyers in a seller's market, and it is tough to sell discipline and order to a newly empowered population imbued with the free-agent spirit. Anyone who doubts just how vulnerable the boss now is need only visit the Web site of Vault.com, where employees of such places as United Parcel Service and Boeing exchange information about superiors. It's hard to think of a form of authority that has gone unchallenged in this boom, other than the faceless authority of huge piles of money. Which brings me to:
Collapse of the guild mentality. The rise of free agency, and of employee ownership, has caused a crisis in the highest tier of wage slavery, the professions. The mystical grip of the old-fashioned guild on the middle-class American imagination must be at an all-time low. This trend, too, began on Wall Street in the 1980's; six fancy-pants lawyers and an actual brain surgeon sold bonds on the trading floor at Salomon Brothers because it paid them so much more to do so. Similarly, Silicon Valley now teems with exquisitely trained lawyers and doctors who have chucked in medicine or the law to work for a venture capital firm, or to start an e-health or biotechnology company.
The gist of the problem here is what might be called "the business model" of the professions. All a lawyer or a doctor or an accountant has to sell is his time. This might have sufficed when there was great prestige attached to working at Ernst & Young or Sherman & Sterling. But that prestige has collapsed, under the weight of the money made by people who are not professionals.
Indeed, one casualty of the boom has been all forms of work-related prestige other than sheer moneymaking. A good example is the university president. Once a plausible stepping stone to perhaps even the White House, the job was coveted for all sorts of nonmonetary reasons. Now it is widely regarded as something of a dumping ground for the bureaucratically minded. Benno Schmidt's 1992 decision to quit as president of Yale to enter the private sector would have been unthinkable a decade earlier. When, last month, the president of Brown quit to take a job for a lot more money, as chancellor of Vanderbilt, he reinforced the idea that Ivy League prestige no longer trumped pay.
The decay of a lot of old-fashioned status means that a lot of very important people are doing things that not very long ago they would have thought beneath them. When President Clinton leaves office few will be shocked if he takes a job with Lazard Fr<heart>res or DreamWorks. That in itself is shocking. Which brings me to a final, and perhaps defining, trait of work today:
The new spirit of nonconformity. In the free-agent economy anything that smells of conformity is out of fashion. Even in giant companies there is a trend to nonconformity. Corporate cultures have changed a great deal in the current boom, at least on the surface. Across America staid corporate executives are busily devouring such unsettling (to them) books as Clayton Christensen's "Innovator's Dilemma." Every corporate boss now understands that he's supposed to turn the wage slaves who report to him into whirling dervishes of innovation.
A new corporate language has been invented to support people's need to believe that their work is actually an endless quest for originality. "Outside the box," for instance. These days you cannot spend two hours inside any big American company without some poor sucker telling you how he believes in "thinking outside the box." "Outside the box" is to our age what "plastics" was to the 1960's. The one thing that is certain is that anyone who uses the phrase "outside the box" is as deeply inside the box as a person can be.
Of course, the current fashion for nonconformity is itself a kind of conformity. There are now many jobs to which it takes more nerve to wear a blue suit than a nose ring. Working from home in the nude is no longer evidence that you are an interesting person, or even a happy one. The next step comes when people figure that out. There are limits to the pleasure of individualism.
A lot of what workers find appealing about the new openness in markets for their labor is actually just a byproduct of our magical boom. It's always a joy to be a seller in a seller's market. The joy is only enhanced when your counterpart is a faceless corporation, to which you owe nothing. But this pleasure comes with a price tag: the risk that you may one day find yourself a seller in a buyer's market, where the buyer is a faceless corporation that owes you nothing. The corporate socialism that constrained the old-fashioned worker had its benefits. (One of them was "benefits.") When things went bad there was at least a pretense that the company bore some responsibility for the worker's fate. In some cases this assurance wasn't worth all that much but in many others it was worth quite a lot. Now that pretense has nearly vanished. Guess what that means? You're on your own.

HEADLINE: Come Back, Company Man!

BYLINE: By Adrian Wooldridge; Adrian Wooldridge is a Washington-based correspondent for The Economist.

 BODY:
A decade ago, corporate America tore up the social contract that bound employees to their companies. Downsizing and re-engineering made it clear that employees were expendable commodities, not valued resources. Today, many bright workers are getting their revenge by fleeing their fickle employers for better-paying rivals -- or dot-com start-ups. Indeed, quitting has become so fashionable in Silicon Valley that the turnover rate for companies there has reached an estimated 25 percent a year. The average American 32-year-old has already worked for nine different companies. Workers today fantasize not about landing a "dream job" but about having a "portfolio career" -- one dream job after the other. 
 Is the death of the Company Man something that should be lamented or celebrated? We asked three leading management experts to offer their thoughts on loyalty in a virtual age.
 
Jeffrey Pfeffer
Stanford graduate School of Business
If loyalty is dead in some companies, it's mostly because it has been murdered by business practices like downsizing at the first sign of trouble and subcontracting out all "nonessential" positions. The message of "employability" -- that a company's only responsibility to its people is to get them qualified for their next job -- has clearly registered with the work force. Who can blame them for acting accordingly?
Today's rapid-turnover arrangements may seem good for the corporate bottom line, but in fact they make it difficult to build long-term, sustained success. In an economic environment in which capital and the latest technology are widely available, the only hope for building sustained competitive advantage resides in companies' management of their people. Thankfully, a few companies like Southwest Airlines, Toyota and Cisco Systems have retained the wisdom of building profits by taking care of their people.
Consider SAS Institute, the largest privately held software company in the world (with annual sales of more than $1 billion). It has a turnover rate of less than 4 percent. SAS does not contract out very much of anything, use many part-timers or tell people they need to think about their next job -- in fact, the company says that people will have three or four careers during their working lives and it hopes all will be at SAS. Nor does it offer stock options, dole out big bonuses or do any of the other things that companies with toxic workplaces have to do in order to bribe people into staying.
What SAS does instead is provide generous benefits like on-site day care, a full-indemnity health insurance plan (bet you thought this didn't exist any more), a 35-hour business week, recreational facilities -- as well as something much more important. While lots of companies say that "people are our most important asset," SAS actually believes it. People are trusted rather than monitored and controlled, given great equipment to work with, permitted to try new things, allowed to have a life as well as a job and, in short, treated with a respect all too rare in today's high-stress workplaces.
For SAS, being nice is good business. What happens when you work while exhausted?
You make errors. SAS actually prefers to ship software that isn't full of bugs -- what a unique idea! It needs fewer checkers than other software companies because its employees are awake on the job. The organization's low turnover saves it an estimated $70 million annually.
Too many companies think that laying people off or reducing wages is the best way to turn a profit. But loyalty is central to achieving success.
 
Rosabeth Moss Kanter
Harvard Business School
We are currently experiencing nostalgia for a golden age of company loyalty. Yet in too many organizations people were "loyal" not because they really cared but because they had no choice. Seniority reigned. Status, influence and big pay increases were tied to promotion. People didn't have stock options -- they had pension plans that handcuffed them to the company. The "loyalty" workers seemed to demonstrate by sticking around was illusory; many of them secretly dreamed of escape and retired on the job.
Old-fashioned corporate loyalty in which all status and rewards accrued to seniority stopped being good for the economy when global competition heated up; productivity and wages stagnated under the old corporate bureaucracy. Now that the economy is characterized by high work-force mobility, productivity is up and wages are rising. With a tight labor market, the shoe's on the other foot, and in many industries, it is employees who have numerous opportunities and companies that are desperate to retain them.
Companies today must offer great jobs in a great environment with great amenities -- and constantly improve on them. They must earn loyalty. Razorfish, a digital design firm, holds people who could go anywhere by offering exciting work for top clients, a hip corporate ambiance and larger-than-life amenities, like a Las Vegas trip for everyone in December. "I'd never leave such a cool company," a 30-something Web site producer told me. That is, not until a cooler company comes along. Razorfish has to think every day about how to stay the coolest.
I think it's a good thing that companies today have to work harder to keep the best people. The benefits they add make work more rewarding. Stock options make more people act like owners of their companies, and that can only benefit performance. And it's wonderful that companies now recognize that people have lives outside their work. Discovering high rates of turnover among female professionals, Deloitte & Touche, an accounting firm, took steps to add flexible schedules and control travel. These changes, useful for men as well, landed Deloitte in Fortune magazine's Top 10 list of best companies to work for in America -- helping the firm attract still more talent.
Some companies earn employee affection by making people proud to work there. I.B.M. gets high marks from employees because of its major financial commitment to public education innovations. Timberland offers its employees 40 hours of paid company time per year to work on community service projects.
You can't buy loyalty with just a paycheck. Building long-term commitment depends on four things: the nature of the work itself, the opportunity to grow, the chance to speak up and be listened to and the feeling of making a difference. Members of the new generation in the work force don't want to be subordinates; they want to control their own fate. They want to do meaningful work that has redeeming social value without sacrificing the chance to get a life. Give them that and they'll give you loyalty in return.
 
Tom Peters
Author of "The Brand You 50"
Loyalty is the glue that holds society together -- including commercial society. That said, corporate loyalty is rubbish. If you apply for a job at the Tom Peters Company and imply that you'd like to make a life of it, I'll unceremoniously throw you out of the office. Suppose you are a would-be Michael Jordan of my trade, consulting? I'll still toss you out.
Here's my New Social Contract. I want my company to be so attractive, so laden with talent, so energetic it makes your head swim. I want to give you an exciting work environment, peerless teammates and a string of challenging projects with top clients you could not match anywhere else. In turn, I demand that you give your all to these hot projects. And I demand that you be loyal -- to your teammates, to the client, to yourself. You must perform and grow as you've never performed and grown before.
However, I also demand that you not be "loyal" to me or my company. If you do turn out to be a Michael Jordan-type superstar, don't I want you to stick around? No! (And yes.) That is, I do not want you to stick around out of misguided allegiance. If I can provide you with exciting new challenges, and if you respond accordingly, well, then I hope we do indeed grow old together -- one project at a time.
Mindless corporate loyalty -- the essence of 50's Babbittry -- was always a rotten idea.

HEADLINE: 0%* Unemployment

BYLINE: By David Brooks; David Brooks is a senior editor at The Weekly Standard and author of the forthcoming "Bobos in Paradise: The New Upper Class and How They Got There."

 BODY:
Karl Marx spent all those years dreaming about the worker's paradise. Yet he never got to sit in the conference room at Berbee Information Networks Corporation and listen to Jim Berbee rattle off all the luscious perks he offers his employees. They get stock options, of course, but also Palm Pilots, cell phones and a $1,000 bonus to help with the down payment on their first homes. If they want to work in their pajamas, the company pays to install and maintain high-speed I.S.D.N. lines in their bedrooms. Two years ago Berbee took everybody in the company and their families to Disney World. Bagels and muffins are free on Fridays, the sodas in the office machine are free all the time (consumption went up 400 percent after that change), and if employees want to use the office copiers for personal use, no problem. An auto-repair service comes to the employee parking lot every other Wednesday to do oil changes and tire rotations. There's dry-cleaning delivery four days a week and pizza at least once a month (which for some reason employees still have to pay for).
Marx would have looked at all the cushy benefits and figured that the dictatorship of the proletariat had finally come to pass. But there's a simpler explanation. Full employment. Berbee is located in Madison, Wis., which has a microscopic 1.2 percent unemployment rate, second lowest in the country after another university town, Columbia, Mo. Jim Berbee is desperate to attract and retain workers. He has 220 employees and an amazing 94 percent retention rate, but his company is growing so fast he also has 110 job openings. "We're losing ground every week," he cries. 
 And it's not only the tech geeks who are in short supply. The employment classifieds in the Madison paper land on porches each Sunday with Richter-scale thuds. One company offered free maid service for new employees. No-skill, entry-level jobs carry wages of $8 or $9 an hour, blowing away the federal minimum wage of $5.15. Burger chains are beginning to offer health benefits to grill workers, and still some franchises have closed for lack of staff. Wisconsin Dells, a nearby resort area, has been forced to fly in summer help from Lithuania, Zimbabwe, Russia and New Zealand. Lands' End in nearby Dodgeville has given Green Bay Packers tickets to employees who recruit friends. Figi's, a mail-order company, offers free bus service and free breakfast at Burger King. (Talk about killing off your work force.) Carlson Company, which makes cosmetic counters, built a $750,000 day care center so staff members can visit their kids at story time.
Hubert Humphrey used to go to bed dreaming of conditions like this. But they're not celebrating in Madison. I bounced around talking to businesspeople, politicians and workers, and I kept trying to introduce the phrase "full employment" into the conversation, because it sounds so happy and satisfying. But they'd come back with the phrase "labor shortage," and then their brows would furrow with that expression of grave concern people used to wear when talking about exploding federal deficits. "Employers are have a very tough time finding workers," laments Madison's mayor, Susan J. M. Bauman. We sit in her office, looking gravely concerned.
The other thing you notice is that the locals aren't behaving like rational economic actors. With all these openings, workers should be hopping from job to job, taking advantage of all the perks and lures, boosting their income to the max. Yet a survey done by the QTI Group, the largest local staffing agency, found that the job-turnover rate has been dropping even as the unemployment rate has plunged. QTI has 48 people in Madison trying to find mostly lower-skill workers for clerical and industrial jobs. Every so often, the company offers $10 to anyone who comes in and completes a job application. In Madison, in other words, they're paying people just to look for work.
But no one's jumping at the opportunities. Nor are wages skyrocketing. Salaries are rising, especially among low-end workers and up top among the techies. But salaries are rising nowhere near as fast as you'd expect in such tight labor conditions. You get the impression that even in flush times most people are still pretty conservative when it comes to work and job hunting.
I keep hearing the same things. People don't like to jump around. People like to work at places that are familiar, or where some member of their family already works. Nepotism reigns. Melster Candies Inc., the country's leading manufacturer of circus peanuts -- those orange puffy things made from sugar -- solved their staffing problems when they sent job applications home with some of their workers, asking if they had any underemployed relatives. Jim Berbee boasts that he has had daughters recruit fathers and husbands recruit wives.
This isn't the free-agent nation that our futurologists are always predicting. This isn't the land of rampant, loyalty-is-dead individualists. There's a little more caution and communitarianism in the air here. One is reminded that Wisconsin is said to outstrip most of the rest of the nation in Tupperware use per capita. This is the kind of state where people save their leftovers. And that basic sense of ballast colors the local reaction to prosperity. There aren't many people riding around in Lexus or Mercedes S.U.V.'s.
The job center in Madison, which coordinates state and county jobless, housing and other benefits, is just in the shadow, and definitely within the aroma range, of the Oscar Mayer meat-processing plant. Inside, it looks like a high school library, with rows and rows of computers, where people can page through the online job listings. I plugged in my profile and came back with 442 executive openings, 403 clerical openings, 292 sales openings and so on, including some career options I'd never really considered, like boar-semen collector, TV weatherman and wooden-pole inspector. The people at the keyboards around me were diverse, a couple of young Asian and Hispanic men (there has been an influx over the past two years as word of the hot job market has spread), a middle-aged white guy in a hunting hat, a few seniors and miscellaneous young people. There was some sarcastic chatter among terminals: "Work on Saturdays? Are you kidding me?"
Mary Witt, the director of Dane County Job Service, says that most of the people already have jobs, but would like to find some place where they can advance. A basic problem for employed and unemployed alike is that people are too cautious when looking for work. "Most people select the line of work they've done before," Mary Witt says. "People think small."
In contrast to greater Madison's relentless optimism, the mood in the employment office is sober, if not gloomy. And why not? This is about the only place anyone hears any bad economic news. "I can get anyone a job," says Tom Swoboda, a counselor, "but will it pay the bills?" Madison's real estate prices have risen with the economy, so about a third of the people in the homeless shelters have full-time or more than full-time work. The saddest cases, the counselors tell me, involve extraordinarily well-educated people -- men and women with Ph.D.'s and law degrees -- who have propelled themselves into an elite stratum where job competition is still fierce. Job experts are urging employers to begin looking for workers among formerly marginalized groups, like criminals and liberal arts majors, but apparently it hasn't helped these folks.
I've driven a few miles from the job center, and it is as if I am standing at the source of the Nile. I am here at the midway point of the assembly line for the Sub-Zero Freezer Company. From this very spot, high-end refrigerators flow out to overendowed kitchens around the globe -- to Santa Monica, Fifth Avenue, Bethesda, Boca, Winnetka and across the whole fertile crescent of upscale squash-court-size kitchentopia. It is humbling to be here, at the source, knowing that the shelves being installed in front of me will one day hold organic chutneys, frozen free-range prawns, Florentine pestos and all the other delicacies so pleasing to the nation's bull-market gourmets.
If there is any place in Madison where people have a right to feel puffed up by their economic success, it is here at Sub-Zero, the makers of the quintessential chichi 90's product. Yet I'm not sure I've ever been in a more unpretentious and tradition-conscious corporate culture. I've just had a meeting with three executives, genial conservative white men in their 50's in blue or gray suits, white shirts and muted ties. These guys are proud to be making a top-of-the-line product, but it could be top-of-the-line turbines or diesels, to judge by their complete lack of fabulousness.
Sub-Zero tried to use robotics to put together its machines. But the robots made too many mistakes. So they went back to making the machines by hand. The workers look like classic assembly-line labor, former high school football stars now wearing Packers shirts over slightly bulging waistlines. They have old-fashioned Harley-Davidson tattoos, not newfangled Nirvana-inspired tattoos, and high school degrees or an equivalent. Sub-Zero, though it is growing quickly, doesn't have much trouble finding workers. Fathers bring in sons and daughters; some are third-generation Sub-Zero families. Once in place, workers tend to stay. And newcomers are drawn by the company's reputation at the rate of about 10 to 15 applications a week.
That's the final striking feature of the Madison job market. If the average worker were strictly Homo economicus, he'd choose an employer on the basis of salary and benefits, and jump when he's offered something better. But time and again, people mention the importance of reputation. They want to be able to give a satisfying answer to the cocktail-party question "Where do you work?" Status companies seem to have a big advantage finding workers, and that is true in the manufacturing sector as well as among the biotech and high-tech start-ups.
In the heart of downtown Madison there is a tech company that has a corporate culture several galaxies removed from Sub-Zero. Sonic Foundry is a software firm that makes it possible to convert audio and video for the Web. It is located in a string of renovated warehouses. There's an iron rule of office design: the more beaten and industrial the look, the more likely the firm is a high-tech start-up looking for a patina of gritty industrial authenticity. (If the headquarters are clean, quiet and sedate, with tranquil carpets and serene watercolors, then you know the company is in manufacturing.) Sonic Foundry, with its factorylike office design, is at the cutting edge of the information age.
I should confess straight out that I'm probably not cool enough to even write about Sonic Foundry. There are 20-somethings with bleached-blond surfer haircuts, pierced noses, Smash Mouth goatees, baggy pants and office nameplates with tags like Dirtforker on them. The hipness rolls off them in waves. "Our business is one of the sexiest industries you can be in," says Rimas Buinevicius, the company's C.E.O., lounging back in his black turtleneck on the couch next to a retro steel coffee table. "It's the nexus of new media and music."
The hiring process sounds like the velvet-rope scrutiny you might get at a downtown club. Each potential employee is interviewed seven or eight times, to make sure the person is "going to fit in culturally," Buinevicius says. Sonic Foundry has a growth rate of about 100 percent a year. But once you're in, there's no cooler place to be. There are about 60 computer engineers on staff, and over the past five years only one has left.
So there's even stability among the stock-option rebels at Sonic Foundry. In fact, the affluence feels a lot more stable here than in the Silicon Valleys or Alleys or the rest of the Fast Company corridors. Economists have been puzzling about how the recovery has been able to surge for so long without inflation. Many have been wondering when the nation is going to have to pay for all the gilded-age excess. But maybe Wisconsin is more typical of America than Palo Alto or SoHo or any of the other Next New Thing zones. Maybe even where the economy is hot, most Americans have remained cautious, conservative and cool.

HEADLINE: Feel the Burn? It's More of a Glow

BYLINE: By TERRY TRUCCO; TERRY TRUCCO writes frequently for the Travel section.

 BODY:
SPA is one of those curious words that is redefined every generation or so. A century ago, spas in the United States were mineral springs, where visitors suffering from ailments such as arthritis, rheumatism or jangled nerves soaked in steamy, sulfurous waters. A 1950's spa was a fat farm, with a lettuce-leaf diet and a battery of beauty treatments. Fitness spas, where chirpy instructors screamed "Feel the burn," typified the 1980's; everyone jumped and sweated for hours in big, mirror-lined rooms and almost never went outdoors.
Now comes a new definition: the holistic spa. True to its New Age name, the holistic spa aims to treat the whole person -- mind, body and spirit -- and gently instill good habits meant to last long after the visit. The prototype calls for a diet of organically grown food that's healthy but ample (no more lettuce-leaf entrees), generous exercise with an emphasis on strength training, hiking and yoga (goodbye step aerobics) and exotic pampering treatments using techniques and natural ingredients from the Far East, ancient India or even the region around the spa. Health services, such as bone density tests, acupuncture and consultations with a nutritionist, are often included in the holistic approach. And to keep you in touch with nature, a waterfall or cactus forest should grace the grounds. 
 "A spa today is not about a massage," declared Horst Rechelbacher, founder of the Aveda Corporation, speaking last fall to the annual convention of the International Spa Association, an industry organization of spas, their owners, wellness instructors and service providers such as massage therapists, which has grown from 91 members in 1990 to more than 1,200. "It's about everything -- healing, learning, relaxing, well-being -- and how it all integrates."
Not every spa in the country is equipped, or even inclined, to provide an all-out holistic retreat. But the theme is pervasive as spas try to offer visitors a complete experience instead of a haphazard series of workouts, massages and meals. The model is the classic mind/body spa, which has been around, in various incarnations, for 60 years. The philosophy is that physical fitness isn't enough: you need to nourish and refresh your mind to be completely relaxed. And relaxation is the elusive but desirable commodity spas want to offer. In a recent survey, commissioned by the spa association, 61 percent of 351 people who had visited a destination, resort or cruise spa within the past year said they went to a spa to relax, followed by 13 percent who said pampering was their priority.
Dramatic growth in the number and variety of spas is the other significant trend. In 1980 there were fewer than three dozen spas in the United States. Today there are more than 1,600, according to Bernard Burt, an industry consultant and a founding director of the spa association, ranging from day spas to resorts and cruise ships with spa amenities to full-blown destination spas. You'll even find a handful of old-fashioned mineral spring spas. Burnished by the strong economy, most of the growth is at the high end. Lower-priced spas still thrive, though it's unusual to find a full-service spa with overnight accommodations for under $135 a night a person, without treatments.
Industry observers expect the growth to continue, particularly as the health-conscious baby boom generation ages. In the spa association survey, just 5 percent of nearly 28,000 respondents said they had been to a resort spa in the past year, but 25 percent said they were interested in staying at one. Spas are attracting younger visitors, as well, "particularly day spas, where increasingly guests are 35 and under," said Peter C. Yesawich, whose marketing firm, Yesawich, Pepperdine & Brown, conducted the survey. In addition, 35 percent of visitors to the resort, cruise and destination spas are now men, the survey found.
Not surprisingly, the growth is shaking up what was once a sleepy, if iconoclastic, cottage industry. In the past, the American trailblazers were destination spas that reflected the vision of a single individual, such as Deborah Szekely's sybaritic Golden Door in Escondido, Calif., or Sheila Cluff's sportyspa the Oaks in Ojai, Calif. But operating a spa has become so expensive, real estate concerns and large corporations are behind much of the recent expansion. Indeed, in 1998, the Golden Door was purchased by a Dallas real estate investment trust, which has since opened branches at resorts in Telluride, Colo., and Las Croabas, P.R.
To aficionados, the destination spa, where clients immerse themselves in healthy living day and night, is the genuine spa experience. "We make you stay for a week because that allows you the time to get into your mind and visualize peace," said Ms. Szekely, who also founded the Rancho La Puerta spa in Tecate, Mexico. "It also builds a sense of community. If you know the woman next door will be your neighbor all week, you'll say 'hi.' "
But such spas are labor-intensive and costly to run. Though Mr. Burt estimates there are around 30 in North America (and just under 60 worldwide), no new ones are being built. To raise the destination spa profile, 25 of the best known, including the Greenhouse in Arlington, Tex., and Cal-a-Vie in Vista, Calif., recently banded together, producing a magazine and launching a Web site, www.destinationspas.com.
Most of the growth is in day and resort spas. If a destination spa is a nutritious five-course meal, a day spa is a glass of fresh-squeezed orange juice -- a quick gulp of health and indulgence. In tune with the holistic philosophy, the best day spas go beyond conventional massage and fete you with herbal tea and eye candy, such as waterfalls and greenery, as they dispense such services as Chinese herbology facials, hot stone massage, ear candling and acupuncture.
Resort spas blend elements of the two, although depending on the resort, they vary enormously in scope. Generally, a resort spa provides many amenities of the destination spa with a more permissive diet and stays of almost any duration, even one night. As at a day spa, you can usually drop by for a scalp massage or an aromatherapy bath, even if you are not staying at the resort. Resorts allow you to graft a spa experience onto a conventional golf, beach, skiing or even theme-park vacation and provide the perfect holiday compromise when only one member of a couple wants to visit a spa. And because you can pick and choose spa activities, you determine how much wellness and herbal tea you can stand. In addition, children are often welcome.
Spas outside the United States are evolving, too. As Europe's state-run health systems cut back financing for classic hydrotherapy treatments, many old-style hotel spas in France and Germany have closed. The survivors are spas in better quality hotels, particularly those with American-style treatments. Day spas are flourishing worldwide, as are spas fashioned as retreats that immerse visitors in a country's culture. And big international hotels in Asia are building American-style resort spas.
"ALL resorts and hotels, if they want to survive, will eventually have spas," said Raoul Andrews Sudre, president of Aspen Spa Management, a consulting firm in Fort Lauderdale. He predicts that big hotel chains will start their own schools, training spa staff to a uniform standard of service. "It shouldn't be acceptable that four different estheticians do four different versions of the same treatment," he said. "If you visit a Ritz-Carlton or a Holiday Inn, you know what to expect. But people don't always know what to expect at spas."
So what can you expect from the spa of the future -- or the one you plan to visit next month? More than before, as spas new and old scramble to set themselves apart from the pack. An attractive building and adventurous pampering treatments are two obvious allures.
Think of the classic old-style spa, a clinical, Mitteleuropean structure out of a black-and-white movie, more hospital than haven with boxy, windowless treatment rooms. It's history. The new and refurbished spas are integrating historical or geographical details into their architecture, creating light-filled buildings with high ceilings and windows galore. The Spa Ojai, part of the Ojai Valley Inn and Spa, resembles a California mission, while the Westglow Spa in Blowing Rock, N.C., looks like Tara. Mr. Sudre describes the newly renovated spa at La Mamounia hotel in Marrakech, Morocco, as a facility with touches of the Arabian Nights. "A spa should give people the opportunity to live a dream, or be transported to another world," he said.
Many spas choose to transport visitors to the natural world, with the creative use of woods, rocks, waterfalls, plants and windows. "Losing touch with what's outside is what causes people to get so out of balance," said Jane Segerberg, president of the International Spa Association and former director of the Sea Island Spa at the Cloister in Sea Island, Ga. "Your mind doesn't quiet unless it's with nature."
Treatment rooms are friendlier, too. Treatment suites, where couples can indulge in simultaneous pampering, have become popular at spas like the Canyon Ranch Health Resort in Tucson, Ariz., and the lovely spa, in its own freestanding building across the Chao Phaya River, of the Oriental Hotel in Bangkok. Alfresco treatments are growing in appeal, too, at places like the Aquae Sulis spa at the Regent Las Vegas, which has a massage cabana.
Like spa architecture, the newest pampering treatments are elaborate, individualistic and laced with fantasy. Prevailing influences are Asian; instead of Swedish massage, you'll see Shiatsu massage, Reiki and Thai yoga massage on trendier treatment menus. Watsu, a style of massage based on the principles of Shiatsu and performed as you float in a pool, was the talk of the spa association's convention and is offered by a growing number of spas, including Canyon Ranch.
"When you're in warm water, the massage has more effect on your body and spirit than when it's performed on land," said Michele Chelenza, whose company, Waterdanse Consulting, in Middletown, Calif., trains Watsu practitioners.
High on the exotica charts is Aquae Sulis's Ela Kizhi rejuvenation treatment, based on the 7,000-year-old Siddha Vaidya system of herbal medicine, which purports to make skin look younger with the use of fresh herbs harvested from Hawaii and India during the monsoon season. "We do about two dozen a week," said Patricia Schneider, the spa director, of the 80-minute treatment, which costs $225.
For that holistic touch, spas are designing treatments that use local plants or traditional therapies. During the Adobe Clay Purification at the Spa at Marriott's Camelback Inn in Scottsdale, Ariz., adobe is applied to the skin, then washed off with a soap made from Southwestern plants and a cactus cloth, made from cactus ribs. Following a rubdown with juniper and sage oils, guests relax in the sauna ($110 for 60 minutes).
Spa experts expect these treatments to become more personalized. "Spas need to listen to what a client wants," said Mr. Rechelbacher. "I hate lavender, and I remember a massage therapist saying, 'You'll like it because I do.' Well, I didn't, and she shouldn't have used it."
To further distinguish themselves, spas are cultivating specialties. In the future, look for spas that provide child care, particularly for new mothers who want to get back in shape after having a baby. Or spas specializing in treating alcohol and drug abusers. And more spas will provide healing and recovery centers for patients who have undergone plastic surgery.
Medical-service spas are already a fast-growing niche. As health insurance companies cut back on preventive care, spas have stepped in with services such as cholesterol tests, bone density scans, cardiac stress tests, nutritional analysis, fitness assessments, even physician consultations. Spas provide a controlled environment in which to foster healthy eating, exercise and lifestyle habits. "People used to ask how to lose weight and look 10 years younger, but now they're coming with health questions," said Kristine Huffman, health and healing director at Canyon Ranch in the Berkshires in Lenox, Mass.
SPAS that don't have a health team on staff may look to outside sources. Last year, Dr. Florence Comite, an associate clinical professor at Yale University School of Medicine, initiated Destinations Health, a customized preventative care program for 35-to-55-year-old women that is available at the Noelle Spa for Beauty and Wellness, a day facility in Stamford, Conn., and the Spa Ojai. Before visiting the spa, participants fill out a questionnaire that is evaluated by a team in Connecticut. During the spa visit, a health and longevity portfolio is created that makes recommendations in areas such as diet, exercise and stress reduction.
"It's a health road map, with information on how to prevent disorders of aging and make the most of your health assets," said Dr. Comite, who plans to implement the program at additional spas. It costs $1,800 at Ojai and $1,500 at Noelle.
Escape -- from stress, worries and screaming kids -- is, of course, a classic spa specialty that will continue to flourish. Consider the town of Hershey, yes, that's Hershey, Pa. With a theme park, chocolate museum and candy factory tours, Hershey is a children's fantasy, but what about their parents? This fall the Hotel Hershey will open a spa, and is planning luxurious grown-up treatments like rose petal baths and milk and honey body wraps. Can cocoa-powder exfoliants and crushed-almond body scrubs be far off?

HEADLINE: The Way We Work Now: 3-5-00: Word & Image;
Free Agents Unite!

BYLINE: By Max Frankel 

 BODY:
By their media shall ye know them.
That has always been my test for whole societies. Never mind whether they call themselves Democracy or Republic: free press means free country; controlled press, miserable tyranny. The same goes for individuals. My media test also works for sorting out people, especially office workers. Never mind the title on the door or the workplace habitat, media power is what denotes true rank, clout and worth. 
 It was in Washington that I first realized that medium is not just message but also identity. Obviously, not every civil servant of rank could command a corner window or private toilet. So the telltale sign of superiority became a pen -- a government-issue tapered pen that stood erect in a holder originally designed for quills. A mere stenographer might also accidentally qualify for a window or coat closet instead of rack. But only a boss had one of those pens beside the blotter and water pitcher. Federal regulations required that token of status, no less rigorous than the Pentagon's dress code.
Ever since, I have come to expect workers' media of communication to define their hierarchical worth. After elegant desk sets became commonplace, corporate and government strivers acquired intercoms to summon subordinates. Next appeared dictation machines, and then portable recorders whose content could be tossed to underlings for typing and brought back for signing with those executive pens. Later down the chain of command came multibuttoned telephones with one-touch connection to different layers of the bureaucracy. And later still managers got silent buzzers to alert a secretary to overhear and transcribe a conversation. Eventually, inspired by the White House, the highest ranks achieved voice-activated recorders.
Inevitably, these functional media spread to hoi polloi, forcing the invention of supplementary definitions by decor, notably rugs on the floor, art on the walls and keys to private toilets, elevators and dining rooms. But ranking by media remains the most reliable status index. Indeed, it seems to be surviving even the centrifugal force of the Modem Rebellion.
In the post-modem world, the passkey to privilege is the PC password. In communal offices, whosoever is enabled by secret code to read into another's files -- without being read in return -- is well on the way to sizable bonuses and stock options. And even the least powerful password leads to a corporate support system of benefits, counselors and technological expertise. Walls, windows, carpets, paintings -- all the old physical attributes of rank and power have been supplanted by a virtual, and portable, medium. Institutional passwords unlock undeniable privilege. Few individuals cruising alone on the Web can long compete.
There are young techies who persist in believing that the Information Revolution is destroying all hierarchy and rapidly democratizing the means of creation and expression. They sound much like the last century's revolutionaries who thought they could democratize (i.e. communize) the means of production. Wired magazine, the liberationists' bible, would have us believe that every wired person on the planet will soon have an equal voice in things -- except, of course, that Wired itself is empowered by the lush advertising of corporate behemoths.
The modem explosion has indeed produced a great dispersion of the work force. And many of America's more than 20 million new home-office laborers proudly proclaim themselves "independent" contractors, "free agents" and "self-owned" businesses. Many delight in their flexible work schedules, with time for the kids and for errands, and their escape from supervision. But the truth is that a great many of today's independents, temps and self-employed are the downsized of yesterday, cast adrift without community, benefits or unemployment insurance. Never mind what they call themselves; by their media shall ye know them.
Look past the deceptively egalitarian cell phones, faxes and PC keyboards: truly secure, insured and tax-code favored Americans are wired into networks and propelled by corporate engines. And their speech is amplified by a collective. They get group health and pension plans that are subsidized by taxpayers as well as employers, plus numerous workplace amenities, sometimes even including child care. Equally well served are some "outsourced" workers who may labor at home or on the road but are authorized by higher authority to use SecurID cards and passwords to scale institutional fire walls and tap into networks of privilege.
The majority of home workers who cruise alone in the Internet without these corporate keys or community are discovering that their vaunted autonomy comes with a large dose of ignominy. They labor in fear of illness or recession, or both, and they lack protection against discrimination, most notably in taxation. They must pay an employer's share of Social Security as well as their own. They do not qualify for group insurance or benefits. They must fight the government to deduct office expenses. Only a few professionals among them enjoy the power to bargain collectively.
Show me a worker who hacks at home without a corporate password and I'll show you an underprivileged citizen. To be sure, communal office workers (is there no better term for the old office-office?) are bound to routines and schedules that interfere with domestic bliss and duties. And they are intensely scrutinized, most gallingly by WatchDog, a software that lets the boss track your every movement on the Web. But the home-office worker must watch the dog -- and greet the repairman, pay bills, chase accountants and lawyers and cry out constantly for technical help. That's multitasking with a vengeance.
Sooner or later, most unincorporated individualists will be corralled into unions that bargain for benefits and provide shared services. The MacArthur genius finders have already embraced the farsighted Sara Horwitz, the founder and leader of Working Today, a nonprofit lobby for nearly 100,000 free-agent members. Effective representation, of course, will require taxation and incorporation, then elections, politics and varied ranges of influence -- in other words, hierarchy. The reward will be benefits collectively achieved and individually coded, duly accessed by some password, the key to social worth, your place in the crowd.

With a Texas-Size Ambition

BYLINE: By ANNE MIDGETTE; Anne Midgette writes frequently about art, music and theater.

DATELINE: DALLAS

 BODY:
TELL a New Yorker that the symphony orchestra in Dallas is 100 years old, and the reaction will probably be surprise. The Dallas Symphony Orchestra would like to change that.
True, being 100 in Dallas is a little different from being 100 in, say, Philadelphia (where the orchestra is celebrating its centennial this year as well). The Dallas Symphony's history has followed a roller-coaster track of highs and lows. The group that started in May 1900 as the Dallas Symphony Club rose to see Antal Dorati and, briefly, Georg Solti as music directors in the years after World War II. But it also had to suspend operations during both world wars. It almost folded in the 1938-39 season, and in 1974-75, when Eugene Ormandy and the Philadelphians were celebrating that orchestra's 75th anniversary, the Dallas Symphony Orchestra was shut down for most of the season because of a bankruptcy that nearly snuffed it out. 
 But you get to reinvent yourself in America, and the Dallas Symphony has forged a new identity as a healthy American orchestra. In 1989, it opened the striking Meyerson Symphony Center, designed by I. M. Pei. In 1994, it hired a young American music director, Andrew Litton. In recent seasons the orchestra has visited Carnegie Hall regularly, and this year it will make its second European tour. It releases two to three CD's a year. Its composer's chair, established in 1999, is filled by one of America's most successful young composers, Lowell Liebermann. And the orchestra is aiming even higher.
"The board has a mandate to get Dallas within America's top-tier orchestras," Mr. Litton said. "It's a long-term project. I think it will take 10 years. And another five before the world notices."
The $100 million question (that being the size of the endowment the orchestra's president, Eugene Bonelli, hopes to raise in his quest for international renown) is whether it is possible to buy a tradition as something more than a good, solid, middle-of-the-road American orchestra.
In the last two decades, Dallas has devoted considerable resources to putting its cultural life on the national, even international, map. The downtown Arts District, where the Meyerson Center is located, did not exist 20 years ago. The symphony and the Dallas Museum of Art had been housed in outdated buildings in a complex known as Fair Park, a 15-minute drive from downtown.
The vision and backing of a few community leaders helped create the culture district out of whole cloth. The Dallas Museum of Art opened its new Arts District premises in 1984; the Meyerson followed in 1989. The Nasher Sculpture Park is to open in 2001, a gift of the Dallas real estate magnate and sculpture collector Ray Nasher. Next, Mr. Nasher and others dream of a new performing arts center for the opera company, the last Fair Park holdout. All of this, they hope, will gain the city a new cultural standing.
Certainly, the $82.5 million Meyerson Center -- which, if it had been named for its lead backer, would be known as the Ross Perot Center -- proves that with enough vision and money, you can indeed elevate your status. Justly famous for its architecture, the hall is also known for its sound. Its acoustical designer, Russell Johnson, equipped the wood-lined auditorium with huge resonance chambers, curtains that retract at the touch of a button and a 42-ton acoustic and lighting panel that looks like something out of a science fiction fantasy as it rises and falls on wire cables over the stage.
From the audience's standpoint, the sound is impressive. But not all the musicians agree. "It can be a tricky hall to play in," the principal clarinetist, Gregory Raden, said. "Onstage, you can have trouble hearing each other." Orchestra players were quoted as saying the same thing to Donal Henahan of The New York Times when the hall opened.
An important figure on the Meyerson's building committee was Mr. Bonelli, a symphony board member for 15 years. In 1993 he switched over to take charge of the orchestra's administration. As president of the Dallas Symphony Association, Mr. Bonelli has gone out of his way to stress his commitment to making the orchestra one of the best in the country. Formerly a dean of the School of the Arts at Southern Methodist University, Mr. Bonelli brings plenty of musical knowledge, if not practical experience, to his task.
But what will be most crucial to the endowment campaign is his ability to raise money. Still profiting from the groundswell that the Meyerson's opening created in the community, the Dallas Symphony has a lot more backing than it did in, say, 1974, when it went bankrupt during a period of local economic prosperity. Then, businesses chipped in a mere $28,000, a pittance even in 1974 dollars. Now Texas Instruments alone has pledged to help underwrite the orchestra's regular classical series for the next three years, to the tune of $1.3 million.
Local businesses have also contributed to the recent redesign of the Web site dallassymphony.com. Four of them have worked with the orchestra to create a technologically up-to-date site equipped with such bells and whistles as live 32-bit Webcasts of concerts, e-commerce and, come June, fully automated ticketing capabilities. The price tag over three years: more than $10 million. Even taking into account that this figure includes in-kind services from the companies involved, it's a whopping sum that occasions envious glances from other American orchestras.
Another place the Dallas Symphony spends money is on recording. Its label, Delos, stresses the importance of a two-way relationship. What this means in practice is that the orchestra itself covers the musicians' fees for recordings. Delos pays the costs of preproduction, bringing in equipment, and marketing and distribution. In these tight times for classical recording, there is a feeling in the industry that orchestras will, more and more, be going Dallas's route and assuming part of their own recording costs.
The Dallas Symphony will also need to spend money to attract the top-flight players necessary to achieve its high-flown goals, and to add at least 10 to its current roster of 92. But however much it spends, it may not be able to compete with all the cultural advantages of the Northeast or the tradition of an orchestra like Philadelphia's, which has lured away both the concertmaster, David Kim (who spent the 1998-99 season in Dallas), and the principal trumpeter, David Bilger.
"I want to have an impact on the history of music," Mr. Kim said. "I don't think I can do that in a Dallas or a Houston."
It is going to take a lot more money to change that. It also means that an improvement in musical standards that began in 1977 under the previous music director, Eduardo Mata, and that has continued since 1994 under Mr. Litton will have to be pushed further.
"The orchestra's level of technical expertise wouldn't need apology in any city in the world," said Scott Cantrell, the new music critic of The Dallas Morning News, which sponsors the orchestra's main concert series. "Whether Litton is one of the profound and compelling interpreters of today is another question."
Mr. Litton said he felt a "closed" quality about the orchestra under his predecessor. Opening it up and helping it move toward a more individual, freer playing style is a big part of his self-assigned task. The repertory Mr. Litton favors tends toward big, splashy works like Walton's "Belshazzar's Feast" or the Mahler symphonies. Not much Haydn or Mozart appears on the schedule.
Among the players, there is a consensus that Mr. Litton's energy and drive have led to more touring, more recordings, more exposure. But he has proved an uneven interpreter. His energy, expressed in Bernsteinian flourishes onstage, can be compelling, but it can also spill over into coarseness. His tempos are audibly idiosyncratic. He also has a predilection for the loud.
"The brass pushed to the very edge of vulgarity, and then, just, drew back," a critic from The Times of London wrote of a 1997 performance of Tchaikovsky's Fifth Symphony at the Royal Albert Hall. "It seemed an emblem of the entire performance. Litton would dare extremes of tempo and dynamics which, in other hands, could well curdle into sentiment or flash into mere histrionics. Yet he pulled it off."
This description of a kind of tightrope act, of snatching a decent performance from the jaws of something far less classy, could apply to a number of Mr. Litton's live and recorded performances.
To judge from reviews, the orchestra can make a good first impression, which it may not sustain on longer acquaintance.
"Artistically, we're in a holding pattern," said Gregory Hustis, the principal horn player. Audiences may feel the same way. The last five or six seasons under Mata, and the first seasons under Mr. Litton, were completely sold out. But attendance has declined slightly over the last two seasons.
Mr. Litton seems unconcerned. His contract runs until 2003, and he is clearly content with his position. "You can tell when things are right," he said. "Why leave when we're on the up curve?"
However harrowing the history, there can be little question from the present perspective that the Dallas Symphony is a success story. "When I first came, we played background music while people stood in line to get swine-flu shots at the North Park Mall," said Mr. Hustis, a 24-year veteran. "The musician's lot in the Dallas Symphony is incomparable, it's so much better."
And some players see nothing wrong with embracing this new status as an eminently respectable second-tier American orchestra and leaving it at that.
"For who we are and what we are, we do a pretty good job," said the flutist Harvey Boatright, who has played with the Dallas Symphony for 40 years. "If it makes some people happy to think that we're shooting for the top, well, fine."

HEADLINE: The Price of Freedom

BYLINE: By Nina Munk; Nina Munk last wrote for the magazine about the architect Thierry Despont.

 BODY:
It's early winter. Cold. We've ordered in breaded-chicken sandwiches, Ari Horowitz and I, and are sitting in his cheerless office in Midtown Manhattan. "This whole concept of having to be in the office from 9 to 5, or whatever it is, that's gone, that's just not the world," muses Horowitz, founder of FreeAgent.com, a Web site for independent contractors, freelancers, part-timers and moonlighters. "There's no corporate loyalty or any of that stuff anymore."
Above Horowitz's desk is a badly framed reproduction of a Jackson Pollock. Near the door, tacked to the wall, is a blown-up cover of Snowboard Life magazine that Horowitz rescued from someone's trash. ("Learn to Snowboard the Easy Way!") Not that Horowitz, 31, has much time for snowboarding or art collecting. Himself, he's not a free agent. "I'm an entrepreneur, so I've got to come here every day. I can't disappear. I can't even take vacations. The free agent has a much better lifestyle. They're not necessarily going to make as much money as I might, but they can go snowboarding; they can decide when they want to work and when they don't want to work. It's an incredible lifestyle. I can't really think of a better way to spend your life." 
 Along with Horowitz, a small but vocal group of academics, evangelists and entrepreneurs are promoting this way of life: they're convinced we're on the cusp of a free-agent revolution. From their point of view, big centralized companies with thousands of permanent employees are relics. Back in the days of manual typewriters, before the electronic age, megacompanies made sense. How else could a team of engineers, designers and marketers work together? But in the digital age, the reasoning goes, megacorporations will be displaced by something called virtual corporations -- teams of "free agents" who work together for the duration of a project, and no longer. Ari Horowitz compares the virtual corporation to a movie set: "In Hollywood, when you produce a movie, it's not about a corporation, it's about all these individuals who have complementary skill sets: they come together, they work on a team, they produce something and they disperse," he explains. "This is what I envision the future of work being."
According to the gospel, free agency isn't just a business model; it's a workers'-liberation movement, promising emancipation from the shackles of corporate America. Perhaps you've heard this radio ad for FreeAgent.com, whose slogan is "For a Brave New Work Force": "If people often call you the hired gun, you just may be a free agent. If people call you 'that guy on 15 who's been here forever,' you are not a free agent. If you've ever sent an urgent e-mail pitching yourself for a primo project half a world away, you're a free agent. If you've ever sent an urgent e-mail asking, 'Who left the burrito in the office microwave?' you are not a free agent."
Fussing over burritos left in the microwave is hopelessly conventional. As are dental plans, expense accounts, life insurance, 401(k) plans and sick leave. Today's heroes take risks -- they're entrepreneurs and I.P.O. millionaires, and if you haven't achieved that status, becoming a free agent may be the next best thing. The term free agent conjures the seven-figure salaries of professional ballplayers. It also hints at self-reliance: free agents, like mercenary soldiers, can join one army after another. They don't need the company, they claim; the company needs them. "Be your own boss!" exhorts an advertisement for Guru.com, another Web site for free agents. "Work where you want, when you want. No supervisors. No commuting hassles. Earn $$$ thousands. Freedom to balance your priorities and work in your pajamas."
The cult of the free agent took off in January 1998, when Fast Company, organ of new-age management, heralded on its cover, "Free Agent Nation." As if reporting the demise of corporate America (with its layoffs, office politics, demotions, harassment, hierarchies and general incompetence), the cover lines continued: "25 Million Americans Declare Independence. Are You Ready to Join Them?" It was the Boston Tea Party all over again.
The author of that story, Daniel Pink, a former speechwriter for Al Gore, has since become a one-man advocacy group for free agency, quoted as an authority in publications like Newsweek and The Wall Street Journal. A contributing editor at Fast Company, Pink is currently writing a book about free agents. He also operates a Web site called FreeAgentNation.com, and he gives (paid) speeches promoting free agency. In exchange for stock options, he serves on the advisory board of FreeAgent.com's parent company, Opus360, and writes an advice column for Guru.com. Pink claims he's enriching the lives of workers (many of whom do not have stock options). "I happen to think it's a human way to work, so I advocate it for people," he tells me.
Pink believes that something bigger and higher than technology is driving the free-agent revolution: a search for spirituality. "I thought this was an economic story," he says. "Then I realized it was much gooier than that. It's about emotions, feelings, lifestyle, family. . . . After I wrote the Fast Company article, my mailbox started flooding with letters from people saying, 'Oh, my God, this is me!' Work has become almost a secular religion; people are trying to self-actualize through work. But it's hard to find yourself in a cubicle. It's easier when you're on your own." In other words, earning $$$ thousands in your pajamas may well be the path to self-fulfillment.
Pink's greatest contribution to free agency involves statistics: when he wrote the Fast Company article, he counted 25 million free agents in America; now he says there are 33 million. Just how did Pink arrive at those huge numbers? He won't let on. "I'm pretty sure the government agencies don't know how to count this," he says confidently, explaining how his estimate is nearly three times larger than numbers compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (which says there are 12 million nontraditional workers in America). "I have in my book a separate chapter on numbers," Pink continues. "But I'd like to hold off on giving out that information until the book comes out. It's very difficult," he admits, "to be definitive."
Definitive or not, by this time Pink's hopeful and opportunistic numbers have been repeated so often they've become a cliche, repeated in stock-offering prospectuses, publicity material and other channels of hype. "Between you and me," a founder of a temp agency said, "Dan had no clue. But his numbers became gospel and, hey, it worked. Now everyone bases the market on those numbers."
Promoting their business models with Pink's buoyant stats, dozens of companies targeting free agents have been popping up. Among them: icPlanet.com, Ants.com, IMCOR.com, eLance.com, MBAFreeAgents.com, iNiku.com and Aquent.com.
Like FreeAgent.com, these Web sites match employers with employees, listing short-term and part-time jobs and encouraging "free agents" to post resumes online. They also offer advice and give pep talks promoting free agency to those who cling to their 401(k)'s as if to life rafts. ("Sure working for yourself is scary," warns Aquent's Web site. "Life is an adventure and then you die. Live now!") MBAFreeAgents' focus is business-school graduates; Aquent's is technology; IMCOR's is "portable executives," including chief executive officers, chief financial officers and chief technology officers.
Other companies riding the free-agent wave include the Ebays of human capital: online talent auctions like Bid4Geeks.com and Talent Market, part of Monster.com, where free agents offer their services to the highest bidder. Recently, a freelance pastry chef in Astoria, Queens, with a talent for making croissants and brioches, put himself up for sale on Talent Market. (He had attracted no bidders when I last checked.) At Ants.com and icPlanet.com, free agents compete in a process known as a reverse auction, in which an employer offers a job and entertains bids. One posting at Ants.com, for example, urges multilingual free agents to bid on this job: translating a mammoth high-tech manual from French into Turkish and English. As of late February, 12 translators had placed bids ranging from $50,000 to $750,000.
Whether they specialize in technology or Turkish, dot-coms dedicated to free agents have yet to prove they can make money. According to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, FreeAgent.com, for example, lost $30 million last year on revenues of just $400,000. Access to the site's basic services is free to anyone who registers with FreeAgent.com; at last count (Feb. 9), roughly 64,000 people had done so.
But in order for FreeAgent.com to be profitable, it must get its registered users to upgrade to membership status, which costs $199 upfront, plus $119 to $274 a month (higher rates offer more benefits). Members -- there were only 286 as of Feb. 9 -- get to buy group-rate insurance, join a retirement plan and have their paperwork looked after (invoices, bills, taxes and so on). Each member also receives between 250 and 500 stock options in FreeAgent.com's parent company, which is about to go public. In addition to fees from members, FreeAgent.com intends to charge companies for posting jobs. It also plans to sell banner ads and earn commissions on products sold through FreeAgent.com. An optimist, Horowitz anticipates that throngs of free agents, lured by "the perfect lifestyle," will eventually be drawn to his Web site.
For all the hype, there's nothing glamorous about most of the jobs posted on the free-agent Web sites. On FreeAgent.com, someone's looking for a bookkeeper to work 4 hours a week, there's a 15-hour-a-week job editing marketing material, an opening for a receptionist ("able to professionally answer 4+ incoming lines!") and so on through the range of skills.
I contacted a few dozen people whose resumes were posted on FreeAgent.com. Almost everyone admitted this much: if the right full-time, permanent job came along, they'd embrace it, eagerly. Last year Ralph Armenta lost his job as a managing director of a big hedge fund. When I spoke to him in January, he identified himself as "an involuntary free agent," working from his home in New Jersey on short-term assignments. "I'm 40 years old," he explained. "I have a couple of kids, age 6 and 2. I'd like stability. Maybe if I were 5 or 10 years younger and had less responsibility, I would take a run at it. But I want to be back in the work force." He doesn't want to earn $$$ thousands in his pajamas; like most people, he'd like a regular paycheck.
The profile that Paulette M. Glassman posted on FreeAgent.com highlights her 10 years of experience producing advertisements and films. But like Armenta, Glassman is not a free agent by choice. She is forced to make do with part-time work. "I keep hearing about how good the job situation is, but for me, for people who are grown women -- I'd rather not give my age, but I'm not 21 -- it's been tough to find work. I'm struggling to stay solvent." Most of the responses Glassman gets to her posting on FreeAgent.com and other job-recruitment Web sites are unwelcome: offers from multilevel marketing outfits, many of which appear to be Ponzi schemes. Sometimes, when the phone does ring in her cramped studio apartment, it's a debt-collection agency calling.
More than 60 percent of free agents earn less than regular full-time workers in comparable jobs, according to a study by the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning Washington research group. They have no benefits, they don't get stock options or paid vacations, and free agents may not be protected by employment laws. "It's certainly true that there's a growth in the number of workers who are contract workers," remarks Stephen Barley, co-director of the Center for Work Technology and Organization at Stanford University. Barley spent two years studying free agents in Silicon Valley. (The results of that study will be published later this year.) "To call them free agents, however, is, well, interesting. The vast majority of them work through a staffing firm." Which is to say that the vast majority of them are temps. Outside Hollywood and Silicon Valley, the "virtual corporation" is virtually unknown.
For people whose skills are in high demand -- Java programmers, corporate turnaround experts, Internet consultants -- being a free agent may have the potential to be liberating. Last summer, Samantha Saturn (her real name) quit her job as director of marketing for CDNow, an online music store, in order to do her very own thing. She called her firm Saturn Network, whose promising slogan is "Expert Marketing Solutions for Digital Brands." So far, working out of a one-bedroom apartment in Greenwich Village, Saturn, 28, has had four short-term assignments. Her latest: a five-month marketing project for PlanetOut, a gay-and-lesbian Web site that's getting ready for an initial public offering.
Saturn sets her own hours. She telecommutes. She doesn't have to play office politics anymore. Sometime she works from Les Deux Gamins, an of-the-moment cafe right around the corner from her apartment. Installing herself at a corner table with her I.B.M. laptop, cell phone and a pot of coffee, as if Les Deux Gamins were her office, Saturn holds meetings, she brainstorms, she writes long memos. "It makes me feel like I'm in Paris," she says. Like Hemingway at Les Deux Magots.
But New York in the 2000's is a lot more expensive than Paris in the 1920's. Being a free agent is costly. There are bills to pay: office supplies, long-distance phone calls, Internet service, photocopying, FedEx deliveries, travel, business lunches, lawyers and accountants. There's health insurance and Social Security and Medicare taxes, which, at 15.3 percent of income, is double what old-fashioned permanent employees pay. To balance the burden, Saturn has been given a bit of equity from some of the dot-coms she has counseled. "I'm getting little pieces of a lot of companies at a very critical time," she explains sotto voce. "There's no way I could do this unless I were a venture capitalist."
About her past life as an ordinary full-time employee, she remembers that she "was a slave to my job, a total workaholic." Is she following the 12 steps? Not exactly. "Actually," she confesses, "I work more now."
Back in 1988, long before the term "free agent" signified the emancipated worker, Randy Nelson, now 50, made a business decision: never ever again would he be tied to one company. For eight years, Nelson had been a rising executive in the oil-and-gas division of CSX Railroad in Houston. When CSX decided to get out of oil and gas, Nelson was out of a job, just like that. "That was a wake-up call for me, a watershed event, an epiphany," he recalls. "I thought, I never again want my personal identity to be wrapped up in a corporation. From now on I want to think of my employer as a customer, a client, a revenue generator."
Now Nelson identifies himself as a free agent, a portable executive. His last project was overseeing the introduction of software at a chemicals firm in New Jersey. It lasted 18 months. "I'm an entrepreneur, a make-things-happen guy, a mover-shaker," he says excitedly, explaining why the free-agent life suits him to a T. "I'm not a nurturer; I'm not a long-term guy."
But as Nelson admits, there's a downside to being your own boss and doing your own thing. "It's a very hard, grueling lifestyle," he says. On his last project, he was away from home for a year and a half. "I only came home on alternate weekends. And you don't have control over the downtime between assignments. You may want two months off but get five, or want five months off an'd get only six weeks. You can't do it if you're not a self-driven person who's happy being lonely. You'll always be an outsider; you'll never be accepted as a full member of the team. You're kind of like the gunslinger who comes into town. People will say you're a coldblooded mercenary and look down on you for that."
The longer Nelson and I talked, the more his enthusiasm seemed to wane. "Sooner or later," he said, "I'm going to tire of this interim-executive thing."
Who has the most to gain from the free-agent revolution? Certainly those who advocate it. Ari Horowitz must surely be grateful that he is not a free agent but an Internet entrepreneur instead. He'll probably be worth about $35 million, on paper, when Opus360, FreeAgent.com's parent company, completes its coming initial public offering. As for Dan Pink, unofficial census taker of the free-agent nation, he'll soon be able to cash in his options in FreeAgent.com. And when his book is published early next year, he'll no doubt take his free-agent publicity machine on the road.
The other big winners are companies in the market for what economists call a flexible work force, which is to say, workers who can be hired and fired overnight, in the blink of an eye. Workers who answer 4-plus incoming lines and to whom you have no obligation whatsoever. Workers who are here today, gone tomorrow.
FreeAgent.com knows the score. Its Web site includes a page that encourages employers to hire its eager temps. "Top 10 Reasons Why Managers Love Free Agents" is how it begins. And then FreeAgent.com shows its hand:
10. They don't need pep talks.
9. They don't gripe about their salary.
8. They won't stab you in the back.
7. They tell you when your ideas expletive .
6. When they're sick, they work from home.
5. They don't ask for health insurance, paid vacations, personal days . . .
4. . . . 401(k) plans, stock options, quarterly bonuses. . . .
3. no performance reviews.
2. If they're stupid, lazy or incompetent, you can fire them pretty easily.
1. They do all the work, you take all the credit.

HEADLINE: From the Classroom to the Ballroom

BYLINE: By NANCY DONIGER 

 BODY:
WHEN the sixth-grade students begin arriving for the 6:30 p.m. Social Dance Class at Eastern Middle School in Greenwich, each girl picks up a pair of white gloves from a basket and puts them on. They are all wearing dresses, or dressy blouses and skirts and party shoes, their hair neatly styled.
An equal number of boys enter the room, all wearing jackets, ties and leather shoes, their hair combed, with not a pair of jeans or sneakers in sight. 
 Youth dance classes like this are blossoming in Connecticut schools, social clubs, dance halls and restaurants. Ballroom dancing has shed its stuffy image and become the in thing to do.
Hip hop and rap, and the oversized clothes associated with them, may not be ready for the oldies heap, but they are facing competition from ballroom dancing and maybe even a return to good grooming among Connecticut youth.
Laura DiNatale arrived to the dance class at Eastern Middle School with her mother, Jean DiNatale, a Parent Teacher Association volunteer who helped set up the evening's refreshments with a fellow P.T.A. volunteer, Maria Dubaz. Mrs. DiNatale is also in charge of the gloves for the entire group. She collects and washes them after each session and brings them back to the next class.
"I'd rather be in the gloves than touch some of the boys," said Laura. "Their hands get all clammy. Plus the gloves are elegant," she adds, looking at her hands.
The trend toward ballroom dancing, which is a generic term for dances such as the cha-cha, fox trot, tango, mamba, waltz and swing, is attributable in part to the popularity of big band music, like "Zoot Suit Riot," performed by Cherry Poppin' Daddies. Santana's "Smooth," which recently won Grammy Awards for record of the year and song of the year, is also very popular with midddle-school dancers.
Robin Poska of Ballroom Magic Inc. of Darien teaches dance classes with her husband, Edward. The Poskas had 250 students in their ballroom classes five years ago. They now have 1,000 students and have added more programs in other communities.
Arthur Murray Dance Studios in Danbury has had a 10 percent increase in programs for young adults and Sophia Almeida, the Danbury franchise owner, said the company reports the same increase worldwide.
Ms. Poska said parents sometimes need to give a gentle push to get their children to try ballroom dancing, but by the time they have been doing it awhile, as the Eastern Middle School youngsters have, they look forward to it.
Besides teaching at Greenwich's Eastern and Central Middle Schools, the Poskas teach social dancing and etiquette to young people in Darien, Rowayton, Westport and New Canaan. They have waiting lists in many communities.
A return to civility is prompting a renewed interest in ballroom dancing and good manners, according to Tammis Lazarus, director of the Junior Assembly of Rowayton, where the Poskas teach social dancing and etiquette, including table and telephone manners, and thank-you note writing to children in Grades 4 through 6.
"I think it's something all kids need to be exposed to," Mrs. Lazarus said. "Learning these things from people other than their parents helps kids to listen and take it in."
It took a while to catch on when she first started the program, five years ago, she said. Some parents were reluctant to sign up because they thought their children wouldn't like it.
"But they don't know how fun and beneficial it is until they try it," she said.
Movies and the media have also revitalized ballroom dancing. A Gap commercial, featuring swing dancing, that aired last year was a huge catalyst, as were movies like "The Mask" and "Swingers," according to Peter von Oy, a college senior from Newtown, who recently started a swing dance group, "Swing in' Time" with his younger sister and brother, Alyssa and Tyler.
Peter von Oy, a soccer player and martial artist, had never taken a dance lesson before his new-found passion. His interest began after a visit from his best friend who goes to college in Colorado and introduced the von Oys to swing last year. They were hooked after the first session. They hold regular weekend dance parties in their basement recreation room and give demonstrations at fund-raisers and special events.
"People who do ballroom dance are in as good shape as runners," Peter said. "
Although Tyler, a seventh grader involved in the school drama club, admitted to preferring computer games to swing, he agreed, "It's a lot of fun and gets your heart going. It's good to impress people at school dances."
Alyssa, a senior in high school and all-around athlete, is involved with a program called physical education leadership at Newtown High School and has taught swing to younger students during gym classes.
The von Oys' goal is to compete in swing dancing and teach it to other young people. They have a Web site for their dance group at www. geocities.com/swing_in_time/.
Virginia King, the assistant principal at Newtown Middle School, introduced ballroom dancing three years ago at the school. Ms. King had been attending the Wednesday dance nights at Newtown's Fireside Inn and became involved with ballroom dancing, so much so that she added a large dance studio to her home.
"My dance partner and I would attend our middle school dances, and we always attracted a crowd of students," Ms. King said. Ms. King surveyed the parents, determined a high interest level and hired Stephen Karpovich, director of the Arthur Murray studio in Danbury.
The Newtown students have their classes right after school and wear their regular school clothes, but Karpovich still manages to incorporate dance etiquette into the sessions.
"We all learn etiquette without the white gloves," he said. "I was a big-time jock in school. Dancing takes endurance and technique. It's made me a better athlete. I like to call it 'dance sport,' rather than ballroom dancing."
John Grocki, director of athletics at Irving Robbins Middle School in Farmington, has arranged to have a ballroom dance artist teach swing to the eighth grade in preparation for their promotion dance at the end of the year, where they will be accompanied by the school's jazz band.
Michelle Evans, a winner with her dance partner of numerous ballroom dance awards in the United and England, will teach the in-school sessions, paid for by the Parent Teacher Association. Last year Ms. Evans taught after-school classes at Irving Robbins, but her schedule does not permit it this year, Mr. Grocki said.
"The kids really enjoyed it," he said. "Every kid that started out with it finished it. They're coming to me this year and asking if we're going to do it again. My feeling is the kids need more dance. Their coordination is not where it should be."
Ms. Evans, who lives in Collinsville, started a nonprofit organization called Hartford Youth Dance Initiative five years ago. She teaches social dance to children from all different socio-economic groups at Moylan Elementary School and the Breakthrough Charter School in Hartford.
"I decided to devote myself to teaching the lifelong fun of ballroom dancing to children," she said. "It's something you can do your whole life, like riding a bike. Once you learn it, you never forget it."
Ms. Poska agrees with the notion of starting dance training at a young age. Some parents think fourth grade is too young, but Ms. Poska finds it's ideal because children are so receptive at that age.
"We make an effort to make the program enjoyable and child-friendly," she said. "Parents remember the girl who didn't get picked, or the boy no one wanted to dance with. Now everyone dances with everyone. The hardest job for parents is to get their child there the first night."

HEADLINE: From Tree to Table, It's Time to Taste Syrup

BYLINE: By NANCY POLK 

 BODY:
MUD season is maple syrup season. Now is the best time to visit one of Connecticut's 200 maple syrup producers to watch tree sap boiled down into syrup.
Even though the state produces its own maple syrup, the odds are that syrup bought here will come from somewhere else, most likely Vermont. 
 Last year, Connecticut generated 1.9 percent of the New England maple production compared to Vermont's hefty 54.8 percent.
Stephen H. Broderick, extension forester for the University of Connecticut Cooperative Extension system, said Connecticut wasn't thought of as a maple products state, but it should be. "According to a survey of the U.S. Forest Service there are at least 100,000 acres that could be managed for maple production," Mr. Broderick said. But they are not, he added, because "homeowners don't understand that they could rent their property to maple producers."
Small wooded areas could be tapped but the trees must have a diameter of about 10 inches. Maples must generally be about 40 years old before they can be safely tapped without harming the tree.
Maple syrup sells at a premium price because maple sugaring, the process of converting maple sap to maple syrup, is labor intensive and requires about 40 gallons of sap to produce just one gallon of syrup.
The sap, esentially sugar water, is gathered in buckets or by flexible plastic tubing, then collected in a tank and fed into an evaporator, which dissipates the water, leaving only the concentrated sap. High-quality syrup requires fast boiling at 218 to 220 degrees.
Jason Mancini, a staff archeologist for the Mashantucket Pequot tribe, said the Connecticut Indians probably learned the skill of tapping for sap from tribes in more northern parts of New England. He explained that sugaring, which includes making both syrup and granular maple sugar, was a relatively new activity.
"About 300 to 400 years ago there were hardly any maples," he said. The native people, he said, burned the forests "to prepare to plant crops, build homes, encourage browsing of game and to spur growth of nut trees which they believed occurred after burning."
The Connecticut landscape at that time resembled "a big field," according to Stephen Cook, the curator of the Mashantucket Pequot Museum. Connecticut was a significant grain-producing state until the 1920's, he said. Maple trees began to reappear in the mid-18th century when the burning had subsided.
Several different varieties of maples grew but only two types of maple trees yield sap for syrup. One is the classic sugar maple (acer saccharum) which turns golden yellow in fall and produces a sap that is 2 percent sugar. The other, soft or swamp maple, (acer rubrum) turns brilliant red in fall and yields sap that is half as sweet and requires much more to yield a gallon of syrup, according to Mr. Broderick.
Homeowners can forget tapping that spreading Norway maple in the front yard. It cannot be used. For the adventurous, black birch trees can be tapped for a birch syrup with a minty flavor that Mr. Broderick said was the original source of wintergreen flavoring.
Maple production is not a large industry; in fact, in the words of Ron Olsen, a marketing representative from the Connecticut Department of Agriculture, it is "a little niche." In 1999 that niche was 13,000 gallons of syrup, earning producers $500,000, which Mr. Olsen called a good year.
Maple products have an additional impact on Connecticut's economy. When families visit the sap houses found throughout the state, they are part of the emerging business of "ag-tourism," combining a family outing with an opportunity to learn about agricultural. "It's not necessary to drive up to Vermont to see the sugar process," he said.
Visiting farms is growing in popularity in Connecticut. The tree tapping begins when the ground is frozen and ends when trees begin to bud.
"This time of year, folks are looking forward to spring and a visit to a Connecticut sugarhouse is a bridge into the new season," said Shirley Ferris, agriculture commissioner.
Homeowners can make their own maple syrup but Mr. Broderick suggests it be done outdoors. Mr. Broderick warns that the process produces so much steam it can peel off kitchen wallpaper and coat walls and ceiling with light brown sticky stuff.
"I have seen homemade rigs designed through Yankee ingenuity including 55 gallon drums, brick walls for the firebox and big lasagna pans to cook the sap," he said.
Several Connecticut dealers sell modern equipment to make maple syrup. (Mr. Broderick said it could be dangerous to use the old sap collection buckets and boiling pans because of the lead.) The Flanders Nature Center in Woodbury, has a booklet, "Making Maple Syrup at Home" that provides how-to directions and recipes that include maple-flavored popcorn and ice cream.
The nature center has been demonstrating the art of making maple syrup since the mid-1960's. On weekends, up to 50 people inspect the taps and buckets and crowd into the sugarhouse to watch the sap boil into syrup. Visitors leave smelling sweetly of maple.
Jolynn Rostowsky, director of education at the center, said demonstrations will conclude on March 19.
Another traditional New England treat consumers can easily make is called "sugar-on-snow." It involves pouring boiling hot thickened syrup over fresh snow packed into a pie pan or cone. The result is a confection with a taffy-like texture. In Vermont the traditional accompaniment to sugar on snow is the dill pickle. The Northwest Park Sugarhouse in Windsor serves this treat without the pickle.
Richard Norman, of Woodstock, the president of the Maple Syrup Producers Association of Connecticut, expressed concern about this year's crop because of last year's drought.
"Summer is when the trees put away their starch," said Mr. Norman, who has tapped trees for 25 years. "The drought might make a difference. We'll know in a few weeks."
Warm sunny days followed by cold nights below freezing cause the pressure in the maple trees that starts the sap flowing. The season is over when the tree buds appear, generally mid to the end of March unless it is an unusually cold spring when the sap flows into April.
Several Connecticut nature centers have maple syrup demonstrations. For a complete list of maple producers, call the Connecticut Department of Agriculture at (860) 713-2503 and ask for the "Guide to Maple Sugarhouses."

HEADLINE: Convention Center Shapes Boston Harbor Area

BYLINE: By SUSAN DIESENHOUSE 

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
WITH a 2.3-million-square-foot convention center as its vanguard, a new commercial neighborhood with luxury housing is emerging on Boston Harbor, which for almost four centuries has been the heart of this compact city perennially in search of expansion space. Nine projects valued at $3 billion are being developed in a district once dominated by wharves, ship terminals, fish processors and warehouses.
On April 2, after almost a year of site preparation, construction will start on the $700 million South Boston Convention and Exhibition Center, the linchpin of this new downtown district. 
 "It's a big gorilla that's about to sit down on the waterfront," said Dean F. Stratouly, a Cambridge developer who is directing the convention center project for the Massachusetts Convention Center Authority.
Once completed in 2003, "It will legitimize the whole area." Mr. Stratouly said, creating "a demand for 4,800 hotel rooms and support services that will drive up real estate values."
The modernistic 120-foot-long, 6-story convention center will be large enough to attract the major meetings that have been bypassing Boston. The eight other projects being developed nearby include luxury hotels, offices and 1,200 residential units to be built within the next five years.
They will complement the convention center as well as the 1990's projects -- a new federal courthouse and hotel -- that sprouted on this section of the waterfront, which is a 10-minute walk from Boston's financial district and a six-minute drive to Logan International Airport.
"It's a gold rush already," said Mr. Stratouly, president of Congress Group Ventures, referring to the new projects being planned and the rising real estate values. The increased real estate costs are raising housing prices in the surrounding residential areas of South Boston. "The waterfront," Mr. Stratouly said, "is going from lunchboxes to briefcases."
But some wonder whether this boon for developers and businesses will hamper the operations of New England's premier commercial port, which in 1999, according to port officials, transported $10 billion in goods through its newly dredged waterways. "When you have incompatible uses, something has to give," said Vivian Li, president of the Boston Harbor Association, a private maritime advocacy group. "The conventioneers and firms moving in from the financial district will displace the small businesses that work the commercial port."
Indeed, 92 mostly maritime-related businesses were relocated to assemble the 62-acre convention center site. But the Port of Boston, which since 1996 increased the value of the cargo it handles by 30 percent, hopes to acquire more waterfront space for support operations like warehouses. "We're bursting at the seams," said Georgeanne Tacelli, a spokeswoman for the port.
Signaling the competition under way for space at the harbor, the Gillette Company, one of New England's largest manufacturers, with a sprawling plant on the South Boston waterfront, also intends to continue growing in the area.
Ultimately, the factor that has made all this development possible and will determine which players can efficiently use the waterfront is access to a modern intermodal transportation system, a network that integrates travel by land, sea and air. "What makes this area work for any particular user is transportation," said Ms. Li, the maritime advocate.
Throughout the 1990's, about $20 billion in federal, state and municipal funds have been earmarked to rebuild the land transport network that runs through downtown Boston, linking the waterfront and with the airport via a new tunnel under the harbor. During the road construction, new sewer, water, electric and telecommunications lines are being installed underground. Some of the funds have also been invested to upgrade facilities at Logan Airport, as well as to clean and dredge the harbor waters.
The convention center site is at a crossroads where all forms of the upgraded transportation network will intersect. It is within a few blocks of what will be a rebuilt downtown highway, Interstate 93; a new extension of the Massachusetts Turnpike; a truck haul road; a rapid transit line; and the Ted Williams Tunnel to the airport. However, while about $320 million in federal and state funds have been allocated at the 500-acre commercial port for new terminals, cranes and computerized truck-cargo processing, its transport system is still missing a vital link.
MODERN ports need double-stack freight rail facilities so cargo containers can be lifted off ships and loaded two high on freight trains. In 1995, the State Legislature allocated $86 million to modernize tracks and raise a few bridges to enable the double-stack trains to pass underneath, but the funds have never been appropriated.
"There's no more movement on double-stack rail," said David Panagore, who is directing the convention center project for the city planning agency. But a recent planning agency agreement with CSX railroad will enable steel for the convention center to be shipped to the site by rail, to lower construction costs. Given these developments, shippers and truckers worry that they may lose access to the area in a few years if roads are closed to commercial traffic to make way for pedestrians, Ms. Li added. Nevertheless, each year the port is generating $10 billion in revenues and $3 billion in related economic activity.
Meanwhile the convention center, financed by $700 million in state and municipal bonds and taxes, is likely to lose $15 million annually in its early years while generating $500 million a year in direct economic activity, according to Alan D. Reid, chief financial officer of the convention center authority. "The convention center is a loss leader to fill the hotels and restaurants," he explained.
The convention center has gone from concept to construction quickly for a project of its size and complexity. In only three years, a group of business leaders and politicians shepherded enabling legislation through the Statehouse and agreed on a site and a design; the city took the 62 acres by eminent domain; and the South Boston community settled on a benefits package of about $10 million in housing, training and jobs.
The glass, steel and precast concrete convention center, designed by Rafael Vinoly Architects of New York and HNTB Architecture of Boston, will have a 600,000-square-foot exhibition hall, 200,000 square feet of meeting rooms and parking for 1,000 cars in its first phase of 1.9 million square feet. Attached will be a $265 million, 1,120-room Sheraton Hotel to be developed by Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide Inc. of White Plains.
While many hotel projects here and across the country have been stymied by a dearth of financing, Starwood expects that banks will extend loans and that pension funds will invest.
"Boston is a hot hotel market, we're attached to a state-of-the-art convention center, our site is a mile from the airport and so much new development is planned for the area," said Andrew E. Zobler, a vice president at Starwood.
Development prospects are bright, Mr. Stratouly stressed. After he completes his unpaid tour of duty for the convention center authority, even he may invest there. "At some point, this is going to be prime property," he said. "I can't develop anything now, but I hope to in the future."

HEADLINE: Foxwoods-Glen Cove Ferry Rules the Sound

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
WHEN a Glen Cove councilwoman, MaryAnn Holzkamp, showed up on Wednesday to greet the Tatobam as it arrived in Hempstead Harbor to inaugurate high-speed ferry service from New London, Conn., there was no fanfare. In fact, she barely had time to get on board before an aide was whispering that the crew was ready to pull up the gangplanks for the return trip to Connecticut and they had to get off.
So after a rushed tour of the two decks, she was ushered out to the newly rebuilt pier as the Tatobam's twin 7,000-horsepower gas turbines began to whine and the ship moved away from the dock. She said she hopes that in time, the Tatobam will be seen as more than just a connection to the Foxwoods Resort Casino. 
 "I think eventually it will become an alternative means for Long Islanders to get over to New London, and hopefully it'll bring people from the other side to our community," Ms. Holzkamp said.
But not this week: all 28 riders who boarded in Glen Cove for the first regularly scheduled trip to Connecticut immediately boarded a bus in New London headed for the gambling halls.
"I've been waiting for this since they first started talking about it almost two years ago," said Nicholas F. Distasio of Oceanside. "I go to Foxwoods once in a while, and now I can see myself making more trips."
Inez S. Mirra of Old Westbury called in sick to her office to make the trip to Foxwoods, her first to the casino; one reason she has not visited is her refusal to face the traffic on Interstate 95, she said.
"This way, you can leave your car at home and the captain will do the driving," Mrs. Mirra said. At the Connecticut end, a Foxwoods bus picks travelers up at the dock and deposits them at the casino, then brings them back for the 6:30 p.m. trip back to Long Island.
"You really can't have a better way to travel," said Mark Doherty of Locust Valley, also a first-timer to Foxwoods. "The only problem is, you're kind of stuck to their schedule."
The only paying passenger who did not take the Foxwoods bus was Rudy S. Mackin of Jewett City, Conn., who boarded in New London for a round trip. He said that while he is a regular casino-goer, he was traveling last week to check out connections from Glen Cove to Manhattan for a trip he plans with his wife, Rose Marie.
"We usually drive, so I'm doing some reconnoitering," he said. "On a good day the drive is two hours and 45 minutes, maybe three hours. I would say 25 to 30 percent of the time, though, there's a delay, and that's only going to get worse."
Fox Navigation will run the 249-foot, 318-ton ferry the length of Long Island Sound and back twice each day, departing from the Cross Sound Ferry Terminal in New London at 6:30 a.m. and 6:30 p.m., and from Glen Cove at 9 a.m. and 9 p.m.
On three Fridays in February the ferry made test runs to and from Glen Cove, but Wednesday was the first day with paying passengers, and it went off within minutes of its published schedule, and with no evident glitches. Four stewards served coffee, soft drinks and snacks in the passenger areas. Three deck hands made sure all the mechanical systems were operating smoothly.
A light breeze out of the south and glass-calm water did not even put the advanced stabilizing technology to a test. A set of "wings" can be extended eight feet under the ferry to prevent it from rolling too much in the worst weather.
"Obviously, we're always looking for ways to improve our service, but this is an excellent start," said J. Grant Parker, director of operations for Fox Navigation. Among the improvements planned this month: satellite television that will beam sporting events and other special broadcasts to keep passengers entertained on the 2-hour, 15-minute run. "We want to turn this into an experience, not just a ferry ride," Mr. Parker said.
Up on the bridge, Capt. John F. Falvey Jr. stood with his hand on the joystick that has replaced the ship's wheel, his eyes scanning the computer screens that monitor every system on the ship. Underneath the ship powerful water jets pushed the boat through the Sound at more than 50 miles an hour, so fast the Coast Guard will not allow passengers outside during operation for fear they may be blown overboard.
"This boat is more manageable than just about anything else you're going to see," Mr. Falvey said. "I can stop this boat right now in less than 700 feet, an emergency stop, if we had to. You wouldn't want to do that with passengers on board, but we have done it in sea trials."
There had been some opposition in Glen Cove to the lease that the city gave Fox Navigation, reflecting concerns about the environmental impact, the deterioration of tidal wetlands because of runoff from the parking area, traffic and the impact on marine traffic.
Mayor Thomas R. Suozzi responded that revenues from the lease will go toward cleaning up polluted sites along Glen Cove Creek, and that ferry service is one way of returning the area to productivity.
Mr. Parker said the ferry had environmental advantages as well. Its water jets will pump oxygen into the waters of the Sound; because of pollution the water suffers from low levels of oxygen every summer. And its gas turbines put out about one-fourth the pollution of a comparable diesel engine, and a small fraction of what would be generated if everyone aboard drove their cars back and forth to Foxwoods.
But the North Shore Environmental Alliance has not been appeased: it vowed to pursue a lawsuit against Glen Cove for failure to require an environmental impact statement before allowing the ferry to operate. Dan Maddock, co-president of the alliance, said that under State Supreme Court rules, a judge must decide within 30 days whether to hold a hearing on the case.
Kenneth L. Robinson, an attorney representing the alliance, noted that Fox Navigation had originally proposed landing the ferry elsewhere in Hempstead Harbor, at a site under the jurisdiction of Oyster Bay, but moved to Glen Cove because Oyster Bay was going to require a full-scale environmental study.
"The project should be suspended until the affected communities have an opportunity to review and evaluate the total impact of the operation on area traffic, air and water quality," Mr. Robinson said.
First-day passengers shrugged off those concerns, and said they expected the arrangement would eventually work to the environmental and economic benefit of Glen Cove.
"The property was a dump," said Kathy Lagatta, whose house overlooks the harbor. "They cleaned it all up. The community should be thankful for all they've done here."
Her husband, Neil Lagatta, said the new ferry dock could prove to be a turning point for Glen Cove's waterfront. Foxwoods and its rival casino, the Mohegan Sun, have already paid more than $1 billion to Connecticut under an agreement that allows them to operate slot machines, "and now, you can bet they're going to spread some of that money around here."
The new dock definitely means a shorter trip for Island gamblers. "If traffic is good it takes about three hours," said Carl Vita of Lynbrook. "But the day it snowed, it took me six hours. This ferry landing is only 18 miles from my house. It's a blessing."

HEADLINE: From Far-Off Shores to Long Island

BYLINE: By BARBARA DELATINER 

DATELINE: STONY BROOK

 BODY:
IN the beginning, there were the Native Americans: the Algonquin tribes like the Matinecocks, the Shinnecocks and the Montauks. Then in the 17th century came the English and the Dutch, with their African slaves, in the first of what was to become succeeding waves of immigrants to Long Island.
When, how and why they came, where they settled and what they added to the melting pot is the subject of "New Neighbors: Migrations and the Changing Face of Long Island," an exhibition at the Museums at Stony Brook. Two years in the making, with art, photographs, oral histories, maps and personal artifacts, the show explores the cultural, economic and political effect each group of newcomers has had on the existing populations. 
 By "going back historically to look at the changes on Long Island," said Joshua Ruff, the exhibition's curator, "we can help contemporary Long Islanders understand the roots and the results of that diversity."
This understanding could eliminate some misconceptions, he said. "Most people tend to think that suburbanization dates back to Levittown," Mr. Ruff said, admitting he had believed that when he started the project. "But the growth of new suburban enclaves and villages really started in the mid to late 19th century when the population actually did start to rise, growing very quickly in the World War II period and then after the war and following the Hart-Celler Immigration Act of 1965."
This law, which liberalized the nation's immigration policy, Mr. Ruff said, had a major impact, both in numbers and in the nature of the immigration. It brought people directly to the Island, just as the Italian railroad and sand-mine workers, the Polish, German and Irish farmers and Jewish watchmakers had come in the 19th century, instead of by way of New York City.
The story is told both chronologically, divided into periods before 1880, 1880 to 1940 and more recently, and thematically, dealing with such subjects as "Fears, Stereotypes and Discrimination" and "Searching for the American Dream."
More than 100 items are featured, drawn from the Museums at Stony Brook's vaults or on loan from historical societies and libraries, museums like the museum on Ellis Island and private sources.
For the more contemporary aspects of the story, Mr. Ruff had to rely heavily on families that had kept photos and papers documenting their ancestors' arrival on the Island.
"I suddenly realized that the historical societies and museums, including ours, had very few, if any, modern items," he said. "And we should be collecting things that detail and document new populations arriving. But we've stopped roughly around 1940 and if we don't begin again there will be little around about the 20th and 21st centuries."
There are Native American clay pots from Montauk; a cane dating to 1639 that belonged to Edward Howell of Southampton; an 1824 sampler made by a member of the Elliott family of Sag Harbor; photos, circa 1890, of Italian-Americans at work on the Long Island Rail Road and sandmines in Roslyn; a Ukrainian wedding headpiece used at the turn-of-the-century in Riverhead, and broadsides put out in 1890 by the Long Island Rail Road inviting people to "Buy Homes on Long Island" with the "most healthful . . . climate on the coast."
There are also the medical license, circa 1950, of the Island's first Hispanic physician; deeds excluding blacks, Asians and Jews from buying property; a World War I poster in Yiddish urging Jewish immigrants to save food; photos and news accounts of the first black police sergeant in Babylon who settled in Amityville in 1950 after unsuccessfully trying to buy a house in Levittown; an ornate Indian baby cradle belonging to a family in Kings Park, and an oral history account of a political refugee's escape from El Salvador to Brentwood in 1981.
Among the more unusual items is a late 17th-century Dutch print labeled "Nieu Amsterdam," said Mr. Ruff, 27, who lives in Kings Park. "I found it at the New York Public Library, but I also found the same exact print labeled 'the West Indies.' I guess, the Dutch looked at both colonies the same way."
One of the more fascinating stories he came across, Mr. Ruff said, dealt with a village in Suffolk that a developer, Thomas Wellwood, founded in the 1870's. "He called it 'Breslau' in an attempt to attract the Germans who like the Irish farmers of the day were beginning to settle in the area. The name was changed to Lindenhurst in 1892, not, as legend has it, because the residents wanted to escape their German heritage, but because they had become disenchanted with the developer and wanted to break away from him completely."
Mr. Ruff had only one regret: "that I couldn't include more in the show, but I'm very limited in terms of space."
"Although," he said, "I guess I would have liked to have gotten A. L. Henry's painting, 'The Last of the Montauks' from an upstate museum. With others moving in, the Island's Native Americans became more and more invisible."
The exhibition features an interactive world map. "We're asking visitors to sign the book to tell us where their ancestors came from," Mr. Ruff said. "And then every week we'll update the map, adding pins for new places and new totals."
Eventually, Mr. Ruff said, he hopes the exhibition will help "start a dialogue as people, looking more historically at the phenomenon of migration, realize that it's a continuous process with ongoing phases. There are similarities in the way people respond to newcomers throughout these migrations. Furthermore, these changes taking place on the Island are clearly happening in other places as well."
"New Neighbors: Migrations and the Changing Face of Long Island" runs through July 4 at the History Museum of the Museums of Stony Brook on Route 25A. It can be seen from 10 a.m. to 5 Wednesdays through Saturdays and noon to 5 p.m. Sundays, and will be accompanied by special programming like "Merengue!," a concert by Luis Cordero and Los Amigos de la Amarque of dance music with roots in African and Spanish music, at 2 p.m. next Sunday. (631) 751-0066.

HEADLINE: Foxwoods Reaches Out to Long Island

"I've been waiting for this since they first started talking about it almost two years ago," said Nicholas F. Distasio of Oceanside. "I go to Foxwoods once in a while, and now I can see myself making more trips."
The Mashantucket Pequot tribe built two high-speed ferries, the Tatobam and the Sassacus, before it shut down its New London shipyard. It envisions a network of ferry routes that would serve much of the Northeast. Some of the lines bring patrons to its casino -- besides the Glen Cove trips, it operates a route from New London to Martha's Vineyard during the summer. It has also operated a route between New Jersey and Martha's Vineyard, and the tribe has said it is interested in eventually linking Boston, Cape Cod, and possibly Newport, R.I.
Inez S. Mirra of Old Westbury called in sick to her office to make the Wednesday's trip to Foxwoods, her first to the casino; one reason she has not visited is her refusal to face traffic on Interstate 95, she said.

"The project should be suspended until the affected communities have an opportunity to review and evaluate the total impact of the operation on area traffic, air and water quality," Mr. Robinson said.
In Connecticut, the ferry is operating out of an area where boats already serve Block Island, R.I., as well as Orient Point and Fishers Island in New York, so there has been no outcry about the environment. First-day passengers shrugged off those concerns and said they expected the arrangement would eventually work to the environmental and economic benefit of Glen Cove.

HEADLINE: In the World of Starter Mansions, More Is More

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
WHAT are high-tech, high-intensity home buyers looking for in their new haciendas?
They are looking for houses that are bigger than ever; bigger than their parents' homes, bigger than their classmates', bigger than their colleagues', bigger than their friends' -- and more impressive, too, architects and real estate agents agree. According to the National Association of Homebuilders, the average American house is growing in size: to 2,225 square feet last year from 1,710 square feet in the early 80's. 
 But that is just the national average. In the new subdivisions of Westchester and Fairfield Counties -- along with the Hamptons and Aspen and other spots populated by the Nasdaq nouveau riche -- a house is not a house unless it is at least a minimansion, with 3,000 square feet as only the first notch on the architect's ruler.
"I've done them 3,000, 4,000, 8,000 square feet," said Joesph R. Crocco, a prolific architect based in Tuckahoe. Most recently, Mr. Crocco finished Whippoorwill Ridge in Armonk -- where houses start around $650,000, he said -- and he is working on more megahouses in Bedford, Pound Ridge and Armonk.
Judging from a selection of some of the newly constructed houses in Armonk subdivisions, the developers are also looking for variety: there is the chateau-esque, the baronial, the Abode of the Sea Captain, the shingle style gone post-modern and the House of the Seven Gables, among others.
"It's hard to make fun of these houses, seeing that my wife would kill to live in any one of them," said Alex Herrera, an architect who works at the New York Landmarks Conservancy and, among other things, advises developers on new construction appropriate to historic areas. Nevertheless, Mr. Herrera said the problem with the designs of many of these monster houses often stems from the proportions.
"In the old days, builders tended to be guided by pattern books," he said. "Now they're guided by product catalog: they pick out the fanciest windows by Pella, the fanciest doors from Marvin, the fanciest columns from that fancy column place and the fanciest garage doors from the fancy garage door place, so the parts go together in no particular order."
He pointed to a photograph of a house with seven gables ("And that's only on one side!" he said) in the Whippoorwill Hills subdivision, where houses sell for more than $500,000.
"Look at the tiny windows at the top of the garage door," he said. "They are out of proportion to the windows. And where's the front door? It's lost among the gables."
Inside, critics say, some of the houses have another problem: their layouts.
"These bigger houses are easier to design, because bigger houses are better armatures for the features the buyers know they want," said Duo Dickinson, the Connecticut architect who is the author of "Small Houses for the Next Century" (McGraw-Hill) and four other books.
If the outside of the house is suitably impressive, prospective buyers then seek to check off an ever-expanding laundry list of amenities (including, of course, a laundry.)
"It's gotta have a three-car garage with an eight-foot door for the S.U.V.," said Mr. Dickinson, who sheepishly admitted to having designed a handful of these pricy behemoths.
"It's gotta have his and her closets and his and her bathrooms, and a fireplace in the master suite and a separate study off the master suite and a den and his and her offices and a reading room and a media room and . . . " He paused to catch his breath. "I went through a spec house in Greenwich last week and it was mind numbing, all these rooms."
And the rooms do not always work the way they do in the older houses. Like Mr. Herrera's description of the exteriors as an amalgam of different parts, so, too, Mr. Dickinson said, is the inside.
"The house isn't designed," he said. "It's just rooms combined."
Mr. Crocco, the architect who has designed several projects for Michael Fareri, the prosperous Armonk developer, almost echoed Mr. Dickinson's list of rooms -- for people and automobiles.
"The developers have a lot of requirements," he said. "I get a lot of requests for three-car garages, large family rooms, elaborate kitchens, master bedroom suites with his and her bathrooms and media rooms."
In Mount Kisco, Russ Davidson, last year's president of the the county's American Institute of Architects chapter and this year's spokesman, said the architectural merit of new houses in Westchester County varies dramatically.
"Some," he said, "are very low-quality, cookie-cutter plans that have just been scaled up, and they show it. Others have been carefully worked out."
But in the end, he said he "can't understand why people pay $750,000 and more for a house that isn't as well designed as their Jaguar or their Armani suit."
Mr. Davidson admits he is prejudiced: he is an advocate of the individually custom-designed, client-commissioned dwelling, which he argues often costs less than the builder's spec model, no matter how magnificent.
Nevertheless, he conceded that people might actually like these off-the-rack, amenity-laden minimansions on a grass-coated suburban plot.
"There are a lot of people who don't take risks," he said, carefully, "people who don't want to wait a year to see how it turns out."
But there is a delicate balance between designing a house to make the house as impressive as possible and keeping it from looking, uh, eccentric.
In fact, some say the less stylish, the better.
Michael Carliner, an economist for the National Association of Homebuilders, said that his research shows that the more nondescript a new house is, the better it sells.
"Like Realtors tell you: paint the walls white," he said, "and keep it unoffensive -- and definitely stay away from the unique. These houses may be less imaginative, but they're certainly more marketable."
For Mr. Crocco, the architect for Whippoorwill Ridge in Armonk, it all depends on what the developer asks for in the design of his speculative mansionettes.
"Different developers have different ideas and different expectations," he said. "Some want top quality -- and some want it down and dirty.
"I've done it all," the architect said.

HEADLINE: Well-Kept Secret? Armonk Becomes Builder's Paradise

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS 

DATELINE: ARMONK

 BODY:
MICHAEL E. FARERI pilots his silver Mercedes, with his name on the license plate, along the winding, wooded roads of this Westchester hamlet, pointing to swaths of property he used to own, currently owns or plans to own any day now.
Mr. Fareri is the developer du jour in this booming community, part of the town of North Castle, where hillsides and wetlands have given way to vast tracts of starter castles, home to Wall Street's bonus babies, who can pay cash for multimillion-dollar houses. 
 Mr. Fareri waves to everyone he passes, friends and foes alike, knowing that for every person here dazzled by his accomplishments there are many more who consider him the enemy, the defiler of what used to be. But he could not care less.
"Most people think I'm trying to rape this place," he said. "But if you want to be in the wilderness, go to Vermont. How can anybody say it's too much? As fast as I build them, they get snapped up. The world should run by the law of supply and demand."
The real estate explosion in Armonk, 30 miles from midtown Manhattan, has produced a typical small town tableau, comedy or tragedy depending on one's point of view. It offers plenty of conflict between old-timers and newcomers, developers and preservationsists, citizens and their leaders and neighbors fighting for their views. It has several stock characters, larger than life and full of bombast; a predictable subtext about history versus progress and a chorus of "Not In My Backyard" coming from all sides.
Let's start with the antagonists:
The nouveau riche builder with a midwinter tan, cufflinks like Krugerrands and a fleet of cars, lawyers and servants to fill his every need. The blue-blood former chairman of the Town Planning Board, who relished the power of a big fish in a small pond.
The new homeowners, some with more money than they know what to do with and others so real-estate-poor that their mansions have indoor swimming pools but no furniture. And the old-timers, who fear that the water wheels, grist mills and Revolutionary-era barns where they played as children will be destroyed and forgotten.
Mr. Fareri, the flashiest of the bunch, stands at center stage.
On a whirlwind tour of his real estate holdings, the 53-year-old builder points to grand houses, one after another, that he built for himself and later sold at 250 percent profit. He points to residential developments, from $200,000 condominiums in a renovated schoolhouse to small clusters of half-million-dollar town houses in a gated community, to tracts of nearly identical million-dollar McMansions, each an arm's length apart.
He drives by a Victorian-style office and retail complex on Main Street that he recently developed. Then the shell of a brick garage on Old Route 22 that he plans to turn into a diner, with a gas station theme. Next a desolate tract he has owned for years, home to an abandoned bowling alley, where he dreams of a sprawling supermarket, the kind with a coffee bar, sushi chef and gourmet takeout. And then there is a nursery, currently for sale, where he would like to set up a business for his daughter, a 25-year-old landscape architect.
"If I see a "For Sale" sign, I buy it," Mr. Fareri said. "Armonk was a well-kept secret. Now it has taken off. And it's only going to get better."
Besides Mr. Fareri, the man most responsible for Armonk's remarkable residential growth is Piers L. Curry, the recently retired head of the Planning Board. When he took up his appointed post a dozen years ago, Armonk was already blessed with the strong tax base that comes from commercial and industrial giants like International Business Machines, Swiss Re and Travelers. So, low property taxes were a draw in the subdivisions that have been built under Mr. Curry's watch, which some say have turned Armonk into a rich man's Levittown.
"Nobody was paying any attention" to Armonk for decades, Mr. Curry said. It was bypassed by the Metro-North, which has its nearest station in North White Plains 10 miles away, and had no highway access until Interstate 684 was built in the late 1960's, said to be a concession to I.B.M. Then the developers took notice, buying up estates and farms, only to be stymied by a stalled economy, high interest rates and widespread unemployment.
All that changed in the flush 1990's, when Wall Street money and pent-up demand turned Armonk into a builder's paradise. The first to capitalize on the change was Mr. Fareri, once an electrician in Yonkers, who had been buying land here for 25 years.
Since Mr. Fareri started building, others have joined him. Five major estate developments are in the works on Route 128, between here and Mount Kisco. Plus two on the hillside overlooking the Kensico Reservoir and other small subdivisions tucked here and there on older residential properties where excess land, fetching $300,000 an acre, has been sold.
Combined, Mr. Curry said, this recent building surge will add 391 new homes practically overnight to a community that had 957 houses in 1990 and a mere 257 20 years before. That growth rate -- to 1,348 from 257 units in 1970 -- is huge, said John Nolon, director of the Land Use Law Center at Pace University, attributable to open land in a neglected pocket and nearly a decade of unbroken prosperity.
This pace of development, needless to say, has spurred furious controversy. There is conflict between newcomers, who ride limousines to their jobs in the city and have no time to serve on town boards or as volunteer firefighters, and old-timers, who yearn for the secret wooded places where they played as children, now paved and off limits behind electric gates or deer netting.
"In a perfect world, three of us would own the whole place and nobody else would live here," said Mr. Curry, who recently sold his old farmhouse here and now divides his time between a vacation home in Rhode Island and an apartment, meant for a caretaker, in historic Smith's Tavern. "We'd all have 10-square-mile estates. But we don't and we can't. We have to play the hand we're dealt. I'd love to see gracious homes, less density. But it wasn't my call. The zoning existed. I saw it as my job to make the best of it."
Mr. Curry, who concedes he is no diplomat, has nearly as many detractors here as Mr. Fareri. Many residents say he conducted too much of the town's business in private, and he admits that many meetings about development took place "off line," without his fellow commissioners or the public present, in the interest of efficiency.
Mr. Curry argues that he had no leverage to stop development or influence its aesthetics, so long as builders were not asking for property to be re-zoned. Other communities slow the approval process to a crawl, he said, in the hope that a builder will give up and go elsewhere. But instead, Mr. Curry said, the builder often sues, or loses so much money during the delay that he puts up a shoddy product.
John A. Lombardi, town supervisor for 40 years, said efforts were made to slow the residential development by upzoning, so that many houses must now sit on two- to four-acre lots, and also by encouraging builders to put up fewer units than the law allows, say 25 homes on 80 acres when 40 would be legal. The culprit in the development boom, as Mr. Lombardi sees it, is neither the aggressive developers nor the lenient planning board, but the descendants of the original landowners.
"The people who sold the property caused the problem," he said. "The kids, the first thing they do when the old folks die is go to a lawyer" and put the land on the market.
The growth, Mr. Lombardi said, has strained Armonk's infrastructure -- its stores, roads and parking areas. The downtown, a mere block and a half, is choked with traffic and double-parked sport utility vehicles; the modest Food Emporium is no longer sufficient.
"We'd like to catch up," Mr. Lombardi said. "It's going to take some bold moves, but it has to happen. The only questions are how much, where and when."
One of the quaint local landmarks, Schultz's Cider Mill, is on the market, with a prospective developer who wants to use the land for a supermarket, which would require rezoning. Another promising site, owned by Mr. Ferari, is far enough from downtown to disperse traffic, but it also requires rezoning. It is here that Mr. Fareri will build a supermarket if he can, with a health club as his fallback since it is permitted under current zoning.
As Mr. Fareri has grown in influence, some townspeople have concluded that the government bends over backward to advance his projects, a charge town officials reject. Mr. Lombardi tiptoes around a question about which supermarket proposal he favors. To answer, he said, is to risk offending the people who have elected him to 20 terms or to invite litigation against both the town and himself. He only observed that Mr. Ferari's parcel is much larger -- 16 acres compared with 6 at the cider mill -- with room for a bigger store and more parking.
Future town meetings, regarding the requests for rezoning, are sure to be a cacaphony of opposing interests.
Environmentalists fear that improved roads or new stores in the buffer zone around the Kensico Reservoir will endanger the water supply. Urban planners and town officials, citing the goals of a 1996 comprehensive plan, are determined to provide additional parking and more places to shop.
Newcomers in the hillside developments, who have already blocked one attempt to build a supermarket or shopping center on the Fareri site, are adamant that they do not want commerce so close to their homes. But long-standing residents are just as dug in. Their vistas of rushing streams and blue herons have already been marred by the sight of backhoes and newly framed condos. How dare the very people who bought those houses say no to stores and parking lots that the hamlet needs?
"The town let them just cover the hillsides with matching houses, throw up gates and then keep everybody else from having a decent grocery store," said the Rev. Jack Miller, a Presbyterian minister. Mr. Miller lives here in a tiny Frank Lloyd Wright house that abuts a gated community built by Mr. Fareri and another subdivision, under construction, which Mr. Fareri sold to Toll Brothers, one of the nation's leading home builders.
Bernard Magdelain, a banker at Chaseand president of the Homeowners' Association at Whipporwill Ridge, a Fareri subdivision visible from Mr. Miller's home, commiserates with those who find houses like his own eyesores and even shares their feeling that the Town Board has let developers run amok.
But Mr. Magdelain and the homeowners he represents are four-square against a new supermarket on either of the sites visible from Whipporwill Ridge. They do not want the daytime traffic, the nighttime noise of trucks unloading or the Dumpsters and other mess and are quite content to travel beyond their borders to shop, some of them going to Greenwich, Conn.
"The town is being . . . I'm not going to use the word manipulated, but reactive to developers who come in with ideas," Mr. Magdelain said.
"Why don't they do site surveys and determine where is the best place and how big should it be? Why don't they show us the traffic studies, the environmental studies? There should be a long-term game plan here. Why do we only hear about things in whispers at cocktail parties?"
Mr. Magdelain sounds much like Mr. Miller, who asked the same questions about the planning process in regard to the new subdivisions. And there is a further ironic echo when he disdains the aesthetics of the subdivision that abuts his own, called Whipporwill Hills.
Mr. Magdelain said he sought a bucolic setting when he moved here and thus chose a site at the edge of a nature preserve -- and as far as he could get from Whipporwill Hills, which lacks some of the architectural details of Whipporwill Ridge.
His subdivision, Mr. Magdelain observed, is landscaped with good-size hardwood trees and fast-growing white pines that will eventually curtain each house from the others. Next door, he said, the developer must have "used Agent Orange" to clear the land. "I call it Jurassic Park," Mr. Magdelain said.
The land around both Whipporwill subdivisions is in the buffer zone near the watershed or wetlands protected by Federal environmental law. But these lands are under no legal protection, said Eric A. Goldstein, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council who has written a report on the risks to the Kensico Reservoir, the strategic choke point for 90 percent of the drinking water headed to New York City and lower Westchester. The situation "illustrates the weakness and short-sightedness of the existing laws," he said, adding that Armonk is Exhibit A for preservationists, since it has some of the last remaining parcels of open land in Westchester County and plans to develop retail projects and improve roads near sensitive sites.
"This is the most controversial development activity in the region," he said. "You can expect a raging battle there in the next six months."
Walt Bell will be watching it unfold.
Mr. Bell, a retired laborer in the warehouse at Reader's Digest, has lived in Armonk since 1928. He remembers when the I.B.M. campus was Wenga Farm, where he picked apples, milked cows and baled hay. He is trying to persuade the developers along Route 128 to preserve the ponds, grist mills and rock formations that once defined the landscape.
Mr. Bell admires the architectural detail and landscaping of Mr. Fareri's properties, compared with other subdivisions. But that does not blunt the loss he feels each time a childhood haunt is paved over. This he pours into poetry, including one poem that ends with this verse:
"The greed of man is what it be.
He sold our land of liberty.
And now our land is not so free.
So fear what is ahead of thee."

HEADLINE: EDWARD J. LOGUE;
Shared Leadership

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Herbert Muschamp's appreciation of Edward J. Logue "From an Era When Equality Mattered," Feb. 20 fails to get at some fundamental differences between the way urban reinvestment policy was conducted in Mr. Logue's heyday and the approach that cities have to pursue now in order to "reconfigure themselves in the era of mass suburban exodus." 
 The key issue is not the "collapse" of planning but the need for cities to manage a transition from traditional master planning to contemporary strategic planning in order to make inner-city revitalization efforts succeed in today's environment.
Urban renewal-era master planning in New York and other big cities was managed by the local development "czar," who was widely recognized as the center of policymaking and implementation. The photo accompanying Mr. Muschamp's essay, a shirt-sleeved Mr. Logue standing in the rubble of a soon-to-be-redeveloped site, is the perfect image of this traditional centralized leadership. In contrast, strategic planning for present-day reinvestment depends on a sharing of leadership responsibilities by government and community interests.
The most visible master-planned projects of Mr. Logue's era relied on large-scale demolition -- often accompanied by the displacement of families and businesses -- followed by new construction on cleared sites. Today's best strategic planning minimizes displacement and generates well-designed new construction combined with the rehabilitation of valued existing structures to preserve the traditional community fabric. Government-subsidized housing financed through the federal Low Income Housing Tax Credit and HOPE VI programs within the past decade in New York and elsewhere provide great present-day illustrations of the positive qualities Mr. Muschamp praises in Roosevelt Island's Southtown.
Mr. Logue and other city-rebuilders had access to lots of government money to support the realization of their plans. Like Philadelphia's Edmund Bacon, Mr. Logue showed that good design and a substantial investment of public funds could produce lasting benefits for targeted downtown and neighborhood development sites. Today's strategic planners confront a much more difficult problem: how to succeed in an environment of greatly reduced public fund-ing, through smaller, incremental implementation approaches which, though more limited in scale, produce tangible benefits for urban communities.
Planning for urban reinvestment in an era of constrained authority and limited resources is a challenge which, though formidable, can be mastered. When leaders in government, community organizations, and the planning-design professions collaborate effectively in the service of today's inner-city communities, they do far more to advance the ideals of equality and democracy cited by Mr. Muschamp than Ed Logue and other master planners were capable of achieving in their day.

After Agency's Reversal, A Tenant Faces Eviction

BYLINE: By TRISH HALL 

 BODY:
ANNE GILMAN, an artist and teacher whose works on paper are quietly riveting, moved into her two-bedroom apartment on West 110th Street 10 years ago with her husband at the time and their daughter, who was then 7 years old. It is in a well-maintained building with polished marble floors and friendly doormen, in a neighborhood more homey than chic.
Shortly thereafter, she became convinced that her landlord, Marsid Realty, was overcharging for the rent-stabilized apartment, so in 1990 she filed a rent appeal with the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, an agency that oversees rent regulation. For four years, she heard nothing, but the silence didn't really matter, because she and her husband, who had met as teenagers in Queens, could afford the $2,095-a-month rent. 
 However, when they decided to break up after 20 years of marriage, and she still hadn't received an answer, she filed a request for a resolution of the case, called an Article 78. If the rent was going to remain, neither she nor her husband could afford it alone. She began looking for a smaller, cheaper place, and found one across the street and down the block.
"It had no doorman, and the fire escape led right into the apartment, which scared my daughter," she said. Still, it seemed she had to move, and it had two bedrooms. But just as she was about to sign the lease, she got a letter from the state agency telling her that her rent had been too high and that it would be essentially cut in half. So she decided to stay. The landlord was also assessed treble damages of $50,000.
Since then, she has paid the amount established as her new legal rent and specified in her lease, $1,011.12 at the time, and later, adjusted upward by the legally allowable increases. So when she received a letter two months ago saying that the rent decision had been reversed on appeal six years after the first ruling, and that she would now have to pay $2,223 a month, she was in shock.
But that was hardly the worst of it. The state told her that she also had to pay her landlord back rent, estimated at more than $47,000. And it nullified the treble damages, which the landlord had not been required to pay while the case was on appeal.
AND so, instead of planning the surprise party she had hoped to give for her father's 80th birthday in April, maybe making the salmon with cilantro and tomatoes she had prepared for her parents' 50th wedding anniversary, she is now wondering whether she will be evicted before that, and if she is, where she can go.
Her family now includes not only her daughter, Lisa Gilman-Rosen, a junior at Stuyvesant High School, but also her husband of 11 months, a writer and translator, and his two daughters, one at Hunter College High School and one living away from home at college. She declined to give her husband's name, saying she did not want potential landlords to know they were married.
The case, she said, has tainted her, making her appear as a bad tenant, when in fact she has lived as a careful person, never taking the big risks or rash steps that put people in debt.
"You could call the credit bureaus today," she said. "I pay off my credit cards. I always have a zero balance. I find this humiliating."
She and her new husband spend a lot of time at home; they cook, they play Scrabble on their bed -- which is in the dining room so their daughters can have the bedrooms. They live carefully and quietly, and yet, she said: "I feel inept. I feel like I've done something wrong to get us in this position, and I've never lived that way. I've never lived on the edge."
Under the agency's ruling, she was supposed to begin paying the new rent of $2,223 in January, plus $1,900 a month toward her back-rent debt. She said she cannot pay that much and continues to pay her old rent. The landlord has gone to court to evict her, and to collect the back rent.
Hoping to get help, she has applied to an arts organization for an emergency grant. "They say they help with catastrophic events," said Ms. Gilman, who teaches at Pratt Institute and at Purchase College, State University of New York. She exhibits her work four or five times a year, and she recently had a piece bought by the Brooklyn Museum of Art.
The possibility of being evicted, and of having to declare personal bankruptcy, has left her distraught. Sitting at her dining room table, serving but not eating mandel bread and herb tea, she said she finds the situation unbearable and mystifying. "I had no evidence at that time that the ruling was something I should doubt," she said. "I have leases. Nowhere does it say this is a provisional rent."
After receiving the latest ruling, she filed appeals of the state decision and the eviction action through her newly hired lawyer, Robert Levy, who has handled many tenant-landlord cases. "I've been doing this for 30 years, and I've never seen anything like this," Mr. Levy said.
When Ms. Gilman filed her fair market rent appeal, she was challenging the rent under provisions that guide landlords in setting new rents when apartments move from rent control to rent stabilization.
Generally speaking, the rent-control laws apply to apartments that have been occupied by the same tenant since July 1, 1971, and are in buildings of three or more units built before Feb. 1, 1947. When such tenants vacate an apartment, its rent is generally regulated by the rent stabilization laws.
The previous tenant in Ms. Gilman's apartment had paid $605 a month; the landlord then raised the rent to $2,000. Under the law, the landlord can show rents for comparable apartments to justify the establishment of the initial rent under stabilization laws.
In the four years before the first ruling, Mr. Levy said, the landlord presented no comparables. The decision was reversed last year, Mr. Levy said, because the agency decided that a legislative change in 1997 allowed the landlord to submit comparables that would buttress his case, even though new evidence is typically not allowed in an appeal unless it was unavailable the first time around.
Because the landlord in his appeal submitted evidence that pertained to rental leases signed around 1990, it should have been previously available to him, Mr. Levy said.
"The feature that's so upsetting is that they changed the rules in midstream," he said. "They bent them beyond recognition." Ms. Gilman, he said, was right to assume that even if her landlord prevailed in an appeal, any rent change would be minor.
THERE was no reason, he said, for her to believe that the agency could fully reverse itself. "It's really a Kafkaesque situation," he said. "You wake up one morning and you owe your landlord nearly $50,000."
Bill Harra, a vice president of ABC Realty and the managing agent for the building on West 110th Street, said the landlord had at one point voluntarily lowered Ms. Gilman's rent somewhat when she and her first husband were having financial difficulties. The landlord did not even get notice of the first challenge to the rent, Mr. Harra said, until several years after it was filed.
"The D.H.C.R. apparently lost the papers for two years," he said. Because of that, he said, the landlord did not have time to gather the comparables that his case required. When the landlord was told that the rent was being rolled back -- and that he was being assessed the $50,000 in treble damages -- he appealed, and during that process, the overcharge he owed Ms. Gilman was frozen.
He has now taken her to court to get the back rent and to evict her, Mr. Harra said, because she is still paying the old rent. "She chose not to pay the new legal rent," he said, "and the landlord said, 'I gotta take you to court.' "
Debbie Del Pino, a spokeswoman for the Division of Housing and Community Renewal, said it would not comment on its procedures in the case, or the time it took to issue rulings, because it cannot talk about cases that are pending or on appeal.
Meanwhile, Ms. Gilman is wondering where she will go if her appeal is unsuccessful, or even worse, if she is evicted before a ruling on the appeal is issued. Most important to her is a safe place, in part because she still remembers the terror of being assaulted at knifepoint as a teenager in Queens. To her, a good neighborhood is not fancy, but "lively, well lit and well trafficked."
But she has talked to some real estate agents and says she is gloomy about her prospects. "There's no place to move to that is comparable," she said. "We're not lawyers. We're not doctors. How do normal people pay the rent?"

Along Rt. 1 Near Princeton, the Market Is Booming

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
THE office market along the Princeton Route 1 corridor is on a roll: over the last year 800,000 square feet of space in six mostly speculative buildings became available, and all but 100,000 square feet has been leased.
Now the market is entering a second round of building. Work is under way or will soon begin on projects totaling 507,000 square feet. And thousands more square feet are planned, including research and development space, along the 20-mile corridor between New Brunswick and Trenton. 
 Developers say they are trying to capitalize on the state's strong economy and job growth, which continue to stoke tenants' need for space and their desire to be in this central location close to Princeton University.
Commercial brokers said they were initially concerned about overbuilding when so much space came onto the market in 1999. The Princeton corridor's 800,000 square feet of new office space was the second-highest production level last year -- after the Jersey City waterfront, with 1.1 million square feet -- in New Jersey's 11 central and northern counties. But that situation did not materialize, and "demand remains strong" said J. Douglas Petrozzini, a senior vice president in the Edison office of Grubb & Ellis, the national commercial brokerage company. The market should be able to handle the additional space, he added.
Most of the demand is from present tenants who are expanding along with a few companies relocating from North Jersey and Manhattan, said Jonathan Miesel, anassociate director of the East Rutherford office of Cushman & Wakefield. "If businesses continue to grow at a rate of 5 percent a year, that will generate a demand for 500,000 square feet of space," he said.
At the end of 1999, Mr. Miesel's firm reported that the Princeton market had a vacancy rate for prime space of 12.4 percent, up from 9.8 percent the year before. But Mr. Miesel said that the rate was skewed by the availability of a 400,000-square-foot building in South Brunswick. It was built about two years ago for a Dow Jones subsidiary that was later sold. If that building is omitted, the vacancy rate for prime space "hovers around 4 percent," he said.
Meanwhile, the average asking prices for prime space rose to $29.13 from $28.85 per square foot. For all other space, they remained stable at $22.87 per square foot, according to Cushman & Wakefield.
These factors, developers said, gave them the confidence to move ahead. "There is a dearth of new product in the pipeline, and there are still plenty of tenants in the market," said Walter F. Thomas, Northeast regional manager for the Patrinely Group, a Houston development company with offices in Princeton. Patrinely is making its initial foray into New Jersey and the Princeton corridor in particular.
LAST March, Patrinely contracted to buy, in pieces, 98 acres from Princeton University to build a large office complex, up to 1.2 million square feet, as part of the larger 2,200-acre Princeton Forrestal Center, which straddles South Brunswick and Plainsboro Townships. The first building there was started on speculation last September, and 108,000 of its 154,000 square feet has been leased, Mr. Thomas said.
A second building with 70,000 square feet is planned. Both will occupy 24 acres on the west side of Route 1. The remaining 1 million square feet of space planned for the complex will rise on 74 acres on the east side of the highway.
Explaining the deal, David Knights, the director of marketing for Princeton Forrestal Center, noted a continuing demand for space: 6.1 million square feet of office, retail and hotel space has been completed or is under way there, and the occupancy rate is 98 percent. Eventually, the center's site is zoned for a total of 9.2 million square feet.
Mr. Knights said a 168,000-square-foot building at 650 College Road East that was started last August is now 94 percent leased. That building is being developed by a partnership of the Aegis Property Group and the Berwind Property Group, both of Philadelphia, on 12 acres bought from the university. The partnership is planning another building with 100,000 square feet on 13 adjacent acres, he said.
The office complex the Patrinely Group is developing, Mr. Knights said, "opens up a new section of Forrestal Center on the east side of Route 1."
The complex, Princeton Corporate Campus @ Forrestal is, as its name implies, being designed to attract the growing number of technology companies, but not to the exclusion of mainstay companies in the pharmaceutical and financial-services sectors, said Mr. Thomas of the Patrinely Group.
The leases signed at Patrinely's three-story, 154,000-square-foot building are to two growing companies already renting space in Princeton corridor. Nova Nordisk, a Danish company that manufactures insulin and related devices, took 80,000 square feet for its North American headquarters, and ZS Associates, a global pharmaceutical consulting firm, leased 28,000 square feet for its regional office. Rents are $30 to $31 a square foot, with the tenants paying for their own electricity.
Since that building is 70 percent leased, Mr. Thomas said Patrinely would begin construction on the second 70,000-square-foot building by July. Then, he said, his company will follow the same formula to develop speculative buildings on the east side of Route 1, where there are also opportunities for build-to-suit projects for specific tenants. Up to seven buildings, each with at least 150,000 square feet, could be built on that side of the highway, he said, adding, "There is enough of a critical mass in the corridor now to feed on itself."
AT Carnegie Center, the 450-acre office campus in West Windsor, a 65,000-square-foot building is also rising. There, about half of an eventual four million square feet has been built. "With our existing tenant base, we're building to meet their growth needs," said John Brandbergh, the director of marketing and leasing for Boston Properties, a real estate investment trust that acquired the center in 1998. Once the new building is leased, "we'll take a wait-and-see attitude," he said, on whether to start a speculative building that could contain as much as 140,000 square feet.
And with leasing winding down at 600 Alexander Park, a 140,000-square-foot building, also in West Windsor, the Trammell Crow Company will start construction in the next few months on a second speculative building of 70,000 square feet, said Aubrey Haines, a vice president of Trammel Crow. It is developing both buildings for the Multi-Employer Property Trust, a pension fund. Rents are $29.50 a square foot, with tenants paying electricity. "In a tight labor market companies are using quality office space to attract employees," Mr. Haines said.
One developer also sees this as the right time to add research and development space to the market, along with offices. "The demand for quality one-story R & D buildings is the highest it has been in years, and the supply doesn't even come close to filling it," said Vincent Marano, the chief operating officer of National Business Parks, the managing arm of the partnership that owns College Park. That 11-building campus in Plainsboro, part of Forrestal Center, has 814,000 square feet of fully leased space, half of it for research and development.
A partnership of Pocantico Associates and Zirinsky Associates, both of Manhattan, is under contract to buy 31 adjacent acres straddling South Brunswick and Plainsboro Townships, but outside of Forrestal Center, to build a 320,000-square-foot office and R & D complex called Princeton Business Park. The project, which must gain approvals from both townships, will have a maximum of five buildings constructed on a build-to-suit basis.
"It's a natural progression of College Park," Mr. Marano said. "We're striving to meet the needs of high-tech and biotech companies. It's a niche we see as the future" He said the partners would start on the 17.4 acres in South Brunswick, which are zoned for the 200,000 square feet of office and research space his firm wants to build. Approvals could be secured by July, he said, adding that negotiations are under way with a tenant, whom he would not name, for a 92,500-square-foot building. Rents are to be in the range of $25 -to $27 a square foot, he said.
Once that site is completed, Mr. Marano said the partners would turn to the 13.6 acres in Plainsboro. In the interim, the partners would seek the rezoning and approvals needed for the site, which could accommodate buildings totaling 120,000 square feet. The entire project is projected to take three to five years to build.

HEADLINE: Warm-Weather Retreats;
Summer Rentals Are Going, Going . . .

BYLINE: By NADINE BROZAN 

 BODY:
I WISH you had called me two weeks ago, because the rentals are just zapping up," Kelly Lee, an agent with B & K Real Estate in Bay Head, N.J., said regretfully to a caller one day in early February.
"But I thought we were too early to call," the astonished woman responded. In fact, though the snow was still on the ground and the breeze off the ocean was chilly, the woman was anything but early in her quest to rent a house in the picturesque Jersey shore village. 
 "For the right house in the right areas, we probably have six or seven people waiting," Benia Grygent, an agent with B & K, said as she drove around town showing houses. "We start in the fall, so that by now 80 percent of the available properties are gone."
Indeed, if the number of leases already signed and the swarms of prospective tenants looking over houses, mansions, cottages or condos everywhere from Nantucket to Connecticut to the Pocono Mountains of northeastern Pennsylvania are indicative, it will be a banner season for the rental market -- and a profitable one for owners. Prices in these areas have risen from 5 to 25 percent in the last year, brokers say; in the Hamptons they have escalated by at least 20 percent.
In Fire Island Pines, a community with some of Fire Island's more lavish homes and many swimming pools, "99 percent of the seasonal rentals for this summer were spoken for by Columbus Day, and now we are getting inquiries about shorter rentals," said Carole Weissman, an owner of Island Properties Real Estate and Management Corporation.
In the Poconos, Rob Baxter, a broker and owner of C. R. Baxter Rentals Unlimited, said: "People who know the community often started looking last summer. It seems like the market is up over last year, and we have run out of homes in certain categories."
Rentals for the properties that Mr. Baxter represents generally run from $500 to $3,000 a week, depending on size, amenities and their proximity to a lake. Most of his rental houses are in two lakeside communities, Arrowhead Lakes and Lake Naomi, and he also has town houses, two-story homes attached in groups of three or four, bordering a lake in Pinecrest.
In Nantucket, Mass., "the market is out of control," said Joyce Montalbano, a sales associate with Congdon and Coleman Real Estate. Rentals listed by her agency range from $1,000 a week for a one-bedroom cottage in town to $17,500 a week for a six-bedroom house in Brant Point that is coveted for its easy access to both beach and town.
And in Martha's Vineyard, Ann Floyd, the owner and principal broker of Sandcastle Realty, said: "The demand is still extraordinary despite the fact that some people say we have priced ourselves out of consideration. We got inquiries starting last summer and now we are wondering what are we going to do about the inquiries for the year 2001."
This year, rents go from $1,000 a week for a rustic workshop on a farm to $15,000 for a house that is on a saltwater lagoon, sleeps 10 and has a private beach and dock.
But nowhere is panic over renting more palpable than in the Hamptons. "You show people a rental for $50,000 and they say, "Bring my check to the landlord immediately so I am sure will have a house,' " said Judi Desiderio, the vice president of Cook Pony Farm Real Estate. The number of houses rented through her agency, which has seven offices from Westhampton Beach to Amagansett, is up by 18 percent over last year at the same time, she said, and the average rental price has increased by 20 percent.
"One couple walked into our Bridgehampton office last weekend and were distraught because there were no brokers available to help them," she said recently. "They pleaded with the manager, 'We must get a rental right now.' They would have taken anything we would have shown them."
Given their experience, such desperation was not totally irrational: they had lost bidding wars to other renters with fatter checks. "They made an offer on one house and the offer got topped," Ms. Desiderio said. "On the second one, they signed a lease and mailed it to the landlord, but by the time the landlord received it, an aggressive broker from another office had hand-delivered a check for more money."
"People are frantic," she continued. "We tell them: 'Pick one of the houses you saw. It won't be here next week.' "
Though it is possible to find a small house in the Hamptons for as little as $12,000 for the season, oceanfront mansions command at least $250,000. The highest rental that Ms. Desiderio has heard so far is $410,000 for the season, and that was snapped up in January. "It is a complete estate," she said, "with everything known to man but a helicopter pad."
According to George C. Ballantyne, senior vice president and New England regional manager of Sotheby's International Realty, responses to what only a few years ago would have been considered astronomic rents are largely dependent on where people come from.
"New Yorkers are more used to spending and are more prepared to do so," he said. "Residential prices are still substantially less expensive in Boston and New England, even in Back Bay and Beacon Hill, than they are in Manhattan. For example, in the past month I sold a town house in Boston for a new record: $5.9 million. Many town houses in New York sell for more than $10 million."
Still, does it make sense, no matter how unlimited the budget, to plow hundreds of thousands of dollars into rent?
For people who want grand mansions with breathtaking views, tennis courts, swimming pools and other luxuries, that may be the only choice, in the view of Timothy G. Davis, principal managing director for Allan M. Schneider Associates, which has seven offices in the Hamptons and Montauk. "If you want to live in that kind of a house, you can only rent it," he said. "It is not available."
For example, he said: "There is a house we rent in East Hampton that has several guest houses and a pool on 30 acres and is $400,000 for July 1 to Labor Day. If it were for sale it would be $25 million, but it's not. There is no way to build it or buy it."
And though the economy has been soaring, there is no certainty that it will continue its upward flight. That has bred a live-for-the-moment attitude toward putting what would certainly be the down payment on a house, and in some cases could buy a sizable house, into rent.
WITH all the bonuses on Wall Street, people find they have a certain amount of disposable income," said Anne Orton, manager and associate broker in the Southampton office of Cook Pony Farm. "But they don't know if they will have it next year, so they don't want the responsibility of owning or maintaining the property, and they don't want the continued overhead that kind of house would command."
Thanks to stock market profits and hefty bonuses, second-home sales have been unusually brisk, depleting the supply of houses available for rent and driving up rental prices, brokers say. "People who want to be in the Pines will pay whatever is necessary, and there is no balking because they have the discretionary funds," said Ms. Weissman, the Fire Island broker. An oceanfront house there would go for $75,000 for the period between May 1 and mid-September, she said; a simple three-bedroom inland cottage for $18,500 for mid-May to mid-September.
In Nantucket, "we're probably getting up to 50 new inquiries a day," said Douglas Foregger, chairman of Country Village Rentals and Real Estate, which conducts business there as well as in Stowe, Vt., Aspen, Colo., St. Bart's in the French West Indies, and Lyford Cay and Harbour Island in the Bahamas. "We have doubled the number of houses rented over the same time last year, and the phones are ringing nonstop." In fact, he added: "The market in Nantucket is now very strong for October and November, because prices go way down then. You can figure that a rental that would be $10,000 for a week in August can be as low as $5,000 a week in late October and November."
At Lake Wallenpaupack in the Poconos, prices exceed those of last year by about 10 percent, said Peter Helms, president of Davis R. Chant Realtors.
The rental season in Lake Wallenpaupack does not go into full gear until the beginning of March, "but we are getting probably twice as many calls already as last year," Mr. Helms said. "A rustic cottage with three bedrooms and a loft starts at $800 a week and can go to $1,100. A four- to five-bedroom house can bring as much as $1,600 a week. The $800 house would have been $750 last year, and there has been no resistance."
Some househunters have found they have to spend much more than planned. Others have made compromises, and still others have found themselves shut out, so far.
Frederick D. Hoff of Hackensack, N.J., who retired as director of national accounts for the former Celanese Corporation five years ago, was fully prepared to pay $22,000 a month for a long season rental in Bay Head or Mantoloking, N.J. But when he went to look last month, he found what he considered all the nicely appointed places taken.
"Instead I saw a lot of yuck, smelly older places," said Mr. Hoff, who was widowed and is now in the process of getting a divorce from his second wife. "Sure I could easily spend $100,000 and like what I am in, but that is crazy. It is a down payment on something. I want value for my money."
Jennifer Millington of Manhattan, a 28-year-old financial software account executive, has been renting group houses with friends almost every summer in towns on the New Jersey shore like Belmar, South Belmar, Sea Girt and Spring Lake since graduating from college in 1993. She began looking in those locales in November but didn't take anything then.
"Everything was $20,000 to $24,000 for Memorial Day to Labor Day, and we thought we would have a bigger group," she said. "We didn't have enough people who wanted to spend that kind of money or make that kind of commitment."
In January she resumed her search and found a house for $9,000, but it was only for five weeks between Memorial Day and the end of July. Finances were a major consideration. "The price worked out better for the partial summer, and we figure we will be more likely to come down every weekend this way," she said.
Last year Susan Kirshenbaum of Manhattan, a partner at Greenberg Kirshenbaum, a recruiting firm for advertising agencies, and two friends paid $24,000 for the Memorial Day to Labor Day season for a three-bedroom, two-bath house on a cul-de-sac in Amagansett, L.I., that she found barely adequate. "It had a Murphy bed version of a kitchen where if you opened the refrigerator door, it hit the wall," she said. "The broker told the owner he could get $40,000 for it this year."
Instead she and her friends will pay an amount she would only describe as "significantly more than $30,000" for a small three-bedroom house perched on a dune in Amagansett. "Two years ago we rented that same house for June and July because we thought the rental for the whole summer was absurd, and now we are paying it," she said. "But how much is happiness worth?"
That depends on the locale, on the size of the house, on the amenities and the length of the rental -- but more than anything else on its proximity to the water, preferably the ocean.
IN Osterville on the south shore of Cape Cod, for example, Paul Grover, senior vice president of Kinlin Grover GMAC Real Estate, which has 14 offices on the Cape, said: "A nice oceanfront rental on a sandy beach could be $30,000 to $50,000 a month for July and August. Across the street, you would pay $15,000 to $20,000 per month, and if you are in the village, walking distance to the beach, you can get a nice house for $10,000 a month, but then you wouldn't have a private beach. If you have to drive to the beach, then the rental could be $5,000 a month."
In Lake Naomi in the Poconos, prices range from $500 to $3,000 a week. "It's the lake that makes the difference in price," Mr. Baxter said. "Off the lake they don't bring in more than $1,100. Those on the lake have their own private beach and maybe a boat docked, and most of those are already booked."
Rents for houses in Litchfield County, where many artists, writers and theatrical and political luminaries have homes, are significantly less than on Long Island. "If the Hamptons is upward of $70,000 for the season," said Seymour Surnow, owner of the Surnow Group at William Raveis Real Estate, "then our top rent is $50,000."
And there would be no roughing it at that price. "That would get you a four-bedroom, centrally air-conditioned house with a heated pool on 10 acres with ponds and English gardens, if you're lucky," he said. "It is up 10 percent over last year, and several years ago it went for $10,000. '
The range of rents in the area goes from $8,000 or $10,000 for the season up to $50,000, he said. Mr. Surnow said last week that he had just got a listing for a four-bedroom saltbox in Bridgewater for $13,000. Another listing he described as modest is for a three-bedroom house in Roxbury on 46 acres that is available for $21,000 for the season.
Besides the bargain -- relatively speaking -- prices, he said, the area offers a more subdued lifestyle despite its high quotient of celebrities. "There is no scene here at all," he said. "You could see Mia Farrow, Stephen Sondheim, Dustin Hoffman and Arthur Miller in the grocery store, and no one gives them a never mind." (You won't see Whoopi Goldberg anymore; Mr. Surnow just sold her farmhouse in Cornwall.)
"And you don't have to make restaurant reservations two weeks ahead," he said. "In fact there are not that many restaurants. The big excitement on Saturday evening is having friends come over."
As far as ambience is concerned, modernity seems to prevail over charm, no matter what the locale. "In the past a lot of people who would go to Martha's Vineyard or Nantucket would want a great old farmhouse with a lot of character," Mr. Foregger said. "Now they want new and shiny and not as much rustic."
Although Nantucket has exceptionally strict rules on architecture, style, color and trim -- the rules dictate, for example, that in most circumstances houses must be gray -- "you can still make an old house new inside," he said.
On Martha's Vineyard, "people may want a quaint New England shingled cape with a rose-covered fence," Ms. Floyd said, "but they also want it to be well equipped. They ask for fax machines, a second plug and phone for Internet access, Jacuzzis and nicely equipped kitchens. We hardly ever get requests for swimming pools or tennis courts."
By contrast, in the Hamptons, "most people won't even look unless something has a pool and is centrally air-conditioned," said Tina S. Fredericks, a broker who has been in business in the Southampton to Montauk area for 35 years.
"We used to think people came here for the beach and the air quality," she said. "If they could go swimming in the bay they were very happy. Now everyone wants air-conditioning, not air quality."

HEADLINE: SENIORITY;
A Ready Constituency Awaiting Recognition

BYLINE: By FRED BROCK; Fred Brock is an editor at The Times. His column on the approach and arrival of retirement appears the first Sunday of each month.
E-mail: fbrock@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
AMID all the fighting over Confederate flags and Christianity, none of the presidential candidates have tried very hard to connect with an important constituency: older Americans.
That is not to say that the contenders have ignored issues that affect seniors, like Social Security and Medicare. And Vice President Al Gore's recent trips to Florida have hardly been to visit college students. 
 But no candidate has tried to go beyond a handful of trigger issues and to forge an empathetic bond with older people, to become their champion, as President Clinton has with blacks over the last seven years, as Senator John McCain has with fellow veterans or as Mr. Gore has with organized labor.
Older Americans, of course, are a very diverse lot, making them more difficult to appeal to than, say, an ethnic minority group with a shared history.
But Bill Zinke, a consultant for corporations on hiring and retaining older workers, thinks the time is ripe for a leader to tap into this important voter pool.
"A candidate who can show that he really understands the needs of older Americans could certainly swing important votes in his direction," Mr. Zinke said. "And I don't mean just in terms of entitlement programs or more laws."
In other words, he is not asking candidates to pander to seniors' pocketbooks. Rather, he wants to hear them talking about what older Americans have to contribute.
The comments from House members in the wake of last week's unanimous vote to lift earnings restrictions on Social Security beneficiaries aged 65 to 69 indicate that, at least on the Congressional level, some politicians are catching on.
Although Mr. Zinke has no formal expertise in politics, he argues from the numbers. Some 58 million Americans are 55 or older, a figure that will bulge as the baby boomers enter retirement. And older people go to the polls. In the 1996 presidential election, 77 percent of Americans over 65 voted, compared with just 49 percent of the overall voting-age population.
Henry J. Aaron, an economist at the Brookings Institution in Washington and an expert on aging and demographics, is among those who argue that older people are too diverse to be captured as a core constituency. He agrees, however, that their growing numbers and high voting rate -- combined with "ennui among younger voters" -- could make them fertile ground for a candidate able to forge an "emotional connection."
Mr. Zinke wants to see political leadership that will change what he calls the "national mind-set" about older Americans. "Jawboning is as good a term as any to describe what I think is needed," he said.
"The general attitude is that when you reach a certain age, you're over the hill. You should go somewhere and enjoy the 'golden years.' "
He cited a 1999 Harris Poll showing that there were 3.7 million people over 55 who were out of the work force but who would like to keep working. "Because of ageism and the national mind-set about older people, they think there are no jobs for them or they are not wanted," he said. "In a tight job market, this is a valuable resource pool."
SO why doesn't one of the candidates start beating this drum? "I think they and their advisers are just plain missing the boat," Mr. Zinke said.
Steve Murphy, a Democratic political consultant in Washington, thinks there may well be an opening for a candidate with such a message. But he said national office seekers had to be careful of too many segmented appeals. "You need an overarching appeal to build a majority," he said.
Still, a focus on seniors, he added, could have traction as a subtext of a campaign, because values are important in this year's elections. "Equal opportunity and respect for elders are important values," he said. "Also, building credibility with older voters is important, because traditional means of reaching them are becoming less effective. They don't respond well to pandering."
Mr. Zinke, a former corporate and criminal lawyer in New York, runs his own consulting company, Human Resource Services in Boulder, Colo. He is organizing a conference in Washington in June on the importance of older workers in meeting employment needs. Sponsors include AARP, Chase Manhattan, GTE, Nortel Networks, Pitney-Bowes, Young & Rubicam and AXA Equitable.
Mr. Zinke is an example of what he preaches. He will be 73 this month, and he has no plans to retire.
"We should not see aging and our increased longevity in a negative light," he said. "Instead of worrying about the graying of America, we should be looking forward to the benefits and opportunities of this demographic change." After all, he said, "an older population is also a wiser and more skilled population."

As Gasoline Prices Rise, the Cost of New Cars and Trucks May Fall

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
RISING gasoline prices and wavering consumer confidence might mean better deals on new cars and trucks this spring.
Consumers might not get the bargain of a lifetime from auto dealers, but they could save enough to help offset their higher fuel costs, particularly with gas-demanding sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks. 
 "As strange as it may seem, the consumer's purchasing power will actually be enhanced" this spring when it comes to buying a popular S.U.V. or pickup truck, said David Littman, chief economist with Comerica Bank in Detroit.
Mr. Littman said the fact that automakers have changed their production schedules to turn out more S.U.V.'s and pickups means that they have bigger inventories of these vehicles. And because light trucks like these have relatively high profit margins, automakers and dealers have more leeway to bargain. Although car and truck sales have been very strong so far in 2000, Mr. Littman said he had anecdotal evidence that it was taking more incentives to sell the bigger vehicles.
"Gas prices are having an impact," he said.
Until recently, those prices were not a big issue. But the national average cost of a gallon of gasoline, including all grades and taxes, reached a record $1.4713 in late February, according to the Lundberg Survey of 10,000 gas stations across the country. A year earlier, the average was 99.8 cents a gallon.
As a result, an owner of an S.U.V. or a pickup truck can find himself pouring plenty of money into a fuel tank. Using the Lundberg figures, it would cost about $640 a year more than it did a year ago to gas up a Chevy Tahoe -- with a 26-gallon tank -- once a week. It would take $960 more to fuel a Chevy Suburban with a 39-gallon tank, and about $1,083 more for a Ford Excursion's 44-gallon tank.
Of course, the future of gasoline prices is hard to figure. Representatives of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries are expected to approve an increase in crude oil production when they meet later this month, but any increase is unlikely to bring gas prices down to the levels of early last year.
Aside from gasoline prices, there are other reasons that automakers and dealers may be inclined to bargain.
With very strong auto sales during the last few years, including a record 16.9 million in 1999, "there's no pent-up demand left" for new cars and light trucks, said Susan Jacobs, head of Jacobs & Associates, an automotive marketing and research firm in Rutherford, N.J.
Manufacturers will need to persuade consumers "to come in and replace their cars even though they're not falling apart or in need of major repairs," she said. That may be a difficult task, she added, because the stock market, a big source of wealth for many consumers, is not turning in the gains this year that it did in 1999.
Rising interest rates may also prompt car sellers to negotiate more. Americans were slightly less confident about the economy during February, largely because of higher interest rates and gasoline prices, according to the Confidence Board, the business research group.
Although consumer confidence is still very high, it could ebb if the Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates, as it is widely expected to do. And consumers who check Internet sites about the availability of good used cars could migrate toward the used-car market to save money, Ms. Jacobs said.
Consumer groups advise auto buyers to go into a showroom only after doing a lot of research into new car prices. Consumer Reports and Consumers Digest suggest that buyers learn the invoice price of a model, or the price the dealer pays the automaker for the car or truck.
Consumers Digest notes on its Web site (www.consumersdigest.com) that the invoice price generally includes a small profit for the dealer. The magazine suggests that customers "negotiate upward from that baseline."
The Internet has many sites for researching the invoice price, including the Kelley Blue Book (www.kbb.com). Consumer Reports also sells reports on car prices through www.consumerreports.org or through its toll-free phone number (800) 888-8275.

Modestly, India Goes In for a Swim

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER 

DATELINE: BOMBAY

 BODY:
WITH its acres of artificial rivers and cement oceans painted swimming-pool blue, Water Kingdom could almost pass for a theme park in Florida, if it weren't for the men in turbans who are bobbing in the wave pools and the women sailing down the water slide in pants and long-sleeved shirts.
But Bombay is a long way from Orlando. The water park here was built for people who don't know how to swim; it rents swimsuits to women who have never worn one before. Sarabjit Kaur, dressed in a bathing costume of long black stretch pants and a loose T-shirt, shuddered at the thought of a one-piece, never mind a bikini. 
 "Our culture doesn't allow us," she said shyly. Her husband, Tanjendar Singh Sodhi, a well-traveled banker, explained: "Things are changing. She wouldn't have even worn this five years back. Now she is."
Water amusement parks are springing up all over India, in New Delhi and Bombay, in Madras and Hyderabad, in Ahmedabad and Indore -- signs of change in a country where tens of millions of people have benefited from an increasingly open, market-driven economy over the past decade. They have money to spend on luxuries that their parents could never have afforded, or even imagined.
India may still conjure up exotic images of snake charmers, leprous beggars and bejeweled maharajas, but there is a new middle class rising here, and its members are busily doing the consumerist things that the middle classes do everywhere: shopping for refrigerators, chatting on the phone, watching cable television -- and looking for fun.
"Leisure is on the boom here," said Rajen Shah, general secretary of the Indian Association of Amusement Parks and Industries. "One Sunday, people will go to a bowling alley or a pool parlor. The next Sunday, they'll go to a water park."
Gautam and Madhauri Varik are just such a couple. He owns a small workshop that assembles electronic gadgets using circuits from Singapore. She sells chemicals to biotechnology laboratories. Each has a master's degree, and together they earn roughly $4,000 a year, about five times the national average, putting them in the upper middle class.
They have a far higher standard of living than their parents did. Mr. Varik, 27, grew up in a one-room house with three other family members. He and his wife, who have no children, live in a two-room apartment with a kitchen and a host of appliances, including a refrigerator, washing machine, television, VCR, CD player and telephone.
They enjoy their prosperity, but their lives are more hectic than those of their parents. Neither of their mothers had jobs, but Mrs. Varik, 30, works and travels almost as intensively as her husband. "They had more free time than us," she said, a bit wistfully, of her parents' generation. "We are working too hard."
So the Variks look for convenient places to relax. They enjoy going out to play billiards, and on a recent Sunday they tried Water Kingdom for the first time. "One of my friends took his wife here," Mr. Varik said, as he sat next to a wading pool. "He insisted this was the best place to spend a weekend. And it is fantastic."
Economists caution that being in the middle of the Indian income range doesn't yield anything like the buying power of a middle-class income in western Europe or North America. Iswar Natarajan, chief economist at the National Council of Applied Economic Research in New Delhi, thinks a better term for this group might be the consuming class. Using survey data, he estimates that the number of households in this class, with incomes of $1,200 to $6,000 a year, has almost doubled in the past decade, to about 39 million. That translates to 220 million of India's one billion people. Most still cannot afford a big-ticket item like a car, but they still find themselves with growing amounts of disposable income.
Ashok Goel's family owns the 22-acre Water Kingdom park, which had more than half a million customers last year. Mr. Goel said a typical visitor to the park spent about $5 over all, including admission, suit and locker rentals and snacks; at a water park in the United States, $5 might not even cover parking. Prices are kept affordable at Indian parks by low labor costs and the fact that there is no off season -- the weather is warm all year round in most of the country.
Parks like Water Kingdom adapt to the needs of local customers in ways besides price. Almost all the pools are shallow, because few Indians can swim, Mr. Goel said. Women, most of whom rent their bathing gear, can choose among styles that reveal as much or as little skin as they want.
"The swimming gear has been tailor-made for the Indian psyche," Mr. Goel said. "You can cover from wrist to ankle. We have all the kinds. But the two-piece does not exist."
There are now about 80 water parks, large and small, in India, most of them opened in the last few years, said Mr. Shah, who besides heading the trade association is also managing director of the Arihant Industrial Corporation, which manufactured the water slides and wave pools used at about 60 of the parks.
On a recent Sunday, Water Kingdom was full of playful scenes. There were young lovebirds floating in inner tubes down Drifting River; lumpy, out-of-shape people lined up to buy french fries and a Coke at an on-site McDonald's, and families riding the waves in Wetlantic.
Meenaxi Patel, a homemaker, sat astride a large inflatable crocodile in the wading pool at Goofers Lagoon with a group of other women from her apartment building.
"We have come, all the ladies and kids, no gents," she said. "My husband is very sporting. If I go out with the kids, he feels good. He's at home relaxing. My mother-in-law is also there, resting."
Like others in the park, Mrs. Patel spoke of freedom and fun as the parks' big draws. Wearing her own colorful swimming costume, a style that covered her thighs and upper arms but that was gaily splashed with fuchsia flowers, she said she and her friends had left all their worries behind.
"It used to be that women stayed at home," she said. "They wouldn't wear these costumes and come out. But times have changed. We want to enjoy."

HEADLINE: ON THE CONTRARY;
The Real Bottom Line For All This Free Stuff

BYLINE: By DANIEL AKST; Daniel Akst's column tilts at conventional business wisdom and appears the first Sunday of each month. E-mail: culmoney@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
THE best things in life may not be free, but lately a lot of pretty good things can be had for practically nothing.
The Village Voice, for instance, is one of many newspapers that are now distributed gratis. There are also no-fee credit cards, free income tax software and even free computers. In the investing world, of course, there are no-load mutual funds, not to mention stock-trading commissions that seem to be fast approaching zero. 
 The Internet, of course, is truly the land of the free -- from free e-mail, voice mail and fax services to access to Encyclopedia Britannica and major newspapers and magazines of every stripe. Linux, the upstart operating system that some people see as a challenge to the hegemony of Microsoft, is free, too. And until Microsoft scotched the idea recently, there was even talk of making Windows free.
With news of $30-a-barrel oil and $2.85 million for a one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan, Alan Greenspan is hardly the only one worried about inflation. In such a climate, it is deceptively easy to overlook the opposite trend: all the cheap stuff bubbling up to the surface of our economy. And the cheapest of these goods and services -- the ones that cost nothing -- are notable as harbingers of long-term social and economic changes.
For one thing, this free stuff is aimed at affluent people, who in effect are trading on their status as sales leads. That suggests that the trend offers yet another way, besides marrying each other and investing in Internet stocks, that the rich will keep getting richer.
A further implication is that the recipients will be obliged to surrender more of their already depleted store of privacy. But despite considerable hand-wringing, they probably won't mind very much, because even though their lives have become a more open book to strangers, they already enjoy unprecedented physical privacy from the people they really care about -- their neighbors. These days, the affluent do not perambulate in watchful villages. They cruise sprawling suburbs behind tinted windshields. For most people, this supposedly horrifying arrangement has proven remarkably congenial, and it doesn't appear likely to change.
Of course, nothing in life is really free. Providers of free information may hope that the recipients will pay by listening to advertisers' messages; providers of free computers make the recipients sign long-term Internet access agreements. Yet many of us find that the costs of our new free services are borne mainly by other consumers, suggesting that we are at the threshold of a golden age of free riders.
I'm not referring here to turnstile jumping, but to arrangements like no-fee credit cards with grace periods. People who pay in full, and on time, get free use of a bank's money for a month, underwritten by customers who maintain outstanding balances. Similarly, investors in index funds get to ride free on the coattails of the costly research and investment decisions made by others, decisions in the absence of which the stocks in the index would cease to rise. If you read this column on a Web site instead of buying the paper, you would be free-riding, too.
Can all this continue? Some of it surely can, because the rising tide of free services reflects two long-term trends that show no sign of abating. The first is global competition, which has a way of making even things that aren't free amazingly cheap. Consider the labor, materials and capital investment that went into what you are picking up for a song at Wal-Mart or Costco.
The second trend is a technology-inspired acceleration in the commodification of goods. Is there really any material difference between brands of vodka or cola or comparably equipped personal computers? Stock-trading systems, mutual funds, Internet access and other goods and services are becoming ever more alike. Even cars, within a given model class, are more difficult than ever to tell apart.
GIVEN a decently managed money supply, how do you raise prices in this environment, or stand out in the crowd? I predict ever-higher premiums attached to marketing, which already occupies a hallowed place in American business culture.
There will also be innovation, naturally. Building a better mousetrap always holds out the possibility that people will be willing to pay more for rodent control. That won't be inflationary, if the mousetrap really is better.
Nonetheless, the possibility reminds us that the best mousetrap is always likely to cost something, and that even in Freebie Nation, you get what you pay for, one way or another.

HEADLINE: MARKET INSIGHT;
A Season To Consider Very Real Earnings

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
BELIEVE it or not, spring is just around the corner. And while most stocks slogged through January and February, the companies behind the ticker symbols have been out there in the real world, doing real business, many of them making real money.
In about a month, when first-quarter profit numbers start to roll in, people who have been worried sick about rising interest rates may start to remember that there is a lot of life out there. Of course, there is a very real chance that outside of technology, those investors may spend the intervening period merrily selling shares of very good companies that are making very good money. 
 Leah Modigliani, a United States equity strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, took some time last week to talk about profits, interest rates and the stock market. Following are excerpts from the conversation:
 
Q. The economy barreled ahead at nearly a 7 percent annual clip in the fourth quarter, and so far this quarter hasn't shown many signs of slowing. Does that bode well for corporate profits?
 
A. Earnings were very strong in the fourth quarter and we think that trend is continuing.
For the Standard & Poor's 500 companies, we think earnings will rise about 15.7 percent on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter, and 12 percent for the year.
There will be some aberrations within the group, particularly in the energy sector, where in some cases earnings will go from negative to very positive. And we will continue to see good earnings growth out of technology, even though some of these stocks are ahead of themselves on fundamentals.
 
Q. Are there other sectors that will do particularly well?
 
A. We should see very strong earnings growth in basic materials companies, the paper, chemical and aluminum stocks.
According to our calculations, the consensus projected earnings growth rates for energy companies will go from negative in 1999 to 45 percent this year. The projected growth rate for basic materials is 36 percent, which is a little higher than the 33 percent earnings growth projected for technology companies.
 
Q. For the most part, investors seem to have ignored these signs, especially in the groups you just mentioned. Why?
 
A. Even though we are seeing very strong earnings growth in energy and basic materials, the market doesn't seem to care.
We have liked energy stocks for some time, and still do. But people seem to be concerned that oil prices will come down from these peaks. That may happen, but they will still be way up from where they were a year ago. And that will be reflected in earnings.
Most of the so-called Old Economy stocks are undervalued. Even some of the companies that are migrating to the New Economy are not getting much credit for it right now, like the auto stocks. They have good sales and are really jumping on more efficient Internet-based purchasing methods. But for the most part, the stocks are in the dumps.
 
Q. Isn't there also some concern that if rising interest rates choke off growth, these kinds of cyclical stocks will get badly hurt?
 
A. If the economy gets into trouble, that would be the case. But because of healthy growth overseas, energy companies would be a little bit of an exception to that.
 
Q. What about interest rates? The worry seems to be that the Fed will tip the economy into recession. Is that likely?
 
A. If the economy goes from 7 percent growth to 4 percent, it is a slowing that on the margin is a negative. But 4 percent growth is still very strong.
 
Q. Technology stocks seem impervious to the prospect of higher interest rates. Are they really that bulletproof?
 
A. The cost of capital for these companies is extremely low, so higher rates will not impact that. You would think stocks with a high price-to-earnings multiple would be impacted. But people are looking at the wonderful opportunity for technology in the future and are not worrying about a one-year rise in interest rates.
That said, valuations are ahead of themselves.
 
Q. With the Nasdaq composite index being the notable exception, most major measures are down so far this year. Are you expecting more selling?
 
A. In the beginning of the year, we were calling for a 20 percent to 25 percent correction for the Dow Jones industrial average and the S. & P. 500. We are probably part of the way through that, but there may be more to go. I am not talking about the Nasdaq, which is an index I don't have a focus on.
 
Q. What stocks do you like right now?
 
A. In a general sense, we like the oil service stocks. Schlumberger and Halliburton are two that I like. And I like integrated oil company stocks like Conoco, and some of the bigger companies, like Exxon Mobil.

Cutthroat Capitalism, Only 99 cents

BYLINE: By JIM O'GRADY 

 BODY:
IT is retail red in tooth and claw.
So say the owners of several 99-cent stores strung like a discount archipelago along shop-crammed Myrtle Avenue in Ridgewood, Queens. They say the competition is cutthroat in this heavily trafficked half-mile strip between Forest and Wyckoff Avenues. And it has only got worse as new stores have opened in the area, at the rate of about one a year. 
 When Muhammad Choudry, a Pakistani immigrant who opened Power 99 last April, is asked to compare his store to the others, he picks up a cardboard box and rips it open. "The other stores don't have this," he says, pulling out a hand-held electronic game called Einstein. "The other stores," he says, "they have no variety!"
Mr. Choudry is mistaken. Variety -- overwhelming, cornucopial, floor-to-ceiling and baroque -- is a defining characteristic of the 99-cent stores. Every store has row upon row of the same steel wire bins, like gaping pelican mouths brimming with snacks and toys and videos, octopus in hot sauce and powdered amaretto cappuccino. (And antacid.)
But after a while, as you move from store to store, you begin to see the same core group of items, the 10-packs of hair clips and boxes of off-brand baking soda. And the stores themselves begin to blend in an endless stream of shuffle-worn floors and bouquets of plastic carnations blooming in hues unknown to nature.
So, clearly, one of the ways to survive in the business is to offer something different. Hence, the fresh meat at Mario Bortz's store, Supermarket 99. Mr. Bortz's son, Fabian, said that late last year his father was searching for a way to distinguish his inventory from his competitors. He had already lowered prices to 88 cents -- where they remain, with the odd 79-cent sale thrown in -- though the name of the store hasn't changed.
"We started getting shipments of meat two times a week," said Fabian, 19, a student who works part time for his father. "We get hot dogs, ham, turkey, American cheese and sausages," he said. "It's very popular."
Martha Gillings agreed. She recently bought two packs of Perdue chicken thighs, three two-liter bottles of soda and a 16-pack of Star Farm American cheese slices at Supermarket 99, all for $5.65. "Eighty-eight cents for Perdue chicken," she said. "You can't get that at Waldbaum's or Pathmark."
Price competition is a lot keener than customers might expect from places where nothing goes for more than 99 cents; $1.07 with tax. Mr. Choudry says he occasionally slashes the price on a popular item, like a Bounty Big Roll of paper towels, and announces it on a sign in the window. He said the attention-getting price draws shoppers into his store. Once inside, he says, their urge to browse becomes almost irresistible.
"The customers come in for one thing," he said, "but they leave with five things." (On Thursday, in an extreme form of this tactic, the corporate owner of a 99 Cents Only Store in Woodland Hills, Calif., part of a chain, offered microwave ovens and television sets for 99 cents to the first nine customers at the store's grand opening.)
Mr. Bortz said his father, who went to a trade fair in Las Vegas two weeks ago, hunting for fresh items, also sells at a loss sometimes, but for a different reason. Thefather owns seven 99-cent stores throughout the city, and one, on Westchester Avenue in the Bronx, is engaged in fierce competition with local stores.
"They kill themselves for a dime in that neighborhood," Fabian Bortz said. He recalled that last year a competitor posted a sign for a popular item at 76 cents. Mr. Bortz lowered his price to 75 cents. The other store owner went to 74 cents. Mr. Bortz won when he dropped the price to 73 cents. He summed up the confrontation: "Sometimes you have to buy something for 75 cents and sell it for 73 cents just to kill they guy across the street."
Shoppers in Ridgewood seem fond of the 99-cent stores, as do New Yorkers on Broadway in Harlem, on Westchester Avenue in the Soundview section of the Bronx, on Church Avenue in Kensington, Brooklyn, and in the many other areas where such outlets are found. And why shouldn't they be? It doesn't take an economic Einstein to figure out that with price wars breaking out at even the low-margin end of the retail food chain, it is the bargain hunter who benefits. Randy Kuntz, a house painter from Glendale, Queens, said he strolled down Myrtle Avenue once a week in search of sundries. At 99 USA, he fingered some tape for repairing leather and said simply, "You cannot beat the prices here."
Three doors down from 99 USA is a Duane Reade drugstore. The manager, Joshua Pierre-Louis, said the bulk of his business comes from filling prescriptions and selling items that cost much more than a dollar. When asked if he worried about being undercut by the 99-cent stores, he replied: "I don't pay them no mind. Our competition is Rite Aid and Genovese. I never go into those other stores." Yet, propped up in the corner of the store's large display window is a Bounty Big Roll. The price? 99 cents.
Beyond the prices, some shoppers enjoy 99-cent stores for the chance to go on a treasure hunt. Carmen Gil said she took her two children to Supermarket 99 five or six times a week. "This is like a treat for them after school," she said, as well as a way of showing them how to shop sensibly. Last week, her daughter, Bethsaida, bought a notepad for school, while her son, Gabriel, purchased a Disney coloring book.
Ms. Gil admitted she did not stand idly by while her children rummaged for goodies. "I love to shop here, too," she said. "Sometimes they have to kick me out of the store."
There is a pleasure to getting and spending that goes deeper than even the treasure hunt. That something else, you might say, is the magic of the deal.
Even Isidro Tejada, a worker at 99 USA, succumbed to it recently when he picked up a wine glass and said, "I heard this is genuine crystal." It was a nicely fluted glass, etched with a wispy flower pattern. But it was one of dozens of similar glasses stacked haphazardly on a shelf piled high with batteries and plastic vases.
Mr. Tejada continued, "They say if you put water on the rim and run your finger on it, like this, it makes a ringing sound." He glided his finger in a reverent circle over the mouth of the glass, without touching it.
There was no sound, but he seemed to hear one anyway. "That's crystal," he concluded.
Of course, real crystal is expensive, and it is unlikely a crystal wine glass would sell for 99 cents, even on Myrtle Avenue. But pointing this out might break the spell of a place where it can seem at times that the iron laws of commerce are suspended, a place where the great American promise of discriminating acquisition among shelves groaning with product is available to all.
As Mr. Choudry said: "Where else can you spend $20 and leave with a bag of 20 things? You may be poor, but you feel rich."

The RisksIn the Fed's Assault On Stocks

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
ALAN GREENSPAN can be clear as a bell when he wants to be. Testifying before Congress last month, he left no doubt that he intends to keep raising interest rates for as long as the wealth being created by the stock market generates more demand than the economy can satisfy.
Yet even as he put investors on notice that monetary policy will get tighter, he was unwilling or unable to address head-on the quandary he faces: how to put a speed bump in front of Wall Street without sending the entire economy into a skid, hurting workers who own little if any stock while he hunts an enemy, inflation, that is nowhere in sight. 
 Mr. Greenspan, who has been all but deified over the last few years, rarely finds himself on the defensive. But his approach is puzzling even some of his biggest fans, and if he miscalculates in raising rates this year, his reputation, not to mention the nation's prosperity, could take a beating.
It is one thing for the Fed chairman to lay the blame for inflationary pressures on Wall Street. Whatever the economic merits of his position, making the stock market his bogeyman is less politically incendiary in an election year than the traditional central banker's warning that too many people are working and earning good money.
But having made the stock market the villain, he could have trouble justifying interest rate increases that also skewer the innocent. Is there any practical difference between raising rates to curb the wealth effect and raising them to push up the unemployment rate and subdue wage increases?
When Mr. Greenspan appeared before the Senate Banking Committee, Senator Jim Bunning, Republican of Kentucky, told Mr. Greenspan not to lose sight of the fact that wage and price increases have remained remarkably restrained, given the robust pace of growth. "Don't become so frightened by success that you throw wet blankets on a fire that isn't burning," he said.
Senator Charles E. Schumer, the New York Democrat, suggested that Mr. Greenspan consider raising margin requirements on investors who buy stocks with borrowed money, as a way of reining in the stock market without putting jobs and improved standards of living at risk. "Isn't raising interest rates too blunt an instrument, a meat cleaver rather than a scalpel?" Mr. Schumer asked.
IMPLICIT in these pleas is that ownership of equities, although far more common than in the past, remains relatively concentrated among the wealthy. The Fed's most recent Survey of Consumer Finances found that in 1998, 48.8 percent of households owned stocks, either directly or through mutual funds and retirement accounts -- a remarkable jump from 31.6 percent in 1989.
Among households earning $25,000 to $50,000 in 1998, those stock holdings had a median value of $11,500. Among households earning $100,000 or more, the median value of stock holdings was $150,000.
Senator Paul Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, cited the example of a high school dropout he met recently who had finished a training program and found work for the first time. "This young fellow is far removed from the wealth effect," Mr. Sarbanes said. "If the activity and the volatility is in the stock market, we may need to think of some way to address that without slowing down the whole economy and affecting the opportunities for these young people."
Mr. Greenspan is far more attuned to the benefits of strong growth than his critics acknowledge. He makes a solid case that the best thing for Mr. Sarbanes' young dropout and others like him is to ensure that the long expansion is not poisoned by an outbreak of inflation. And there is no question that the economy's 6.9 percent annual growth rate in the fourth quarter is far above anyone's speed limit.
Moreover, Mr. Greenspan is candid in saying that there are many things about the fast-changing economy that even he does not fully understand.
The charitable view is that Mr. Greenspan is still puzzling over how to deal with the ways that lofty stock prices ripple through the economy. The more skeptical view is that Mr. Greenspan, for all his protestations that he is not aiming directly at stock prices, is really doing just that.
Newly released transcripts of policy meetings of the Fed during 1994, when it was raising rates repeatedly, show that Mr. Greenspan was concerned even then that the equity market was in dangerously speculative territory -- and that he quite consciously used rate increases to send a chill through investors.
He is no doubt equally eager now to take the froth out of the markets. His challenge is to do it without draining the life out of the best economy most of us will ever see.

HEADLINE: PRIVATE SECTOR;
Mr. Fix-It Rewires a Company

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
EVER since he was a child, Dick Syron has been a tinkerer. As a teenager, he fixed TV sets and cars for spare cash. As an adult, he rewired a 134-year-old house. And he loves working on his 28-foot Bertram motorboat almost as much as he loves powering it through the waves.
And now, at 56, Richard F. Syron is facing what may be his biggest tinkering job yet. As the chief executive of the Thermo Electron Corporation -- a post he has held for just nine months -- he is revamping the diverse manufacturing company top to bottom. 
 Once he is done, Thermo Electron will no longer be a multitentacled company with dozens of publicly traded subsidiaries. It will be a mainstream manufacturer with one set of shares.
"People's willingness to buy small, thin-float stocks that don't have dot-com on them is pretty low," Mr. Syron said. "We're better off as a conventional company."
The revamping is well under way. The company, based in Waltham, Mass., announced on Jan. 31 that it would sell businesses that had provided one-third of its $4.2 billion in revenues. It is spinning off to shareholders two other businesses: biomedical devices and paper manufacturing equipment. And it plans to buy back the public shares of those companies that will form a business making analytical instruments.
Such a transformation is a tall task for someone who had never before run a public company. Sure, Mr. Syron had been on Thermo Electron's board for nearly two years, and yes, he had known George Hatsopoulos, the company's founder and former chairman, for decades.
He has done some big-time quasicorporate tinkering, as well: as president of the Boston Federal Reserve in the early 1990's, he helped keep many New England banks solvent as others across the country went under. In his most recent job, as president of the American Stock Exchange, he was an architect of its merger with Nasdaq's parent, the National Association of Securities Dealers.
But analysts wondered about Mr. Syron's qualifications to run Thermo Electron. "When he was first named, I did have to scratch my head a bit," said Deane Dray of Goldman Sachs, who nonetheless has high hopes for Mr. Syron's reign.
Mr. Syron acknowledges Wall Street's doubts, but says they are misplaced. "Organizational restructuring is not rocket science," he said. "It's common sense."
To hear Mr. Syron's friends and former colleagues tell it, he has that in abundance. "Dick is extremely bright, pragmatic and energetic -- emphasis on that middle word," said E. Gerald Corrigan, a Goldman Sachs partner who worked with Mr. Syron at the Federal Reserve. "He isn't caught up in theology; he's a doer."
Thomas F. Ryan, Mr. Syron's predecessor at the stock exchange, cited a case in point. "He knew enough not to involve the members in the merger decision until it was time to vote," Mr. Ryan said, "and then he knew how to persuade everyone that this merger was right."
Still, why would Dick Syron take on Thermo Electron? He took a 50 percent pay cut when he left the Amex, he says. And for now, his million stock options, priced at $19.10, do not represent any bonanza. Thermo's stock closed at $21.9375 on Friday -- well above its low of $12.50 on April 9, 1999, but nowhere near its high of $44.50 on Dec. 31, 1997.
"The stock has to go up substantially for this to be a good financial move," Mr. Syron said. "Anyone who says it is cheaper to live in Boston than New York hasn't lived in Boston lately."
So again, why? "I like to fix things," he said.
Mr. Syron grew up in Watertown, Mass., the child of Irish immigrants -- his father was a blacksmith, his mother a domestic worker. They lived in a three-family house, with relatives in the other apartments and other relatives a few blocks away.
Many of them loved to work with their hands, and Mr. Syron picked up the knack. "In our environment you didn't call a plumber; you borrowed your uncle's wrench," he said. Uncles and cousins taught him how to fix automobiles, and he learned to repair televisions at an after-school job.
He seemed destined to be an electrical engineer. But in college in the late 60's, he discovered he had a learning disability that made mechanical drawing impossible. He also met his future wife, Peggy. They have been married for 28 years, and have a daughter, Erin, 20, and a son, Brendan, 15.
As an economics major at Boston College (he has advanced degrees in economics from Tufts), Mr. Syron worked summers painting houses in poor sections of Boston. At the Boston Fed, he tried to ensure that people in poor neighborhoods were not unfairly denied mortgages.
Donald L. Isaacs, a retired banker and his best friend, recalls that Mr. Syron, an avid boater, has eschewed fancy sailing clubs, instead joining the more blue-collar South Boston Yacht Club. "Dick judges people by characteristics and qualities, not titles," Mr. Isaacs said.
Apparently, that is how Thermo Electron's board chose him, too. Investors had soured on the company's strategy of constantly spinning out public companies. In September, Mr. Hatsopoulos's brother John, his intended successor, announced that he would resign. The board, wanting someone familiar with the company, chose Mr. Syron. George Hatsopoulos resigned as chairman in January, giving Mr. Syron that title as well.
Mr. Syron expects that it will be more than a year before the sales are completed, the spinoffs done and the company operating as a manufacturer. When everything is fixed, will he leave?
Probably -- but then again, maybe not. "There are many other things I want to do," he said. "But you can't make decisions about what you'll do three years down the road."

The Higher Stakes of Business-to-Business Trade

BYLINE: By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. 

DATELINE: DALLAS

 BODY:
NO one doubts that there is tremendous money to be made helping companies do business with one another over the Internet. And judging by the enormous multiples that investors are paying, they seem pretty sure which kinds of companies are going to make that money. But are they right?
Business-to-business electronic commerce, known as B2B, covers a lot of ground. For some years, companies have been developing digital links with customers, distributors and suppliers to improve supply-chain management and demand forecasting and to squeeze out inventory costs. But lately the concept has taken a quantum leap in scale, to encompass whole industries buying, selling and trading with one another online. 
 Now growing numbers of software companies and dot-com start-ups are pouring in, enticed by the prospect of billions of dollars of transactions in, say, auto parts, freight-hauling services or specialty chemicals passing through a Web-based "exchange" or "marketplace," akin to an eBay for big business, that they could build and control.
And investors have followed, sending stock prices soaring for B2B companies like i2 Technologies, based here in Dallas, whose market capitalization of around $26 billion is about 1,000 times last year's earnings; i2 began life 12 years ago as an enterprise software concern. Ariba and Commerce One, two of i2's competitors, have also seen their stocks shoot up 20- and 30-fold from their offering prices, standing out even in the highflying technology sector.
But the announcement by General Motors, Ford and DaimlerChrysler that they would combine forces to create a single Internet marketplace through which to do their buying has called into question whether the keys to the gold mine will ultimately be claimed by the B2B players or the Old Economy companies they want to serve.
Not that the automakers' announcement froze out the technology companies: Oracle, the Redwood City, Calif., database and e-commerce concern, was chosen to be a key technology provider to the new venture along with Commerce One, and both stocks have jumped since the announcement. But it is not certain that playing the limited role of technology supplier will ever yield enough revenue to justify today's sky-high stock valuations.
Analysts say most B2B exchange revenue will come three ways: from recurring subscription and maintenance fees from participants, from a small commission on each transaction and from equity stakes in the new exchanges. Together, the amounts should be huge.
Consider a few hypotheticals. Total B2B transactions are expected to rise from $145 billion last year to $7.3 trillion in 2004, according to the Gartner Group, a consulting firm. A cut of, say, 0.25 percent of that in transaction fees would yield nearly $20 billion in annual revenue, with much more growth to come. As for equity, some Wall Street analysts are already estimating that the Big Three's exchange could, as a publicly traded company, have a market capitalization of more than $30 billion.
"There is probably at least a trillion dollars in market cap up for grabs in the B2B industry," said Andrew Roskill, an analyst at Warburg Dillon Read. "At the end of the day, there are probably only going to be a very few winners in each vertical industry sector, but those guys are going to command a very high premium."
For some others, it won't be pretty, as the aftermath of the carmakers' Feb. 25 announcement suggested. As it became clear during the day that i2, which had been helping G.M. with its own Internet site, had been left out of the new venture, its stock fell by more than one-quarter from its high that day. The stock recovered some of the lost ground last week, thanks to happier news about new Internet exchanges in the apparel and ground transportation industries and a successful meeting here with analysts; i2's shares closed Friday at $170.75.
Still, the episode shows that for all the talk of the New Economy triumphing over the old, some e-business highfliers cannot count on being masters of their own fate. Many traditional companies are rapidly deciphering the B2B world and demanding better terms for their participation, sometimes leaving smaller slivers of equity and lower fees for the technology companies than they had hoped. Some analysts expect Oracle's cut of the new auto venture to be smaller relative to Ford's than the two had initially discussed for Ford's own Web site project, although terms have not been announced.
With so much at stake, competitive tensions run high. The chief executive of i2, Sanjiv Sidhu, said in an interview last week that his staff was still negotiating for a role in the automakers' exchange. Mr. Sidhu argues that Oracle is not in his company's league technologically. "It's tough to really understand what they have to offer if you measure it based on what they have up and running," Mr. Sidhu said.
In response, an Oracle spokesman said new products due in the next few months would make the company "the best of the breed for supply-chain software" and that i2's exclusion, so far, from the Big Three's venture meant that "i2 is now irrelevant in the auto industry."
George Gilbert, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, agreed with Mr. Sidhu that Oracle lagged behind i2 in some crucial areas of technology. He said i2, struggling to cope with a huge flow of new proposals, was searching for a more standardized and efficient way to strike deals.
Historically, Mr. Gilbert said, i2's "biggest challenge has been marketing, because they've seen farther down the road than most, and they've had to bring people along." But lately, he said, "the market has caught up with them. It's like everything is coming together."
Speaking about B2B in general, Mr. Sidhu said fears that fees and equity stakes for companies like his would be squeezed were overblown. Demand for new Internet exchanges and associated software is so great, he said, that everyone is focused simply on getting sites up and running, not on the financial fine points. "There are many patients needing attention," Mr. Sidhu said, "and there's a shortage of doctors."
Technology companies may have an easier time in fields where both buyers and sellers are fragmented, like agriculture, than in concentrated industries where a handful of companies hold all the cards. Leah Knight, a principal analyst at the Gartner Group, said the automakers must have realized that they could dictate terms, and "if they want to take a larger percentage of the transaction, that comes with the turf."
Mr. Roskill said the same dynamic was developing elsewhere. "The last six months or so, we've seen a bit of a wake-up call from traditional industry players trying to shift the balance of power away from the technology providers to the actual people who provide the order flow," he said. But, he added, there is a limit to how far the pendulum should swing: "It makes sense to give the technology provider a stake that's meaningful, so their interests are tied together" with the users'.
In such an environment, Ms. Knight sees a shakeout ahead. While some B2B players "have the potential to become companies in the upper end" of the Fortune 500, she said, "maybe not even half" of those now in the field will be winners. The current stock market valuations of the remainder leave them a lot of room to fall.

As business-to-business e-commerce takes hold, the question of who will exert the most control over online marketplaces and exchanges -- and the rewards to be reaped from them -- will be answered differently from industry to industry, analysts say.
 
Concentrated buyers
One or a few main companies that buy from a host of suppliers.
Buyers are likely to dominate, with B2B companies in lesser roles as technology suppliers.
EXAMPLES: Big Three automakers; Sears and Carrefour
 
Concentrated sellers
One or a few major suppliers that sell to a host of customers.
Sellers are likely to dominate, with B2B companies in lesser roles as technology suppliers.
EXAMPLES: Metalsite (steel), ChemConnect and CheMatch (chemicals)
 
Fragmented
Many buyers and sellers trading, collaborating and competing.
Opportunities for B2B companies to dominate as intermediaries.

HEADLINE: IDEAS & TRENDS;
A Credibility Gap In the Digital Divide

BYLINE: By KATIE HAFNER 

 BODY:
THE latest buzzphrase circulating among politicians and computer industry executives these days is the digital divide, the gulf between those who have access to computers and the Internet and those who do not. Poor people and minorities, or so the thinking goes, are in danger of being shut out of what promises to be the most important mode of gathering and exchanging information, and what is emerging as a common way of making and spending lots of money.
In fact, though, there is a growing recognition among those dealing most closely with the issue that the term digital divide, while clever and provocative, has become a catchall phrase for politicians with conspicuous agendas and that the divide is a complex phenomenon that no amount of measurement can fully explain. 
 Increasingly, it seems that the nation is actually facing a multitude of digital divides, not one limited to race or income or education. While it is true that millions of people are still without access to computers or the Internet, those who are counted as connected fall along a spectrum: Some are dialing into the Internet through antiquated rural phone lines that cannot handle high data speeds, while others use ultra high-speed connections from both work and home. Millions of others are getting their connection only occasionally from public libraries, classrooms or community centers.
Last week was a busy time for those in the digital bridge-building business. First, Vice President Al Gore visited a San Francisco nonprofit group to deliver a speech on the divide.
Later in the week, the Rev. Jesse Jackson opened a branch of his Rainbow/PUSH Coalition in Silicon Valley, with the goal of closing the divide among the poor. The same day, the Rev. Jackson delivered a speech at the University of California at Berkeley in which he pronounced access to technology "the newest stage of the civil rights struggle."
Also last week, results of a survey conducted by National Public Radio, the Kaiser Family Foundation and Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government corroborated earlier studies that found that at higher income levels there is virtually no racial gap. More good news: of those who bought computers in the last two years, about one-third are from low-income or minority groups.
And yet the survey found a persistent racial divide among low-income households when it comes to computer ownership and Internet access at home.
Such findings may not spell out the problem as much as help reveal its thorniness. It helps to start by looking at the ways in which people connect to the Internet. Plenty of people have connections at work, but some of them are not wired at home. In addition, connecting to the Internet from work, a library or school is quite different from connecting from the privacy of one's living room. Experts say that the only way to fully appreciate the Web is to experience it and that the most useful experience, unfettered by the constraints of an institutional setting, comes with using the Internet from home.
At the same time, a high-speed cable modem connection gives a Web surfer a far different view of cyberspace -- one that's lightning quick and rich with sound and motion -- than that seen via a slower link from a traditional modem.
Thus far, much of the digital bridge-building has focused on schools. At first blush, the gap there doesn't seem especially alarming. According to Market Data Retrieval, a company that has surveyed the nation's public schools, 94 percent of schools in wealthy districts have access to the Internet, compared with 84 percent of schools that serve poor populations.
But the figures are deceptive. "Those numbers fail to address the nature of those connections," David Gollaher, chief executive of the California Healthcare Institute, a nonprofit group in La Jolla, Calif., told a group of health care experts who gathered last week at Berkeley to discuss the digital divide and e-health (industry shorthand for the delivery of health information and services on the Internet).
Most of the poorer schools, Mr. Gollaher said, connect to the Internet using a relatively slow 56 kilobit-per-second connection, which may be fine for sending e-mail but prevents a large population of potential users from experiencing the full scope and power of the Internet.
Mr. Gollaher later said it was not until he got a high-speed connection at his home that his own children grew interested in the Web. "They download a lot of music, and they listen to radio stations online," he said. "Many of the uses they prefer are uses that depend on high-speed connections."
SOME experts have claimed in recent weeks that the digital divide is actually a myth, that income at all levels might play a greater role than race in disparities between the digital haves and have-nots, though the two are often connected.
The N.P.R. survey disproved that claim with a finding that among households of all income levels, 57 percent of whites under the age of 60 have Internet or e-mail access from home, compared with 38 percent of blacks. In households where income is less than $30,000 a year, the study found, 34 percent of whites have access from home, compared with 19 percent of blacks.
That divide narrows drastically when on-line access takes place outside the home, especially in the workplace. "The gap largely disappears everywhere except at home," said Molly Brodie, a vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, who oversaw the N.P.R. survey.
"As soon as you start to look a little deeper, you see that the biggest problem is at home," said Donna L. Hoffman, a professor of management at Vanderbilt University and the co-author of a 1998 study with results similar to those in the N.P.R. survey.
"There's no way you can understand what it can do for you unless you use it," she said of the Internet. "You have to try it, then you can see the meaning it can have in your own life."
Connecting to the Internet from outside the home makes having such an experience more difficult, she said. "I just think it's very hard to do that when you have a 30-minute limit, or when you have to wait in line, or with others around."
David Greenbaum, a researcher at Berkeley who works with community groups in Oakland to address the digital divide, suspects that the problem of access from home might be one of cause and effect.
"One premise that underlies all of this is that if someone had the right kind of access at home, they'd be much more involved in the whole wired and on-line world," Mr. Greenbaum said. "But if they already had the impulse and interest to be part of that world, then they'd have the kind of motivation to have a machine at home."
INTERESTINGLY, the N.P.R. survey found no significant difference between whites and blacks at low-income levels when it came to owning other home electronics, like cable television and V.C.R.'s.
Mr. Greenbaum said that at a recent digital divide conference in Oakland, a number of people asked: "Why is it people are willing to spend $500 on a big wide-screen TV? How can we instill that same kind of economic pull to a desire to being online?"

HEADLINE: A Dependence on Oil

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Effort for Lowering Oil Prices Gains at U.S.-Saudi Meeting" (news article, Feb. 27):
Sending Energy Secretary Bill Richardson to secure lower oil prices may provide consumer relief in the short term, but does nothing to address the long-term problem of our oil addiction. In addition to spewing 20 percent of our global warming pollution, automobiles guzzle 40 percent of the oil we use, keeping us dependent on foreign oil. 
 In fact, with the proliferation of S.U.V.'s, the average fuel economy of new vehicles sold has fallen to its lowest point since 1980. Since 1996, Congress has blocked President Clinton's ability to raise fuel economy standards. The president must stand up to Congress and the auto industry now to raise these standards.

HEADLINE: So Big That Politics Gets Lost

BYLINE: By Michael Yaki; Michael Yaki, a lawyer, is a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
Moving the California primary to March 7 from its old date in June would ensure one thing, the politicos and party hacks said: it would give the state, the seventh-largest economic power in the world, some importance in the process of electing the president.
Never mind that with 54 electoral votes, California could be sure that once the primaries were over, the nominees would spend an inordinate amount of time here. Never mind that the well-heeled of Hollywood and Silicon Valley (and the occasional Buddhist monk) could already talk shop with any politicians they wanted. 
 If we Californians were really important, the thinking went, we should be part of determining which candidates were there in the general election to woo us. You can imagine party bosses muttering as the world focused on clumps of 45 frozen voters apiece in Iowa and New Hampshire. We are California! We incarcerate more people than live in Des Moines!
But California's sheer size keeps it from being a New Hampshire or an Iowa, even with the primary duly moved. Staged media events attended by thousands -- Chinatown walks, barrio strolls and anti-crime speeches -- replace the hourlong stop at the coffee shop.
Instead of the folksy meetings down at the courthouse, we've had an almost yearlong barrage of radio and television ads, glitzy mailers and annoying phone calls from "grass-roots" bullpens in Florida and Arizona. Yes, we may have a decisive impact early. But that doesn't necessarily translate into greater citizen involvement.
If we really want to make the voters of California connect with the early stages of the presidential marathon, we need a different approach. Why not be creative? We are a big, diverse state. Split California up into "affinity" primaries.
Each California group would vote on the same date as an affinity partner elsewhere in the country, with our delegates divided accordingly. By being lumped together with other, earlier primaries, we might have even more impact.
Take, for example, Iowa. The issue there seems to be farms, farms, farms. We have farms in California, big farms. The Central Valley. The Imperial Valley. We could link up with Iowa in a "farmers' caucus." We might even invite the very small farmers in Humboldt County (if we conveniently forget the illegal crop that several of our candidates swear they haven't touched in decades). Then Bill Bradley, George W. Bush, Al Gore and John McCain could wax philosophical in front of real corn and rutabagas. After all, what grows in Iowa in January?
Or consider San Francisco, which has the largest (surprise!) proportion of voters in the state who decline to state their political preferences when they register. San Franciscans pride ourselves on our independent (liberal) streak. New Hampshire prides itself on its independent (conservative) streak. The "live free or die" state and the "free love" city together on one primary day -- just imagine the synergy.
New York City and Los Angeles could end their foolish competition by beaming Palm Pilots at one another and recognizing that they're really only a cell phone's throw apart. The megacities with megadiversity and megaproblems could have a megaprimary in March (the ides would be most appropriate).
Communities like Palm Springs could be linked with their golf-saturated, water-table-draining brethren in Nevada and Arizona to form a "fairways and greens" primary. And so on. And then, for the general election, we could return to our usual winner-take-all vote to unite our great state behind one candidate.
Yes, I'm kidding. But the problem is real. And Iowa and New Hampshire are about more than just being the first hurdles of the presidential race. They also represent a model of politician-citizen interaction that is the envy of the nation.
In a California statewide contest, whether a primary or a general election, candidates tend to focus on their bases of voters, extracting the highest turnout possible among those most likely to support them.
Mr. Bradley, who has staked a position to the left of Mr. Gore, is focusing heavily on the San Francisco Bay area, a treasure trove of liberal voters. Mr. McCain, who is trolling for patriotic, heartland conservatives, has been seen hopping from meeting to meeting in Fresno and Stockton.
This approach means entire communities are ignored or given token attention. It may seem cynical, but it is dictated by California's size and the cost of campaigning. Affinity primaries might give everyone an opportunity to feel as courted as the waitress in the coffee shop in Concord or the office manager in Oskaloosa. They could be the way to bite-size California's vastness to connect the individual voters to the greater political good.
As a locally elected official, I know the power of the handshake, the conversation in the grocery store, the chat on the street corner. The willingness and ability to engage one-on-one is still one of our most precious grasps on the democratic process, but it is increasingly scarce.
We are the mighty California, with the coastline that stretches nearly 1,000 miles and the population of more than 30 million. But we are also many Californias, and we need to find some way to give more of our people the sense of an individual stake in the electoral process.

Guess Who's Embracing Immigrants Now

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
IN 1994, Gov. Pete Wilson rode to re-election on his successful support of Proposition 187, which barred the children of illegal immigrants from attending public school in California.
Two years later, the Republican-led Congress pointed to the huge budget deficit when it enacted legislation that barred hundreds of thousands of legal immigrants from receiving food stamps and Federal disability assistance. 
 Immigrant bashing then swept into the presidential campaign as a wedge issue. Bob Dole, the Republican presidential nominee, called for barring the children of illegal immigrants from attending schools. Pete Wilson seized on anti-immigrant proposals to spur his faltering presidential bid. And Pat Buchanan's motto may well have been "Don't give me your tired, your poor."
What a difference four years make. George W. Bush has denounced the Republicans' past anti-immigrant initiatives and boasts that he can speak Spanish, while Al Gore has even assayed a few stumbling words of Espanol. Not only that, Republican Party strategists have declared that Hispanics will be the soccer moms of this year's campaign. It's as if immigrants have been transformed Cinderella-like into the belles of the political ball. "There's been a remarkable turnaround," said Frank Sharry, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, an advocacy group for immigrants.
It is easy to see why. Democratic and Republican strategists agree that Hispanics may provide the swing votes in the four states -- California, New York, Texas and Florida -- which have large Hispanic populations and which, taken together, account for half the electoral votes needed to win the presidency.
While immigrants tend to vote in smaller percentages than other demographic groups, the number of Hispanic-American and Asian-American voters is growing fast, and so are their campaign contributions.
Immigrants are also increasingly valued by corporate America; were the nation's six million illegal immigrants expelled tomorrow, thousands of restaurants, hotels, farms, poultry plants and garment factories and gardening companies would be forced to close for want of workers. Some economists also believe that the nation's record economic boom may have already sputtered without immigrants to fill millions of jobs.
"There's no question that without the flow of immigrants, we would have hit much earlier the level at which we started to have wage inflation and that would have meant higher interest rates and that would have reduced the spectacular growth that we see," said Daniel Bachman, chief economist at Transatlantic Futures, a Washington-based research institute. His opinion is shared by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman.
This is not a low-wage, service economy phenomenon. The high-tech sector has asked that the annual quota for high-skilled immigrants be nearly doubled.
Unions, like many Republicans, viewed immigrants with suspicion. The A.F.L-C.I.O., for example, saw them as an economic fifth column that took away union jobs and depressed wages. Recently, however, it has called for a general amnesty for illegal workers. In economic boom times, with unemployment at 4 percent, these are potential union members.
"We no longer have a knee-jerk reaction that immigrants drag down the standard of living," said John Wilhelm, president of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union. "We, the labor movement, want to show we're on their side."
Surveys by the Public Policy Institute of California found that in 1994, 20 percent of Californians said immigration was the topic they most wanted politicians to talk about, while this year only 2 percent of Californians feel that way. "Whenever we're in boom periods, as we are today, people are more generous in their attitudes toward immigrants," sSaid Mark Baldassare, survey director at the California institute. "Immigration is not a very good wedge issue in the current economic climate," said Mark Baldassare, survey director at the California institute.
Republicans switched tacks after sifting through recent election returns. In 1996, 72 percent of Hispanic voters backed Bill Clinton, while 21 percent supported Bob Dole. And exit polls showed that in California's 1998 race for governor, 78 percent of Hispanic voters backed Gray Davis, the Democratic victor. Republican strategists were also startled that in California alone, 250,000 Mexican and Salvadoran immigrants became naturalized Americans and registered to vote in 1996 and 1997.
The record number of immigrants who have sought citizenship, registered to vote and then voted Democratic around the country in recent years is widely viewed as a backlash against Republican-backed, anti-immigrant policies. "The politics of immigrant bashing has backfired," said Harry Pachon, president of the Tomas Rivera Policy Institute, a research group in Claremont, Calif. This has made a small group of Republicans, led by Jack Kemp and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York, who spoke out against their party's nativist policies, look prophetic.
Democratic politicians risk being torn between Hispanic voters and the traditionally Democratic African-Americans, who often see them as competitors for jobs and political power. Nonetheless, with demographers projecting that Hispanics will replace African-Americans as the largest minority group in five years, the role of Hispanics in politics will undoubtedly grow.
"The Ellis Island immigrants of the early 1900's became a key part of the New Deal coalition that led to decades of dominance by the Democratic Party," said Mr. Sharry of the National Immigration Forum. "The new wave of immigrants is clearly up for grabs, and with the tight races for Congress and the White House, this fast-growing population can determine who dominates over the next few decades."

HEADLINE: PRIMARY ENDORSEMENTS;
John McCain and Al Gore

 BODY:
On Tuesday, New Yorkers, Californians and voters in nine other states have the unusual opportunity of participating in presidential primary elections that could be decisive in their parties' nominating contests. By the end of the day, it could be clear whether Gov. George W. Bush faces a prolonged battle from Senator John McCain on the Republican side and whether Vice President Al Gore has put an end to former Senator Bill Bradley's campaign for the Democratic nomination.
This page does not always endorse in the presidential primaries. We last did so in 1992. We believe dual pre-nomination endorsements are in order this year because of the competitiveness of the contests and because of the importance of the choices before our readers. These endorsements are also, in some sense, a tribute to the vigor and seriousness that the four candidates have brought to this campaign season. So with a bow of respect to all four for reviving public interest in the election process, we endorse Mr. McCain as the preferable candidate for the Republicans and Mr. Gore as our choice for the Democratic nomination.
 
The Leadership Test
 
 In their very different ways, each of these two men communicates a greater capacity for overarching presidential leadership than his opponent. Mr. McCain's potential proceeds from deeper knowledge about government and a commitment to reform as a guiding idea rather than a hastily adopted slogan. Mr. Gore, for his part, knows more about domestic and foreign issues than any candidate in either party, and his aura of confidence and readiness for command have intensified while Mr. Bradley's appetite for the job seems to have mysteriously diminished during the campaign.
We have clear disagreements with Mr. McCain on issues like abortion and gun control, as well as profound reservations about Mr. Gore's record on the Clinton-Gore campaign's fund-raising abuses in 1996. But real campaigns seldom present perfect choices. Therefore a nomination endorsement has to take into consideration the broad agenda of challenges that will face the next president and to reflect a reasoned judgment -- and sometimes even a leap of faith -- as to a candidate's ability to rise above ideology and past mistakes. The list of tests confronting the next president is a daunting one. It includes preserving peace and prosperity, improving education, health care and the environment, and healing the religious and racial divisions in American society. In their respective races, Mr. McCain and Mr. Gore are unequivocally the best choices to lead in these areas.
 
The Republican Race
Clearly, this point in the political calendar finds the Republicans with the more competitive race. While trailing in the important California contest, Mr. McCain is strong in New York and has the potential to prolong a healthy battle for the soul of the G.O.P. The party's leaders first looked to Mr. Bush as a modernizer who would end the damaging "culture wars" that led to President George Bush's defeat in 1992. The governor was presented initially as an inclusive moderate with a short but impressive record in Texas. He improved his state's schools and challenged the G.O.P. status quo by opposing Congressional attempts to balance the budget by punishing the poor.
But in fighting off his opponent, Mr. Bush has embraced a punitive hard-right agenda. After first challenging his party's Congressional leaders, he has made himself an instrument of their opposition to campaign finance reform. His ill-advised tax-cut proposal, miscues on foreign policy, opposition to gun control and vows to appoint anti-abortion Supreme Court justices have further dimmed his appeal.
If he does win the nomination, perhaps he could reclaim his original political persona as a more spacious kind of Republican who would be a uniter, not a divider. But the smarter course for Republicans would be to choose Mr. McCain, who would not have to be repackaged and repositioned when it comes to outreach and reform. He has a proven ability to get votes from the vital center of the American spectrum. He began with a vow to destroy the "iron triangle" of donations, lobbyists and legislation. He broke further with the Republican leadership to oppose Mr. Bush's outsized tax-cut scheme as too weighted toward the wealthy. Bravely, and perhaps foolishly, he became the first important Republican figure to challenge leaders of the religious right for intimidating the party with religious-based litmus tests.
This has led Beltway Republicans to launch a nonsensical effort to depict Mr. McCain as a false conservative. The charge is wrong on the facts. Mr. McCain has opposed gun control and abortion. In the foreign policy area, he has been one of the Clinton administration's toughest critics. Although we do not agree with many of these positions, we think Republican voters should judge him on his real record, not the falsified version being pushed by Mr. Bush's right-wing enforcers.
As a zestful insurgent battling to open his party, Mr. McCain has brought gusts of fresh air, excitement and common sense to American politics. Despite our differences with him on abortion and other important policies, we respect his politics of principle and his opposition to Congressional influence-peddling, and we recommend him to voters in the Republican primaries.
 
 The Democrats
The reality of the Democrats' battle is that Mr. Bradley is on the ropes. Only weeks ago, he seemed the likely beneficiary of primary voters' conflicted attitudes toward President Clinton. The leader who presided over the longest economic boom in American history and accomplished many progressive goals had also brought dishonor to the Oval Office. Mr. Gore could not be blamed for the singular lunacy of the Monica Lewinsky scandal. But he was tarnished by fund-raising fiascoes invoked by the very words "Buddhist temple" and "no controlling legal authority."
At first, Mr. Bradley seemed ready to capitalize on a general public impulse to turn the page. But after a promising start, he stumbled badly in regard to policy and performance. His ambitious health care proposal, the initial centerpiece of his campaign, was attractive, especially because of its goal of universal coverage. Yet he never effectively answered Mr. Gore's charge that he had underestimated the cost of his proposals and jeopardized Medicaid and Medicare. Even more striking, Mr. Gore's swarming debate style did not bring out the warrior in Mr. Bradley. Instead, the challenges made him seem petulant and remote.
Perhaps it was simply that the thoughtfulness and independence that marked Mr. Bradley's Senate service did not translate to the stump. Certainly his eloquence on race and his demands for higher ethical standards elevated the campaign. But the voters picked up on Mr. Bradley's lack of energy and on a certain emotional austerity in his connection with them. If overeagerness to please is a defect in Mr. Gore, Mr. Bradley possesses an even more disturbing inability to convey a real hunger for the opportunity to serve.
 
Al Gore's Potential
There is plenty to criticize in the style and substance of Mr. Gore's record. The Republicans are already planning to run videos of the Buddhist temple event, where Mr. Gore still insists he was shocked to find that money was being raised. In this campaign, he has exaggerated flaws in Mr. Bradley's record and been evasive about the evolution in his own position on abortion, guns and tobacco.
But Mr. Gore brings tremendous gifts to his quest for the White House. Most impressive to us, he communicates a passion to lead, a determination to leave a positive mark on history and a burning desire to step out of his mentor's shadow and prove that he possesses the self-control and presidential high-mindedness so lacking in Mr. Clinton. The Al Gore of today has a deep commitment to social justice, abortion rights and gun control. To make up for his fund-raising lapse in 1996, he promises that if elected he will make campaign finance reform one of the top half-dozen legislative priorities for his first year.
On foreign policy, the vice president is clearly the best-prepared candidate in this race. He is also his party's strongest leader on environmental protection and scientific progress. On issues ranging from preserving the Everglades to pushing for a global treaty on carbon dioxide emissions, he is the primary architect of Mr. Clinton's environmental legacy.
Widely ridiculed for asserting that he invented the Internet, Mr. Gore can actually take credit for seeing the digital world before most other political leaders. He promises to bring a grasp of science and technological advances to the White House at a time when a host of tough problems on everything from Internet privacy to genetic engineering will confront the nation. Finally, Mr. Gore's experience as a successful partner in making the right decisions on budget and fiscal issues, and in fighting a reactionary Congress to protect and even expand domestic programs, holds great promise for the future. Like Mr. Clinton, the vice president can be a maddening compromiser. But he has a strong internal compass and is more prepared for presidential responsibility than Mr. Clinton was in 1992 and than Mr. Bradley is today.
Our endorsements of Mr. McCain and Mr. Gore apply only to the nomination competitions of their parties. As always, we will wait until late in the general election campaign to make a final endorsement for the presidency. The fall campaign, of course, will provide another set of tests for the final two contestants. But every citizen should hope that the last months of this political year will be marked by the earnest effort that Al Gore, Bill Bradley, John McCain and George W. Bush brought to the primary season.

HEADLINE: THE NATION: Cross Purposes;
Mixing God and Politics And Getting Burned

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
FORTY years and 10 presidential elections ago, John F. Kennedy felt compelled to journey to a hostile conference of Protestant church leaders in Houston to plead that he would never serve as a vassal of the papacy if he were elected the nation's first Catholic president.
It was an ignominious moment for many of Mr. Kennedy's fellow American Catholics as the candidate, a decorated war veteran, had to pass Protestant muster and deal with the dregs of anti-immigrant, anti-Catholic bigotry rooted in the nativist prejudices of the 19th century Know-Nothing movement, when native born Protestants demanded voting, citizenship and education curbs on the alarming waves of Catholic immigrants. 
 In weathering the fire and winning the election, Mr. Kennedy gently cautioned the nation to oppose any attempt to distort the presidency by "making it an instrument of one religious group." His words survive as a prescription for all the nimble campaigners who have followed him through the risky, often treacherous field where politics and religion overlap.
This year, spurred by an unexpectedly contentious Republican primary, the nation is witnessing a 180-degree turn on the historic Kennedy confrontation. This time, it is a worried Protestant candidate from Texas, Gov. George W. Bush, who is now daily seeking out Catholic forums and photo ops, replete with church banners and Roman-collared clerics, to assure one and all his presidency would not be an instrument of a dominant religious group -- evangelical Protestantism.
"Isn't that a neat little parallel -- a nervous George Bush trying to reassure Catholics?" observed Kate O'Beirne, the Washington editor for The National Review. She is less amused by Senator John McCain's wielding of the religion issue in his tooth-and-claw nomination struggle with Governor Bush.
"It's a rare Catholic who even cares about Bob Jones University," Ms. O'Beirne said of the South Carolina evangelical college Senator McCain has strategically lambasted as an anti-Catholic bastion happily visited by Governor Bush. "It's shameless Catholic baiting," said Ms. O'Beirne, predicting a backlash of sorts against Mr. McCain among the significant blocs of Catholic voters expected to turn out this week in the mammoth Super Tuesday primary showdown.
Whether Mr. McCain wins or loses, it is clear he has let a red-white-and-blue genie out of the bottle and its recorking seems unlikely during the general election campaign this fall.
Democrats, fairly leering in delight, are recording every sling and arrow exchanged in the Republican primary. And for good reason. It was only six years ago that the Newt Gingrich revolution in the House alarmed Democrats with the fact that a Catholic majority of voters had shifted for the first time in decades from Democrats to Republicans on the House ballot. Before that, Catholics had split their ticket, voting, say, for President Ronald Reagan but then returning to their lunch-pail party roots.
But the Republicans' painful disarray over the role of the religious right -- a bloc that Mr. Reagan first tucked masterfully into the G.O.P. fold -- is giving Capitol Hill Democrats new hope. In the House, the McCain attack has caused Democrats to revive an earlier, largely overlooked flap in which charges of anti-Catholicism marred a bipartisan attempt to choose a new chaplain.
In the Senate, Democrats, hoping to sting Republicans in open floor debate, quickly offered broadside resolutions condemning Bob Jones University as segregationist and -- 40 years after candidate Kennedy -- even anti-pope.
"This is the one question of value that will outlast the primaries," promised Senator Robert Torricelli, the New Jersey Democrat who runs his party's Senate politcal campaign. "People are going to want to be heard on this, the possible alienation of Catholics just when many thought they were part of the Establishment," the senator added, contending that Governor Bush would be tarred with the issue into the general election.
OTHERS, however, think that Senator McCain "went one day too far" with his attack, in the words of Scott Appleby, a history professor at Notre Dame University. He noted that Mr. McCain used the word "evil" in a follow-up attack on the Rev. Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson, two politico-evangelical stalwarts, but then quickly had to retract it.
Mr. Appleby, the director of the Cushwa Center for the Study of American Catholicism, feels the senator "is failing to tap into a deeper level" of Catholic fear that is more a relic of history than descriptive of modern Catholics, who are not monolithic voters unless faced by an appalling instance of anti-Catholic bigotry. Mr. Bush just does not fill the bill, Mr. Appleby thinks.
It should be noted, too, that it was only after Mr. McCain was defeated in South Carolina and headed for states with broader, more diverse voter blocs, that he threw down the religious glove and singled out Mr. Robertson and Mr. Falwell as "agents of intolerance," betting that the muscle of the religious right has withered since President Reagan blended it into a coalition with post-Kennedy, blue-collar Catholics.
In Michigan, Mr. McCain first denied, then confirmed that his campaign phone-blitzed Catholic voters with reminders of Mr. Bush's Bob Jones appearance and of the school's policy against interracial dating, which it reversed Friday, and its history of anti-Catholic polemics, including descriptions of the Vatican as running a "Satanic system."
MR. McCAIN was, in some sense, merely stealing from the religious attack playbook of the Bush campaign in South Carolina.
"It was some of the worst of American politics I've seen," the political columnist Mark Shields said of attacks by pro-Bush organizations on Mr. McCain, in which some observers sensed wisps of anti-Semitism and other insults to pluralism.
The key question is how the McCain initiative will play out Tuesday in states like Ohio and New York, where there are significant numbers of voters who consider themselves Catholic. Will the bloc fears of the old post-immigration generation revive?
In Ohio, as other states, Catholics may be increasingly uneasy about the Bob Jones reports, says John C. Green, director of the Bliss Institute of Applied Politics at the University of Akron. But he emphasizes that Protestant evangelicals also see the issue as an attack on them and not, as Mr. McCain insists, solely on two performers on the nation's politico-religion circuit.
Indeed, exit polls in Virginia and interviews with many voters who identify themselves as religious conservatives suggest that Mr. McCain's remarks are mobilizing support for Governor Bush.
In any case, the issue of religion, as ever in American history, is putting as much fresh life into primary day as into the Bush campaign. "The running joke here," Mr. Green said, "is whether Governor Bush will join the Knights of Columbus by primary day."
Peter Quinn, a veteran New York political speechwriter and historical novelist, said: "McCain is blowing on some old embers and causing some smoke, but no real fire. I don't think George Bush is seen as anti-Catholic." Still, Mr. Quinn admitted he was intrigued by how much the Catholic vote might resonate Tuesday with candidate Kennedy's trial by dogma before the Protestant prelates.
The net effect of Senator McCain's attacks on the religious right were "politically disastrous," in the view of Mr. Shields. "He failed to distinguish the followers from the leadership, implying they'd been bamboozled," he said. "And in politics you never blame the customers."
Beyond questions of strategic advantage in the electoral wars, there lies the large gray area where voters' impressions of personal and civic morality overlap. There, the rancorous butting of politics and religion itself can become an issue as much as a spectacle for the voters.
John C. Green, director of the Bliss Institute of Applied Politics at the University of Akron, sounds decidedly unalarmed about this instance of boundary crossing. Whether in the year 2000 or 1900, "this is what campaigns do: they look for appeals that will work and look for groups that will move," he said.
But he noted that this election cycle "has an unusual amount of explicit references to religion." He pointed to the early and emphatic statements of Christian faith from Mr. Bush, Vice President Al Gore and many of their rivals. He thinks this may be due to voters, who are looking beyond the booming economy to wonder whether a rapidly changing culture, regularly troubled by news of its own lack of control, as seen in a lurid ongoing melange of shootings and scandal-ridden leaders, demands more avowedly moral politics and politicians.
They certainly are out there now on the stump. They are talking beliefs and charging hypocrisy, looking for advantage while promising the high road to voters already sensing the risk, amid the spectacle of once more mixing politics and religion.

New Interest in the Smokestacks

BYLINE: By MICKEY MEECE 

 BODY:
Smoke was once again visible from the stacks on Friday as Old Economy companies retook a leadership role that they had relinquished to New Economy technology companies of late.
 What prompted the rally of shares in companies like Dow Chemical, DuPont and Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing was a Labor Department report showing that 43,000 jobs were created in February, merely a fifth of what Wall Street economists had expected and the slowest pace in nine months. 
 The report eased concerns about a possible series of interest rate increases.
 What I'm seeing is a lot of old names coming back from the dead, and that's good, Charles Payne, head analyst at Wall Street Strategies, told Reuters.
 The Dow Jones industrials ended higher for five consecutive days for the first time since August, up 5 percent for the week, to 10,367.20. Those basic industry stocks had gotten totally whacked, Michelle Clayman of New Amsterdam Partners, told Reuters.
 But technology shares were not completely overlooked by investors. The Nasdaq composite continued its tear toward 5,000, ending the week up 7 percent, at 4,914.79. MICKEY MEECE

HEADLINE: INVESTING: DIARY;
A Psychiatric Theory On Irrational Exuberance

BYLINE: By RICHARD TEITELBAUM 

 BODY:
It is a truism that the stock market is a pendulum swinging between fear and greed. But what if there is no fear because investors are chock full of Prozac or other psychoactive drugs?
Perhaps stock prices and indexes like the Nasdaq composite, up 20.8 percent so far this year, could race to unprecedented valuations as investors' usual reactions to things like high price-earnings multiples and rising interesting rates are suppressed. 
 That is the hypothesis being floated by Randolph M. Nesse, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Michigan, in a recent essay posted on a Web site called Edge, (www.edge.org).
Dr. Nesse points out that prescriptions for psychoactive drugs rose to 233 million in 1998 from 131 million in 1988, with nearly 10 million filled last year for Prozac alone. Next, he considers the likelihood that a disproportionately high part of the population connected to the markets -- brokers and wealthy individuals, in particular -- are likely to be taking antidepressants.
And he says he has noted that certain of his patients who take such drugs seem to worry too little about real dangers. "This is exactly the mind-set of many current investors," he said.
Dr. Nesse said he did not want to belittle the positive effects that antidepressants may be having on the economy.
"They are productive employees," he said of workers taking such drugs.
"But if investor caution is being inhibited by psychotropic drugs, bubbles could grow larger than usual before they pop, with potentially catastrophic economic and political consequences," he said. "If chemicals are inhibiting normal caution in any substantial fraction of investors, we need to know about it."
On the other hand, if a "Prozac effect" on the markets is confirmed through further research, it might not necessarily be bad news for stocks. Only one-third of the population that could benefit from antidepressants is currently taking them, according to Dr. Nesse. So, presumably, the market has room to go higher.
(Full disclosure: Dr. Nesse said he was not currently invested in the market, having recently sold a position in a biotechnology stock, Affymetrix.)
In any case, Dr. Nesse is adamant that government-sponsored research into the topic is necessary. But he is not sure whether it should be carried out by the Securities and Exchange Commission or the National Institutes of Mental Health. RICHARD TEITELBAUM

HEADLINE: In Mexico, Nature Lovers Merit a Kiss From a Whale

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, March 4

 BODY:
Mexico learned this week that it cannot be half global.
After five years of pressure from an environmental movement that is every day more transnational, the government on Thursday canceled plans with the Mitsubishi Corporation of Japan to build a gigantic salt plant on the shores of a lagoon where gray whales give birth. 
It was a decision Mexico never expected to make when the battle began, back in the early stages of the country's broad opening to foreign commerce under the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement. Up to that time, Mexican leaders had been able to dismiss the complaints of foreign environmentalists as an intrusion into their national affairs.
But in the war for Laguna San Ignacio, a tranquil inlet in an unblemished Baja California desert, the nationalist arguments no longer packed any punch. And as Mexico received $11.6 billion last year in long-term investments from abroad, it also discovered that it cannot ignore the other forces, like the environmental movement, that are crisscrossing borders and making politics into a global game.
"It took a million people to do it," said Jacob Scherr, a director of the Natural Resources Defense Council, an American group that led the campaign, "but we showed that we can work together worldwide to compel even the largest corporations to respect nature."
Mexican and foreign conservationists united behind the campaign, organizing support from the humble Mexican fishing communities on the shores of the lagoon to the offices of several United States mutual funds that agreed to shun Mitsubishi stock. The crusade was waged over the Internet and in the press across North America.
Mitsubishi received at least 750,000 letters calling for it to scrap the project, and a boycott of its products was getting under way in California. Bus stops in Mexico City carry posters showing a regal fin rising above the lagoon's serene waters and asking riders if they want the whales to belong to "a corporation" or to humanity.
The Mexican government owns 51 percent of the salt company that proposed the salt plant and Mitsubishi owns 49 percent. The company already runs a big 50-year-old salt evaporation plant in another lagoon frequented by whales up the coast from San Ignacio.
If Mexico and Mitsubishi had gone forward with the new plant, they would have been permanently stuck with the image of profit-happy predators that the environmental movement had spun around them.
Environmentalists were aware that their victory did more than guarantee peaceful swimming for the whales at Laguna San Ignacio. It proved that they can be lead players on what has become an international stage.
President Ernesto Zedillo lashed out with uncharacteristic spleen this week when he announced the decision to dump the project. "Frankly, it infuriates me that some groups used this project to gain fame and even, I have to say it, to reap economic and political profits," he said.
Mexico's embrace of the global economy has forced it to be flexible on trade issues with the United States, on whose economic fortunes Mexico now depends more than ever. It has begun to observe international standards in human rights, another area that was once considered off-limits to foreign pressure.
But no issue has been as open to direct influence by international groups as environmental protection.
In this case, of course, the environmentalists had one ally whose charisma was irresistible: gray whales are among the most amiable of nature's creatures. Although they are more than 40 feet long, they oblige whale-watchers by raising their snouts very gently to be kissed.
Environmentalists quietly conceded that the threat to the whales might not be as great as the protest propaganda suggested. But Mr. Zedillo and Mitsubishi finally acknowledged that the enormous industrial plant could alter and befoul the pristine ecosystem of the lagoon and its desert surroundings in ways that no amount of human science could foretell or repair.
Mexico's success in international trade probably contributed to its willingness to step back from the $100 million investment and 200 jobs the salt plant promised. Mexican officials long contended that scrapping the project might discourage other investors, but it became clear that not even Mitsubishi would change its view of Mexico as a promising market.
No one was as surprised at the reversal as Homero Aridjis, the Mexican writer and conservationist who began the drive to stop the salt plant five years ago from the living room of his Mexico City home. Today he is at the center of a powerful international network. "It was a victory of nature over commerce," Mr. Aridjis said simply.

HEADLINE: Kuwait Hints At an Increase In Oil Output

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: KUWAIT, March 4

 BODY:
Kuwait gave its first official hint today that it might accept a formula to raise the oil supply after its oil minister welcomed the outcome of talks among three major exporters.
The oil minister, Sheik Saud Nasser al-Sabah, said in a statement that talks among Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Mexico this week were a step in the right direction "to safeguard oil market stability, guarantee supplies to consuming nations and avoid price fluctuations which harm all countries and global economic growth." 
 Saudi Arabia and Venezuela are members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Mexico is not.
The three oil ministers said after talks in London on Thursday that additional supplies were needed, but they did not say when producers would raise output or by how much.
Oil prices rose to a nine-year high on Friday after the assurances of extra production failed to calm worries over an increasingly tight gasoline market in the United States.
Sheik Saud, who had strongly supported extending an agreement to cut global oil output beyond its expiration when OPEC meets later this month, said Kuwait "seeks and supports any inclinations that lead to stabilizing prices in a fashion which serves the common interests of oil producing and consuming states."
Kuwait, which sits on 10 percent of the world's oil, is producing 1.837 million barrels of crude oil a day under the current agreement.
Bill Richardson, the United States energy secretary, said on Friday that he planned to meet Sheik Saud next week.
Mr. Richardson visited Kuwait last month to lobby for higher oil output to ease the rise in prices in the United States, the world's biggest oil consuming nation, before the summer driving season, when gasoline demand peaks.
Sheik Saud said in his statement today that oil prices had fallen over the last two years to below $10 a barrel and that this had had a grave impact on the economies of oil exporters. Kuwaiti crudes are currently selling for over $27 a barrel.

HEADLINE: Driven by Fear, Colombians Leave in Droves

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: CALI, Colombia, March 1

 BODY:
The long, chaotic line outside the government passport office here begins forming shortly after sunrise. By the end of the day, as has been the case every workday for more than a year, 800 to 900 passports will be issued to a multitude of Colombians eager to leave a country that has become one of the world's most lawless and violent. Many will be headed for the United States.
"Until the end of 1998, the high figure had been about 500 a day, and then only during the peak vacation season in July and August," said Colombia Medina, the passport department's weary director. "But we no longer have a high or slow season anymore, just a constant flow of people wanting to get out." 
 After four decades of civil conflict and a proliferation of guns and gangs, the forces driving Colombians to abandon their country are perhaps especially acute in this city of two million people, best known for its ruthless drug cartels. But the phenomenon is national, with people of every class leaving from small towns and rural areas as well as large cities.
By government estimates, 800,000 people -- 2 percent of Colombia's total population of 40 million -- have left the country in the last four years. The expectation is that the exodus has not yet reached its peak because the country's problems are no nearer a solution. And the prospect of a $1.6 billion, two-year aid package from the United States has not eased Colombians' anxieties.
Political violence continues to rise and left-wing guerrilla and right-wing paramilitary groups increasingly use kidnapping and extortion to finance their war with each other and the state. Colombia's murder rate is 10 times that of the United States, and last year 2,663 kidnappings were reported. Both rates, experts say, are the world's highest.
Such statistics, abstract as they are, have left the average citizen with a very real feeling that there is no longer a safe haven to be found anywhere on Colombian soil.
The raw numbers of people leaving are alarming enough, but because many of those exiting are highly educated professionals, including engineers, architects and doctors, the accelerating exodus has become a deep source of concern here.
"Colombia in its entirety has been transformed into a giant travel agency," Juan Fernando Cristo complained in a column in El Espectador, a major national daily. "Everyone seems disposed to emigrate, and nothing could be worse for the country than this growing phenomenon and the subsequent loss of human talent, productivity and earnings."
For many Cali residents, a turning point came last spring when a unit of one of the country's leftist guerrilla groups, the People's Liberation Army, raided a church during Sunday Mass and took more than 150 hostages for ransom.
In addition, guerrilla groups now operate at will in the surrounding countryside, setting up roadblocks, halting vehicles to check the identities of passengers, and, in a practice known in Colombian slang as "miraculous fishing," kidnapping those whose names appear in a laptop computer registry of the rich and prominent. Affluent neighborhoods of the city seem no safer: today, three teenagers were kidnapped on their way to an elite private school.
One man waiting in line for a passport this week was Luis Alberto Guevara, 28, a former investigator at the prosecutor's office here. He now works for an airport security company, but has obtained a visa that will allow him to move to Florida and do the same work there. The environment, he said, is certain to be "much calmer and less dangerous."
"The level of insecurity here is growing tremendously, and so our work becomes increasingly dangerous, with constant threats from all sides," he said. "I do not want my children to have to live through what we have lived through."
One prominent family recently began moving to Florida after suffering through three kidnappings of family members by guerrillas, paying a ransom each time. They are trying to liquidate their businesses and properties and shift the rest of their assets to the United States.
"I love this country, but the situation has become unbearable," said a family member who is still here, coordinating the transfer and who spoke on condition of anonymity because of fears that he too could be kidnapped. "Anyone with a decent economic situation is trying to get out because no matter how many ransoms you pay, you are never fully vaccinated against the guerrillas, and the police or even private security can provide no protection."
The affluent are not the only ones giving up. Working-class Colombians are also leaving in growing numbers. Armando Berenguez, 32, a taxi driver, is going to Spain, leaving his wife and 10-year-old child behind until he can find a job "at a hotel or in construction or anything that is honest" and a place for his family to live.
"You don't dare take a fare out past the city limits here anymore because the guerrillas will stop you at one of their roadblocks and kidnap you and your passenger and take your car," he said when asked why he was leaving. "It happens all the time to people I know, and when you've had your car taken from you like that, there is no way you can make a living."
Some of those leaving are unemployed and would ordinarily be regarded as economic immigrants. But they are quick to reject that label, pointing out that the recession Colombia is currently living through, its worst in 70 years, has its origins in the guerrilla conflict, which has intensified in recent years as efforts to find a settlement have deadlocked.
"The rich are getting themselves and their money out of the country as fast as they can, and the guerrillas keep on bombing power pylons and oil pipelines, which makes the foreign companies afraid to invest here," said Juan Carlos Rios, 28, an electrician about to head for the Netherlands Antilles. "That means there is no work for people like me, and we become victims of a crisis we did not create."
In an effort to curb the drug trafficking profits that allow the guerrillas to buy weapons, recruit fighters and maintain a huge network of informants, the Clinton administration is proposing a $1.6 billion two-year emergency aid package for Colombia. But that plan too seems to be contributing to the jitters that are driving Colombians abroad.
"If things are this bad now, what is going to happen when all the gringo money gets here?" asked Juan Pablo Robles, 34, a technician who is about to go to Spain. "The whole country is going to become a war zone."
According to the United States Embassy in Bogota, Colombians are seeking entry to the United States at a record rate: 366,423 applied for nonimmigrant visas last year, compared with 150,514 in 1997. About three-quarters of the requests for nonimmigrant visas and just over half of the 11,345 applications for immigrant visas were granted last year, embassy records indicate.
The preferred destinations of Colombians fleeing to the United States are said to be Miami, New York City and parts of New England. Large Colombian immigrant communities are already well established there and newcomers can hope to be received warmly.
"Going to the United States remains the dream of most of those who are leaving," said Ms. Medina, the passport official. "But getting an American visa can be a real problem, so a lot of people are also going to Spain" or to nearby countries like Costa Rica, which does not require visas of Colombians.
Applications for political asylum in the United States, while still small in absolute terms, have also begun to rise, as has the approval rate for such claims, according to Immigration and Naturalization Service figures. In the last quarter of 1999, the agency received 396 political asylum requests from Colombians, compared with 334 in the previous 12 months, and the approval rate rose from 19 percent in 1998 to 46 percent by the end of last year.
According to the Colombian agency that oversees immigration matters, at least 565,000 Colombians, or one of every five travelers, who left the country from 1996 to 1998 did not return. Final figures for 1999 are still being compiled, but government officials say everything points to a sharp increase in the rate of departure.
Picking up on the trend, the newspaper El Tiempo recently published what it called "an inventory of reasons not to leave for the United States." These ranged from "You really have to stop completely at stop signs" and "There are not as many holidays," to even more fanciful considerations like "The natives do not know how to dance either salsa or merengue."
Just a decade ago, "the extraditable leaders of the drug cartels said they preferred 'a tomb in Colombia to a jail cell in the United States,' " the newspaper reminded its readers. But "many Colombians today prefer any space whatsoever in the colossus of the north to a moral, physical, psychological, or employment tomb here in our own country."

HEADLINE: End to Social Security Penalty Welcomed by Companies and Their Workers

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN with LESLIE WAYNE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 4

 BODY:
At the McDonald's Corporation in Oak Brook, Ill., the oldest workers, those 65 to 69, scrutinized their paychecks as the end of each year approached. When their accumulated wages neared a magic number, $15,500 last year, many resigned. "A senior would sadly say, 'I can't afford to work here anymore,' " said Walt Riker, the company spokesman.
As McDonald's workers went, so went Emily Galvenz, 68, of Miami, out walking in a park on Thursday. "That was one of the reasons I never took a full-time job after I retired," said Ms. Galvenz, who works part-time managing a beauty salon. "It just hurts to give money like that away to the government." 
 Chances are that from now on, Ms. Galvenz and the McDonald's employees will be able to work and earn as much as they like -- with the enthusiastic blessings of their employers.
Spurred by election-year politics and complaints from employers scrambling to find enough workers to help them keep the boom alive, the House voted 422 to 0 on Wednesday to purge the Social Security laws of a relic of the Depression.
For decades, the provision has reduced the benefits of workers ages 65 through 69 for every dollar they earned over $17,000. At the time it was enacted, the law was designed to move older workers aside in favor of younger ones.
The Senate and President Clinton are widely expected to go along, and the bill they are considering would be retroactive, to the start of this year.
Across virtually every sector of the economy, the initiative is receiving enthusiastic acclaim, reflecting the now-rare unanimity among lawmakers of both parties on Capitol Hill. With the sole possible exception of the leadership of organized labor, which has yet to take a position, this is one of those exceptional government initiatives that hardly anyone faults publicly.
But while saying the overall effects should be positive for workers, their employers and the economy, some experts in workplace management say it creates new challenges for employers in managing older work forces and, once the economy stalls, in dispensing of those who have lost their edge. Increasingly, they say, retirement is becoming a matter of negotiation, requiring new flexibility in setting workers' schedules and benefits.
"I think many corporations will look to phased retirement," said John Woyke, principal of Towers Perrin, a human resources consulting firm in New York. "In the typical job -- especially in the service economy where people aren't constrained by their muscles -- we do not see a decline in ability at age 65." And in this tight job market, he said, "we will see a definite number of initiatives to encourage people to stay longer."
Under current law, older workers are docked $1 in Social Security benefits for every $3 they earn above a limit the government sets -- rising to $17,000 for this year from $15,500. The repeal means little for those who earn less than $17,000. At $20,000 in wages, the worker loses $1,000 in benefits. And at about $68,000, the worker loses it all, up to $17,196 a year.
"It's just unambiguously a good thing," said Gary Burtless, labor economist at the Brookings Institution in Washington. At the point at which workers start losing Social Security benefits, he said his research has shown, they simply stop work because they see themselves paying an additional tax on top of all their other taxes. "It's just a pure bad tax," Mr. Burtless said.
Evelyn Morton, a lobbyist for the AARP, calls it "good labor policy, good social policy and good economic policy." Bruce Josten, executive vice president of the United States Chamber of Commerce, said, "Everyone's running out of workers. Anything that will ameliorate that problem is useful."
The nation's biggest retailer, Wal-Mart Stores, is also one of its biggest employers, with 885,000 workers in the United States. The company does not know how many are older than 65, but it says 134,000 are over 55.
Most Wal-Mart employees earn low wages, less than $10 an hour. But when they do cross the $17,000 annual threshhold, or about $8.30 an hour for a full-time job, the penalty kicks in at the end of the year.
"This House vote will mean a lot to them and it will make us happy too," said Tom Williams, a Wal-Mart spokesman.
The repeal also pleases a company where workers earn vastly more than at Wal-Mart -- the Lockheed Martin Corporation in Bethesda, Md., the giant defense contractor. There, older professional workers routinely earn more than $68,784 a year, the point at which the $1-for-$3 formula wipes out their entire Social Security benefit. Restored, the benefit comes as a significant bonus.
"It might cause people with deep experience to stay longer," said James Fetig, a Lockheed spokesman. After Lockheed experienced a series of rocket launch failures, Mr. Fetig said, an analysis showed that one reason was that too many "mature, first generation" rocket scientists had left the company in the mergers and downsizings of recent years.
At General Mills in Minneapolis, one of the nation's oldest big companies, Michael Peel, the vice president for human resources, says the company has "lots and lots" of employees who are in their 60's and 70's.
"We view it as irreplaceable talent," Mr. Peel said. "And given the demographic crunch in out country and the scarcity of intellectual capital," the repeal of the earnings limitation "will have a beneficial impact" on the company's efforts to hold onto those workers.
Jana Weatherbee, spokeswoman at I.B.M., said, "The basic point is that we want the skills that will win in the marketplace, and these skills come across in all ages."
These days, at least, concerns about whether workers' performance declines with age appears not to be an issue, or at least not one that employers openly discuss. With the job market so tight, consultants say employers have an incentive to retrain workers with expiring skills, or move them to jobs where they can be more productive.
In addition, they say, employers have another reason for holding on to the workers they have even if the economy slows: the baby-boom population is moving into its 50's, and far fewer younger workers are coming up behind them.
"When a corporation wants to get rid of its work force it has no problem doing it," said William Goldberg, partner in charge of personal financial planning in the Houston office of KPMG, the consulting firm. "It is just the opposite in this tight labor market."
At universities, where complaints of doddering tenured professors have become commonplace, administrators say they doubt that the ending the earnings limitation will have much to do with the professors' choices to stay or move on.
"Individuals, either at the faculty or at the staff level, at that age level, at that age bracket, view working for the university as a calling," said Sheldon Steinbach, general counsel at the American Council on Education, which represents 1,800 public and private colleges and universities.
"And as a profession," Mr. Steinbach said, "rather than as a job. And to the best of my understanding, no individual in the past, present or future, viewed the cap as an impediment or a stricture on their desire to continue to work."
But for workers in other fields, the repeal is likely to achieve just what employers and lawmakers hope in expanding the labor force.
In Massachusetts, Homer May of Sagamore Beach, who turned 65 in June, said he would not let the repeal thwart his plans to retire soon from his job as a mechanical piping designer. "We want to go places and do things," he said.
But he also plans to work, part-time, until he reached the earnings limit of $17,000. "My cap was like four days a month," he said, "and this will give me the opportunity to be a little more flexible."
His friend and fellow piping designer, Robert Flaherty, of Quincy, Mass., turned 65 on Wednesday, and he has no plans yet to slow down or retire. "But the concern about making the money and losing the Social Security was down the line."
"I knew people," Mr. Flaherty said, "who worked for me some years ago when the limit was $7,000, and they would work until three in the afternoon, and they would leave because they didn't want to lose any Social Security money."

HEADLINE: U.S. Planning Tough Rules For Growing Organic Food

BYLINE: By MARIAN BURROS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 4

 BODY:
More than two years after the federal government's first effort to define and regulate organic food failed to win public approval, the Department of Agriculture is announcing much tougher rules that prohibit the use of genetically modified ingredients in products carrying the organic label. The rules also prohibit the use of irradiation to decontaminate the products and the application of sewage sludge as fertilizer.
The rules, to be announced within a few days, could take effect by the end of the year. 
 Of the more than 275,000 comments received in response to the original proposal in 1997, virtually all of them opposed those three processes, which the Agriculture Department had considered allowing.
The new rules indicate an about-face in the department's attitude toward organic farming and represent one of several steps it is taking to help the small and medium-sized farmers who have mainly been ignored or even discriminated against by the agency for decades.
The national standards could help American producers sell organic food abroad.
"This could turn out to be the most important rule U.S.D.A. has issued in 20 years," said Dr. Margaret Mellon, of the Union of Concerned Scientists, an environmental advocacy group. "The Agriculture Department's policies have made small farmers an endangered species. Now it is trying to construct a system to allow small farmers to help them survive, to help them flourish. It is also a turning point in its relationship to consumers. The agency has never before been responsive to consumers' desires or demands."
In an interview, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said that if the public thought the standards were too strict they should let the department know during the 90-day comment period before the agency enacts the final rules. "I'd rather go from too strict standards and ease them than going the other way," Mr. Glickman said.
After initially ignoring many of the recommendations of the National Organic Standards Board, which had been set up to help the agency formulate the regulations, the Agriculture Department has now taken all of the board's advice, including total prohibition of antibiotics in animals raised as organic.
When Congress passed the Organic Foods Production Act in 1990, sales of organic food had reached $1 billion: projected sales for 1999 are $6.46 billion.
Under the new rules, raw products could carry the federal agency's organic seal on the front of packaging if they were 100 percent organic, meaning that they are grown and manufactured without the use of added hormones, pesticides or synthetic fertilizer.
Processed food made from at least 95 percent organic ingredients could also carry the seal. And processed food containing at least 50 percent organic ingredients could be labeled "made with organic ingredients."
Irradiation, genetic modification and the use of sludge would be prohibited not only in the organic ingredients but in the conventional ingredients in foods made partly with organic ingredients.
Products with less than 50 percent organic ingredients may use the word organic only in the list of ingredients; the prohibition against those three processes would not apply.
Advocates of organic farming say that the standards have set the bar very high for organic farmers in the United States, possibly discouraging them from growing organic crops.
"The document is certainly much closer to meeting industry expectations than the first one but the pendulum may have swung too far," said Katherine DiMatteo, executive director of the Organic Trade Association. "I am afraid that some people are not going to bother to be organic anymore."
One of the areas of concern that has been left vague in the new rules is how to treat organic crops that have been contaminated with drift from nearby genetically engineered crops. An Agriculture Department official said a farmer would not be penalized if some low level of inadvertent contamination occurred.
As part of a larger effort to help the more than 12,000 organic farmers, the administration's budget for the first time includes a $5.5 million request for organic research. In addition, the Agriculture Department has a pilot project for crop insurance for organic farmers.
"We need economic avenues for small- and medium-size farms," Mr. Glickman said. The public can send comments to the Agriculture Department on the Internet at www.ams.usda.gov/nop, or by mail.

HEADLINE: SHADES OF BLUE: A special report.;
Diallo Case Yields More Nuanced View of Police

BYLINE: By GINGER THOMPSON and C. J. CHIVERS 

 BODY:
None of the facts have changed in the year since Amadou Diallo died in his doorway: four white police officers, 41 bullets and one unarmed black man. But in neighborhoods from one end of the city to the other, away from the daily protests over the slain man and the political posturing, New Yorkers' attitudes about the police have begun a subtle shift.
It is reflected in the deeply divided relationship that Jude Mignon, a barber in Brooklyn, has with the police. Mr. Mignon, 32, an owner of the Chocolate City Barber Shop and Cafe in Crown Heights, said that officers from the local precinct regularly stopped in to chat, and that their presence had been good for business. 
 But at night, he said, the police seem more like a rude gang in sweatshirts and jeans. A couple of times while walking home from work, Mr. Mignon said, he has been stopped by plainclothes officers, pushed against a wall and frisked.
Striking a pose with his arms outstretched to display his baggy clothes and cascading dreadlocks, Mr. Mignon said: "To look at me, you wouldn't know if I sold drugs or owned a business. But if you are from this community, you would know who I am."
He went on: "I don't hate all cops. Some of them are real cool to me. But some have too much power."
In the year since the storm of police bullets in the Soundview section of the Bronx, New York has been racked with noisy confusion from protests over police brutality, high-profile warnings against the dangers of an anti-police backlash and the spectacle of a public trial. Yet interviews with nearly 100 people in three boroughs last week show that the public furor over the case masks signs of a complex new consensus.
Despite the angry clamor, or maybe because of it, some New Yorkers say they have a fresh sense of the perils of police work. And it appears that the Police Department, besieged by community complaints, has redoubled its efforts to focus on outreach as well as arrests.
In nearly 100 interviews a year ago, soon after Mr. Diallo was killed, the mood of the city was darker. New Yorkers of all races said they worried about police aggression, and many residents -- blacks in particular -- expressed their distrust with palpable bitterness.
With the acquittal of the four officers on Feb. 25, that distress continues. Conversations were conducted last week in the neighborhoods along the No. 2 subway line, which threads its way though a variety of economic and ethnic neighborhoods, including housing projects in the North Bronx and a youth center in Flatbush, Brooklyn; an atrium cafe on Wall Street and a public park in Harlem; a hangout for black professionals in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, and a leather boutique in the West Village. Those talks showed that there was still deep anxiety across the city over the death of Mr. Diallo and the acquittal of the four officers who fired the fatal barrage.
White New Yorkers -- bankers on Wall Street, commuters at Pennsylvania Station and retirees in the West Village -- said they were stunned that the four officers had been acquitted, and they worried aloud about increasing racial tension. Blacks and Latinos in wealthy and working-class neighborhoods vehemently criticized both the acquittals and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's unwavering support of the police, saying that those had magnified their anger and deepened their fear.
"It's not getting any better," Robert Ali, 48, said while people-watching at the Fulton Street Mall in Brooklyn. "After something bad happens, the healing will start, but then there is another episode. So you have to ask yourself, 'Are things really going to change?' "
When pressed, however, to reflect on their own experiences with the police and their overall feelings about the department, rancor for some would give way, allowing a mixture of feelings to surface. Comments from very few people reflected the tone of the Rev. Al Sharpton, who has referred to the police as some kind of occupying force. And very few espoused Mr. Giuliani's staunch defense of the police.
Most attitudes fell in a conflicted place between those two poles. After speaking for several minutes about how upset she felt over the Diallo shooting, Kirsten Levingston, a lawyer, concluded that she could come to no conclusion about her feelings toward the police.
"I actually do have a complex view of the police," said Ms. Levingston, an African-American and mother with one child, who lives in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn. "It's both, 'I feel for you, you have a tough job,' mixed with 'You need to be more respectful and decent to the people you are serving.' "
A year ago, shortly after Mr. Diallo had been buried in Guinea, his homeland, The New York Times interviewed an equally broad group of New Yorkers. The aim, then as now, was to learn how people viewed their growing police force as the city neared the end of a renaissance decade marked by plummeting crime rates.
Whites who were interviewed then expressed sharp interest in and concern over the way Mr. Diallo died, even though many said they could not imagine something like that ever happening to them. In them, the shooting stirred frustrations over strict, some said rude, enforcement of petty matters like leash and traffic regulations.
Faint echoes of those feelings were heard in interviews with whites last week, but many acknowledged that their interest in the case had waned and that the police had returned to being an invisible part of their world.
Anthony Pommes said his attitudes about the police had evolved over the last year. Mr. Pommes, a 27-year-old book publicist, said that immediately after Mr. Diallo was killed, he worried that the police were using "horrific force" to fight crime. Now, he says, he has a "more balanced" view of the police.
"They have a job to do, and it is a hard job," Mr. Pommes said while waiting at Pennsylvania Station for a train home to Long Island. "Sometimes they do it well, and sometimes they make mistakes."
Another Long Islander at the station, Sherry Gellis of Lynbrook, said: "I do not think police do things carelessly. I think they can become unnerved, like most human beings."
Blacks and Latinos remain more on edge. A year ago, in the fury over the shooting of Mr. Diallo, many spoke in bitterly hostile tones about the police presence in their communities, with almost no positive reflections.
And the acquittal of the four officers dredged up those same deep strains of anger and distrust that linger in minority communities like East Flatbush and the Frederick Douglass Housing Projects on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, where people feel unfairly targeted by crime-fighting strategies that rely on waves of street searches.
Stopping to chat in the North Bronx, Sgt. Richard Rodriguez of the Marine Corps Reserve, a Persian Gulf war veteran, said that as a military man, he was ashamed of the behavior of the New York police.
"I've been halfway around the world," Sergeant Rodriguez said. "I've lived with police in North Carolina and in California. And the police department here, I'd say 50 percent are foul."
As Shikwan Galliego, a security guard, entered the Hoyt Street subway station in Brooklyn, he said more aggressive police tactics had taken too large a toll on communities like his.
"I don't think we should have to put up with cops harassing us so that we can have less crime," he said, clutching the hand of his 2-year-old son. "They are supposed to stop criminals, not anybody who's black."
But in more than a few of the neighborhoods visited last week, people did not speak of the Police Department as monolithic. What emerged from their experiences with the police was the image of a Jekyll-and-Hyde agency with two distinct personalities.
One is embodied by the uniformed beat officer, whose attributes were best described by a group of giggling teenagers outside Clara Barton High School in Crown Heights. Shivering in the chilly breeze, the girls said officers from the nearby precinct station house visited their school and some played basketball with them after classes.
Sharisse Hewitt, 17, said she had seen the officers help lost children get home. Eimy Aguilar, 15, said the police had restored security to the apartment building where she lives. "They are there 24-7 trying to get the drugs out," she said.
And Jermaina Howard, 16, said that she once approached an officer on the street to ask about becoming a police officer and found him enthusiastic and helpful.
The other part of the Police Department, specialized units, are the centerpiece of Commissioner Howard Safir's crime-fighting strategies. In some operations, the department flushes the street with plainclothes officers to sweep out guns and drugs. Others use small plainclothes squads to root out a suspect.
The officers who shot Mr. Diallo were part of the Street Crime Unit, and Officer Louis Rivera, who shot and killed another Bronx man last week, was also on special detail.
The newest such units, organized under the name Operation Condor, have already made more than 13,500 arrests since they started in mid-January, according to department records. There are no figures on how many people were stopped and frisked to reach such arrest figures.
But on the streets, where the units are notorious, most minority residents interviewed last week had been stopped and searched at least once or knew someone who had.
K. Lee Johnson, a 28-year-old musician and producer for Big East Entertainment in Harlem, has had an angry encounter with the special units. He recalled a time last November in Queens when three plainclothes officers descended upon him from an unmarked car and frisked him, saying they were looking for guns.
"I felt humiliated," Mr. Johnson recalled. "I felt I had no right to walk the streets."
While the experience left him shaken, he has also watched his neighborhood become safer and more vibrant because of the police. When asked how he felt about them, he gave an answer that mixed appreciation with disdain.
"Crime has cleaned up," he said. "You can walk down the street and feel secure. You know they are on the beat and looking out for your safety."
Then, he added: "But in the same manner, you're afraid of cops. You never know what a cop will do when he approaches."
Those kinds of conflicted experiences and feelings about the police were expressed by numerous people who live and work along the path of the No. 2 subway.
At the southern end of the line, in Flatbush, Derrick Dawson, 31, runs recreational programs for about 200 youths at the neighborhood Y.M.C.A. On Feb. 25, shortly after the four officers were acquitted of murdering Mr. Diallo, Mr. Dawson was expecting the youths to gather for their weekly "teen night." He said he thought seriously about canceling, thinking that tempers could flare. Instead, he decided to let the teenagers come and vent.
Crammed into the small auditorium, he said, they were silent at first. But slowly, the trickle of angry questions turned into a flood. He said the teenagers asked how it was possible that the officers could be acquitted on all charges in the Diallo shooting. They wondered what it meant for their own safety. They wondered whether there was anything they could do to protect themselves from the people who are supposed to be protecting them. They wondered whether they could really trust the police.
Mr. Dawson said he reminded the angry group about the officers who had become friends, who had helped teenagers stay out of trouble, who play basketball in Y-leagues, who participate in career seminars.
"I think more than anything, the reason the kids did not do anything that night was because they have relationships with police officers," said Mr. Dawson, who was born and raised in the neighborhood. "I don't think the kids think all police are bad, they just felt betrayed."
As soon as possible, he said, he wants to arrange for officers from the local precinct to visit the center and speak directly to the teenagers there.
"You have to understand. We have Latin Kings. We have Crips. We have Bloods. We have all the gangs," he said, "but we tell the kids when you walk through that door leave your colors outside.
"We want this to be a safe haven for the kids," he said. "And we want them to keep their positive relationship with the police."
To the north along the subway line, near the Atlantic Avenue stop, there is a laid-back crowd of black professionals at Lucian Blue. Wayne Rambharose, the owner, said he opened the restaurant and bar, with soft yellow walls and votive candles, because he wanted to bring a bit of SoHo to the black middle-class neighborhood.
Mr. Rambharose, 37, looked the image of cool, wearing glasses with blue-tinted lenses the size of quarters. He has never been hassled by the police, he said. In fact, his relations with officers have been pretty good. But the shooting of Mr. Diallo and the acquittal of the officers shattered his attitude about the police.
"There is a really, really unhealthy atmosphere in New York right now," he said. "It's not even a racial thing anymore, with whites against blacks. But there is a divide between police and all the rest of us."
He blamed the mayor for much of the atmosphere.
"He has never made an effort to embrace blacks," Mr. Rambharose said. "There's never been any extension of an olive branch, and this is a time when that is needed."
At the other end of the bar, Emmett Devon Harrell struggled to reconcile his anger over the verdicts with his positive feelings toward the police.
He acknowledged that he was a product of the prosperous times of the last several years in New York, times that allow more and more young men to spend $450 on the leather jackets he designs. But, he said, the shooting of Mr. Diallo and the acquittals were like a reality check.
"When it really comes down to it, whites still have all the power, and we have none," said Mr. Harrell, who is black, "no matter how successful we may think we are."
Still, he found it hard to summon rage against the police.
"I believe they all have good intentions," he said. "It's just that some of them let their egos get in the way."
At the foot of Manhattan, three young men who work for a Wall Street bank sat and discussed their feelings about the case.
Brian McWilliams, 31, who is white, said he had "negative feelings" because he believes that the police are rude and arrogant with white suspects, and racist in their dealings with black suspects. The Diallo shooting, he said, supports that.
But not to Dom Romano, his 27-year-old white colleague. He said he thought the police in New York had done well in lowering crime, and he saw the Diallo shooting as an honest mistake.
"In that neighborhood, if I was a white cop and I saw a black guy reach in his back pocket, I'd be on edge," he said. "You hate to stereotype, but I can definitely understand why they were afraid."
On the Upper West Side, near 72nd Street, Anita L. Halton, a 21-year-old white woman, waited with friends for the start of their jazz dance class. She said she was almost oblivious to the police. "I actually feel very ignored by the police," she said with a shrug. "It's almost an invisible force to me."
But the police presence at the north end of the No. 2 line has changed the landscape, in ways good and bad. Parks are not littered with syringes, and mothers say they are less afraid to let their children play outside.
Cavan E. Sherland, 32, a barber in the Williamsbridge section of the Bronx, said he got regular courtesy visits from the police in the neighborhood and was reassured by their presence. But he does not recognize the officers who have stopped him for questions after he locks up at night. And what is worse, he said, the officers do not know him.
When asked how he feels about the police, he shrugged and said, "You have good cops, and you have bad cops."

HEADLINE: U.S. Proposes Rules to Help House Buyers

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 3

 BODY:
The federal government has proposed new rules that would make it easier for low-income house buyers to qualify for mortgage loans, a move intended to help blacks and other minorities buy houses.
The proposed rules from the Department of Housing and Urban Development would require two of the largest housing finance companies in the country, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, to increase the percentages of overall loans that they offer to lower-income families from the current standard of 42 percent to 48 percent in 2000 and to 50 percent in 2001. 
 The companies would be required over the next 10 years to buy $2.4 trillion in mortgages from banks and other lenders to assist the 28 million American families with low and moderate incomes. Many of those families are minorities, housing officials said.
"This rule will greatly expand the supply of affordable housing across the country," said Housing Secretary Andrew M. Cuomo.
The companies buy mortgages for homes and apartment buildings from banks, savings and loans and other mortgage lenders, and package and sell the loans to investors. When Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae buy mortgages from lenders, they provide the lenders with cash to issue new mortgages.
Under the higher goals, the companies would buy an additional $488.3 billion in mortgages over the next 10 years for seven million more low- and moderate-income families. The new mortgages would be added to the $1.9 trillion in mortgages for about 21 million families that would have been helped by the current standards.
Mr. Cuomo said that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were cooperating with federal regulators on this issue. The Housing Department said it was reviewing fair-lending practices at Fannie Mae. The two companies can do more, Mr. Cuomo said, and that led to the elevated goals.
Under federal rules, families have low or moderate incomes if they make no more than the median income for their communities. Median incomes vary from area to area, but the national average is $47,800.
Because of the booming economy, officials said, some people were being priced out of the housing market, creating a dichotomy in who owned homes. Seventy-three percent of whites owned their homes, compared with 45 percent of Hispanics and 46 percent of blacks.
"That is the gap we have to close," Mr. Cuomo said in an interview.
The initiative, in addition to helping low- and moderate-income families, would increase affordable housing loans for families with low incomes (less than 80 percent of the area median) and very low incomes (less than 60 percent of the area median). Assistance for rural areas and cities would also be included in the proposed rule.
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac fall under federal oversight because they receive special exemptions from Congress from all state and local taxes except property taxes and from Securities and Exchange Commission registration requirements.
The requirements for mortgage purchases were last set in 1995. The goals were up for renewal this year, as required by Congress. The housing administration could have lowered the goals or have left them unchanged. After a 60-day public comment period, a final rule is expected in the fall.

HEADLINE: New Flood Aid to Mozambique, and Some Complaints

BYLINE: By RACHEL L. SWARNS 

DATELINE: MAPUTO, Mozambique, March 4

 BODY:
Today's headline in the daily newspaper Noticias hit a nerve: "West Closes Its Eyes to Tragedy in Mozambique."
Next week, eagerly awaited American and British military helicopters will start searching for those still stranded by devastating floods and hauling food and medical supplies to the hundreds of thousands of people left homeless. 
 But while government officials and relief workers have applauded the imminent arrival of the 10 helicopters, 6 fixed-wing planes and hundreds of soldiers, other people in Mozambique are complaining that the outside world took too long to respond to the crisis here.
By the time the aircraft and soldiers start flying, virtually all of the people trapped in trees and on rooftops will already have been saved. And the flood waters of the Limpopo and other rivers have started to recede, officials said today.
The government, which had issued an urgent appeal for what it now says was a low target of $65 million, has received only about $40 million, officials said today. And on Friday, Leonardo Simao, the foreign minister, bluntly told reporters that he believed that the delays in assistance had resulted in unnecessary deaths. No one knows exactly how many people have died but relief agencies estimate the toll in the thousands.
"If the response had been more quick, I believe more lives could have been saved," Mr. Simao said after meeting in South Africa with ministers from South Africa, Zimbabwe and Botswana. "I believe the inertia of bureaucracy is evident."
American officials, who have already committed more than $11 million to the relief effort, say they responded as quickly and efficiently as possible. No one -- not the Mozambican government, nor the relief workers on the ground -- expected the flood waters to rise so dramatically on the weekend of Feb. 26.
And there is no question that the assistance from the United States and Britain is still desperately needed and welcomed. Mozambique is still struggling to distribute food, shelter and medicine to nearly one million people who have lost houses, food supplies or livelihoods and to rebuild this country's infrastructure.
But the debate does highlight the simmering resentment felt by many government officials and relief workers across Africa who say the powerful nations of the world often fail to act as urgently here as elsewhere.
Mozambique has no choice but to rely on outsiders for help. The country, which before the floods was expected to have one of the world's fastest growing economies, is still very poor, with an average per capita annual income of about $152. And the army has only about 6,000 low-paid, poorly-trained soldiers and a handful of helicopters, which often lack parts, maintenance and fuel, Western observers say.
Neighboring South Africa, which was experiencing its own floods, sent 7 of its 100 military helicopters for the worst of the crisis. "We did all we could," said Sam Mkhwanzi, a spokesman for the South African Defense Ministry.
The situation was also complicated by the changing nature of the disaster itself. The first floods started in mid-February. By Feb. 26, most people thought the worst was over.
The United States sent in six disaster-assessment experts and donated about $630,000 for food, emergency health centers and logistical support. Relief agencies began to send emergency crews home.
"The first phase of the floods was coming to a relatively satisfactory end at the end of last week," said Ross Mountain, the United Nations' special envoy to Mozambique. "Then last weekend, the skies opened in Zimbabwe and South Africa. This came down the river and that's when this much greater challenge arose."
The appeals went out to the world last weekend and by midweek the United States had pledged helicopters, troops and more money.
Some relief workers and government officials argue that the United States and Britain could have done more to get their helicopters in sooner. The role of Portugal, the colonial ruler of Mozambique until 1975, also came under fire, particularly because Lisbon currently holds the presidency of the European Union, normally a source of disaster aid.
But Mr. Mountain says he believes that the world contributed what it could. "One can always say we must do better," he said. "But I think countries and governments have moved pretty quickly."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL: NOTEBOOK;
For Piniella, One Year at a Time

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

DATELINE: PEORIA, Ariz., March 4

 BODY:
Not every manager working in the last year of his contract is unhappy about it. Lou Piniella of the Seattle Mariners has no problem with his status.
"I basically have told our people here that we got a new general manager and it's fair to him to let him work with me and make sure he's very comfortable," Piniella said. "I told them that I could manage very, very well on a one-year contract. I've got no concerns at all." 
 The Mariners are already in a state of flux, so what is one more piece of uncertainty. They finally rid themselves of the agonizing Ken Griffey Jr. problem, but Alex Rodriguez has them biting their nails, so a little thing like a manager is not going to faze them. Nor will it faze Piniella.
"I can manage very well on a one-year deal," said Piniella, who previously managed the Yankees and the Cincinnati Reds. "I can manage on a one-year deal forever. It doesn't bother me. Some people feel differently. I feel if I'm doing my job correctly and well that there's an opportunity whether it's here or somewhere else."
Pat Gillick, the new general manager, had nothing but praise for Piniella. "I think Lou's an excellent manager," Gillick said. "He handles people well, and he has a real love and passion for the game. That's real important. From my standpoint, Lou's a solid, solid guy."
But just as Piniella said Gillick was new, Gillick noted that the Mariners have a new chief executive officer, too, Howard Lincoln. "He wants to see how Lou and I get along," Gillick said.
By deferring to Gillick, Piniella might be keeping his options open. After eight seasons in Seattle, he could be ready to go elsewhere, or at least consider another job, depending on the openings seven months from now. He may want, like Griffey, to work closer to home, which is Tampa, Fla. He may want to be available if the Reds' job becomes available. He managed the Reds to the World Series title in 1990, and working conditions have improved since he left two years later.
"I didn't say that," he said in response to the idea of changing jobs. "I never mentioned that. We'll just wait and see what happens. I haven't given it any thought. I'm very happy managing just the way I am and whatever happens happens."
Whatever happens this year, Piniella said, he wants to continue managing. "I have some goals that I'd like to reach," he said, "so from that standpoint, yeah, I'd like to continue managing."
One of his goals, he said, is to win the World Series with an American League team. Sparky Anderson, who last week was elected to the Hall of Fame, won it in each league, with the Reds in the National League and the Detroit Tigers in the A.L. Unlike Anderson, Piniella played on World Series winners, too, though in the same league.
"It's never been done where a guy has played on a winner and managed a team in both leagues to win," Piniella said. There's another combination he would like to put together.
"I'd like to win 1,500 games," he said. "I think it's only been done once where a manager has had 1,500 hits and 1,500 wins. Some old guy way back when did it."
Fifteen managers gained 1,500 or more victories in the 20th century, the so-called modern era of baseball. Of those who played, none reached the 1,500-hit plateau. In his research, Bob Rosen of the Elias Sports Bureau had to dip back into the previous century to find the "old guy" Piniella referred to.
Fred Clarke, who began playing in 1894, finished his career with 2,672 hits. He began managing in 1897 and ended that career with 1,602 victories. Piniella collected 1,705 hits as a player and has won 1,019 games as a manager. He will need a minimum of six seasons to achieve his goal.
"I'm not ready to retire," he said, then added, "It's not going to be my choice. It won't be my option. It will be somebody else's option."
Piniella's success as a manager has been good enough that whether he is with the Mariners or with other teams he should get the seasons he needs to join Fred Clarke in that select circle and have the chance to win that elusive World Series championship as an American League manager.
 
The Underselling of Gwynn
Another player with Tony Gwynn's career would possibly have earned twice the money he has in his 17-year career. Gwynn agreed to his latest contract the other day, a nonguaranteed extension for the 2001 season, prompting a renewed assessment of the San Diego star's salary history.
"Everybody says that," he readily acknowledged when he was asked if he has always undersold himself. "You try to figure out what you think you're worth and try to get it. A lot of times it's less than what other guys are getting because other guys are not afraid to go somewhere else.
"With me, this is where I want to be. Knowing that, you find a number in your mind you feel comfortable with and hopefully that they feel comfortable with. This time I wanted to get closer to what I thought I was worth on the open market."
Gwynn thought he was worth $8 million for one year. That is what he will make out of the new contract, which includes a $2 million signing bonus, if he has 502 plate appearances or if the Padres exercise the option for a $6 million salary. If he doesn't and they don't, they will pay him a $2 million buyout.
"This time," Gwynn said, "the number wasn't the issue. It was whether to guarantee it or not. They didn't want to because I was going to be 40 this year. I wanted it guaranteed because I thought I had earned it. They gave, I gave. I gave up the guarantee and I got a bonus in front and a buyout in back. If I stay healthy this year, the option kicks in and everybody is happy."
It has been Gwynn's desire to remain in San Diego that has saved the Padres millions of dollars in the right fielder's career, which is in its 18th year. In April 1997, for example, when he had already won seven National League batting titles (he would win his eighth that season), he signed a three-year contract extension for $12.6 million, an average of $4.2 million a year. His $4.3 million salary this year is dwarfed by salaries of players with less talent.
Has he ever thought of playing elsewhere?
"Not really, no," he said. "My dad thought I should. I knew in my mind this is where I want to be. When you're on the outside looking in, it's hard to understand. When you're on the inside, you know. I'm where I'm supposed to be."
That's why Gwynn could relate to Ken Griffey Jr.'s taking less money to play in Cincinnati.
"That's where he wanted to be," Gwynn said. "There's nothing like being happy. There's nothing like playing where you want to play. That's something I've known for a long, long time."
 
A Manager's Challenge
Dusty Baker, who manages to keep his San Francisco Giants in contention more often than not, does not resent the expenditures the Arizona Diamondbacks made last year en route to a 100-victory season and a division championship.
"Nothing you can do about it," he said. "You can't apologize for spending your own money."
Baker said he chooses to take a different view of a team in the Diamondbacks' economic position. "It makes me feel like the have-nots versus the haves, which makes it kind of fun to me," the manager said. "It reminds me of when I was a kid playing against the country club guys. You could take pride in beating the country club boys."
Did that happen often? "Sometimes," he said.
 
Lopes Looking Upward
His title is manager, but Davey Lopes is playing the role of drill sergeant. Not that the Milwaukee Brewers' training camp resembles Camp LeJeune; Lopes's drilling is mental.
"It's like being in the Marines," he said. "You have to brainwash people into believing that you're the best."
Assuming on-field command of a franchise that has endured seven successive seasons of losing records, Lopes has to change the players' minds before he can expect the players to change the team's record.
"I've been in losing situations; I know what goes on in losing situations," the rookie manager said. "People come to the ballpark and say 'I got mine, I don't care.' Sometimes things need to be said. You have to be vocal about it. You have to emphasize that you will not accept that mentality.
"In most losing scenarios, nothing is being said. Everybody accepts it from top to bottom and that's where the problem comes in, when everybody becomes a victim of it. I will not become part of that scenario."
Lopes wants to instill in his players the belief that when they go on the field, they have a chance to win. "Some teams have a better chance than others," he said, "but that doesn't mean you can walk in with the attitude that I cannot win."
A negative attitude can overwhelm teams like the Brewers because they are at a disadvantage economically. Teams in the lower salary stratosphere have demonstrated they have little chance to compete for division championships.
"First of all I don't want to hear it," Lopes said of the potential for his players to blame losing on their economic status. "No. 2, in reality they are right that other teams have the resources to do things that we aren't going to be able to do. But that doesn't stop you from giving everything you have. I don't want you to use that as an excuse for not winning. As soon as you do that, you're dead in that you become complacent, you become selfish, you become everything that you shouldn't become as an athlete."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES;
2 Paths on Foreign Policy: Advice and Instinct

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 4

 BODY:
In October 1994, as the Clinton administration finally sealed a deal with the isolated, Communist government of North Korea to freeze its nuclear weapons projects in return for aid from the West, Senator John McCain was furious -- and he let everyone know it.
Mr. McCain took to the floor of the Senate, charging President Clinton with "appeasement," and predicting that North Korea was already stockpiling enough plutonium "to blackmail South Korea and Japan," with enough left over to supply Iran, Syria and Libya. The administration, he said, had been "played for fools," and he called for the immediate shipment of more rocket launchers and other equipment to South Korea. 
 It was classic McCain foreign policy: straight from the gut, hawkish, full of headline-grabbing buzzwords. In retrospect, it also appears overblown. Five and a half years later, North Korea's nuclear program remains frozen, at least as far as American intelligence agencies can tell, and its military power has gradually eroded.
In 1994, George W. Bush was making his first run for governor of Texas, not worrying about North Korea. But last year, after lengthy discussions with a team of advisers, Mr. Bush adopted a far more cautious position that exemplifies the step-at-a-time approach of a man new to foreign affairs.
While suspicious of North Korea, his aides say, he would not abandon the 1994 deal. But he insisted on taking a position just a shade tougher than the Clinton administration's, explicitly warning that any deviation from North Korea's commitments would be dealt with harshly.
"My administration will deploy antiballistic missile systems, both theater and national, to guard against attack and blackmail" from countries like North Korea, he said several months ago, committing to a missile shield that no one is yet sure is technologically feasible.
North Korea is just one example of the differences in both substance and style between John McCain and George Bush when they talk about foreign policy.
They come to their conclusions much as they run their campaigns: one by instinct, the other by committee.
Mr. McCain is rarely uncertain of his positions, even if his advisers wince at how quickly he sometimes reaches firm conclusions, then awkwardly tries to wrap a set of principles around them.
Mr. Bush, in contrast, is far less comfortable with the subject matter, more dependent on a stable of advisers, many drawn from administrations of Ronald Reagan and his father. His inexperience usually breeds caution, though it can lead him into trouble when he is pressed for answers that go beyond his script.
So it was no surprise a few weeks ago that Mr. McCain, in response to a question about Vladimir V. Putin, the former K.G.B. operative who has now risen to acting president of Russia, branded Mr. Putin as a "ruthless, ex-Communist apparatchik" -- words that could haunt him if, as president, he has to coax and cajole the Russian leader on the usual range of prickly issues.
Asked the same question about Mr. Putin, Mr. Bush was unwilling to offer more than a tepid "it's too early to tell" and then repeated, straight from his foreign policy speech, steps the United States should take to rebuild its strained relations with Moscow.
"John McCain is a pilot, and he flew single-seat fighters," said a Republican foreign policy adviser who has known him for years, but is leaning toward Mr. Bush. "He's got nerve, courage to beat the band, but he insists on flying the plane by himself. Bush isn't a pilot. He's more like a company commander who can move people from point A to point B."
And, the adviser said, "I can envision moments when I'd want a pilot, and moments when I would need a good company commander."
At times, Mr. McCain and Mr. Bush sound alike. They both call for a greater assertion of American power, and both breeze by the enormous resentments that power has engendered abroad, even among allies.
They both accuse the Clinton administration of lurching from crisis to crisis, and say they would provide steadier leadership and better focus. They both want China to join the World Trade Organization, a Clinton administration initiative, and both argued to cut off aid to Russia during its war in Chechnya, a step the Clinton administration never took. And both favor national missile defense.
Mr. McCain has devoted very little attention to the newest and most complex territory of foreign affairs, where it meets the challenges of economic globalization; but Mr. Bush has done little more.
While some of Mr. McCain's predecessors as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee delved into America's trade deficits or the nature of economic interchanges with Europe and Asia and the World Trade Organization, Mr. McCain has steered clear. He played no role in the Asian financial crisis, said little about economic questions that dominate the Clinton foreign policy agenda, and his international economic agenda has focused chiefly on restoring trade relations with Vietnam.
Mr. Bush's only real foray into international economics has been in his own backyard, his support of the North American Free Trade Agreement. He talks at length about refocusing foreign policy on what he calls "the neighborhood," meaning Mexico and the rest of Latin America. (Mr. McCain, in contrast, is far more likely to talk about American relations with the great powers.)
But wander into other areas of foreign policy and Mr. Bush's responses are hit-and-miss. His foray into discussing Russia's 1998 economic collapse led him to charge, incorrectly, that the Treasury had bailed out big American investors who had lost millions in Russia.
No foreign policy issue has been more discussed in this campaign -- or more confusing -- than the question of when and how the United States should use its military power.
At first glance, Mr. McCain's statements make it sound as if he would be the most militarily adventurous president since Ronald Reagan. Mr. McCain began using the phrase "rogue state rollback" as his campaign got into gear last year, suggesting that he would use the nation's intelligence services, governments-in-exile or military force if necessary to destabilize dictators.
But that is only at first glance. In a debate with Mr. Bush on Thursday in Los Angeles, Mr. McCain rolled back a little on rollback, arguing that his efforts to arm and equip opponents of such dictators amounted to "an attempt to avoid United States military involvement."
At other times Mr. McCain has expressed doubts that American interests are at stake when deployed against the likes of President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia. "We shouldn't have gone into Kosovo, or shouldn't have stumbled into Kosovo," Mr. McCain said two weeks ago. "There was no need to intervene there."
Yet once American forces were committed to the Kosovo conflict, Mr. McCain argued more ardently than anyone in the Senate that the United States should threaten the use of ground forces.
Adm. Charles Larson, the former commander in chief of American forces in the Pacific and one of Mr. McCain's oldest friends and closest national security advisers, said that what angered Mr. McCain was "a sense that we did all the wrong things to get where we got in Kosovo" and that "the last thing you want to do, from a strategic point of view, was to rule out the use of troops."
Mr. Bush's main concern is not that Americans are being pushed around by rogue states, but that troops are over-committed.
"I didn't like what went on in Rwanda," he said last month, "but I don't think we should commit troops to Rwanda, nor do I think we ought to be the peacekeepers all around the world."
Senator McCain replied: "Look, there's only one superpower, and that's the United States of America. And there will be times when the superpower has to do things that other nations don't have to do."
But he did not reconcile that with his past critiques of Mr. Clinton's ventures into Somalia and Kosovo.
Mr. Bush's oft-repeated line is that Washington's relationship with Beijing "is going to change from one of strategic partner to one of competitor, but competitors can find areas of agreement, such as in trade."
But in Thursday's debate, as he tried to explain how his administration would defend Taiwan if China made good on recent threats that it might use force to accomplish reunification, Mr. Bush described a policy that sounded almost identical to the Clinton administration's.
Mr. McCain has a more detailed critique of the Clinton administration's approach to China, arguing that Mr. Clinton "shattered" a longstanding policy of "strategic ambiguity" -- leaving the Chinese guessing about how the United States would react to an effort to retake Taiwan -- in his last trip to China. He says Mr. Clinton was far too cozy with China's leaders, echoing the argument that Mr. Clinton made about Mr. Bush's father in 1992.
But Mr. McCain's prescriptions are largely tactical. He says he would "push the development of sea-based missile defense systems" so he could move ships close to Taiwan to defend it. That sidesteps, however, the issue that has tied the Clinton administration in knots: how to use some combination of economic and military power to change the behavior of China's leaders.
That is a far more complex equation, involving the three-dimensional chess of trade policy, human rights policy and military policy. And in the scattered arguments over China thus far, neither of the Republican candidates, like their Democratic rivals, has displayed any new ideas about how to make the next move.

HEADLINE: Make an Immigration Policy for Today's Needs

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Your report about the plight of foreign professionals who are awaiting green cards (news article, Feb. 29) is a good reminder of the outdated norms that govern the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
While the United States is in dire need of skilled professionals to perform vital tasks within the booming economy, it is also flooded by illegal workers who are mostly unskilled. 
 There seems to be a penalty for foreign workers who do things by the book and no real punishment for those who slip through the immigration agency's net.
The United States, more than any other country, has welcomed immigrants and has grown because of it. It is ironic that a policy that hinders the new high-tech workers has not been adapted to suit today's needs.

HARVEST OF EMPIRE
 A History of Latinos in America.
 By Juan Gonzalez.
 346 pp. New York: Viking. $27.95. 
 The hit songs of Ricardo Martinez, better known as Ricky Martin, are unlikely to remembered a decade from now, but the recent boomlet of Latino pop stars in this country appears to mark the start of a more generous appraisal of Hispanics in the United States. For the most part they have been treated as unwelcome interlopers or ignored altogether, even though their swelling ranks constitute the most dramatic demographic transformation the United States has ever undergone. For a country long used to seeing itself as black and white, it will be something of a shock when Hispanics become the nation's largest minority group in five years and fully one-quarter of the population by midcentury.
Even Americans who are aware of the statistics generally lack a fuller appreciation of what the country's Latinization portends. But now, with "Harvest of Empire," Juan Gonzalez has made a serious, significant contribution to understanding who the Hispanics of the United States are and where they come from. This ambitious, well-researched book highlights positive traits that are often overlooked, like Hispanics' high rates of employment and business formation, and underscores how their struggles have been compounded by an anti-immigrant climate and the disappearance of high-wage union jobs that helped earlier arrivals climb up the socioeconomic ladder.
The defining feature of United States Latinos, which poses the main challenge in writing about them, is their tremendous diversity. Although joined by a common language (Spanish), they come from 20-odd countries with distinct histories, customs and blends of European, African and indigenous stock. Gonzalez takes the sensible approach of devoting separate chapters to Mexicans (two-thirds of United States Hispanics), Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Colombians and Panamanians, Dominicans and Central Americans. Though he gives short shrift to the uniquely American Latino hybrid forming in cities where several nationalities cluster, interact and intermarry, his multigenerational stories of immigrant families in New York, Texas, California and Florida endow his text with depth, detail and emotional resonance.
The book's unifying theme, as the title suggests, is that the United States caused this wave of immigration by two centuries of neocolonialism, imperialism and economic exploitation. The author, a Puerto Rican and a columnist for The Daily News in New York, hammers away at this argument, recounting the military interventions and heavy-handed, self-interested Washington policies that certainly did exacerbate the region's troubles. But his insistence that the United States is the sole culprit behind the poverty and turmoil propelling so many people northward ignores equally important factors -- beginning with the anti-entrepreneurial, anti-individualistic bent of Spanish colonialism -- that restricted economic opportunity and political liberty. His sustained broadside against Uncle Sam does help make the point that what happens down there affects what happens up here, and more specifically that the one realistic way to curtail immigration to the United States is by improving people's lives at home.
Unfortunately, Gonzalez is so convinced that the United States can be only an unremitting force for evil that he cannot see a good thing if the gringos are behind it. He labels free trade, which Washington has promoted, an economic disaster for Latin America and for Mexico in particular. But free trade has in fact spurred huge job creation there, and Mexico's economy has averaged five percent growth since 1996, although one would not know it from reading this book. The United States has a great deal to be ashamed of in its historical treatment of Latin America, but the region's development today is hampered less by United States competition than by its own practices that favor monopoly, discourage investment and allow vast sums to end up in overseas bank accounts.
Gonzalez explains his point of view in a rich and touching portrait of his family. An urban New York leftist, he got an Ivy League education and helped found a militant Puerto Rican group called the Young Lords, but success did not make him forget his parents' struggles with racism, violence and poverty or his own memories -- for example, of the teacher who wanted to call him John -- that still rankle. His thesis best applies to Puerto Rico, which was and still is the United States' sole Latin American possession. Its anomalous, quasi-colonial status has played havoc with Puerto Ricans' social stability, economic fate and national identity. But whereas Gonzalez's personal politics would seem to make independence the logical solution for him to embrace, he instead takes the awkward position that Puerto Ricans should gain full autonomy but retain their coveted United States citizenship. Such conflicted stances are exactly what has kept the island on the fence, unwilling to give up the benefits of tax-free welfare and open access to the mainland despite the political humiliation of limited suffrage and subjection to wartime draft.
The book's final section tackles the issues that will determine whether the Latinos of the United States are successfully integrated into the mainstream: immigration, education and political enfranchisement. Gonzalez makes a persuasive case that newcomers and natives alike ought to be able to agree on certain common-sense goals, among them that the federal government should help areas hardest hit by immigrant influxes, that English fluency is a critical asset for economic advancement and that foreign-born residents should become legal citizens, with a voice in the system. Recent elections show that the Latino vote has become key in critical states, and most presidential candidates now on the stump are at least trying to speak a few words of Spanish.
Gonzalez has high hopes for a future Latino-led, multiethnic coalition that will inspire new political activism. And he suggests that non-Hispanic Americans might grow more accepting of the Latino presence if they recall earlier fears of Irish, Italian and Jewish immigrants. They might remember, as they get used to pop tunes with a Latin beat, that some of the most quintessentially American songs were written by Israel Baline, a working-class man from Siberia better known as Irving Berlin.

THE GLOBAL SOUL
 Jet Lag, Shopping Malls,
 and the Search for Home.
 By Pico Iyer.
 303 pp. New York:
 Alfred A. Knopf. $25. 
 The 20th century effectively began with an object lesson in the odiousness of nationalism, in the form of World War I. The 21st may teach us that internationalism is hardly better. Instead of all peoples in their national costumes joining hands before a rising sun, we are faced with the prospect of a global corporate entity that bypasses government and subjects all distinctions and all rights to the exigencies of profit. We are offered the choice of going along quietly or else joining the mujahedeen in the hills, who are chiefly fighting each other. But the economic bulldozer and the xenophobic reaction have been remarkably synergistic in one respect: Together they have uprooted many millions of humans from their native soil and set them down to reinvent themselves in distant lands.
Pico Iyer was seemingly destined to chronicle this wave of enforced reinvention. He was born in Britain to Indian parents (who named him after the 15th-century Italian neo-Platonist Pico della Mirandola), transplanted to Southern California and then given a thorough English education at Eton and Oxford. Today he lives, variously, in Los Angeles, rural Japan and the airports of the world -- he covers such matters as the Olympics for that paragon of global culture, Time. "The Global Soul," his sixth book, treats most of these biographical particulars in passing, although it is not primarily an autobiographical exercise. It comprises a series of linked journalistic essays, each of which attempts in a different way to address the phenomenon of worldwide displacement and its consequences. The book is bracketed by two personal accounts. The first, of seeing his house in the Los Angeles foothills burned down by wildfire, is about the process of detaching. The other is about touching down, but very lightly; it concerns his life in a Japanese community where he doesn't speak much of the language, his girlfriend doesn't know much English and the neighbors regard him with mingled fascination and alarm, even after four years.
In the intervening five chapters Iyer travels, and finds places that function as metaphors. He goes to airports -- not merely passing through every hub in the known world but experimentally living for a while at LAX -- and savors their ambience of temporariness and suspended reality. He visits an old school friend who is now a member of the international managerial class and lives in Hong Kong, if indeed he can be said to live anywhere since he travels so constantly he carries around currency and mass-transit tickets for 27 countries and receives voice mail in three of them (as if Hong Kong's managerial-class compound actually qualified as somewhere in particular). He goes to Toronto and gauges the success of the ad hoc, bona fide multiculturalism that has redefined that city over the past few decades. He visits Atlanta to cover the Olympic Games and tries to find the point of intersection between the shiny, optimistic public-relations facade of the place, kicked up a few notches to welcome the world, and the sordid, nameless, boarded-up reality lurking behind it. He returns to Britain and assesses how it has treated its many residents whose roots lie in its former colonies, focusing on one Indian-born friend who feels alienated because Britain is no longer sufficiently British.
It's quite a tour, around the world and then some, dense with detail. Iyer is a very good noticer. He notices that Hong Kong has a clothing store called People's Republic of Chic, that a Southeast Asian passing through LAX wears something emblazoned with the legend "The Very Last Viking," that a restaurant in Toronto serves "Indian Pakistani-style Chinese food," that the Atlanta Yellow Pages carries 132 listings for the Babbitt Aachen Aaland Aalborg escort agency, that the gift shop in John Keats's house sells teddy bears wearing sashes that say "I Am a Romantic." The book is filled with men and women of diverse nationalities and ethnic backgrounds, most of them making cameo appearances, establishing themselves as cosmopolitans. There is not much time to get to know anyone, because the experience is necessarily kaleidoscopic and in constant motion. Iyer particularly relishes multinationality pileups, such as: "I'm sitting in a Parisian cafe just outside Chinatown (in San Francisco), talking to a Mexican-American friend about biculturalism while a Haitian woman stops off to congratulate him on a piece he's just delivered on TV on St. Patrick's Day." Or: "I called up a Chinese friend whom I'd first met in Nepal (where he'd been working on an Anglo-Italian film about the Buddha), and his Japanese-American wife picked up." Or: "The Iranian addressed her in fluent Danish, corrected her Californian inflections, and then, in her mother's tongue, said sadly, 'Good-bye, Danish girl.' As soon as she walked away, he turned to me. 'Excuse me. Habla espanol?' "
There is a great deal of this sort of thing. Each chapter seems to contain an anecdote about the author's ethnic provenance being mistaken for some other, one or more citations from works of literature on the subject of deracination (" 'Perhaps there is an advantage in being born in a city like Monte Carlo, without roots,' says Brown, the suitably anonymous character in Greene's 'Comedians' "), and at least one epigram on the subject ("a true cosmopolitan, after all, is not someone who's traveled a lot so much as someone who can appreciate what it feels like to be Other"). And the trip embodied in each chapter is complicated by flashbacks to other trips, other cities and other continents. The international editions of Time and CNN recur almost as ubiquitously as they actually do in airports and hotels around the world. After a while, the reader can begin to feel jet-lagged.
Iyer is a good writer with a sharp eye, a well-furnished mind and a keen moral sense. It is probable that he intended "The Global Soul" to be as dizzying as its subject. The book is, however, too dizzying by half. One problem is that the individual chapters give every appearance of having begun life as magazine assignments and then of having been pulled like taffy to enlarge their significance. They are marked with magazine journalism's impatience, its need for quick-cut montage, for sound bites, for color and parade, for summing-ups that fall every few paragraphs as regularly as tolling bells. There are exceptions. Iyer is absorbing when he is himself absorbed, when he slows down the pace sufficiently that we can walk with him, as we can in his frustrated circling around Atlanta, trying to find the face behind the mask, or in his last chapter, in which he very simply describes the rituals of his oddly but serenely constricted life in Japan.
The magazine glibness that pervades the book also obscures his coming to terms with his subject. Iyer writes, for example, concerning the architect Rem Koolhaas's plans for the impersonal "city without qualities," "Cities, no less than people, rebel against being nothing." But earlier he approvingly cites a writer who "deliberately keeps all colloquialisms and local references out of his books," in order to make them translation-ready, and isn't that much the same sort of thing? He feels welcomed by Toronto and chilled by Hong Kong, but the difference may not be immediately apparent, since his descriptions of the two places are so similarly hectic and wide-eyed.
Maybe the problem is in a sense endemic to the subject, since constantly operating on a solar clock at variance with the one in the sky above tends to delay or blunt one's reactions, and dazzlement may pass for enthusiasm but actually presage nausea. But then Iyer's subject is a vexed one, and could arouse a simple reaction only in the kind of people who believe that God sits on their side of the football field, and no honest writer would pretend to come to anything but a rueful and provisional conclusion about it. As he writes in his reflective final chapter, "Perhaps the deepest obligation of any foreigner in a place he loves that's not his own is to remember, daily, that his paradise is a fallen one."

The Woman Who Knew Too Much
 Alice Stewart and the Secrets of Radiation.
 By Gayle Greene.
 Illustrated. 321 pp. Ann Arbor:
 University of Michigan Press. $35. 
 EVERY study that tries to measure the effects of radiation on health adds to a never-ending debate. Among the very few ideas that are generally accepted is that children X-rayed before birth, even if only once, have a measurably higher chance of developing leukemia.
That idea, well entrenched now, was a long time coming, and it came because of Alice Stewart, an English doctor and (before the term gained wide acceptance) an epidemiologist. Stewart, born in 1906, did her pioneering work on childhood leukemia in the mid-1950's, but is today still pushing the envelope, with studies of workers in nuclear weapons plants that find a variety of health problems she attributes to radiation. She continues to publish scientific papers in peer-reviewed journals and to speak at conferences.
Gayle Greene's "Woman Who Knew Too Much" seeks to trace Stewart's unconventional approach in investigating the effects of man-made radiation. It provides some shrewd insights into her personality and methodology.
For example, in the project she oversaw known as the Oxford Survey of Childhood Cancer, Stewart said she drew the link between prenatal X-rays and the incidence of leukemia not only by reviewing health records but by asking a wide variety of questions of the mothers. "They might have a memory of something prenatal that the doctors might have forgotten," she said.
The survey, which grew to cover hundreds of thousands of children in England in the mid-50's, including me, was not her first experience in getting close to her subject matter or, for that matter, her closest. In the early days of World War II, called upon to find out whether TNT was making the workers in a munitions factory sick, she decided "I could get a much better grip on it if I went and filled some shells myself."
At times the book hews so closely to Stewart's recounting of her own story that it is almost a memoir. Elsewhere, Greene, a professor of women's studies and literature at Scripps College in Claremont, Calif., traces a history of professional slights and nonrecognition, and seeks to build a case that Stewart is like Galileo and Copernicus, recognized only in hindsight.
The problem with this approach is that it presumes that the scientific mainstream will come around to Stewart's point of view about the effects of radiation on adults. It may, but it hasn't so far.
"The Woman Who Knew Too Much" doesn't work as a history of science -- the technical material given by Greene isn't broad or deep enough, and some of the detail is oversimplified. It doesn't work as a history, either, offering only limited context for the politics and economics of the nuclear age. But it does provide a picture of Stewart as a woman in an area not hospitable to women for most of her century, and working in a pioneering field, epidemiology, that raised still more suspicion. Even today epidemiologists are not much in favor with other scientists; a joke among Energy Department officials is that they are good at finding health problems -- as long as the problem you are looking for is an epidemic. Stewart's work on childhood leukemia, though, was based on about one extra case per 2,000 babies, a subtle problem.
In the last few years Stewart has been trying to build the case that data on Hiroshima survivors, the main source of our knowledge about radiation health effects, is a poor yardstick for predicting the health of nuclear workers, who get their doses in small, chronic increments, not in one large event. She adds that the Hiroshima studies do not even represent the complete experience of the bomb survivors, since the work there did not start until five years after the bombing, by which time many of the weaker survivors had died.
All this is characteristic of Stewart's unorthodox thinking. If "The Woman Who Knew Too Much" provides only a limited understanding of the science, it does provide a good understanding of the scientist.

The Tipping Point
 How Little Things
 Can Make a Big Difference.
 By Malcolm Gladwell.
 279 pp. Boston:
 Little, Brown & Company. $24.95. 
 It's hard not to be fascinated by fads. A previously unwanted item will attract sudden, enormous, inexplicable attention. The company that provides it will run out. Pundits will read into its popularity portentous meanings for contemporary civilization. The lucky few will make fantastic sums of money. Then, as mysteriously as it appeared, the item wanes in desirability. Within a year or two, whatever it was that had sent people into a frenzy becomes the answer to a trivia question.
Fads remind us of the potential for disorder always lying behind the placid surface of daily life. Economists study fads for examples of speculative mania -- Dutch tulips, perhaps today's Nasdaq -- that inevitably result in depressions. Sociologists teach that in the middle of a fad individuals are more likely to be swayed by crowd psychology than by their own wants. Satirists find in fads human foibles writ large; Melville's "Confidence Man" and Twain's "Man That Corrupted Hadleyburg" are built around the illusions that lead people to deny what their eyes see in favor of what their hearts desire.
"The Tipping Point," by Malcolm Gladwell, is a lively, timely and engaging study of fads. Some of those he writes about fit snugly into the long tradition of crowd behavior: out-of-fashion Hush Puppies resurged into popularity in 1994 and '95; teenagers, despite repeated health warnings, continue to smoke and in the past few years have been doing so in increasing numbers; and in 1998 a book called "Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood" reached a sales mark of two and a half million copies. Some of the other phenomena analyzed by Gladwell are a bit more unusual, including the decline in crime in New York City that began under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. But all of them can be taken as examples of how unpredictable people can be when they find themselves in the throes of doing what everyone else is doing at the same time.
Unlike previous observers of fads, however, Gladwell, a staff writer for The New Yorker, does not emphasize what they teach us about human irrationality. He does the exact opposite. Fads, he claims, are not really fads at all. They are illustrations of what he calls "the tipping point," a term that he appropriates from the highly rational language of medical science, and that he defines as the "one dramatic moment in an epidemic when everything can change all at once." Ideas and products and messages and behaviors, Gladwell writes, spread just as viruses do.
Viruses are contagious, but they move through a population at something like a leisurely pace until a tipping point is reached and they explode into an epidemic. Gladwell extends the idea of the tipping point from natural to social phenomena, from epidemics to fads, insisting that we can discover the scientific principles that govern both.
Gladwell calls the first such principle the Law of the Few. An idea or behavior spreads because of the unusual qualities of a few key groups of individuals. There are the connectors, networked people who know seemingly everyone and who can make or break reputations on their word alone. There are the mavens, people who acquire such detailed knowledge of a product that others turn to them repeatedly for advice. Then there are the salesmen, those whose enthusiasm for a product can send its sales spiralling upward.
The second law of fads, according to Gladwell, is the Stickiness Factor. All kinds of potential fads exist around us, but only certain ones take. "Sesame Street" was failing miserably with test groups when someone, as a last-ditch move, thought of blending real people with puppets. Including a map highlighting the location of the infirmary induced many Yale seniors to heed previously disregarded warnings about getting a tetanus shot. At a time of message overload, finding a way to make something stick is part of making it survive.
Finally, Gladwell discusses the Power of Context. One reason crime declined in New York is that officials put into practice the much-debated broken-windows theory, which held that if subways were cleaned of graffiti and windows were repaired, people would begin to obey the law. Altering the context altered the result. Gladwell offers another example: the Rule of 150. Groups smaller than 150 cannot influence many outside them. Larger groups tend to become impersonal. Knowing that, we begin to realize that one can create a large fad by first creating a series of smaller ones.
Gladwell, who made his career in journalism as a science writer, has a knack for explaining psychological experiments clearly; "The Tipping Point" is worth reading just for what it tells us about how we try to make sense out of the world. But its central premise, no matter how often asserted, fails to persuade. Gladwell's rules of epidemic behavior are common sense dressed up as science. We do not need to know about how a virus spreads to know that networking is important, that good salesmen move products or that most ad campaigns fail. And some of his ideas -- for example, that 150 is the ideal size of a human group because 1 to 150 also happens to be the ratio of the size of our neocortex to the size of our entire brain -- are just fanciful.
A virus spreads by replicating itself into as many hosts as it can find. The tipping point it reaches is quantitative in nature; matters achieve epidemic proportions when replication takes off mathematically. The social tipping points of everyday life, by contrast, are qualitative. What makes them fascinating is not the number of times things repeat themselves but the fact that events taking place after the tipping point is reached are not the same as those that took place before.
Consider the most well known of social tipping points, though one that Gladwell does not analyze: partly integrated neighborhoods segregating themselves when whites come to feel that too many blacks live there. A white person who sells a house to an African-American because the latter makes the best offer is ostensibly engaged in the same behavior as a white person who sells a house to an African-American because he is in a panic and just wants to unload his property at any price. But subjectively, their actions are completely different. Before the tipping point, the white seller is rational. Afterwards, his consciousness has changed, and he acts out of fear, ignorance or both. The tipping point takes on a life of its own because human beings, the transmittal agents, unlike viruses, have minds of their own.
Forcing science where science does not belong results not only in misunderstanding; it could also cause harm if taken too seriously. Gladwell points to a rash of Young Werther suicides that took place in Micronesia in the 1970's and 80's. Just like crime or smoking, suicide is contagious, he writes, citing the studies of a University of California sociologist who found that suicides increase after reports of suicide appear in the newspapers.
As with any form of social behavior, there will always be an imitative factor. But it is simply wrong to say that the very essence of suicide is a private language between members of a common subculture. Suicide may not have any essence, but if it has one, it is a private act of a person with serious mental disturbances and not a language at all. Anyone who believes that suicide is contagious the way the flu is contagious may well be distracted from giving the kind of attention that a potential suicide victim needs, the help to deal with problems inside, not behaviors outside.
I wish Malcolm Gladwell had chosen to use his considerable skills as a journalist to describe more examples of actual tipping points. In reaching instead for theory, he reaches well beyond where he, or anyone else, can safely travel. The theory of tipping points requires that "we reframe the way we think about the world," he writes. Actually, the way we think about the world has to reframe the often stilted theories we develop about it.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN;
Coast to Coast, Troves of Delegates at Stake on Tuesday

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

 BODY:
The voting on March 7 represents the closest this country has ever come to a national primary to choose the major parties' presidential candidates.
Contests will be held in 16 states from coast to coast and in American Samoa. Nearly a third of the 2,066 delegates to the Republican convention and 4,338 delegates to the Democratic convention are at stake. Chances are, when all of Tuesday's votes are counted, it could be clear who will be nominated at both conventions in August. 
 Most of the public attention and the candidates' resources have been devoted to California and New York, which together have 42 percent of the Republican delegates to be chosen on Tuesday and 46 percent of the Democratic delegates.
But other large states, like Ohio, Georgia and Massachusetts, are also voting. And New England is holding what amounts to its own regional primary with contests in every state except New Hampshire, which had the first primary on Feb. 1.
The potential combinations are intriguing. For instance, Senator John McCain is the favorite in all five New England states that are voting and that together have 102 Republican delegates, 1 more than New York. If Mr. McCain wins most of the delegates in New England and New York, that could offset a victory by Gov. George W. Bush in California, which has 162 Republican delegates.
On the other hand, Mr. Bush could sweep Georgia (54 delegates) and Missouri (35) and do well in caucuses in Minnesota (34), and that could balance losses in the East.
The situation is complicated by the Republicans' voting rules. In most of the states voting on Tuesday, only a fraction of the delegates are allocated on the basis of who wins statewide, and most are awarded to the candidate who carries each congressional district. As a result, in many states, Mr. Bush and Mr. McCain are each likely to win some delegates, and it is possible they will be divided fairly equally.
On the Democratic side, Vice President Al Gore appears to have a clear lead over former Senator Bill Bradley in every state voting on Tuesday. And while Mr. Bradley may win some delegates in congressional districts, he may not win the majority of the delegates in any state.
In all states, Democratic candidates are allotted delegates according to their proporton of the vote.
 
New York
 
POPULATION: 18,175,301
MEDIAN INCOME: $37,394
 
VOTING RULES -- Party members only.
DELEGATES -- 243 Democratic. 101 Republican. Candidates have slates of delegates in the 31 Congressional districts, 93 in all; the three delegates with the most votes in each district win. State party committee chooses eight at-large delegates.
CANDIDATE VISITS -- Bradley 27, Bush 6, Gore 26, McCain 12.
For a long time, most people in politics assumed they knew the contours of the New York primary: There would be a huge fight on the Democratic side, as Mr. Gore faced a stiff challenge from Mr. Bradley. On the Republican side there would be, well, nothing -- or almost nothing, as the state's Republican machine once again ensured that its favored candidate, this time Mr. Bush, had the primary ballot to himself.
What is actually happening is the reverse. The Republican Party failed to keep Mr. McCain and Alan Keyes off the ballot. This resulting fight -- the first competitive Republican primary in New York since 1980 -- appears to ride on a few factors. The first is a harsh attack directed at Mr. McCain by Mr. Bush, in the form of mail and radio and television advertisements, that portray him as anti-New York, against breast cancer research and anti-environment. The second factor is the system: delegates appear on the ballot, with the candidates' names in tiny type underneath. Unlike Mr. McCain's delegates, Mr. Bush's tend to be elected officials, who are better known. The third factor is Mr. McCain, whose campaign would seem particularly well suited to the state's moderate Republican electorate.
By contrast, Mr. Bradley's campaign has been barely perceptible. What might prove most significant is what happened long before the vote: Mr. Gore's methodical campaign to nail down support from unions, Democratic officials and constituency groups. These are the people who get the vote out. And they could make the difference in a presumably low Democratic turnout.
 
Connecticut
 
POPULATION: 3,274,069
MEDIAN INCOME: $46,508
 
VOTING RULES -- Only party members can vote in primaries.
DELEGATES -- 54 Democratic, 25 Republican, winner take all.
CANDIDATE VISITS -- Bradley 4, Bush 2, Gore 2, McCain 4.
A poll published this week by Zogby International shows Mr. McCain and Mr. Bush in a statistical tie. Several factors stand in Mr. Bush's favor: strong support from the state's governor, John G. Rowland, who has overseen a statewide effort on Mr. Bush's behalf, and family history. President George Bush, the candidate's father, was born and raised in Greenwich, George W. Bush was born in New Haven and attended Yale University.
Mr. McCain's anti-establishment message has widespread appeal in Connecticut, where 40 percent of the state's 1.9 million voters are independent. But the senator is hindered by the state's voting rules, which bar independents from the primaries and prohibit crossover voting. Voters have until Monday at noon to register in a party.
For Democrats, who control the state legislature, Connecticut seems poised to give a victory to Mr. Gore. A Quinnipiac College poll taken two weeks ago showed Mr. Gore leading Mr. Bradley by 9 points, and Mr. Bradley has not been able to cut down his deficit since then.
 
California
 
POPULATION: 32,666,550
MEDIAN INCOME: $40,934
 
VOTING RULES -- Single ballot with all candidates. Only votes of party members count for delegate selection.
DELEGATES -- 367 Democratic, 162 Republicans, winner take all.
CANDIDATE VISITS -- Bradley 26, Bush 9, Gore 21, McCain 29.
California has not played a decisive role in settling a presidential nomination in nearly three decades, and its impact this year may be diluted by same-day contests in other big states. But all four major contenders have poured time, money and television advertising into trying to do well in the biggest state of all, and the final two debates before the March 7 primaries were both in Los Angeles.
The most unusual feature of this year's primary is that the names of all candidates will appear on the same ballot regardless of party, providing the first big test of the probable nominees' comparative strength in a general election. The latest polls show Mr. Gore, Mr. Bush and Mr. McCain in something close to a three-way tie for the overall vote, with each drawing about a quarter of likely voters and Mr. Bradley and Mr. Keyes trailing badly. Under party rules, only the votes of party members will count in selecting delegates for each party, and Mr. Bush has consistently led Mr. McCain 2-to-1 among Republican voters.
Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush have almost all the support of their party establishments and the most organizational troops on the ground. They and their opponents have each spent millions of dollars on television advertising, although their commercials have not run nearly as often as a welter of advertisements for statewide ballot measures.
Perhaps the biggest political surprise of the season here was Mr. Bradley's inability to gain any real traction. He spent a year teaching at Stanford University after leaving the Senate, and more than held his own in the fund-raising sweepstakes against Mr. Gore in both Hollywood and the Silicon Valley. But California's economic recovery has almost precisely coincided with the Clinton administration's tenure in Washington, and Mr. Gore's assiduous seven-year courtship of the state has paid off in his strong standing in the polls.
 
Georgia
 
POPULATION: 7,642,207
MEDIAN INCOME: $38,665
 
 
VOTING RULES -- Voters can cast ballots in either primary.
DELEGATES -- 77 Democratic. 54 Republican, 33 winner-take-all per Congressional district, 21 at-large, winner-take-all overall.
CANDIDATE VISITS -- Bradley 2, Bush 2, Gore 5, McCain 1.
This state is solidly in the Bush camp. Almost all of Georgia's elected Republican officials are supporting Mr. Bush. Mr. McCain canceled his only visit to Georgia in the days before the primary and has no staff or resources in the state.
None of the four major candidates have run any television advertisements. Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore each made a single quick appearance in the last few weeks.
Mr. Gore has the backing of Gov. Roy Barnes and most party leaders, and a poll last week showed him leading Mr. Bradley among Democrats, 64 percent to 27 percent.
 
Hawaii
 
POPULATION: 1,193,001
MEDIAN INCOME: $40,827
On Tuesday, 33 delegates are at stake in the Hawaii Democratic caucuses. But there has been hardly any campaigning in what remains the most solidly Democratic state in the nation, and the 10th smallest, with just four electoral votes. Republicans will choose their delegates in a state convention in May.
None of the major presidential contenders have visited the state, and none have any paid staff there. Even the flushest, the Bush campaign, is headquartered in the home of its state chairman.
Vice President Al Gore has the support of virtually the entire elected establishment, and Lt. Gov. Mazie Hirono, the head of the local steering committee, said there were plans for minimal direct mailings and phone calls aimed at getting out the vote.
 
Idaho
 
POPULATION: 1,228,684
MEDIAN INCOME: $36,680
Democrats are sometimes referred to as an endangered species in Idaho, and whoever is the party's presidential nominee will face a huge uphill battle for the state's four electoral votes in November. Neither Mr. Gore nor Mr. Bradley has campaigned in the state in recent months.
Nonetheless, 16 of the state's 23 Democratic delegates are at stake in Tuesday's caucuses; the rest are so-called super-delegates, already selected. Mr. Gore has a clear edge in endorsements of elected officials. And he has the backing of the widow of Senator Frank Church, an iconic figure in the state. But Mr. Bradley has the support of Cecil Andrus, a popular former governor and secretary of the Interior Department.
Republicans will select their delegates at caucuses in May.
 
Maine
 
POPULATION: 1,244,250
MEDIAN INCOME: $35,640
 
VOTING RULES -- Only party members can vote in primaries, but independents can enroll in a party at the polls. Deadline for party switching has passed.
DELEGATES -- 23 Democratic. 14 Republican, allotted by proportion of vote, unless majority, then winner take all.
CANDIDATE VISITS -- Bradley 2, Bush 0, Gore 1, McCain 1.
Most voters, about 300,000, are registered as independents. In 1992, they helped Ross Perot beat President George Bush in the state's general election.
There have been no polls of Maine voters recently, making the candidates' popularity hard to measure. Mr. Bradley's campaign has been buoyed by endorsements from 10 of the state's 18 Democratic state senators.
Mr. McCain is in a tight race with Mr. Bush in Maine, where the Bush family owns a home and garners strong support from the Republican Party. Mr. McCain held a rally in Portland yesterday.
"Ninety-five out of 100 times in Maine the more moderate candidate will win the primary," said Christian Potholm, a professor at Bowdoin College, in Brunswick. "If McCain came to Maine and spent a little money on television, I think he could win it."
 
Maryland
 
POPULATION: 5,134,808
MEDIAN INCOME: $50,016
 
VOTING RULES -- Independent voters can vote in Republican, but not Democratic, primary. No crossover voting.
DELEGATES -- 68 Democratic. 31 Republican, 24 winner-take-all per Congressional district, 7 at-large, winner-take-all overall.
CANDIDATE VISITS -- Bradley 2, Bush 2, Gore 5, McCain 1.
 Although Maryland is the 19th most populous state, the presidential candidates have devoted few resources here. There has been little television advertising, and the candidates have visited mostly for fund-raisers. Partly this is because much of Maryland receives Washington newspapers and television. The extensive political coverage makes local campaigning and advertising less important than they might be elsewhere.
Polls show Mr. Bush ahead, but his lead is not commanding. The Bush campaign has sent about a dozen paid staff members to Maryland to supervise mailings and phone banks. The McCain campaign has a corps of volunteers but no paid workers.
Maryland is one of the most heavily Democratic states in the country. By all accounts, Mr. Gore has a substantial lead over Mr. Bradley.
Under state party rules, independents can vote in the Republican primary and this could work to Mr. McCain's advantage. The word in Republican circles is that the higher the turnout, the better the chances of a McCain victory.
 
Massachusetts
 
POPULATION: 6,147,132
MEDIAN INCOME: $42,345
 
VOTING RULES -- Independent voters may vote in either primary. No crossover voting.
DELEGATES -- 93 Democratic. 37 Republican, winner take all.
CANDIDATE VISITS -- Bradley 11, Bush 2, Gore 8, McCain 7.
Even in liberal Democratic Massachusetts, about half of registered voters are independent and more than 25,000 Democrats have changed party affiliation to vote Republican on Tuesday. Both are good signs for Mr. McCain.
Recent surveys show Mr. McCain ahead of Mr. Bush by more than 20 percentage points, even though the state's governor, Paul Cellucci, and the state party are supporting Mr. Bush.
A poll released on Feb. 25 showed Mr. McCain drawing strong support from registered Republicans and sweeping every demographic category.
In September, polls showed that Mr. Gore led Mr. Bradley 40 percent to 36 percent.
But Gerry Chervinsky, a pollster with KRC Communications Research in Newton, Mass., said things had changed drastically. "Gore will win convincingly," Mr. Chervinsky said. "Massachusetts still loves Clinton, there's no Clinton fatigue here."
 
Minnesota
 
POPULATION: 4,725,419
MEDIAN INCOME: $47,926
 
VOTING RULES -- Voters declare they are members of a party before voting in caucus.
DELEGATES -- 34 Republicans. Caucuses hold nonbinding straw polls on candidates and elect delegates to conventions that pick parties' national convention delegates.
CANDIDATE VISITS -- Bradley 3, Bush 1, Gore 2, McCain 0.
This is the largest state in which both parties choose their delegates at caucuses. The Democrats will hold theirs on March 11 and 12.
The Republicans are also holding a straw poll, but the outcome will have no binding effect on delegate selection.
The advantage in caucus states usually goes to the candidates with the best organizations, so it is assumed that Mr. Bush will win most of the support at the Republican precinct caucuses on Tuesday. Mr. McCain has no official campaign in the state. The latest polls show Mr. Bush ahead in public opinion.
But in politics, Minnesotans often go against the grain. There is no registration by party in the state. Voters will be free to attend whichever caucuses they please. And no one is able to predict the size of the turnout or the outcome with confidence.
 
Missouri
 
POPULATION: 5,438,559
MEDIAN INCOME: $40,201
 
VOTING RULES -- Voters can cast ballots in either primary.
DELEGATES -- 75 Democratic. 35 Republican, winner take all.
CANDIDATE VISITS -- Bradley 9, Bush 5, Gore 1, McCain 2.
 Mr. Bush and Mr. McCain made in-and-out stops in Missouri last week, but neither candidate has put many resources into the state. The most recent polls show Mr. Bush somewhat ahead. But Missouri does not have party registration, so it is hard to predict who will turn out for which primary.
Mr. Bradley was reared in Crystal City, down the Mississippi River from St. Louis, and he announced his candidacy there. Mr. Bradley also seems to have done more television advertising in the state than any other presidential candidate. But none of the state's Democratic Party leaders are suggesting that he will come out ahead of Mr. Gore on Tuesday.
 
North Dakota
 
POPULATION: 638,244
MEDIAN INCOME: $30,304
North Dakota's Democratic caucuses are essentially a beauty contest. The state's 14 Democratic delegates will be chosen at the state party convention in April.
The state's two senators and one House member are Democrats, but North Dakota has not voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964. Neither Mr. Gore nor Mr. Bradley has had any significant organization here.
No statewide polls have been conducted on the race, but Mr. Gore is expected to dominate the delegate selection.
The Republicans held their caucuses on Feb. 29. Mr. Bush won with 76 percent of the vote, taking all 19 delegates.
 
Ohio
 
POPULATION: 11,209,493
MEDIAN INCOME: $38,925
 
VOTING RULES -- Voters can cast ballots in either primary, after enrolling in a party at the polls.
DELEGATES -- 146 Democratic. 69 Republican, 57 winner-take-all per Congressional district, 12 at-large, winner-take-all overall.
CANDIDATE VISITS -- Bradley 4, Bush 6, Gore 7, McCain 2.
Mr. McCain has high hopes for Ohio, the third largest state voting on March 7. Independents and Democrats are free to vote in the Republican primary. Similar rules led to his victory in Michigan on Feb. 22.
Mr. McCain has run a substantial amount of advertising on television. His stops in Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati last weekend received considerable coverage in newspapers and on television news shows.
But Mr. McCain has little organization in the state. Mr. Bush, on the other hand, has the support of Gov. Bob Taft and almost all other prominent Republicans in the state, and he is organized in each of Ohio's 88 counties. The latest polls show Mr. Bush with a modest lead.
On the Democratic side, Mr. Gore appears to be comfortably ahead. Union families and African-Americans are disproportionately important in Democratic primaries in Ohio, and Mr. Gore seems to have solid support from those groups.
 
Rhode Island
 
POPULATION: 988,480
MEDIAN INCOME: $40,686
 
VOTING RULES -- No crossover voting, but independent voters can cast ballots in either primary.
DELEGATES -- 22 Democratic, 14 Republican, winner take all.
CANDIDATE VISITS -- Bradley 3, Bush 1, Gore 3, McCain 1.
Rhode Island is one of New England's most staunchly Democratic states. Only about 15,000 of the state's 600,000 voters -- or 2.5 percent -- cast ballots in the 1996 Republican presidential primary.
Every winner of New Hampshire's presidential primary since 1972 has also won in Rhode Island, and Mr. McCain and Mr. Gore are the clear favorites on Tuesday.
Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush have the support of the top officials in their parties. Gov. Lincoln C. Almond and Senator Lincoln Chafee support Mr. Bush. Senator Jack Reed and Representatives Bob Weygand and Patrick J. Kennedy are behind Mr. Gore.
But like voters in neighboring Connecticut, Rhode Island's voters are historically independent of party machinery, and 39 percent of the electorate, according to a recent survey, may still be undecided.
 
Vermont
 
POPULATION: 590,883
MEDIAN INCOME: $39,372
 
VOTING RULES -- Voters can cast ballots in either primary.
DELEGATES -- 15 Democratic, 12 Republican, winner-take-all.
CANDIDATE VISITS -- Bradley 1, Bush 1, Gore 0, McCain 1.
Mr. McCain's core theme of campaign finance reform will find a ready audience in Vermont, which has some of the nation's strictest rules on donations.
With independents and Democrats far outnumbering Republicans, and the primaries open to all voters, Mr. McCain will have an advantage. Polls show him leading Mr. Bush by about 20 points.
McCain forces are predicting victory in the election, only the second binding primaries held in Vermont.
On the Democratic side, Mr. Bradley is better organized than in most other states, and his campaign has been well received by liberal Democrats and independents.
Mr. Bradley has received endorsements from members of the state's Democratic national committee delegation, but Gov. Howard Dean and several other top state officials have come out for Mr. Gore. Recent polls show the vice president leading Mr. Bradley 56 percent to 35 percent.
 
Washington
 
POPULATION: 5,689,263
MEDIAN INCOME: $47,421
Despite the attention lavished on Washington State by candidates of both parties for last week's primary, it was, in terms of collecting delegates to the national convention, an almost meaningless exercise.
For the Democrats, the primary, which Mr. Gore won easily despite Mr. Bradley's nearly nonstop presence in the state for a week, was a beauty contest only. For the Republicans, just 12 delegates were at stake; Mr. Bush collected 7 and Mr. McCain 12 in a proportional allocation of the votes.
Thus, Tuesday's caucuses will be the deciding factor in allocating 94 Democratic delegates and 25 Republican delegates. Since the caucuses tend to attract die-hard elements of each party, both Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore, the winners in the broader primary voting, are expected to do well.

HEADLINE: Unesco's Fat Gets a Trim And Reform Is in the Air

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, March 3

 BODY:
In the family of United Nations agencies, Unesco has long been the spoiled child. The top jobs -- in Paris, no less -- were invariably cushy and easy to get with a little political pull. Reformers anxious to curb the selfish traits of this wayward offspring came and went without a trace.
When a new director general with new ideas, Koichiro Matsuura of Japan, was elected last fall, he thought he knew quite a bit about how bad things were. He had been Japan's ambassador in Paris for five years and chairman of Unesco's World Heritage Committee. 
 "But I discovered once I was inside that the mismanagement was much more serious than I had anticipated -- a lot of arbitrary appointments, arbitrary promotions," he said in an interview. His office alone had 20 politically appointed advisers hired without professional screening. They were soon dismissed.
Mr. Matsuura, a lawyer and economist who graduated from Haverford College in 1961 after four years at Tokyo University, made tough speeches to the board of the agency -- formally the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization -- and to its staff. He opened a Web site for complaints from the 2,500 employees.
"I discovered that there were a lot of people more demoralized than I had anticipated," he said. "Rewards to the undeserving, not to those who deserved them -- that was a common theme." He found that some departments had refused to meet with outside auditors, and in-house auditing systems were "weak, almost nonexistent."
Mr. Matsuura, 62, a veteran diplomat who is fluent in English, French and Spanish, succeeded Federico Mayor Zaragoza of Spain. Mr. Mayor is blamed for acquiescing to many political appointments demanded by member nations but won praise in his two-year term above all for squashing Unesco's efforts to develop a "new international information order," which many nations saw as an attempt to regulate or muzzle the press.
In 1984, the information proposal and mismanagement at the top of the organization prompted the United States to withdraw from Unesco. Britain and Singapore followed suit, but Britain went back in 1997 under Prime Minister Tony Blair. President Clinton told Unesco in 1995 that he was prepared to restore American membership, but administration officials say there is no money to rejoin.
Mr. Matsuura hopes to tempt the United States back in with a reform plan he says he will put in place this spring.
David Malone, president of the International Peace Academy in New York and a former Canadian Foreign Ministry official in charge of relations with international agencies, is skeptical.
"I think Matsuura faces an uphill battle in turning around an organization which is deeply scarred," he said.
"The problem of Unesco is that successive heads have turned it into a personal patronage machine, neglecting programs and bloating the staffing," Mr. Malone said. "We used to all know what the Unesco objectives were. Now nobody knows what Unesco does beyond the World Heritage sites. The important work is on literacy, education, key cultural monuments and themes, and serving as a forum for the promotion of high scientific standards. Who ever consults Unesco now on science?"
Mr. Matsuura is the first Asian to head Unesco, which was established in 1946. Since then, Mr. Matsuura said, the world has changed "and we must evolve with it." He says Unesco, with a largely Europeanized view of culture -- more than half of the 630 World Heritage sites are in Europe -- needs to extend more help to the poorer nations that also want to save their historical artifacts and natural sites and cultures not necessarily covered by the current convention governing world heritage.
"We cannot be simply content with promoting intellectual cooperation among developed nations, without paying attention to the needs of developing nations," Mr. Matsuura said. "The convention only covers tangible things. It does not cover intangibles like craftsmanship, music, tradition and languages."
Unesco was founded to promote peace through knowledge and communication, Mr. Matsuura said, and he is planning to interpret that in very concrete ways. Unesco has already been involved in projects as diverse as restoring colonial Havana and recreating a traditional silk industry in Cambodia.
Mr. Matsuura is making a big push into education. He has been asked by Bolivia to help create a higher education system, and Haiti is seeking advice on all levels of schooling. But the biggest job will be Nigeria, where President Olusegun Obasanjo is asking Unesco to design a basic school system. "There is a country of 120 million people," he said, "and their education is in shambles."

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
Finding Ways to Dabble in Cuba, Legally

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

 BODY:
WITH the custody battle over little Elian Gonzalez in the news nearly every day, the Cuba question is again on many minds, including those of some frustrated American investors who see opportunities slipping away.
Since the Soviet Union fell apart, President Fidel Castro has been forced to flirt with capitalism and the United States dollar he once despised. Investors from Canada and many other countries have poured huge sums into Cuba. And a few Americans are putting their money into third-country companies and closed-end funds with exposure to Cuba -- although the legality of some of this investing by Americans is, at best, blurry. 
 "Politics aside," said Enrique J. Lopez, a Cuban-American telecommunications consultant in Hialeah, Fla., "Cuba is moving."
The embargo enacted almost 40 years ago still forbids direct American investments. The Cuba-U.S. Trade and Economic Council, a business group based in New York, advises Americans that investing in a foreign company doing business in Cuba is legal so long as they do not own a controlling stake in the company, and provided that Cuba is not the source of more than half its revenues.
But government regulators say the council is interpreting the exceptions too broadly. Both sides agree that buying into a company like Sherritt International, a Canadian mining concern, is prohibited because a majority of Sherritt's assets are in Cuba. But other investments are less clear, and the Office of Foreign Assets Control is reluctant to offer guidance.
A more recent trap facing investors in Cuba is the Helms-Burton law, enacted in 1996, which prohibits business executives who use property that Mr. Castro confiscated from American owners from entering the United States.
So Cuban investment plays are not for the faint of heart. But they have the advantage of already being in place if, and when, the embargo ends.
One of the newest Cuban ventures is Leisure Canada, a Vancouver development company. It expects to break ground in April on a 370-room tourist hotel on a 2-square-mile beachfront property between Havana and the resort of Varadero.
A Cuban state tourism company will put up $7.5 million in equity, which will be matched by Leisure Canada. The remaining half of the $30 million project will be financed by some Canadian institutions.
To avoid problems with the Helms-Burton law, Wally Berukoff, chief executive of Leisure Canada, said he investigated 443 properties before selecting sites that he was satisfied had no American links. But the bet for American investors is that the embargo will not be in place by the time the hotel is up and running, in a couple of years.
Leisure Canada trades on Canada's new national exchange, the CDNX. Share prices hit a high in the last year of $3.50 (Canadian) but now trade at $1.78. Analysts expect the stock to remain flat until construction is complete. Mr. Berukoff believes that 10 to 15 percent of the company's 3,000 shareholders may be Americans. And Robertson Stephens owns 26 percent of Leisure Canada through an offshore fund.
Alan B. Snyder, president of Snyder Capital Management in San Francisco, recently decided to buy into Leisure Canada. "At these prices," he said, "the stock is kind of a perpetual option on Castro and the future of Cuba without him."
MORE adventurous investors may be tempted to get into the Beta Gran Caribe fund, a British closed-end fund that is not waiting for Castro's government to fall. The fund already has 14 investments in Cuba valued at $26 million. "We're mostly holding things at cost, anticipating real increases in three to four years," said Peter A. Scott, chairman of Beta.
The most prominent investments are in biotechnology. The fund, for example, owns about 5 percent of York Medical, a private company in Toronto that tests and licenses Cuban medical breakthroughs like a promising anticancer vaccine.
Beta is traded on the Dublin Stock Exchange, but can also be bought through Cedel, a European clearing house. Shares traded recently at 4.75 Swiss francs. Mr. Scott said he did not know if Americans participate because he never asks investors to identify themselves. "In theory, we care if Americans are involved," he said. "But in practice, we're not going to know anyway."
ONE way around the regulatory morass could be the closed-end Herzfeld Caribbean Basin fund (ticker symbol: CUBA), which has about $9.8 million invested in companies outside Cuba, many of which would benefit from Mr. Castro's fall. The fund returned 22.9 percent last year, and closed at $5.125 on Friday, off 4.7 percent for the year to date.
 The fund's top holding is Florida East Coast Industries, which runs a railroad from Miami to Jacksonville. Thomas J. Herzfeld, the fund's manager, says that if the embargo is lifted, the railroad would be used to haul goods shipped to and from Cuba. Its stock closed at $40.75 on Friday, off 20 percent from its January high.
There's even a speculative Cuban bond play. Mr. Herzfeld's fund holds $165,000 in face amount of Cuba's sovereign debt, known as "Batista bonds." Mr. Herzfeld bought them for $63,000 in 1995 and said they could be worth as much as $291,000, including interest, if paid in full. (The bonds are now valued at zero.)
Americans eager for a piece of Cuba can also invest in companies that stand to benefit if the government pays off its debts. The ITT Corporation used to own the Cuban telephone system. When ITT split into three companies in the 1990's, each inherited part of a $130 million-plus-interest claim on property confiscated by the Castro regime.
The Italian company that now runs the Cuban telephone system is paying ITT's successors a total of $30 million over 10 years for the right to temporarily use the confiscated property. If the claim is ever settled, the smallest of ITT's offspring, ITT Educational Services, with a market capitalization of $361.5 million, could see a modest bump up in its shares.

HEADLINE: Who Needs a Diploma?

BYLINE: By Mark Wallace; Mark Wallace, a college dropout, is a frequent contributor to the weekend Financial Times.

 BODY:
A couple of years ago, just before Dan Hammans dropped out of high school, his guidance counselor told him that he would never earn more than $15,000 a year, that he would never hold a job for more than six months at a time and that, to put it plainly, he would never amount to anything. "He pretty much told me I was a loser," Dan says. He is sitting in his 1999 Mitsubishi Eclipse, which is fire-engine red, cost $23,000 and boasts 210 horsepower off the factory floor -- though with Dan's modifications, that's up to 260. Dan is on his way home from a job at which he earns roughly $1,600 every two weeks, or about $25,000 more each year than a certain Mr. Sternberg of Gilbert High School in Iowa would have thought possible.
"What the heck?" Dan mutters at a passing car. "That's a real interesting body kit. It's got Ferrari side skirts or something." When traffic is light (and the Eclipse running well), the drive to Richardson, where Dan lives, just outside of Dallas, takes about 15 minutes door to door, though on bad days it can take more than an hour. Commuting is one of the small annoyances Dan has learned to put up with in his new life as a computer networking engineer, though it is clearly not as frustrating as walking a mile through subzero Iowa winters to grade school. Such experiences, Dan says, help explain his preoccupation with fast cars. There is that, of course, and then there is the fact that he is 19. "I'm also fascinated by traffic patterns," he says after being cut off by another driver. "It reminds me of fluid dynamics." 
 Mr. Sternberg can perhaps be forgiven his pessimism: in the United States, 25-year-old male high school dropouts make less than $25,000 a year, on average. Their compatriots with high-school diplomas make only about $31,000, the same starting salary as college graduates with engineering degrees.
The Department of Education does not compile data for 19-year-old high school dropouts with a natural working knowledge of computer systems who teach themselves fluid dynamics in order to design airflow parts for their new cars. But perhaps they should: more and more American teenagers are forgoing college educations or even dropping out of high schools to "drop in" to jobs created by the technological revolution. "I've talked to some people who go to college," says Anthony Yarbrough, 19, a network engineer who graduated from high school last year. "They say, 'O.K., we read this book all day; we get to do a little of this.' From what they're telling me, I'm learning a lot more just working than I would've in the college system."
Bonnie Halper, whose high-tech placement firm,
Sendresume.com, occasionally finds jobs for such young people, says: "When I look at some of the resumes that I get from people right out of college, I think, Why are they teaching you these useless technologies?" Dan and Anthony, by contrast, learned their skills not in classrooms but in pursuit of the passions that grip so many teenagers these days: computer games, digital music, video editing, computer animation and film. They are hobbyists whose hobby just happens to be part of the fastest-growing industry on the planet, and they are learning to take advantage of it.
Though Dan wouldn't like to admit it, we are lost. It is early afternoon, and a brief stretch of President George Bush Turnpike (estimated completion date: 2004) stands weirdly overhead to the left, connecting one patch of flat Texas sky to another. Orange detour cones have left us well north of the customer we are to see, but Verio, the company for which Dan works, gives him 31 cents a mile to take the Eclipse on site visits, and we've skipped lunch to arrive on time.
At the site, a long, low concrete commercial block that houses a telecoms company, we are led through an open-plan cubicle warren so vast that the paths between cubes have been given street names. Just off Crowley Avenue, between Colleyville Road and Clyde Boulevard, sits the "electrical room," where Dan is to test three network lines. To do this, he has brought a small device known as a router, with which he will "ping" a similar device back at the office, some 15 miles away.
Routers are the traffic cops of the Internet, guiding countless bits of information between computers, e-mail servers and Web sites around the globe. An intimate knowledge of routers comes in handy at Verio, one of the largest Web-site hosting companies in the world, but this is a knowledge Dan has only imperfectly at present. Most of his morning was spent back at Verio trying to get the two routers to talk to each other -- though at one point there was a break to check out a new screen saver, based on "The Matrix" ("awesome," in Dan's estimation).
At the site visit, the problem is solved with a call to Dan's boss, but the morning has not been in vain. This is what passes for training in an industry that moves too quickly for textbooks and knows precious few rules. "When I got this job," Dan says, "they'd ask me, 'Do you know how to do this?' And I'd say, 'No, but I will by the time I get it done."'
That Dan came to Verio with gaps in his skill set is fine with his boss. "I learned stuff on the job from scratch, which is the way I feel people should learn their jobs," Ric Moseley says. "I'm not sure Dan's quite as mature as he needs to be -- a lot of that maturity I think is learned in college -- but four years anywhere is going to do something to you, being out on your own for the first time, meeting new people, having to deal with different situations by yourself. Which is what he's doing now."
The network test takes only a few minutes, and Dan is back in the office by 4 o'clock. "I'm going to be glad when this day's over," Dan says. "I guess I'm always just paranoid about doing things wrong."
I first met Dan in Manhattan, where he was competing in a professional computer gamers' tournament. A past champion, Dan estimates he has garnered almost $100,000 in cash, prizes and endorsements since he began competing in 1995. Computer games have also been Dan's ticket to the job market. He learned his networking skills at "LAN parties" in the mid-90's, wiring friends' computers into Local Area Networks for all-night sessions of video games like Quake. (Ric Moseley, who is 28, learned his trade the same way.)
And even in the Internet age, it is whom you know. Dan landed his first job in Dallas, testing computer games, through contacts made at Quake tournaments. In March 1999, he moved out of his parents' house and joined the skilled labor force. Most of us take much longer to reach that point. For Dan, it came when he was barely old enough to vote.
Teenagers, of course, have been dropping out for as long as schools have been in session. While most probably still become manual laborers or minimum-wage toilers, our fast, new information-age economy allows some dropouts to move along productive paths rather than simply run from age-old conflicts. Like Dan, some even seem to be doing both. "It really was hard having a pager in high school," says Michael Menefee, a 21-year-old product developer who dropped out of college after just a few months. "The principal would say, 'I'll just hold this for you, and if you get a page, I'll come get you.' Well, that's not the point. The point is, I'm making more than my teachers."
Still, as Dan's mother, Alice Hammans, says, dropping out is no guarantee of a good job: "You don't get something for nothing. Daniel hasn't just begun in the work world without first acquiring a lot of knowledge." His schooling in computers, in fact, began around the age of 3, when his father got a Commodore 64, one of the first home-computer systems. By 7, Dan was programming in Basic. In high school -- just as the World Wide Web was exploding into America's consciousness -- Dan got a part-time job at a local Internet service provider. Dan describes his childhood as happy, sort of, until he got into school. "Dan had a really hard time in grade school," his mother says, "so he just chose an alternate path. Luckily, because of everything that he has internally, he was able to make it."
Other "drop-ins" echo Dan's frustration. "I was always one of those people who sat there and argued with my teachers about why I should be in school all the time," says Matt Levine, who, at 18, has decided that starting an Internet-based media company is more important than college. "I looked at the opportunity and the opportunity cost, and sort of went where my heart desired, at least for the moment."
Furthermore, says Peter Pathos, founder and chief executive of Theplanet.com, a Dallas start-up specializing in "advanced" Web hosting, "Right now, I think there's much more opportunity diving into the phenomenon than going to college." Pathos employs both Anthony Yarbrough and Michael Menefee, as well as other "drop-in" young adults. "There's almost a gap between the ones you catch right out of high school and the ones who've been used up and burned out by the time they're 21 or 22 by the high-tech jobs," he says of his employees. "The younger ones are some of the most talented people."
It's a busy Friday night, and Dan is having dinner at Campisi's Egyptian with his girlfriend, Wendy, an 18-year-old pre-med student at the University of Texas, and his roommate, Mike, a 23-year-old college dropout who works in computer game design, something Dan hopes one day to pursue. The place is aclatter with waiters and barmen and locals cheering the Dallas Stars, but none of this seems to reach Dan, who is lost in a video game on the tiny screen of his cellular phone. "Take this away from me," he tells Mike, after we have put off ordering a second time. The episode sparks a reminiscence of early video games and the Commodore 64's Dan and Mike both owned as children. "We had one we actually used for a stepping stool," Mike says, "because it was so solid." Dan describes with pride loading games onto the Commodore system at the age of 4, which involved typing commands his father had printed on the disk. Though he couldn't yet read, he was able to copy letters well enough to get the computer to play the game.
"Even back then," Mike says, "even when we didn't know anything about computers, I always thought it was silly that it didn't just load the game, that you had to type something." It is a small point, but a telling one. When the Commodore 64 came along, those of us old enough to read followed the instructions. But Dan and Mike are unburdened by such received wisdom. They are first-generation citizens of the information age, not immigrants to it, and are intuitively familiar with its language and its ways. We who remember the dawn of the personal computer may feel that the future has at long last arrived, but Dan and Mike were born into that future. It is nothing more exciting than their present day.
Though Dan is currently wrapping up his G.E.D., his education is not over yet. With Verio's help, he plans to go after a Cisco Certified Internetwork Expert certificate, the information-age equivalent of an M.B.A. According to Cisco, the starting salary for the 2,000 or so C.C.I.E.'s awarded thus far in the United States is roughly $75,000. Even without a Cisco certification, it's impossible to tell how far Dan could go in the high-tech job market, where brain sweat and elbow grease are still the best predictors of long-term earning potential.
Dan's stormy relationship with school may have cost him little in terms of salary and the kind of statistics tracked by the Department of Ed., but even at 19, he recognizes that stepping through the door to the adult world of work has left other doors to swing shut behind him. "The day I realized I would never go to college, I was really bummed out," he says. "I wanted to play hockey. In high school, I was, like, twice as good at hockey as I am now at Quake, and as much as I love Quake, I loved hockey twice as much.
"That's really the only regret that I have. I watched people that I played with go on to play for Iowa State, and they won the national championship last year and they were awesome."

HEADLINE: Domestic Violence And the Workplace

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Agony of Domestic Violence at the Office" (Workplace section, March 1): Studies indicate that up to one-half of domestic violence victims have lost a job due, at least in part, to the violence. In most states, an employer is free to fire a domestic violence victim simply because she is battered. That is why we need laws -- like Intro 400-A, introduced this January in the New York City Council, and the federal Violence Against Women Act of 1999 and Battered Women's Economic Security and Safety Act of 1999, pending in Congress -- that would prohibit employers from such discrimination. 
 Because a woman's job is frequently the key factor that will enable her to leave a violent relationship, it is imperative that employees coping with abuse not be penalized for disclosing this information to their employers.

HEADLINE: Making the Rich Richer

BYLINE: By Richard Rorty; Richard Rorty teaches at Stanford University and is the author of "Achieving Our Country."

DATELINE: STANFORD, Calif.

 BODY:
A few days ago I got a nice letter from the Social Security Administration, telling me that I was entitled to some $1,600 a month, but that unfortunately I couldn't receive it because I was still earning a lot of money. Last week I opened the newspaper to find that the House of Representatives has voted unanimously to have the money sent to me anyway. The Senate and the president, it appears, are quite prepared to approve this change. So in the course of this year I shall get government checks for about $20,000. About $8,000 of it will go for federal and state taxes, but I shall still have a net $1,000 extra a month that I never expected to have.
I do not feel entitled to that money. Like a lot of other Americans who are 68, I am making a very good living. When I stop working I will get a pension that ensures that I still live perfectly comfortably. I would like Congress to use the Social Security taxes I've paid over the last 45 years to promote the general welfare. 
 That means leveling things out a bit, so that my fellow 68-year-olds who could not go to college, and could not get nice, highly paid, white-collar jobs like mine, will have a better chance at a reasonably comfortable old age. Congress could have sent the extra money it wants to send me, and millions like me, to some of my fellow sexagenarians who do need it. These include all those arthritic 68-year-olds who are shelving groceries, or standing on their feet all day making change, for $7 a hour. They are doing this because their monthly Social Security payments will probably never rise above $1,000.
Members of Congress know perfectly well that the rich have been getting steadily richer and the poor poorer -- that Americans like me are getting a bigger and bigger share of the gross national product, whereas the people who clean the toilets in my office building are getting less and less of it. But this knowledge seems to have no influence on them whatever. They act as if promoting the general welfare meant promoting the interest of people who make more than $50,000 a year. As Nicholas von Hoffman has put it, we live under "government of the comfortable, by the comfortable and for the comfortable."
Once the boom stops, and the Silicon Valley bubble bursts, we can expect our elected representatives to take considerable pains to see that the comfortable remain comfortable, while letting the poor assume any burdens that must be borne. The man who puts in eight hours making sandwiches at a cafeteria on the Stanford campus, and another eight hours bringing glasses of ever fruitier cabernet and ever spicier chardonnay to us comfortably off folk in one of Palo Alto's better restaurants, will probably lose his second job, because many of the professionals in Silicon Valley will start drinking jug wine at home.
This will probably mean that this man cannot move his kids into a school district where they might learn something, and that they will never get properly educated. Our elected representatives can be expected to look with equanimity on this steady reinforcement of our present system of hereditary castes.
President Clinton has said that he will sign the legislation that gives me that extra $1,000 a month. He should think again. He is a decent and generous-spirited man, whose attempts to do the right thing have been frustrated by Republican majorities in Congress. But he could use his last year in office to speak out. With the backing of Vice President Al Gore and former Senator Bill Bradley, he could ask Congress to take the bill back and make it a little less absurd -- a little more fair, a little less selfish.
Our president has been good at political compromises, but unless he takes a few uncompromising stands before leaving office he will go down in history as having acquiesced in our nation's moral decline. This decline has nothing to do with our sexual mores. It has everything to do with our increasing willingness to let the rich take more and more from the poor.

HEADLINE: Boycott Over Battle Flag Has Spoleto Under Siege

BYLINE: By IRVIN MOLOTSKY 

 BODY:
The director of the highly regarded Spoleto Festival U.S.A. in Charleston, S.C., says he is determined to put on this year's event despite an economic boycott organized to protest the flying of the Confederate battle flag over the State Capitol and his own abhorrence of the flag.
Because of the boycott, called by the state branch of the N.A.A.C.P., one of the festival's marquee performers, Bill T. Jones, has withdrawn his dance company from the festival. In addition at least half a dozen performers, including Patti LaBelle and the O'Jays, have canceled other concerts in the state in the last month. 
 Still, Nigel Redden, Spoleto's general director, said that despite his personal opposition to the flying of the flag, the 18-day festival, which runs from May 25 to June 11 and is the pre-eminent arts event in the Southeast, would go on.
He also said that he hoped that the flag, which the N.A.A.C.P. and its allies regard as a symbol of racism, would be removed before the end of the legislative session, which runs until June 1 and overlaps with Spoleto.
If it is removed and the boycott is ended, Mr. Jones will perform, both the dancer and Mr. Redden said. "But we can't plan on that," Mr. Redden added.
In an interview, Mr. Jones said of his cancellation, "It was the only decision I could make."
On Friday Mr. Redden and the Spoleto board's executive committee issued a statement saying that while they supported the flag's removal, all the artists scheduled to appear had been asked to do so in spite of the boycott "because the festival strongly believes that the arts have a unique ability to stimulate debate, draw people together and ultimately to change them in ways nothing else can."
Mr. Redden said that no corporations or foundations had withdrawn their support because of the boycott, but that "two corporations we had been courting said it would be difficult at this time."
He said it was too early to determine what impact the boycott might have on ticket sales, which are slightly up from this time last year.
"However," Mr. Redden added, "we are receiving letters from people saying they will not come if the boycott continues."
Spoleto U.S.A. has a major impact on the South Carolina economy. Last year the state estimated that the festival had generated $1 billion in local spending since it began in 1977 as the American counterpart of the festival founded in Spoleto, Italy, by Gian-Carlo Menotti. Ms. LaBelle had been scheduled to give a concert at the Carolina Coliseum on the campus of the University of South Carolina in Columbia on April 8.
After she canceled, the concert's producer, Woody Johnston, lined up five rhythm-and-blues acts, including the O'Jays, to replace her. But they also withdrew.
Mr. Johnston said he agreed with the singers' decision to adhere to the boycott, which several sports organizations are also supporting. They include the New York Knicks, who are to stop using the College of Charleston as a training site. "It's only going to get worse until the flag comes down," Mr. Johnston said.
The speaker of the South Carolina House, David H. Wilkins, who defends the battle flag as a symbol of tradition, said, "I would like very much to resolve this issue with dignity and finality."
He has proposed removing the flag to the Confederate Soldiers Monument in front of the Capitol, but the N.A.A.C.P. has rejected the idea, and both sides appear to be hardening their positions.
Dwight C. James, the executive director of the N.A.A.C.P. branches in South Carolina, said he was pleased by Mr. Jones's withdrawal from the festival.
"It speaks well of Mr. Jones's character," he said, "that he has the courage to take an individual stand when he sees something that's wrong, to have this symbol of bigotry and oppression removed from the State Capitol of South Carolina."
Mr. James added that he hoped others would follow Mr. Jones's example, forcing a cancellation of the festival. "The festival, because of its impact on the tourism industry, is a prime target," Mr. James said. "We have reached a lot of folks who make up the audience."
Since Mr. Jones first approached the N.A.A.C.P. when he heard about the boycott, the organization has been trying to persuade other performers to cancel their appearances at Spoleto. So far none have, Mr. James said, adding that he remained hopeful.
Mr. Redden said he would allow any performer to cancel a contract because of the boycott with no ill feelings. Both he and Mr. Jones said they hoped the dispute would end in time for Mr. Jones to appear at the festival, and Mr. Redden said, "I am already talking to Bill about future engagements."
Most performers scheduled to appear at Spoleto did not respond to phone calls about their plans. One that did was the American Music Theater Group of New York, which is to perform "Running Man," a jazz-inspired opera written by a black composer and performed by an all-black cast to the music of a mostly black band.
Diane Wondisford, the group's general director, said the company had decided to go ahead with its performances. "I have had discussions with the composer, Deirdre Murray, and others," she said, "and they are respectful of the position taken by Bill T. Jones and are confident that the Spoleto Festival, working on behalf of the participants and South Carolina, will do the right thing."
Joseph Flummerfelt, artistic director for choral activities at the festival, said the Westminster Choir College at Rider University in Princeton, N.J., of which he is artistic director and principal conductor, would also appear even though he is adamantly opposed to the flag's remaining. "It's a big opportunity for the students," he said. "None of us like this, but we have not considered withdrawing from the festival."
If the flag does not come down and the boycott continues, "it could impinge upon the life of the festival," Mr. Flummerfelt said.
Mr. Johnston, the producer of the canceled LaBelle show, said the artists who would have performed at the Carolina Coliseum as her substitutes had they not canceled as well were Destiny's Child, a rhythm-and-blues group, and the singers Eric Benet, Brian McKnight and Gerald LeVert, as well as the O'Jays.
"I know that other promoters aren't going in there because of the boycott," Mr. Johnston said. "It will be a unison situation."

HEADLINE: General Electric Forms E-Commerce Division

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: ORLANDO, Fla., March 5

 BODY:
The General Electric Company, already one of the top providers of electronic purchasing systems, said that it had formed an electronic-commerce unit that would compete with companies like Commerce One Inc. and Ariba Inc.
The company's GE Information Services unit now competes with I.B.M. for trading systems between companies that order, ship and track supplies and products. Now it will offer data exchange, purchasing software and services and trading-partner exchanges over the Internet. 
 G.E. wants to tap a business-to-business Internet market that is expected to rise to $1.3 trillion in 2003 from $109 billion last year, according to Forrester Research. The company split GE Information Services into two units, investing an undisclosed amount into the resulting businesses. The Internet business is called GE Global Exchange Services.
"We come to market with a good 30 years already, with a trading partner community of 100,000," said Harvey Seegers, who will head the new Internet business. "This is not a start-up."
GE Global Exchange Services has about 1,500 employees. Mr. Seegers declined to disclose how much the company expected in revenue in its first year, though he said the unit would have in "excess of $1 billion four to five years out."
The brand name GE Information Services has been retired, the company said. Customers will continue to be served by the other unit, called GE Systems Services, which has about 500 employees.
GE Global Exchange Services competes in an arena that has a "much larger order of magnitude" than Commerce One's because it will offer broader services, Mr. Seegers said. The GE unit will look for partners to expand its offerings, though it did not provide details.
"The Internet is key to enabling millions of small- and medium-sized businesses without e-commerce capabilities to join our global trading community," Mr. Seegers said.
Mr. Seegers also said he envisioned the unit offering auction services, such as those offered by Freemarkets Inc., and others. "We're taking something already very good, putting a huge investment in it, and turning it into the de facto standard," he said.

HEADLINE: Colombia And Copters And Clash Over Choice

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
For most of the last three years, Clinton administration officials battled tirelessly with Republicans in Congress over what might be the right helicopters for Colombia's fight against illegal drugs.
When the Republicans sought six top-of-the-line helicopters for the Colombian police, administration officials insisted that a rebuilt version of the old Vietnam-era workhorse, the UH-1H Huey, would do fine. They said that buying the more expensive aircraft, which cost roughly five times as much, would throw the State Department's drug-enforcement budget out of whack. 
 Then, in late December, White House officials confirmed a change of heart.
Going beyond their aides' most ambitious recommendation, officials said, senior officials proposed immediately buying 30 of the helicopters they had once rejected, the Sikorsky UH-60L Blackhawk, at a cost of almost $400 million.
It was Christmas not only for the much-criticized Colombian military, which is to receive the aircraft, but also for United Technologies Corporation, the Connecticut-based conglomerate that makes the Blackhawk and has been struggling with declining orders from the Pentagon.
Now, however, the plan is drawing attention to the lobbying efforts of United Technologies, a major military contractor and political contributor, the political payoff for Democratic legislators from the state, and the policy choices implied in the $1.28 billion aid package that the White House has put forward for Colombia.
The proposal also illuminates the political dynamics of what would be Washington's first large-scale involvement in a civil conflict in Latin America since the cold war, an initiative that has brought unlikely alliances on every side.
"This would be a great relief package -- for the state of Connecticut," said Representative Cass Ballenger, a North Carolina Republican and a supporter of rival helicopter companies. Mr. Ballenger is one of several Republicans who have joined with some political liberals to urge the administration to consider substituting the cheaper Hueys it once championed for some Blackhawks.
Even if the United States bought Colombia a handful of the Blackhawks and dozens of the rebuilt Hueys, Mr. Ballenger said wryly, "you'd still have $100 million or $200 million left over to buy Democrats or Republicans or whatever you still needed" to win approval of the plan.
Administration officials acknowledged that they had been the target of a long lobbying campaign for Blackhawk sales to Colombia by United Technologies and its supporters. A competing push was made by Bell Helicopter Textron, the Texas subsidiary of Textron that produces the so-called Huey II that has been considered as an alternative.
But White House officials denied that politics influenced their decision, saying they followed the advice of military and intelligence experts. "It is ferociously expensive," Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, the White House drug policy director, said of the Blackhawk. But he added, "It's a hugely capable piece of machinery."
The 30 Blackhawks, along with a temporary fleet of 33 surplus UH-1N helicopters, are intended to fly new, American-trained battalions of the Colombian Army into the coca-growing regions of southern Colombia dominated by leftist guerrillas. There, the soldiers are to beat back the traffickers and the rebels who protect their operations.
There is no question that a lack of mobility has been one of the Colombian military's biggest problems. It is also widely agreed that the Blackhawk is a much better aircraft than the Huey II: it can fly farther and faster, carry more troops and better withstand groundfire. But the Blackhawks also pose some significant problems.
Officials say it could take until late next year for all the aircraft to be made; it may take almost that long for Colombian pilots to be trained or retrained to fly them.
The high cost of the Blackhawks -- $12.8 million each, according to administration figures, as opposed to $1.8 million for Huey II's -- has also been brought into relief by the risk that the insurgents, flush with drug money, could acquire surface-to-air missiles to shoot them down.
"What you can absolutely count on is that with the Blackhawks or the beefed-up Hueys, the bad guys are going to acquire surface-to-air missiles; helicopters will be shot down," said Gen. Fred F. Woerner, retired, who commanded United States forces in Latin America in the late 1980's. "The question is, will we replace them?"
Administration officials, aircraft lobbyists and Congressional officials say the decision to buy the 30 Blackhawks was the culmination of lobbying efforts and political struggles dating from 1996.
By 1997, sending Blackhawks to the well-respected Colombian National Police had become almost an obsession for several powerful Republican legislators. For the contractors, Colombia was prized territory, a critical foothold in a rich and growing Latin American market, analysts and industry officials said.
Although their helicopter campaigns cannot be broken out from other concerns, both companies have given generously to politicians.
In the 1996 and 1998 election cycles, Textron and its employees gave $551,816 to Republicans and $364,420 to Democrats, according to statistics compiled by the Campaign Study Group, a nonpartisan research company.
United Technologies and its employees also focused on the Republicans controlling Congress, donating $362,340 over the same period. But the company was comparatively more generous to Democrats, donating $347,200 over that period and giving them almost twice what Textron gave in so-called "soft money" contributions in the current cycle.
The two contractors also used less traditional means to make their case.
In the summer of 1998, for instance, just before Republicans forced through six Blackhawks for the Colombian police by adding more than $100 million to the State Department budget, Textron underwrote a discussion series called "Is Colombia Going Down?" at which the Washington office of the Council on Foreign Relations brought business and government leaders together to focus on the urgency of Colombia's problems.
Both companies also appealed directly to Colombian officials, people familiar with their efforts said, and encouraged the Colombians to make their case to Congressional leaders and administration officials. The Colombian military, which has itself already bought 25 Blackhawks and is now purchasing 14 more, was a strong advocate for the best aircraft they could persuade the United States to get them.
Administration officials say that aides who drafted the Colombia proposal last fall suggested three options: one with no Blackhawks, and others with 45 or 60 Blackhawks in the latter years of the plan -- hopefully after some progress by the Colombian Army -- made the huge expenditure more palatable.
But just before Christmas, White House officials decided to scale back the aid package to a year and a half of spending, seek 30 Blackhawks immediately, and cut financing for some development programs by about half, officials said.
Soon thereafter, the plan came under attack by some of the same Republican legislators who once championed Blackhawks for the Colombian police.
Several would like to give some of the 30 Blackhawks to the police -- a move favored by human rights groups that oppose helping an army with a long history of abuses. Other Republicans, including members of Congress loyal to Textron and U.S. Helicopter, which also helps build the Huey II, argue for buying more of the less expensive aircraft and directing the savings to other Colombian needs, including strengthening the judiciary and weaning farmers away from drug crops.
"What if peace breaks out?," said Representative Bill Delahunt, a Massachusetts Democrat. "These helicopters won't even start coming out for 18 months after the appropriation."
But other Democrats have been more conspicuous recently for their silence on the issue of military aid for Colombia. And while many have been reluctant to oppose the aid for fear of appearing "soft" on the drug issue, few have been as reticent as the senior legislators from Connecticut, Senator Christopher J. Dodd and Representative Sam Gejdenson.
Both have long been vigilant critics of military solutions to civil conflicts in Latin America, and strong advocates of human rights. But both have also been champions of United Technologies and recipients of steady, substantial campaign contributions from the company. Their limited public role in the Colombia debate -- until Mr. Dodd came out recently as one of the first members of either party to endorse the administration's plan -- has been felt sharply by advocacy groups that had counted them as allies.
"Quite frankly, we wish that Mr. Gjedenson and Mr. Dodd would have been more helpful on this issue, especially given their experience on Central America in the 1980's," said Carlos M. Salinas, Amnesty International's Latin American affairs lobbyist in Washington, who has criticized the package.
In interviews, both legislators strongly denied that prospective Blackhawk sales had shaped their positions. Mr. Dodd acknowledged that he had returned from Colombia just days before the aid plan was made final in December and had told senior administration officials he would support it. But he said he did so reluctantly, pushing for more economic development aid, and he insisted that he never pressed the officials to buy Blackhawks.
"I would support a Connecticut company; I wouldn't see that as inconsistent in this case," Mr. Dodd said. "I just didn't do it."

HEADLINE: Pakistanis, Eager for Change, Are Left Frustrated After Coup

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER 

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, March 4

 BODY:
The euphoria that greeted a military coup here almost five months ago -- and the hope that a no-nonsense general could quickly turn this corrupt, virtually bankrupt country around -- have given way to a weary sense that little has changed, and to fears that Pakistan could be drifting toward more war with India.
While it is still early to judge the record of the new government, the White House has little else to go on as it agonizes over whether President Clinton should use his visit to India this month -- the first to this region by an American president in 22 years -- to also call on Pakistan's military rulers and give them the stamp of legitimacy they seek. 
 So far, Pakistan's army chief, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, has not done the things that the American government considers most important. He has not spelled out a plan for restoring democracy. He has not cracked down on an Islamic fundamentalist group that the United States has put on its list of terrorist organizations.
And in a decision that is a telling commentary on the general's cautious style of governance, he has not signed the nuclear test ban treaty. His foreign minister, Abdul Sattar, has spoken out in favor it, but the new government has chosen not to sign for fear that doing so would rile Islamic political parties.
In an interview, Mr. Sattar asked why the new government should pay the political price for signing when the United States Senate has voted against the treaty. "The advantages of signing are unclear, and the disadvantages of political opposition at home are concrete," he said.
Those rationales for inaction or for delaying action have frustrated people who thought that the military government would rule with the swift decisiveness with which it overthrew Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
"Everybody expected this government to come in, kick butt and take names," a Western diplomat said. "Instead, it took them months to get fully staffed, and since then it hasn't done diddly squat."
While General Musharraf casts himself as the antithesis of a politician, his government has been careful to look after certain constituencies. While it has arrested 90 people, including businessmen, on charges of defaulting on bank loans, it has not gone after sitting military officers or judges on corruption charges.
Officials note that the military and the judiciary have their own accountability systems. But it appears that the military has no appetite for investigations of its own and does not want to alienate judges who are hearing cases that challenge the constitutionality of the army takeover.
The government has also been cautious in economic policy. General Musharraf said his government would tax the agricultural incomes of feudal landlords who have always escaped payment and would broaden the sales tax to cover retail shopkeepers. But rather than doing it right away, his finance minister, Shaukat Aziz, formerly a senior executive with Citibank, said he has used the last few months to develop the new tax system and to build greater acceptance among those who will be taxed come July, when the new budget year begins.
"You are changing the culture in a society where nobody likes to pay taxes and where tax avoidance is the name of the game," Mr. Aziz said.
In the political sphere, the government says it will take a first step back toward democracy with local elections to be held by the end of the year, but it offers no timetable for national elections.
"They're talking about devolution of power to the local bodies when we don't have a Parliament," said Asma Jehangir, a lawyer and human rights leader whose father was a member of Parliament who spent four years in prison under two previous military governments. "It's a joke. How can you have freedom at the lower level when there's not freedom anywhere?"
The impatience with the slow pace of change is tangible not only among the intelligentsia, but among the poor. People who cheered the general's promise that he would do what Mr. Sharif never managed -- to tax the rich, punish the corrupt, revive the economy and build "real" democracy -- now say there is little difference.
"The price of wheat flour has gone up, not down," said Lal Muhammad, who ekes out a living selling wrinkled second-hand sweaters on the streets of Peshawar. "The lives of poor people remain the same. I don't see any difference between Musharraf and Nawaz Sharif."
Abdul Halim, a tailor in Peshawar who had skipped breakfast and lunch so his wife and six children could eat, was just as hard boiled. "This is the fourth general who has come, and we haven't seen a better life yet," he said. Still, despite his disillusionment, he hopes that President Clinton comes. "Maybe he can stop war between India and Pakistan," he said.
Mr. Halim's sense of foreboding is shared by some academics and diplomats. General Musharraf has once again made Kashmir the dominant matter in Pakistan's relations with India. It appears that rather than turning down the heat there, Pakistan has backed more frequent and deadly attacks by militants on Indian forces in Kashmir, the majority Muslim territory that both countries claim in a half-century-old dispute.
"They know they don't have a hope in hell of liberating Kashmir," said Pervez Hoodbhoy, a nuclear physicist at Quaid-I-Azam University in Islamabad. "They live in a fantasy world. They think they're inflicting such grievous damage on the Indians when the truth is the opposite. It's Pakistan that is bleeding."
Last week, the Indian government -- citing as justification its 10-week war with Pakistan last summer in Kashmir -- proposed a 28 percent rise in military spending, a $3 billion increase that is itself more than Pakistan's entire military budget.
Pakistan, which already spends more than a quarter of its budget on the military and almost half on debt service, can ill afford to go deeper in hock to try to match India's military and economic might.
In retrospect, it should have seemed inevitable that General Musharraf -- a soldier, not a schooled statesman -- would disappoint. Pakistan's entrenched problems are not amenable to quick fixes. So his men are pleading for time.
"People had completely unrealistic expectations," said Javed Jabbar, who advises the general on national affairs. "They thought there was a magic wand."

HEADLINE: Looking Back at a Day in Selma, 35 Years On

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY 

DATELINE: SELMA, Ala., March 5

 BODY:
Thirty-five years after Alabama state troopers waged a bloody attack on civil rights demonstrators here, President Clinton renewed the call for racial equality today at an anniversary gathering that drew thousands to the site of the march.
So much has changed, everyone agreed, since that day in 1965 when the brutal racism of the South flared up for all to see. But so many challenges remain. 
 Back then, the police unleashed a fierce attack with clubs, bullwhips, cattle prods and tear gas, blocking the voting-rights marchers from crossing Edmund Pettus Bridge. On this anniversary day, law enforcement officers, many of them black, saluted as Mr. Clinton strode across the bridge, arm in arm with a phalanx of aging civil rights veterans.
"Thirty-five years ago, a single day in Selma became a seminal moment in the history of our country," Mr. Clinton said. "On this bridge, America's long march to freedom met a roadblock of violent resistance. But the marchers, thank God, would not take a detour on the road to freedom."
Hosea Williams, one of those original protesters, was pushed in a wheelchair during the re-enactment, right down a roadway that has since become Martin Luther King Jr. Street. He summed up the mood of many when he remarked, "We're not where we used to be but we're not where we ought to be, either."
The violent clash in Selma, broadcast nationally on television, caught the attention of millions of Americans and set off a chain of events that altered the region's social and political landscape. Two weeks later, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. led a march from Selma to the state capital, Montgomery, prompting Congress later that year to pass the Voting Rights Act.
"I thought I was going to die," recalled John Lewis, who had been badly beaten when he tried to cross the bridge, named for a Confederate general. Now, Mr. Lewis is a Democratic congressman from Georgia who returned to Selma with a delegation of colleagues.
"I'm thinking about all the tear gas and the horses," said Frank Spivey, 53, who was toward the back of the march in 1965. "The wind was blowing and the tear gas burned our eyes. All you could do was run."
Shielding his eyes today from the blistering sun in the middle of the mostly black crowd, Mr. Spivey said it was a shame that despite all the progress of the last 35 years, so many of the blacks in Selma and the rest of the country still lived in poverty. "White people are now whupping us economically instead of using fists or guns," Mr. Spivey said.
Mr. Clinton, who has talked throughout his presidency of racial reconciliation, recalled watching the violence in Selma on television as a college freshman and feeling the country's great racial and regional divide. Alluding to the racial challenges of today -- economic disparities, police brutality, controversies over the Confederate battle flag -- the president said there were many more bridges to cross.
"As long as African-Americans and Latinos anywhere in America believe they are unfairly targeted by police because of the color of their skin, and police believe they are unfairly targeted by their communities because of the color of their uniforms, we have another bridge to cross," Mr. Clinton said.
"As long as the reigning symbol of one American's pride is the shameful symbol of another American's pain, we have another bridge to cross."
The voting rights legislation brought down barriers that had blocked blacks from exercising their rights. The number of black registered voters skyrocketed in the years after the law's passage, contributing to the electoral victories of thousands of politicians, black and white.
"Without Selma, Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton would never have been elected president of the United States," Mr. Clinton said.
But many speakers today lamented the low voting participation rates among blacks these days, given how hard the previous generation had to fight for the opportunity.
"Thirty-five years later, there's a deafening silence at the polling places throughout the nation," said Martin Luther King III, a son of the civil rights leader, using Dr. King's familiar cadences to urge blacks not to forget that hard-fought right.

HEADLINE: Senator Seeks to End Grants For Indian Tobacco Stores

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 5

 BODY:
The Department of Housing and Urban Development has spent $4.2 million to subsidize the construction of at least six discount cigarette stores on Indian reservations since 1996, raising criticism from a Republican senator and an anti-tobacco group.
The stores, called smoke shops, sell tax-free cigarettes and other tobacco products at discount prices, an arrangement the critics say the government should not subsidize. 
 Senator Christopher S. Bond, Republican of Missouri, who is chairman of the Senate subcommittee that oversees financing for HUD, has called for the agency to end grants for the stores.
The grants are part of the Indian Community Development Block Grant program, established in 1977, which sets aside 1 percent of the annual appropriation for urban development grants to the states to support development projects on reservations.
Mr. Bond's office said it found that the agency had paid for the construction of six of the stores in Nevada and Oklahoma.
The agency said the grants are given to help with construction, land acquisition and the like, without regard to the kind of business.
In a letter to Mr. Bond in February, Hal C. DeCell III, an assistant secretary at the agency, said the agency opposed cutting off the money, which he called important to economic development.
"We believe there are serious policy, programmatic and legal constraints against such an action," Mr. DeCell said in the letter.
A spokesman for the agency, David Egner, said in an interview that it does not have the authority to ban legal products that are sold in the facilities chosen for the grants. "Federal block grant programs are designed to give local governments, not Washington, control over how to best spend federal funds," he said.
But critics of the program said it was well within the agency's authority to refuse money for the stores.
"It was my hope that HUD would know the difference between right and wrong and voluntarily end its funding of high volume sales and discount cigarettes," Mr. Bond said in a statement released by his office. "It now appears we may need to legislate a common sense solution for HUD."
In a letter to the White House calling for an end to grants for the stores, the president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, Matthew L. Myers, said, "There is a massive difference between not banning cigarette sales and actively encouraging them."
Mr. Egner, the agency spokesman, said, "If Congress takes action in our budget, and restricts us from doing this funding then we would obey that restriction."
But that would provoke opposition from the National Congress of American Indians, a group that represents hundreds of tribes and favors the program.
A spokesman for the group, Ron Allen, said, "We will do two things, we will make it very clear to the White House that in no way should they sign off on a bill that has that kind of discrimination measure in it."
"The next thing we'll do is go to the Hill, because we have a lot of friends there, and we'll get our friends to make this as controversial as possible," Mr. Allen said.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE TEXAS GOVERNOR;
Bush Seeks to Secure California's Big Prize

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: FRESNO, Calif., March 5

 BODY:
Gov. George W. Bush flew back west today for the last two days of the fight for California's 162 Republican presidential delegates, promising that as president he would cut taxes and improve the nation's education.
In stops here and earlier in Stockton and Oakland, Mr. Bush stuck to familiar themes as he sought to lock up a primary victory already foreseen by all public polls here. Fighting a sore throat, he seemed weary and kept his remarks brief. 
 His emphasis on the twin issues of tax cuts and taking federal money away from failing public school districts served not only to distinguish him from Senator John McCain, his Republican rival for the nomination, who also returned to the state today, but also from Vice President Al Gore, whom he said he expected to face in November.
"Taxes are the highest they have been since World War II," he told an enthusiastic crowd in Oakland. He said later he was referring to taxes as a percentage of the gross domestic product. By some other measures taxes have been higher in recent years than they are today.
Governor Bush said his proposal to reduce federal taxes by $483 billion over 5 years was not only fair to taxpayers, giving them money the government did not need, but also, "by giving people their money back, it is an insurance policy against an economic downturn."
As he often does, Mr. Bush spoke with the most emotion when he discussed education. "Every child ought to have a first-rate education," he said. "There are no second-rate children. There are no second-rate dreams." If elected, he would "expect the highest and the best for every child, like we done in the state of Texas," he said, affecting a Texas drawl.
Elaborating at a news conference later, Mr. Bush said his proposal to take federal Title I money -- a program designed to help schools with poor children -- away from failing school districts had been unfairly attacked by people like Mr. Gore who said it would hurt the public schools.
That attitude, he said, reflected "the soft bigotry of low expectations" and the belief that "certain children can't learn." Federal money, he insisted, should no longer subsidize "mediocrity or failure."
He was barely into his education pitch when half a dozen protesters briefly drowned him out. The protesters, opponents of capital punishment, shouted, "Stop the executions -- moratorium now!" and "Murderer!" They were hustled out by security guards, and as they left the auditorium they passed another group, silent McCain supporters holding picket signs with slogans like "Not ready for prime time."
Mr. Bush's weariness showed in occasional verbal slips. Once while discussing terrorism and various foreign threats, he promised to "use our technology to enhance uncertainties abroad."
And when a German correspondent asked him what he thought about the dispute over who should be the next head of the International Monetary Fund, he said, "I think I will reserve judgment on that."
A bigger crowd of perhaps 3,000 people gathered in a hangar at the Stockton airport heard Mr. Bush speak after after a band played "Taking Care of Business."
In that agricultural center, he turned his attention to farm issues, calling for aggressive presidential efforts to open foreign markets. However, he fumbled his phrasings and actually said he wanted to be a president who will "knock down barriers and tariffs so our farmers and ranchers have a chance to sell their home-grown products all across America." Tariffs between states were prohibited by the framers of the Constitution.
He also returned to the tax issue, telling a cheering audience: "The surplus isn't government's money. The surplus is the people's money."

HEADLINE: Mr. Greenspan's New Economics

 BODY:
Chairman Alan Greenspan has gained worldwide acclaim for his cautious stewardship of the Federal Reserve. But in recent testimony before Congress, Mr. Greenspan unveiled some unorthodox ideas. He suggested that a high rate of productivity growth -- something economists usually regard as an unmitigated blessing -- has a nasty downside, actually encouraging inflation. He also suggested that the Fed might need to raise interest rates again to keep stock prices from rising too fast.
Some of the chairman's normally ardent admirers, especially on Capitol Hill, were taken aback. His fears about productivity seemed overdrawn. So did his fixation on stock prices. The critics have a point. 
 Economists have generally thought that the impact of the stock market on the economy was small. But Mr. Greenspan argues otherwise. He starts with the fact that productivity -- output per worker -- has been rising quickly in recent years. That means there are more goods and services for people to buy, a situation that ordinarily is thought to put downward pressure on prices. But he says high productivity can also drive prices up by creating an expectation among investors that corporate earnings will rise. High corporate earnings drive up stock prices, enriching consumers who own stock and inducing them to spend more. This then adds to inflation.
This is certainly a novel argument. But there are not many economists who will buy it. The simple reason is that there is no evidence to support the claim that productivity does more to raise prices than to reduce them.
Meanwhile, Mr. Greenspan's remarks suggested to some observers that the Fed might need to raise interest rates in order to prevent stock prices from rising faster than household income, possibly sparking an inflationary burst in consumption. In this case, Mr. Greenspan appears to be giving too much weight to one cause of inflationary pressure, and not an especially important one at that.
Mr. Greenspan does not need these novel arguments. The economy grew at a 7 percent annual rate toward the end of last year, a rate most economists deem unsustainable. For that reason alone, Mr. Greenspan can justify raising rates to slow the economy.

HEADLINE: Beijing Gets a Scolding for Official Corruption, and Applauds

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

DATELINE: BEIJING, March 5

 BODY:
Prime Minister Zhu Rongji issued an emotional condemnation of official corruption today as he opened the annual 11-day session of China's Parliament.
In a 90-minute speech, Mr. Zhu drew applause for his remarks about corruption, which is widespread and threatens to undermine the party's authority. He repeatedly came back to this theme, for good reason. 
 One of the Parliament's own vice chairmen is not attending the meeting because he is under investigation after accusations that he took bribes. The former vice governor of Jiangxi Province was recently sentenced to death for corruption and faces execution sometime soon.
Mr. Zhu himself has spearheaded a major investigation into a $10 billion smuggling and corruption ring in Fujian Province that has implicated a number of senior officials.
"Leading cadres should stay clean and honest and self-disciplined and be sure their relatives and office staff do the same," he said, noting that corrupt officials must be "severely punished."
His speech also highlighted economic progress and drew the biggest round of applause from the 2,900 delegates when he spoke briefly of the government's hope for a peaceful reunification with Taiwan.
His remarks today conspicuously omitted the military threats that the Chinese government has made in the last two weeks.
Although he emphasized that China "would not sit idly by" as Taiwan moved toward independence, he said that to bring about reunification, the government is "willing to conduct cross-straits dialogue and negotiations on any matter." He later added, "We place our hopes on the Taiwan authorities and even more on the people of Taiwan."
A Chinese government white paper released two weeks ago said that China could attack Taiwan if the island nation -- the refuge of the Chinese Nationalists after the Communists won control of the mainland in 1949 -- indefinitely postponed negotiations.
Most of the speech today offered a mix of economic statistics, assertions and plans for the future, little of which was new, and was flat compared with Mr. Zhu's usual performances.
He said, for example, that China's government bureaus and its military have now divested themselves of all side businesses, as the government had demanded.
Mr. Zhu, China's lead economic planner, made clear that the government intended to continue its policy of economic liberalization and remained committed to China's entry into the World Trade Organization. That goal has been at least partly compromised by China's threatening comments about Taiwan in recent weeks.
The United States Congress must grant China permanent normal trade status to clear the way for the World Trade Organization membership.
But Mr. Zhu also emphasized that as China moves toward a more market-driven economy, the country has to provide a better safety net -- including health insurance and pensions -- for China's poor.
"We must work to create the necessary conditions for the transition to a sound social security system," he said, noting that decent social services are necessary to "maintain social stability."
Mr. Zhu made little mention of the most sensitive challenge the Chinese government faced in the last year: its continuing battle against the banned Falun Gong spiritual movement, which the government has denounced as a dangerous cult. He merely listed taking "decisive measures against the Falun Gong cult" as one of the government's achievements.
The once-popular movement has clearly been severely crippled by a harsh government crackdown that began last summer, which has led to thousands of detentions and hundreds of criminal cases. But today -- as on many days -- small numbers of Falun Gong members were arrested protesting in and around Tiananmen Square.
The square itself was closed today, serving as a parking lot for delegates to the Parliament, which meets in a building next door. Still, more than a dozen members were arrested as they tried to unfurl a banner under the nearby portrait of Mao Zedong.

INTERNATIONAL A3-10
 
Israeli Cabinet Backs Plan to Leave Lebanon
The government pledged to withdraw its soldiers by July from the embattled strip of southern Lebanon that they have occupied since 1982, preferably in the context of an accord with Syria. The resolution strengthens promises of a withdrawal made in the last eight months by Prime Minister Ehud Barak. A8 

Helicopter Lobbying Examined
A plan to sell American-made helicopters to Colombia is drawing attention to the lobbying efforts of the aircraft's manufacturer, United Technologies, a major military contractor and political contributor, as well as to the political payoff for some Democratic legislators. A6
 
Provocation Over Pinochet
The president-elect of Chile, Ricardo Lagos, has harshly criticized the hero's welcome staged by the armed forces for Gen. Augusto Pinochet's return to Chile, kindling a controversy that is testing Mr. Lagos's relationship with the powerful military less than a week before he takes power. A6
 
Putin Rejects Russian Isolation
In an interview with BBC, his first with a Western news organization, Vladimir V. Putin, Russia's acting president, said Russia must be a "strong, powerful state" that sheds cold war politics, avoids isolation and remains willing to seek "more profound integration" with NATO even by joining it so long as Russia "is regarded as an equal partner." A8
 
Corruption in China Criticized
Prime Minister Zhu Rongji issued an emotional condemnation of official corruption, drawing applause, as he opened the annual 11-day session of China's Parliament. A10
 
Stagnation on Pakistan Reform
The euphoria that greeted a military coup almost five months ago -- and the hope that a no-nonsense general could quickly turn the corrupt, virtually bankrupt country around -- have given way to a weary sense that little has changed, and to fears that Pakistan is drifting toward more war with India. A10
 
Balkan Tension Worries U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said the United States was "very concerned" about growing tensions in the Presevo valley, the area of Serbia on the boundary with eastern Kosovo. She also urged the Yugoslav government in Belgrade not to interfere in the area, even though it is not in Kosovo. A5
 
Desperation in Mozambique
Flood waters are subsiding in Mozambique, but the government's struggle to provide for the survivors is just getting under way. Relief agencies say a shortage of helicopters has made it impossible to deliver enough food and supplies. In one refugee camp there are thousands of homeless families, but only six tents and two latrines. There are first-aid workers, but no medicines, and illnesses are beginning to spread. A3
 
The Long Way to Sydney
Remy Bricka, 50, a French adventurer, bid farewell to well-wishers near Marina Del Ray, Calif., as he prepared to walk across the Pacific Ocean, from Los Angeles to Sydney, Australia, on a pair of canoelike skis, with a catamaran to hold provisions. He expects the 7,800-mile journey to take six months, provided he walks 14 hours a day. A15
 
NATIONAL A12-20
 
States Rethinking Laws On Child Abandonment
Lawmakers and prosecutors across the country are weighing changes in laws that they hope will reduce the number of infants found dead each year after being abandoned. Generally, they would allow parents to avoid prosecution for child abandonment if they left their babies in a safe place. Texas enacted such a law in September, and 23 other states, including California, New York and New Jersey, have proposed legislation. A1
 
McCain Looks for a Mandate
The senator from Arizona hopscotched from New York to Ohio to California, clinging to the hope that he can keep his insurgent presidential campaign alive after Tuesday's critical primaries. His advisers admit that he has little chance of capturing California's 162 Republican delegates, but are counting on a scenario that would allow him to claim a mandate to continue his struggle. A1
 
Harsher Juvenile Justice
Californians are being asked to decide whether to make radical changes in state criminal law as part of a ballot initiative. Under the proposal, teenagers arrested for even minor crimes would be stripped of many protections currently afforded in juvenile court, and, if convicted, would face many of the same penalties as adult felons. A1
 
Smoke Shop Subsidy Criticized
The Department of Housing and Urban Development has spent $4.2 million to subsidize the construction of at least six discount cigarette stores on Indian reservations since 1996, raising criticism from a Republican senator, Christopher S. Bond of Missouri, and an antitobacco group. A12
 
A Return to Selma
President Clinton renewed the call for racial equality at a gathering in Selma, Ala., held to mark the 35th anniversary of a bloody clash between state troopers and civil rights demonstrators. Thousands of people, including some of the original demonstrators, were on hand. A12
 
Contrast in Custody Cases
While the custody case involving Elian Gonzalez has dragged on, a similar Miami case, involving a 2-year-old Jordanian boy, Khalil Shanti, whose mother brought him to the United States without his father's consent, has been resolved quietly and quickly, with a judge ordering Khalil returned to Jordan within 10 days. The difference, say experts on immigration and Miami politics, involves flags, passions and power. A15

Democratic Fund-Raisers Subpoenaed in New Jersey
Federal prosecutors have subpoenaed some of New Jersey's most prominent Democratic fund-raisers to testify before a grand jury as part of an inquiry into the finances of Senator Robert G. Torricelli's 1996 campaign. B1
 
Mrs. Clinton Turns Up the Heat
Hillary Rodham Clinton, at a campaign stop in Manhattan, rejected the "false choice" between aggressive crime fighting and civil relations between the police and minorities, in another slap at Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's leadership. B1
 
2 Children Die in Fire
A 3-year-old boy and his infant sister, who were left unattended by their mother, died in a fire apparently touched off by a cigarette lighter in their Bronx apartment, the police and fire officials said. B1
 
Scuffle Ends in Shootings
An off-duty correction officer and a visiting Atlanta police officer were shot in a Times Square nightclub early yesterday by a man who intervened when they and a companion assaulted a patron, the police said. The gunman escaped, they said, and the wounded officers and their friend were charged with assault. B3
 
Charges Filed in Killings
Two men were charged in Miami with murdering a young woman whose body was found with those of three relatives and her fiance in a trail of killings in the Bronx last week. The police said the men were suspects in the other killings. B3

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW;
New York Contemporary, Defined 150 Ways

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER 

 BODY:
"Greater New York," the floor-to-ceiling survey at P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center in Long Island City, Queens, has a Manhattan skyline of cards stacked against it.
With nearly 150 artists, the show is ungainly in size. It has no theme, was selected by committee and, as the first official curatorial collaboration between P.S. 1 and the Museum of Modern Art, comes with the kind of institutional clout that makes the art world see red. 
 The model is virtually identical to that of the Whitney Biennial, which "Greater New York" precedes by a few weeks and to which it will inevitably be compared. It is one that has caused the Whitney headaches for years.
In this case, though, the formula works, or at least works as well as such a daft thing can. It ends up producing a good, solid exhibition, one with arid patches, moments of mere cleverness but also flashes of inspiration. Its tone is low-key, distinctly un-Sensational. The number of women is, for a change, high. With a third of the artists foreign born, there is a cosmopolitan undercurrent: subliminal, maybe, but there.
The show doesn't pretend to be more than a jumbo-size sampler. It leaves a million things out (New York has dozens of art worlds; only a few are represented here) and provides a gold mine of nits to pick. But as a highly selective recap of what's cooking in new art locally -- which, in this case, means the five boroughs, plus a fringe of Westchester -- it's invaluable.
The "new art" part is important. The curatorial team -- Brian O'Doherty, Klaus Biesenbach, Carolyn Christov-Bakargiev and Russell Haswell from P.S. 1, and Paulo Herkenhoff, Laura Hoptman and Deborah Wye from the Modern -- set a base-line criterion that only artists who had not had a solo exhibition before 1995 were eligible for inclusion.
The result is a showcase of youngish artists and young careers, some of which are already in full gear. Several of the participants -- Chakaia Booker, E. V. Day, Shirin Neshat, Paul Pfeiffer, Lisa Yuskavage and Ghada Amer with an exceptionally beautiful sculptural piece -- will also be included the next Whitney Biennial.
Why doesn't "Greater New York" feel as fraught with thumbs-up, thumbs-down pressures as the Biennial? For one thing its focus is comparatively narrow (though still insanely huge). For another, it arrives with no burden of history either to live down or to live up to.
Perhaps most important, despite the evidence of the Modern's fastidious, patrician hand in the selection -- no messy installations, not much sex apart from a spectacular X-rated painting by Cecily Brown -- the show appears at a place known for its quirky, in-the-trenches, youth-friendly house style. P.S. 1, at 22-25 Jackson Avenue, is the kind of place where thousands of intensely art-literate people can show up for an opening, as they did for "Greater New York" last week, and the atmosphere will stay stoop-party casual.
Something of that mood is distilled in a text-based painting by Erik Parker that opens the show. Titled "What It Looks Like (Smart Art)," it's a big bouquet of thought balloons, jazzy and elegant to look at. But each is crammed with names of rap singers, artists and art world insiders, in a hero-worshiping litany as infectious as a hip-hop beat and as hermetic as the art world itself.
Painting, that evergreen medium, is the star of the show. Artists who have been on the scene for a while, like Ellen Gallagher, Udomsak Krisanamis, James Siena and Shazia Sikander, deliver fine work. Newcomers like Tim Gardner and Julie Mehretu take a place in the spotlight.
The formal range is, to say the least, eclectic, the way things are these days. A painting by Diana Cooper comes out from the wall to form a fragile 3-D cubicle festooned with pink pompoms. Jeremy Blake revisits the standard modernist painting vocabulary of color and geometry, but does so through a series of slide projections, which dissolve into snow in the end. Ruth Root makes organic painted paper collages the size and shape of pastries.
Organic abstraction is the theme of one of the more resolved gallery groupings. It brings together David Dupuis's drawings of spoorlike forms, the pattern-rich gouaches of Bruce Pearson and a rainbow-hued net made of pipe cleaners by Lucky DeBellevue. Lisa Ruyter's wiry narrative, "Sunset Boulevard," adds just the right astringent touch. The days when decorative was anathema are behind us once again.
Broader themes are spun out elsewhere, with varying success. One first-floor ensemble tries to get something going with the overlap of infantilism and glamour, a promising idea that some editing might have sharpened. A neat trio of Rob Pruitt's glitter-encrusted pandas, T. J. Wilcox's mesmerizing, noirish video fantasy of the Marlene Dietrich funeral that never was and Elizabeth Peyton's man-child portrait would have done the trick.
Childhood shading into adolescence has been a driving metaphor in contemporary work for years; recently it has taken the form of a hard-to-pinpoint blend of sweetness and scariness. So it makes sense that one of P.S. 1's second floor galleries seems to have reverted to the public school classroom it once was.
Much of it is given over to a Mick O'Shea installation "Artworld," a toy town with tulips for trees, houses made of folded-up gallery invitations and an electric train that transports gobs of paint out to the hall and back. Sharing the space are the sinister-looking (though actually quite poetic) contraptions of Paul Etienne Lincoln. They suggest the work of a brainy, off-center eighth grader who spends Saturdays in the basement with his chemistry set trying to conjure up alien life.
What could easily be the products of such experiments fill a gallery across the hall. Here one finds Keith Edmier's scalded-pink mutant waterlily, Rob de Mar's long-stemmed biospheres and a Seth Kelly sculpture that looks like a moon rock in meltdown. Similar rocks, which appear to be aquarium accessories, are on view in a fish tank installation by Michael Phelan, who enlivens the weird science around him by having real goldfish flitting through his work.
Science is about systematic thinking. And systems of all kinds, the more elaborate and labor-intensive the better, recur. Mark Lombardi draws dense fields of multidirectional arrows to explicate economic history. Elizabeth Campbell applies the same obsessive flow-chart analysis to her personal life.
A gorgeous, light-glinting painting by Sam Gordon looks like a data bank for esoteric spiritual matter. Olu Oguibe, in one of the few uses of interactive computing (yet another art world, and one that the Whitney Biennial will explore), offers a multimedia work station dedicated to the myths of ethnology. Dylan Stone, in the guise of urban archaeologist, is in the process of photographing every architectural facade in Manhattan; his archive-in-progress is here.
Architecture and, by extension, design have an important place. Mark Dean Veca, a kind of pop Tiepolo, has turned the interior of P.S. 1's cafe into a roiling vortex of cartoon clouds, while Ricci Albenda transforms a remote basement room into an immaculate, milky-white sculptural environment, illuminated through overhead sidewalk grates: sunshine by day, street-lamp light by night. Wonderful.
There are even some houses on hand. A many-layered installation by Javier Tellez, who is, like Mr. Oguibe, an interesting thinker and one of the show's finds, consists of a giant, walk-in birdhouse filled with real birdhouses made by psychiatric patients in London's infamous Bedlam hospital, where Mr. Tellez once worked.
And P.S. 1's vast third-floor gallery is dominated by a full-size house stitched from turquoise silk by Do-Ho Suh. Titled "Seoul Home/L.A. Home/New York Home," it is modeled on the one-room house in Korea that this artist grew up in and is named for the cities where she has lived since. It floats on high like the set for a fairy tale ballet about to descend from the flies.
Ms. Suh is one of 49 artists in "Greater New York" born outside the United States. Their presence gives a clear picture of how the demographics of art in New York are being reconfigured. (Institutions like the Bronx Museum of the Arts and the Queens Museum of Art have of course been presenting and actively creating this picture for years.)
The show also reflects developments less easy to tabulate. The body, that endlessly scrutinized and dissected emblem of the 1990's, radically shaped, like the era itself, by AIDS, now has a subtler, less emphatic presence. It is back to being "the figure," but often as an actor in uneasy, dreamlike narratives of a kind seen in the photographs of Adam Baer and Justine Kurland and a rapid-fire, paranoidal video by Jordan Crandall.
Neither beauty nor style as subjects get much attention. Political ideas are muted and oblique; they have a tone of earnest, repressed worrying rather than protest. The insistent, extroverted glamour and aggression of British art recently seen in the city is little in evidence.
In place of Damien Hirst's dead shark there are Mr. Phelan's living goldfish. Instead of the Chapman brothers' naughty tableaux there is Lawrence Seward's little cabinet of sculptural wonders, ghastly but cute. The pretentious historical references of Sam Taylor-Wood's photographs have been replaced by far more modest homages. Near the fuse box powering his art-world Lilliput, Mr. O'Shea has hidden a tiny version of Giotto's Padua chapel, from whose murals, he implies, the energy of a grand art tradition flows.
Over all an air of grandeur, of the big, thrown-open gesture, is missing in the show itself, and when it comes it tends to be directed at the ear rather than the eye. Military marches blast from Nadine Robinson's room-size boombox, passionate Colombian folk songs soar through a lovely video piece by Adriana Arenas, and a throbbing, addictive technopulse (music by Wolfgang Voigt) emanates from Julian Laverdiere's dark, beetling installation, a romantic monument to failed ambition that is also, appropriately, one of the largest pieces on view.
Also appropriately, some of the physically most attenuated works come with expansive ideas. Nina Khatchadourian performs ambitious feats of restorative microsurgery on broken spider webs. Manuel Acevedo, in hand-altered photos, erects sculptures resembling Tatlin's utopian monument in desolate urban lots as perches for birds. And then there is Mr. Stone's project, a truly Sisyphean task given the rate at which things in this city rise and fall.
"Greater New York," on view until May 16, is in the category of "things that rise." It doesn't rise sky-high, but it forms a core of information to which stories, wings, even foundations can be added, as they will be, mentally, by every critically alert visitor to the show. As everybody knows, there is no "New York art." But there is a ton of art in New York, with distinctive looks and concerns shaping up at the beginning of the decade. However that message is delivered, and it is delivered with care and intelligence here, it's good news.

HEADLINE: A Computer to Outguess a Raging Fire

BYLINE: By MARK DERR 

 BODY:
The fire began when a cigarette ignited the couch. Within minutes flames leaped to the drapes and the fire raged until, deprived by closed windows and doors of the oxygen needed to flourish, it subsided.
Still, the smoldering fire continued to raise the temperature in the room, bringing furniture, papers and candles close to their ignition points. 
 Arriving some time later, firefighters burst through the door, and oxygen-rich air poured in with them.
The room appeared to erupt into flames -- a phenomenon called "flashover" -- as the smoldering fire revived and, in rapid succession, papers, candles and other furnishings ignited.
"Once you have flashover, you generally lose the structure and lives," said Dr. Kevin McGrattan, a mathematician with the Building and Fire Research Laboratory at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg, Md.
This fire was hypothetical, created on a computer program that Dr. McGrattan and his colleagues, Dr. Ronald Rehm and Dr. Howard Baum, designed to simulate the behavior of fire in a building in precise three-dimensional detail, and to evaluate systems for detecting and extinguishing the fire.
Called the Fire Dynamic Simulator, the program is to be posted soon for distribution on the Web site of National Institute of Standards and Technology (fire.nist.gov). The program is the most sophisticated and powerful of its kind, said Dr. Richard G. Gann, senior research scientist at the lab.
As part of continuing official investigations, researchers at the laboratory have already used the computer model to reconstruct fatal fires that occurred in Washington and Brooklyn in 1998. The researchers have also used the program to predict the performance of ceiling sprinklers in fires and to explain why a sprinkler next to one already active fails to open in proper sequence, a phenomenon known as sprinkler skip.
Structural fires cost the American economy about $128 billion annually in property damage, maintaining fire departments and insurance. On average each year, 4,000 civilians die and 40,000 are injured in fires, primarily in their homes; among firefighters, 80 to 90 die and 80,000 to 90,000 are injured. Nearly 75 percent of fire fatalities occur in flashovers, Dr. Gann said.
Until now, fire codes and designs aimed at preventing such losses were based on the accumulated wisdom of firefighters, basic mathematical calculations and laboratory tests of materials, Dr. Gann said. But in the 1980's, researchers at the laboratory began developing a computer program that would model the behavior of fire in an enclosed space, using data on the type, amount and ignition temperatures of whatever flammable materials were present. The model drew on abundant data from tests of ignition temperatures and burning times of new materials.
Combined with another model anticipating the behavior of people in the presence of fire, this so-called "zone" model gave specialists a powerful tool for determining the layout of evacuation routes, as well as the placement and timing of fire alarms and sprinklers in buildings, railroad cars and planes. First released for use on a desktop computer in 1983, it is also widely used by fire investigators, said Richard W. Bukowski, a senior engineer at the fire research laboratory, who helped create the "zone" model.
But the model provides only a one-dimensional view of a room, showing the vertical distribution of hot and cooler air, not its horizontal movements. Unable to model the flow of air, it cannot anticipate the behavior of fire in more complicated spaces, like rooms with exposed beams or odd shapes. Although it can make rough calculations about the changing intensity and size of the fire over time, the program cannot determine its location in a room.
The Fire Dynamic Simulator solves those problems by dividing a room into cubes six inches on each side, Dr. McGrattan said. Using the staggeringly complex equations of computational fluid dynamics, it then maps in three dimensions the fire and the flow of heated air through the room. Heat causes materials, like wood, candle wax or fabrics, to release gases, which then fuel the fire in the presence of oxygen. (Thus, water puts out a fire by cooling, not drowning, it, while depriving a fire of oxygen smothers it.) The dynamic model takes days to run through its calculations, making it less user friendly, if more precise, than its predecessor -- but it has already proved its worth.
Last year, Dr. McGrattan ran the program before the test burning of an actual building at the Underwriters Laboratory. The experiment was designed to examine the workings of roof vents, sprinklers and draft curtains, which hang from the ceiling of large buildings, like warehouses, and are designed to funnel smoke from a fire inside the building toward the vents.
The computer model predicted that the draft curtains and, to a lesser degree the roof vents, would actually interfere with the working of sprinklers by delaying their opening and by blocking the full distribution of water from them. Draft curtains and roof vents are frequently required in existing fire codes, which are developed locally, and sometimes by insurance companies. But a model unified national fire code now under development for large buildings would drop the demand for draft curtains, Dr. McGrattan said.
The model has also explained a number of flukes in the behavior of fire alarms and sprinklers. For example, in fire tests in a basement with exposed ceiling beams, the sprinkler farthest from the fire consistently ignited before those directly over the flames. A computer simulation revealed that the beams were acting as a conduit and were channeling heat from the fire to the distant sprinkler so fast that the sensor on the nearest sprinkler never became warm enough to activate it.
The model showed that in sprinkler skip, water from one sprinkler cools the heat sensor on its neighbor so that the second sprinkler is not activated, thus increasing the possibility that the fire will spread. Adjusting the sensitivity or placement of the sprinklers solves the problem.
A similar computer model developed in the late 1990's demonstrated that under specific sea and wind conditions, burning the oil spilled from a tanker caused less environmental damage, despite the smoke and air pollution, than removing it after it has washed ashore. Experiments confirmed the model, and since then spilled oil has been burned at sea off Alaska in 1998 and after an oil tanker, the New Carissa, foundered off Coos Bay, Ore., in 1999.
Simulations now play an equally crucial role in developing, designing and testing new kinds of fire codes, based not on requirements for number and placement of exits, sprinklers, extinguishers and the like but rather on fire safety goals.
These performance-based codes set specific goals for fire safety, including the amount of time needed to warn and evacuate the building's occupants, and the efficiency of the smoke detection and sprinkler systems, but leave up to the design team the how to meet those goals.
Mr. Bukowski estimated that these codes, being developed in Japan, Australia, New Zealand and parts of Europe, can cut the cost of fire protection in a new building -- now set at 15 or 20 percent of the construction cost -- -- by a third, while improving safety. The fire research laboratory is working on a model performance-based code of its own.
Still, the Fire Dynamic Simulator cannot yet predict when flashover will occur because of the sheer complexity of calculating the interactions of hot and cold air, radiant temperatures and the ignition points of multiple materials over a long period.
"Fire modeling is like predicting the weather," Dr. McGrattan said. "We're pretty good in the short term, but not in the longer term. We can predict the first couple of minutes of a fire successfully, but after that, things become more dicey." Nonetheless, he said he expected in the next five years to be able to "confidently predict for any given room what the flash point will be."
Despite the progress made in bringing their models to fire engineers, the researchers admit that firefighters are reluctant to embrace the technology, preferring in most cases to rely on their experience and traditional methods. Still Dr. McGrattan expects computer simulations to be widely used in training, because they can provide a clearer view of fire than video cameras or eyes blinded by smoke.
Scientists at the Building and Fire Research Laboratory also hope within four years to have built a control panel that has embedded in it a "zone" model for tracking the progress of a fire in a building in real time. Sensors monitoring temperature, occupancy, smoke alarms, sprinklers, ventilation and other systems, would relay information back to the program, which would also have an inventory of material in the building.
Constantly updating its data, the computer would determine the location and intensity of a fire, as well as movement, and feed that information directly to firefighters, in all likelihood saving lives and reducing injuries.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: COMMODITIES;
U.S. Says Gasoline Prices to Continue Rising Through the Summer

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 6

 BODY:
Gasoline prices will continue to rise sharply, hitting an average of $1.56 a gallon in the peak summer driving season, but they will come down by this time next year, the Energy Department predicted today.
Because worldwide crude oil supplies are so low, a steep increase in gasoline costs is unavoidable in the near future even if oil-producing countries agree soon to increase production significantly, the department's Energy Information Administration said. 
 The agency said that the average price for a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline, now about $1.35, would "surge to unprecedented levels before the spring is out" and that motorists would pay an average of 35 cents more a gallon from April through September than they did in the period a year earlier.
But while gasoline prices will probably set records in purely numerical terms, they will still be 40 percent lower when adjusted for inflation than they were at their record high, in March 1981, the information office said. And prices will be 16 percent lower when adjusted for inflation than they were late in 1990, during the Persian Gulf war.
As further consolation, an Energy Department analyst predicted that there would be no long lines at gasoline stations, as there were two decades ago.
"We're starting the season with relatively low supplies," said Dave Costello, an economist with the information agency. "Meeting the demand -- which will happen -- will be attended by relatively high prices."
Finally, the information office foresaw a return by this time next year to today's gasoline prices as oil countries continue to produce enough to build up supplies once again.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is scheduled to meet on March 27 to decide whether to increase production to offset a shortage that now stands at more than two million barrels a day. But even if OPEC decides to raise its production drastically, and soon -- say, by two million barrels a day -- there is little chance that enough crude oil can get to refiners in time to stave off higher prices for summer vacationers in the United States, the energy information office said.
The department's report is full of caveats that are intriguing to those who follow the economics and politics of oil. In California, where clean-air rules make gasoline more expensive, prices could approach $2 a gallon. Taxes also vary considerably from state to state.
The department said heating oil prices, which hit $2 a gallon or more in the oil-dependent Northeast this winter, were already coming down as warm weather approached and should be lower next winter. So, presumably, will diesel fuel prices.
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson told Congress last week that he thought that oil production would go up, and that there was no need, therefore, for the government to tap its Strategic Petroleum Reserve of 600 million barrels in Louisiana and Texas.
But Mr. Richardson told some skeptical lawmakers that the option was still "on the table." With the price of crude oil at $32 a barrel, three times what it was a year ago, the administration could face renewed pressure to use the reserves. In New York, crude oil rose 67 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $32.18 a barrel.
Leaving itself plenty of leeway, the information office said it expected crude oil prices to be $22 to $28 a barrel by the end of this year and $19 to $26 a barrel by the end of 2001.
For now, analysts expect oil production to increase. Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Kuwait and Mexico, which is not an OPEC member, have signaled a willingness to increase production.
But there is good reason for caution in predicting oil trends. OPEC has historically had trouble keeping discipline among its members, partly because some members, like Iran, Iraq and Kuwait, have been enemies on the battlefield. Another war in the Middle East could dash all predictions.
One prediction seems safe: American drivers will grumble over higher gasoline prices, forgetting that not many months ago they were extraordinarily low. The amount of gasoline that cost $10 in 1984 cost just $10.19 in July 1999, according to the Consumer Price Index, while the cost of most other goods and services went up 60 percent over those 15 years.

HEADLINE: John P. Keith, 78, President Of Regional Plan Association

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

 BODY:
John P. Keith, a former president of the Regional Plan Association, a nonprofit planning agency for the New York City metropolitan area, died Thursday at a hospital in Manhattan. He was 78.
The cause of death was congestive heart failure, said his wife, Doris. 
 Mr. Keith was president of the association from 1969 to 1989. Previously, he spent 10 years in the No. 2 job, as executive director.
In his years at the association, Mr. Keith broadened its base of support, bringing in corporate backers and making it one of the most influential nonprofit planning groups in the nation.
Among the major issues that the organization influenced in Mr. Keith's years there was the decade-long effort, starting in 1963, to prevent Breezy Point, New York City's last open strip of oceanfront, from becoming a high-rise home to 60,000 people. Instead, most of it became a public park and later part of the first national park in an urban area, Gateway National Recreation Area.
Mr. Keith was also instrumental in preserving commuter rail service in the region by urging the establishment of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and New Jersey Transit.
He also helped stop the construction of a fourth regional airport, near Flemington, N.J., and stimulated the development of downtown Stamford, Conn., and Metrotech, a multibuilding office complex, in downtown Brooklyn.
"He was not only the author of research reports, but he was the kind of leader who got things implemented," said Peter W. Herman, the current chairman of the Regional Plan Association.
"He also helped create a regional consciousness in the area through relentless speeches, articles and taking positions. He made people realize that what you do in New Jersey will affect New York, and what you do in New York will affect Connecticut. He was one of the true regionalists."
John Pirie Keith was born on May 17, 1921, in Windsor, Ontario. He received his bachelor's degree from the University of Arizona, a master's in public administration from Wayne State University and a doctorate from the Institute of Public Administration, where, from 1989 until his death, he worked as a senior associate. From 1956 to 1959, he was an assistant director for the American Society for Public Administration.
Besides his wife, Mr. Keith is survived by a daughter, Janet Keith of Manhattan; a son, Alexander Keith of Elko, Nev.; and one grandchild.

HEADLINE: Embracing Immigrants

 BODY:

To the Editor:
A March 5 Week in Review article about the turnaround in favor of a liberal policy toward immigrants highlights the role of a booming economy and the growing political presence of immigrants. Another factor should be added: the abandonment of anti-immigration attitudes by intellectuals and the laboring classes. 
 New research has challenged the fear propelled by some experts that legal and illegal immigration since the 1965 reforms has diluted our skill levels and driven down the wages of our unskilled workers.
Before the 1986 immigration law was enacted, I argued unsuccessfully that employer sanctions would not cut significantly the number of new illegal immigrants but would reduce the illegals in our midst to a subterranean class without rights. The A.F.L.-C.I.O. has just embraced this viewpoint. It has abandoned its earlier advocacy of sanctions and now seeks another amnesty for illegal workers.

HEADLINE: Reminder From Greenspan: Expect Interest Rates to Rise

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

 BODY:
Just in case investors had chosen not to heed his previous warnings, Alan Greenspan gave them a reminder yesterday that the Federal Reserve intends to raise interest rates until it is sure it has squeezed any inflationary imbalances out of the economy.
In a speech to a conference on the "new economy" at Boston College, Mr. Greenspan, the Fed chairman, repeated his message that the wealth being created in the stock market is creating more demand than the economy can satisfy. 
 Investors took notice. They sent the Dow Jones industrial average down 196.70 points, to 10,170.50. Mr. Greenspan even took some air out of highflying technology stocks, helping send the Nasdaq index down 9.94 points, to 4,904.85.
In his speech, Mr. Greenspan talked about how the most encouraging development of recent years, the upturn in the growth rate of productivity, was creating problems as well as benefits by leading investors to bid stock prices up in expectation of rising profits.
Noting that "many analysts are now projecting that the rate of increase in stock market wealth may soon begin to slow," Mr. Greenspan was vague about how much higher interest rates would have to go before the market cooled to his satisfaction and the economy returned to a noninflationary growth path.
He noted that the interest rates set in the financial markets had already risen significantly over the last two years but said as clearly as he ever does that the Fed would help the process along with more rate increases of its own, starting at the central bank's next policy meeting on March 21. The Fed is expected to raise its federal funds target rate on overnight loans between banks by a quarter of a point, to 6 percent, at that meeting. That would come after four quarter-point increases over the last eight months.
"Until market forces, assisted by a vigilant Federal Reserve, effect the necessary alignment of the growth of aggregate demand with the growth of potential aggregate supply," Mr. Greenspan said, "the full benefits of innovative productivity acceleration are at risk of being undermined by financial and economic instability."
The economy has not overheated so far, he said, because it has blown off steam through two safety valves. One is imports, which have met the demand that domestic producers have been unable to supply. The other is a reduction in the unemployment rate, which has fallen as employers have dipped deeper into the employment pool to find the workers they need.
Mr. Greenspan said that the nation could not afford any further widening in its trade deficit. And despite some tentative signs that the economy might be cooling -- most notably a slackening in the pace of job creation last month -- Mr. Greenspan made clear yesterday that he remained as concerned as ever that the economy was running out of workers, leaving it vulnerable to an upward spiral in both wages and prices.
Assuming that the nation's pool of available workers continues to show a decline, Mr. Greenspan said, "wage increases must rise above even impressive gains in productivity."
"This would intensify inflationary pressures or squeeze profit margins, with either outcome capable of bringing our growing prosperity to an end," he said.

HEADLINE: China Tries To Deflect Criticism On Rights

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, March 6

 BODY:
With the Clinton administration determined to have China's record on human rights condemned by the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva, the Chinese are relying on intensive diplomacy and procedural ploys to escape criticism.
It is a system that has worked well in the past for would-be targets of condemnation. 
 "If the U.S. administration decides to sponsor the anti-China resolution, we believe, like in previous situations, the majority of the commission will be on China's side," Shen Guofang, China's deputy representative at the United Nations said in an interview. "They don't want to see a confrontation in the commission."
Mr. Shen predicted that the United States would not get the solid support of Europe. Some Western diplomats here say the Chinese have been able to play American and European commercial interests against one other with considerable success.
China has had "dialogues" with European countries to explain its record, Mr. Shen said, adding that there should be more talks with the United States, whose main irritant may really be China's socialist system, he said.
"Of course we have some room for improvement," Mr. Shen said. But since the 1970's, when China began to open its economy and begin other reforms, there have been big changes, he said. "China now has the best human rights situation in its history."
Diplomats and human rights officials, who point to steps China has begun taking to cooperate with rights monitors, say that public criticism is anathema to Beijing. When the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, Mary Robinson, said in China that the rights situation had declined, officials warned her not to raise the issue of Falun Gong, the banned religious sect, or other problems that she has highlighted.
For a powerful and determined country like China -- or Russia, when Chechnya is at issue, or at times the United States -- the United Nations system can offer many ways to avoid public scrutiny and embarrassing moments, from the Security Council all the way down to subcommittees meeting in basement rooms.
Official functions are not the only focus. Film screenings, art exhibitions, journalists' briefings and even ecumenical religious services can be blocked by pressure from various nations. China is considered one of the most active in denying a platform for critics, including the Dalai Lama, who is effectively barred from United Nations events.
Ahead of the annual commission meeting in Geneva, which this year runs from March 20 until the end of April, China has been running a two-track defense, diplomats and human rights advocates say.
In Geneva, the Chinese are expected to try to keep an American-sponsored resolution on its human rights record off the full commission's agenda by using a pre-emptive parliamentary technique, a "no action" motion. With support of other Asian, African and some Latin American countries, China has managed to have the resolution struck in advance nearly every year; once it was discussed and defeated.
India, whose rights record the State Department last week characterized as rife with "significant abuses," backs China, as does Iran.
On a second track, China works to bar organizations of Chinese or Tibetan exiles from getting a hearing there. This year it has already succeeded in excluding Human Rights in China, a New York-based group led by prominent exiles.
Fang Lizhi, an astrophysicist now teaching in the United States, is co-chairman with Robert Bernstein of Human Rights in China; Xiao Qiang, another scientist in exile who has worked closely with Chinese grass-roots groups, particularly the mothers of victims at Tiananmen Square in 1989, is executive director.
Human rights groups and United Nations officials say that in the past the commission meeting in Geneva had been unique within the United Nations system in its openness to nongovernmental organizations. But they say that may be changing.
Joanna Weschler, Human Rights Watch's representative at the United Nations, said that tolerance for nongovernmental organizations, known as NGO's, has generally been shrinking under the current composition of a 19-member committee that is able to grant or deny "consultative status" to independent groups.
Margaret Huang, Asia program director for the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Center for Human Rights in Washington, said the committee was "not very NGO-friendly now."Some Western diplomats agree.
The Kennedy center made Mr. Xiao a member of its delegation last year, and was criticized for giving back-door access. "This year I feel for the first time I may not be able to speak," Mr. Xiao said. "If we're not going and don't speak, Chinese issues are gone from the commission."

HEADLINE: MGM Grand to Acquire Mirage Resorts for$4.4 Billion

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

 BODY:
Mirage Resorts Inc. agreed yesterday to be acquired by MGM Grand Inc. for $4.4 billion in cash, creating a casino industry powerhouse but probably ending the reign of Stephen A. Wynn, the founder and chairman of Mirage, as the unofficial king of Las Vegas.
James J. Murren, the president and chief financial officer of MGM Grand, said Mr. Wynn "won't have an active position" in the combined company but he might have a seat on the board. 
 Ron Baron, chairman of Baron Funds, which is a major Mirage shareholder, said that Mr. Wynn told him yesterday that he intended to quit and "start over."
MGM Grand, which is controlled by the billionaire Kirk Kerkorian, will pay $21 a share in cash. That is $4 a share, or about $1 billion, higher than the $17 a share MGM Grand offered for Mirage two weeks ago and nearly double the $10.875 price of Mirage stock before the offer was made. MGM Grand will also assume about $2 billion of Mirage debt.
Mirage had rejected the initial offer last Tuesday but had left the door open to a higher price. Talks began almost immediately after that, continued through the weekend and concluded about 6 a.m. yesterday, executives said.
Industry executives and analysts said the deal could presage further consolidation in the casino industry. With few new states opening to gambling, casino companies will increasingly try to grow through acquisitions.
J. Terrence Lanni, the chairman of MGM Grand, called the transaction "a dream combination of assets and people."
The combined company is expected to be the second-largest casino company in revenue, after Park Place Entertainment, which itself recently completed an acquisition of the Caesars World casinos.
MGM Grand will own 14 casinos, including 5 of the splashiest resorts on the Las Vegas Strip -- its own 5,000-room MGM Grand, which is the largest hotel in the nation, and New York, New York, as well as Mirage's Mirage, Treasure Island and the $1.6 billion Bellagio. It will also have a half-interest in the Monte Carlo on the Las Vegas Strip and own other casinos elsewhere in Nevada as well as in Mississippi, Detroit and Australia. The company is expected to control about half the market for gambling by high rollers.
MGM and Mirage each plan to develop a casino in Atlantic City, so it is now possible that only one of those projects will go forward or that one will be delayed, dealing a blow to the city's development plans but helping some existing competitors. "You had two major companies building two major facilities," said Donald J. Trump, who fought Mr. Wynn's plans in Atlantic City. "Now you have one very major company building one facility."
But Mr. Murren said it had not been decided how many projects would go ahead in Atlantic City.
The swiftness with which the Mirage deal was consummated surprised analysts. They thought that Mr. Wynn, who parlayed a Maryland bingo parlor he inherited from his father into a chain of the world's splashiest theme hotels, would fight to escape Mr. Kerkorian, who is also a self-made man and every bit as powerful as Mr. Wynn, though he tends to remain behind the scenes.
"A week ago I was on record as saying it was over Steven Wynn's dead body he would sell his company," said Harry Curtis, an analyst with Robertson, Stephens.
But Mr. Wynn was under pressure from investors because Mirage shares had fallen so far from the recent peak of $26 a share last May as earnings fell short. Mirage's new Beau Rivage casino in Mississippi proved too fancy for the market there and the Bellagio in Las Vegas, with an Impressionist art collection worth several hundred million dollars, stole customers from the Mirage. And there seemed to be little prospect the shares would recover on their own in the near term.
"I think it's a fair price for the current environment," said Mr. Baron, whose funds own about 6 percent of Mirage shares. Mr. Wynn, meanwhile, said in a statement that the transaction "fully embraces the value of the franchise created by each of the Mirage properties."
People close to the matter say that Mr. Wynn, 58, was growing tired of dealing with Wall Street. And Mr. Wynn, whose eyesight is gradually failing from a hereditary disease, might believe that now is the time to take the money -- his 11.8 percent stake in Mirage will net him about $500 million in the sale -- and pursue other ventures or devote more time to his passion of collecting art.
But some people who know him say Mr. Wynn has not shown any loss of enthusiasm for the casino business and might plunge back in, perhaps by buying the Desert Inn in Las Vegas, which is for sale by Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide Inc.
"I know he feels everything he built is not the ultimate building," Mr. Baron said. He also said it was possible that Mr. Kerkorian, who is 82, might find a role for Mr. Wynn.
Some say that the industry and the state of Nevada would suffer if Mr. Wynn leaves gambling. He is credited with creating the boom in Las Vegas over the last decade by pushing to offer entertainment other than gambling.
MGM Grand officials said the acquisition, expected to be completed by this fall, would immediately add to its earnings per share. The company anticipates significant cost savings, some of which could come from having to pay less to lure the high rollers. MGM Grand is also likely to sell assets, like Mirage's airplanes and an apartment in New York. It is not clear yet what will happen to the art collection, one person close to the situation said.
MGM Grand is also likely to need equity to keep its investment-grade credit rating, analysts said.
Shares of Mirage rose $3.125, to $19, while MGM Grand shares rose 50 cents, to $19.50.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Dow Dips on Caution as Officials Talk of Higher Rates

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Stock prices moved lower yesterday after three of the nation's financial leaders said higher interest rates were needed to cool the economy.
In addition to the cautionary comments, which were made by Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board; Lawrence H. Summers, secretary of the Treasury; and Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, last week's big run-up in stock prices provided additional incentive to take some profits out of equities. 
 "It's as if Greenspan wrote the speech for all of them," said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Company. "As the day wore on and the headlines of what they were saying hit the tape, the market went down." The three officials addressed a conference held at Boston College.
By the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 196.70, or 1.9 percent, to 10,170.50. I.B.M., Microsoft, American Express and Wal-Mart led the decline.
On Friday, the Dow gained more than 200 points after the February employment data suggested that the economy might be starting to cool.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 17.89, or 1.3 percent, to 1,391.28, pushed lower by large declines in Exxon Mobil, Bristol-Myers Squibb and 3Com.
Technology stocks bucked the trend for much of the session, but late in the day the Nasdaq composite index began to sag and closed lower. The Nasdaq finished at 4,904.85, down 9.94, or 0.2 percent. At one point during the day it was up by as much as 65 points. Trading was brisk.
On the New York Stock Exchange, volume was 1.03 billion shares. On the Nasdaq stock market, 1.9 billion shares changed hands.
Stock investors have been worried that instead of cooling the economy, a further series of interest rate increases by the Fed will cause the economy to lapse into a recession.
"That is the big question," said David L. Mead, the chief investment officer at Harris Bank in Chicago. "I think they will be able to avoid a hard landing, simply because they have done it before."
Mr. Mead said the prospect of further increases in interest rates had not caused him to change his investment strategy.
"If we were to make a change, we would shift money out of large-cap sectors and into small and midcap stocks," he said.
A number of bellwether technology companies had a tough day.
Microsoft was one of them. The stock fell 5 1/2, to 90 5/8. Intel dropped 1 7/16, to 117 3/8. And Cisco Systems shed 1 5/16, to 136 1/8.
Hewlett-Packard was one of only three Dow stocks to gain ground. The stock rose 7 1/8, to 145 3/4, after Agilent Technologies, which is 85 percent owned by Hewlett-Packard, announced a switching technology breakthrough. Agilent closed at 161, up 53.
Telephone equipment manufacturers had a good day.
Nortel gained 8 1/2, to 129. Lucent Technologies was up 2 1/16, to 73 3/8. And Motorola gained 5 5/16, to 180 5/8.
Biotechnology stocks, which have been among the market's leaders so far this year, turned in a mixed performance.
Amgen fell 1 3/4, to 64 9/16. Genentech was off 19, to 215 1/2. But Immunex rose 3 11/16, to 248 1/8.
Williams-Sonoma fell 11 15/16, to 18 15/16, after the seller of kitchen equipment said it expected earnings for the quarter ended Jan. 30 might be below Wall Street estimates.

Treasury Prices Drop
 By Bloomberg News
Treasury bond prices fell on speculation that the Federal Reserve would stay its course of raising interest rates, with few signs the economy is slowing to a pace that would not foster faster inflation.
"A rate increase later this month is in the bag, and we're expecting at least two more after that because another 25 basis points is not going to slow this wonderful economy," said Mark Macqueen, who invests $750 million at Sage Advisory Services Ltd. in Austin, Tex. (A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.)
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 5/32, to 101 16/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.14 percent from 6.13 percent on Friday.

HEADLINE: Ikea Wants to Move In, but Neighbors Fight Moving Out

BYLINE: By DEBRA WEST 

DATELINE: NEW ROCHELLE, N.Y., March 6

 BODY:
When Albert L. Jones lost half his backyard to the New England Thruway, he was not happy, but he understood that his sacrifice was for the public good. He took the money the state gave him, put a new roof on his house, paid down his mortgage and learned to live with the noise.
Forty-odd years later, there is another threat to Mr. Jones's home and neighborhood here. Only this time, Mr. Jones is not quite so accommodating. 
 Nor is he alone. Instead, he finds himself in the midst of a battle raising questions far behind his endangered City Park neighborhood.
The fight to save his neighborhood from a proposed Ikea furniture megastore has become a drawn-out battle royal even by the standards of Westchester County, where antidevelopment jousting seems like part of the fabric of daily life.
But it is also raising two questions that go beyond the immediate dispute.
The first is: at a time of increasing development pressures, how aggressive should cities be in using eminent domain to push through developments?
The second is: as land and housing costs continue to soar, can uprooted people expect to find any place in the county they can afford?
Ikea, the Swedish assemble-it-yourself furniture store, wants 16 acres of this neighborhood off Interstate 95 to build a 280,000-square-foot store with a 1,300-space parking lot. Forget that City Park is a neighborhood with 34 homes and 160 residents, 29 businesses employing more than 400 workers, and two churches; Ikea wants the land, and the city has already taken steps to help the company get it.
Officially, city leaders say they are reserving judgment on the project until environmental studies are completed in May. But the lure of Ikea is strong: the store estimates that it will bring this city of 70,000 people $2.5 million a year in sales tax revenue.
The City Council has already declared the City Park neighborhood blighted, the first legal action necessary to condemn it. Now property owners unwilling to sell to Ikea face the threat that the city can take their land as part of urban renewal.
"Why do I have to move for a furniture company coming in?" asked Mr. Jones, 79, a retired school custodian who has lived in City Park since he was 10. "I ask you, is that fair? This is my home. I don't think none of us old people down here could afford to go."
Ikea is trying to negotiate with the property owners. In fact, Michael McDonald, property manager for Ikea North America, says half the owners have indicated that they are willing to sell. If so, they are the silent half of the neighborhood, because the opposition to Ikea here is loud, and getting louder.
"We have used urban renewal many times in the past, and I don't remember there ever being an outcry like this one," said New Rochelle's mayor, Timothy C. Idoni. "It's not as if we are doing what they did in White Plains, going in and knocking out the whole downtown. We try to be very, very careful."
The opposition started when David P. Newmark, president of Vernon Devices, a tool manufacturer, founded the City Park Association to fight the proposed development. He recruited his neighbors, a collection of old-timers and business owners, to join him.
Then, neighbors from surrounding communities joined in, spurred by the prospect of Ikea traffic drawn from as far as 90 miles away clogging local streets.
"Some people first come to the issue because of traffic and pollution," said Scott Stefan, a Larchmont resident and an advertising art director, who founded Wrain, Westchester Residents Against Ikea Now, a group that claims to have 2,100 members. "But then when they find out that they are taking people's homes and businesses to make way for a store, they are incredulous. If you talk to 100 people, 99 of them will say, 'You can't do that in America.' "
Every Saturday and Sunday, members of Wrain knock on doors in New Rochelle to gather signatures against Ikea. Mr. Stefan said each of the seven City Council members would be given a petition against Ikea signed by hundreds or thousands of constituents.
If the petitions do not stop the project, a group of lawsuits will surely delay it. Already, officials of the neighboring Village of Larchmont and Town of Mamaroneck have suggested that they will sue New Rochelle over the threat of increased traffic if the project is approved. And Mamaroneck recently proposed a law to give the town veto power over development on its border.
In addition, Randolph Scott-McLaughlin, the director of the Social Justice Center at Pace University School of Law in White Plains, has his law students researching a new twist in civil rights law. Forcing the 160 residents to move from City Park, where the racial split is about 40 percent black and 60 percent white, would deprive them of their civil right to live in an integrated community, Mr. Scott-McLaughlin said.
"Given the fact that these people are elderly, on a fixed income and their homes are not worth all that much, where else can they go in Westchester that will replicate an integrated community?" Mr. Scott-McLaughlin asked. "I would suggest nowhere."
Ikea first came to New Rochelle in 1997 looking for a place with good highway access to build a store that would complement its highly successful stores in Elizabeth, N.J., and Hicksville on Long Island.
After turning down a few sites that were too small, the city suggested that Ikea consider City Park, Mayor Idoni said. He said the site had been considered for redevelopment since the 1960's.
At the center of the debate over City Park is the blight study that the city commissioned. The study was conducted by Ferrandino & Associates, a planning firm in Elmsford, and Ikea reimbursed the city for its $35,000 cost.
The study found that of the 66 buildings, 84.9 percent were in good or fair condition and only 15.1 percent were in poor or deteriorated condition. Of the 79 tax lots, 51.3 percent were poor or deteriorated, and 49.7 percent were good or fair.
Despite those numbers, the neighborhood was found to be blighted and thus appropriate for bulldozing.
Elliot D. Sclar, a professor of urban planning at Columbia University who lives in Larchmont, said that the neighborhood was deemed blighted not because of the conditions of the houses and businesses there, but because it is such a hodgepodge of homes, factories, parking lots and vacant space.
"The study said that mixed use is evidence of blight," Dr. Sclar said. "But that is a very old-fashioned concept. The hottest neighborhoods in Manhattan are the ones that have businesses and residences together."
And Mr. Newmark said the city helped cause the decline, by never repairing its streets, putting in sidewalks or lobbying to have sound barriers installed along I-95.
Mayor Idoni said that eminent domain laws, which allow government to seize private property to benefit the greater public good, have helped New Rochelle, and many older cities, reshape their downtowns.
In the 1960's, a significant chunk of downtown New Rochelle was declared an urban renewal district to make way for the New Rochelle Mall, which closed in 1992 and sat empty until New Roc City, an entertainment and retail complex, opened on the site last fall.
In 1988, the city declared 24 acres around its train station blighted and dispersed hundreds of people who lived and worked there to make way for a condominium project that later fell through, leaving the area empty for a decade.
Mr. McDonald of Ikea said the store was being attentive to the financial needs of residents. "We are trying to put together a plan to address their financial concerns," he said.
Not everyone in the neighborhood opposes Ikea.
"Things have been pretty tough for me," said Minnie R. Burrell, 55, a widow who has had a hard time making payments on her house since her sister-in-law moved out some months ago. "I would like to get out as soon as I can. I hope Ikea will give me what I would like."
But many others say that their lives have been impeded.
Gregory Sands owns Ortho-Rite, a factory that makes orthotic shoe inserts and employs about 25 people. He has rented a building on Plain Avenue for seven years and is waiting to buy a neighboring building, if the neighborhood survives.
Dominick Gataletto, 77, has lived in his eight-room house on Pleasant Street since he was 2. He has thought about moving several times, first when I-95 was being built and again after zoning changes allowed businesses to move in next to homes. But he does not want to leave now.
"So I've got factories around me and I've got industry around me, but I'm comfortable here," said Mr. Gataletto, a retired postman. "I've got the house fixed just the way I want it. It would be very difficult for me to find what I've got here."
And that is the problem.
If someone wanted to buy Mr. Jones a $500,000 house and pay its taxes, he would move. But he does not expect his little house on the highway to fetch that much.
"I say let us stay here and retire," Mr. Jones said. "How can they walk by and look at the house and say it's blight? I have my roses. I keep my grass short. How could they come in and take this land when we were practically born here? I'm sure they could find something else."

Greenspan Warns Again On Rates, and Stocks Fall
Just in case investors had chosen not to heed his previous warnings, Alan Greenspan gave them a reminder that the Federal Reserve intended to raise interest rates until it was sure it had squeezed any inflationary imbalances out of the economy.
In a speech at Boston College, Mr. Greenspan, the Fed chairman, repeated his message that the wealth being created in the stock market is creating more demand than the economy can satisfy. Page C2.

Qwest Is Daunted by Its Own Deal
If Qwest Communications International had not agreed to acquire U S West, Qwest probably would have announced a deal to be acquired by Deutsche Telekom of Germany by now, and at a healthy premium to its stock price of $57.25 a share. For Qwest's top executives, that has to hurt. Not only have they failed so far to grasp a highly lucrative opportunity, but more important, the hurdles standing in their way are strictly of their own making. Market Place. C16.

Music Industry Sees a New Threat
The music industry was already disturbed about how easy it is to copy music online without paying for it. But in recent months an online service called Napster has greatly magnified the threat by making it easier to find and copy music.

HEADLINE: Boeing's Brains Develop Brawn On Picket Line

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: TUKWILA, Wash., March 6

 BODY:
The chants and placards along the picket lines outside the Boeing Company's jet plants are a bit unusual. "No nerds, no birds," proclaims one sign. And many Boeing engineers, most on strike for the first time in their lives, say they are stunned at how unified their group has become in the face of its dispute with the giant aircraft manufacturer.
"Normally, if you get six engineers in a room, you'll get 12 different opinions," explained Steve Love, a 45-year-old flight test engineer who was warming his hands over a burning barrel on the picket line here the other day. "Well, Boeing has somehow managed to get 19,000 of us together with one thought and one goal, and that's a better contract." 
 Now nearing its fifth week, the increasingly bitter protest here by the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace has mushroomed into one of the largest strikes by white-collar workers against a private company in years. It is an unexpectedly fierce action by a group long considered a union in name only, whose sole act of defiance in its 56-year history was a one-day walkout in 1992.
For the company, which has clearly stirred up deep resentment among the engineers by failing to offer 10 percent cash signing bonuses and other terms of a contract it reached last summer with its larger machinists' union, the strike is posing growing problems. Boeing recently announced, for instance, that the strike had already delayed 15 of 42 commercial jet deliveries planned for February, and such delays are likely to worsen if a settlement is not reached soon, since many of the striking engineers are needed under federal law to certify new airplanes as flightworthy.
But for national labor leaders, who have rushed in to help the strikers, the walkout is seen as a major test of their ability to organize a potentially large segment of the work force: professional workers, like many of the engineers here, who complain of both relentless pressure in the workplace and salaries that they feel do not reflect their contributions to the booming national economy.
Labor has already scored once-unthinkable successes in organizing doctors, especially in California and Florida, who are especially angry at the intrusions of insurance companies on their salaries and relationships with patients. It is making determined efforts, with somewhat less success so far, to organize the high-tech workers who are a huge part of the economy here in the Seattle area and in Silicon Valley. And because the high-profile battle the engineers are waging here is likely to resonate far beyond the corridors of Boeing, organized labor is manning the ramparts in a bid to help them win.
John J. Sweeney, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., with which the engineers' union voted to affiliate a few months ago, visited the picket lines last week, and the federation's secretary-treasurer, Richard Trumka, the former head of the United Mine Workers, is due in town Tuesday. Both have promised money and help to the striking union, and Mr. Sweeney said the Boeing strike was an excellent example of how disgruntled white-collar workers could rally to press for better contracts and health benefits.
"This is a whole area of the new economy that organized labor would very much like to be involved in," said Harley Shaiken, a labor specialist at the University of California at Berkeley. "For many white-collar workers, there's just a volatile combination of feelings that they are underappreciated and not sharing fully in the benefits of this supposedly booming economy. This strike underscores what we've seen with doctors, teachers, now engineers -- there are many professionals who are feeling that they are the proletariat of the information age."
Even if the engineers prevail here and get a better contract, it remains to be seen, of course, whether organized labor can ever forge a broad-based coalition between professionals and the lower-wage workers it also continues to try to organize with major campaigns like the Justice for Janitors movement.
"These are different pressures and issues we're talking about," said Harry Katz, a professor in the school of industrial relations at Cornell University. "There are bound to be tensions between these kinds of workers and lower-wage earners. It's not at all clear that they have a lot of interests in common."
For now, though, here in the Seattle area, there is no question that the "brains behind the planes," as the engineers are sometimes called, are marching in the picket lines, and that truckers and other union workers who drive by here constantly blow their horns in support. (Some drivers making deliveries have declined to cross the picket lines; the machinists and other Boeing unions are contractually prohibited from stopping work in support of another union's strike at the company.)
Indeed, many Boeing engineers, who typically hold advanced degrees and whose salaries range from $37,000 to $128,000, express frustration at having to haggle over contract terms in a region where it seems like so many other smart, ambitious people are becoming dot-com millionaires. Many also expressed bitterness over the huge bonuses received by top corporate executives, including those at Boeing.
But an even more immediate factor in this strike seems to be the engineers' perception that the company is trying to play hardball with them while, the engineers say, it basically gave in with its settlement with the machinists' union. The company reached a deal with the machinists last summer as it was eager to achieve labor peace in the face of a huge backlog of orders; many analysts described the pact as extremely generous, and labor leaders described it as a major victory.
That pact, which headed off what would have been the third walkout by the machinists in the last 10 years, was approved overwhelmingly by the 44,000-member union. It raised hourly wages by nearly 16 percent over three years, and contained a one-time bonus averaging $4,400 per worker.
Details of the contract are labyrinthine, but the company essentially describes its offer as equally generous compared with what machinists received, and the engineers describe it as a step backward that nearly wipes out salary gains with new health-care fees.
In any event, it is undeniable that the engineers are incensed. Charles Bofferding, the union's executive director, likened Boeing's management to the schoolyard bully who declined to pick a fight with the class jock -- in this case, the machinists, the largest union at Boeing -- "and instead they see the little kid in the corner with the glasses and they say, 'Here, let's slap him around a little bit."'
"Well, guess what?" said Mr. Bofferding in an interview. "But what they don't realize is, the kid with the glasses has been taking kung fu. So watch out."
The union represents a broad array of engineers and technical workers with varying levels of training, though these workers are not required to join the union. The engineers' salaries average about $63,000; technical workers pay ranges from $21,000 a year to $81,000, with an average of $45,000.
Since contract negotiations began in October, more than 3,000 eligible workers have joined the union; while less than half of those eligible to join had done so last year, the figure now is nearly two-thirds -- 13,329 out of 20,683 workers in the "bargaining unit" are represented by the union. And even some of those who do not belong to the union are out on the picket lines. The union says 19,000 of the workers in the bargaining unit are out on strike; Boeing estimates that the number is about 17,000.
A Boeing spokesman, Peter Conte, said the company had made several generous offers to the union. Over the weekend, the company announced that it would try to impose the terms of its last contract offer on the engineers, a bid to force them back to work that the union insisted would not shake its resolve.
Many of the engineers say they have never even supported unions, and as one put it: "All that brotherhood and sisterhood propaganda kind of made me sick."
But that is changing. Jim Davis, a 64-year-old maintenance programs engineer who spent 27 years in the Navy and then the last 15 at Boeing, decided earlier this year to join the engineers' union.
"I've really been pretty much an anti-union person," said Mr. Davis, who has advanced degrees in aeroengineering and systems management. "I never, ever thought I'd see the day that I went out on strike. I still can't quite believe I'm out here on a picket line. But Boeing pushed me over the edge. I think they've been unreasonable and unresponsive to some truly unhappy engineers and technical workers."
Bill Sandell, a 34-year-old liaison engineer on the picket line, said he thought unions were for other kinds of workers, not engineers.
"I recognize their place for other people," he said. "But philosophically, I didn't want to be represented by a labor union. I wanted to be represented by my training, my experience and my abilities. I really thought that was my bargaining chip. But now, I feel like joining a union was really the only effective way to make my voice heard at this company."
Tom Claps, 37, a flight test engineer, said he was amazed to watch his fellow engineers, holding signs, chanting and throwing more wood in the blazing barrel to keep themselves warm.
"It takes a lot for a bunch of engineers to get up and walk out the door," he said. "The rocket scientists are literally out on the streets here. It's kind of incredible."

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
Don't Punish Africa

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
There is a travesty brewing in Congress that, if allowed to continue, will be a source of shame for all Americans. It will certainly be an ugly stain on the U.S. labor movement, particularly the apparel union and the A.F.L.-C.I.O. -- a stain that will highlight all the unions' phony-baloney assertions in Seattle that they just want to improve worker rights around the world and help the poor.
This controversy has to do with a stalled trade bill called The African Growth and Opportunity Act. And the bottom line is this: At a time when Africa is ravaged by AIDS, at a time when 290 million Africans -- more than the entire population of the U.S. -- are living on a dollar a day, the main U.S. textile union, UNITE!; the main textile manufacturers' lobby, ATMI; and the lawmakers who bow to both of them are blocking a bill that would allow Africans to export clothing to America duty free -- instead of with the current 17 percent import tax. 
 Why the opposition? Because Africa might increase its share of U.S. textile and apparel imports from its current level of 0.8 percent! Shame on the people blocking this bill. Shame on them.
Some 85 percent of the garments sold in the U.S. today are already sewn abroad. Honduras, little Honduras, already exports seven times more textiles and apparel to the U.S. than all 48 nations of sub-Saharan Africa combined. With our minimum wages, we can't produce jeans that retail for $16 and we don't want to. North Carolina's textile industry has already become highly automated and has moved away from low-value goods to high-value, high-tech fabrics. Much of the unionized labor force sewing clothes in the U.S. is in large cities and comprises new immigrants, many not citizens, since most Americans don't want these jobs.
If Africa were given duty-free access to our market, sophisticated textile plants in North Carolina wouldn't move to Madagascar. China would be the big loser, because Africans have the same skills to knit cashmere sweaters cheaply as people in China, and if Africa were given a 17 percent import tax advantage in shipping to the U.S., manufacturers would move their production from low-wage China to low-wage Africa. Which is why a study by the U.S. International Trade Commission concluded that "the impact of quota removal for African imports on U.S. producers and U.S. workers would be negligible."
So why do the unions still oppose it? Sheer knee-jerk protectionism -- even though the bill has tough measures to protect against any surge in imports from Africa, and restricts free-trade status to African countries moving toward democracy, economic reform and real worker protection.
No matter. Right now the only version of the bill the textile makers would permit is one that says Africa can only import duty-free into the U.S. if it first buys all the fabric, thread and yarn from U.S. factories, then ships it to Africa to be sewn, and then ships it back to the U.S. to be sold -- a costly obstacle course that would prevent any new investment in African factories. The real motto of U.S. trade unions is: We're for more worker standards in Africa, not more work.
This is really bad. This bill isn't a panacea for Africa, but it's important. Throughout the history of industrialization, poor countries have started down the road of development by sewing clothes. It's the one thing that poor people can do right away. It's critical that this bill go through now because by 2005 all the quotas on textile imports into the U.S. will expire. It will be a free-for-all. Right now investors are deciding where to locate plants for 2005 -- whether to stick with China or branch out to Africa, Vietnam or Mexico. If Africa is shut out from these investment decisions, it will fall even further behind.
The Clintonites talk the talk of Africa and AIDS, but, sadly, they have been afraid to get tough with the unions on this textile issue. Why is AIDS spreading so quickly among young women in Africa? One reason is that women have so few jobs they have to sell themselves to men with AIDS. Apparel jobs largely employ women. They make a difference.
But this is of no interest to the A.F.L.-C.I.O. crowd. All they care about is that Africa not sell more than 0.8 percent of garments here. Shame on them for what they are doing, and shame on us if we let them.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE ELECTORATE;
As a Region's Economy Booms, So Does Interest in the Race

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: COVINGTON, Ga., March 1

 BODY:
In the old orange cotton fields of Newton County's past, bright automated factories now turn out an unending stream of Honey Nut Cheerios and flawless polyester sheeting. And with each truck that heads out from here on Interstate 20, the transformed local economy also produces what might be called the opposite of complacency, an engagement with the world of prosperity and politics that has surprised even those who planned for this growth.
Here in north central Georgia, Newton County and its neighbors are practically reverberating with the economic success that has enveloped the once rural region. With the unemployment rate below 3 percent, good jobs are piling up in the classified ads. There are no longer any vacant stores facing the historic town square, which served for years as the backdrop to the television series "In the Heat of the Night." 
 And suddenly, national politics does not seem to be so distant an exercise. People with health benefits and retirement portfolios talk about the presidential race as if they were company shareholders examining a slate of directors, thoughtfully dissecting the candidates and their inner lives. When talk at restaurants around the square turns to the presidential primary on Tuesday, there is a sense of absorption in people's voices, as if they know these candidates well, and as if the knowledge matters.
"I've been listening to Bush during this campaign, and it's like he's becoming stronger because he had to figure out McCain," said Dan Corder, a builder of subdivision homes, who was sitting in Smiley's Restaurant on the square. "I think he's learned something about the country from this campaign. Maybe he's figured out that we don't want the old party politics anymore."
Crystal Butler, who works at Bell's Discount Groceries west of town, is delighted with the county's growth and the number of her friends who are no longer unemployed, and plans to thank Vice President Al Gore with her vote on Tuesday.
"I like the way he tells people what he's going to do on education and the economy," she said. "He comes across like he really means it. And he doesn't spend all his time chopping on people, like the Republicans do."
If previous election campaigns seemed to people here a blur of headlines and angry demands, this year's is more like an interesting but leisurely novel. The plot, played out by wildly contrasting characters, is one of national prosperity, and the people of Newton County have a big stake in its outcome. Like many voters in earlier primary states, those here say economic growth is a chief issue driving them to the polls on Tuesday.
Michael Hinkle, a mechanical maintenance supervisor at the huge new Korean-owned SKC factory, which makes enormous rolls of high-quality plastic film, said he too was planning to vote for Gov. George W. Bush, but was enjoying the competition from Senator John McCain, which has produced high turnouts in several primary states.
"I'm a Bush person, but I'm sure curious about McCain," said Mr. Hinkle, who moved here from central Alabama to take his high-tech job. "I want to do some research and find out what he stands for and why people are attracted to him."
There is not much doubt who will win in Georgia on Tuesday. Both Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore are enormously popular here, and none of the four major candidates have even bothered to campaign regularly in the state. But inevitability does not seem to have dimmed Newton County's interest in this election. No one here has seen a single political advertisement or shaken a candidate's hand, and yet voters are planning to show up at the polls, without making decisions in last-minute frustration. Republican officials are predicting a record turnout for the state, and the Democratic primary may draw large crowds as well.
"People are spending more time looking at the intangible things that they never got to before," said Denny Dobbs, an environmental engineer and former state legislator whose family has lived in the county for four generations. "They want truth, they want sincerity, but mostly they want to take the time to find someone who can give them a normal presidency. Someone who will do what they say and not disappoint them."
Newton County, in fact, is full of people who are in no mind to be disappointed. The county spent years at a comfortable distance from Atlanta's chaotic boom, hoping to nibble at growth while avoiding the strip malls and tract homes. The invasion could not be held off, but now the benefits of good times have also arrived here with full force.
Every week seems to bring another announcement of a new employer or subdivision taking advantage of the 45-minute drive to Atlanta's airport, Hartsfield International. When the SKC plant, where machine operators are paid between $14 and $22 an hour, expands to full size in seven or eight years, it will employ more than 1,000 people and, at $1.5 billion, amount to the largest industrial investment in the state's history.
Now that they have begun to taste the good life, many of the county's 59,000 people want to hear precisely what each candidate would do to keep it going. They want to know details of education planks and economic blueprints. People who work at SKC, or Michelin's tread-pressing factory, or Nisshinbo Automotive's brake-pad assembly plant, are far more interested in trade policy than they would have been a few years ago.
"It's really broadened people's horizons, and I don't think any of us fully anticipated that," said Samuel B. Hay III, chief executive of Main Street Bank, one of the largest retail banks here. "We've got a large Asian contingent here now, a French glass maker, people moving here from all over the world. There might be some political friction, but I think over all it's better for the community."
Like most rural Southern counties, Newton retains a large number of ardent Democrats, many of them the blacks who make up about 26 percent of the population and descendants of the liberal Methodists who founded the original Emory College, in the town of Oxford, just north of Covington. Many well-educated natives of the county who once assumed that they would have to leave to find a good job, like Michael Davis, the plant scheduler at SKC, now say they are thrilled to be able to work where they grew up.
But Newton's location about 50 miles east of downtown Atlanta has made it increasingly attractive too for a growing number of newcomers, many of them commuters who tend to settle in suburban developments on the western edge of the county and vote Republican.
As a result, Newton is fairly evenly split between Republicans and Democrats, and has been a swing county for several elections. In 1992, Bill Clinton won the county by just 7 votes, of 13,613 cast; he lost it to Bob Dole by 515 votes four years later. In 1998, Roy Barnes, a Democrat elected governor that year, lost the county to Guy Millner by just 73 votes. Many people suspect that the tiny but detectable trend toward a Republican majority may deepen as county incomes rise.
"The new people coming in are more conservative, more Republican, pushing things to the right," said one Democrat, Don Ballard, a lawyer who has long been politically active in the area and whose son, Tommy, is running as a Republican for chairman of the county commission. "I suspect that the county will go for Bush" in the general election, the elder Mr. Ballard said, "although we've got the economy as our ace in the hole."
It is clear, though, that fervent partisanship of either stripe does not appeal to most residents here, new or old. Considerable interest in Mr. McCain is expressed by many of the county's voters, including Democrats, who expect him to do well in a region where personality and policy now often outweigh party affiliation.
Covington's mayor, Sam Ramsey, who owns a large furniture store just off the square, is a longtime Democrat who occasionally finds himself voting Republican and has seen the tendency in others. The movement away from party loyalty, he says, is inevitable as income and education rise, but in no way reflects a disengagement from the political process.
"I think people enjoy making up their own minds, forming their own opinions about the candidates," he said amid the clutter of his busy store. "You might think that in a good economy people might not be as concerned, but in a smaller community like this, we don't see that. It's not the big city, where people think they're not important. Here they know they've got a role to play."

HEADLINE: Fire Races Through Stretch Of Shops in Heart of Mystic

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

DATELINE: MYSTIC, Conn., March 6

 BODY:
A fire destroyed a half-block stretch of shops early this morning in this historic maritime center, leaving a charred wreck in the center of Connecticut's most popular tourist destination. It was the fourth time since 1863 that fire has struck the same building on West Main Street, just steps from Mystic's famous drawbridge.
The building's eight storefront businesses were destroyed in the blaze, which began shortly after 12:30 a.m. and smoldered almost until dawn. The structural damage to the wood-frame building is so severe, officials said, that it will have to be condemned, which will leave a wide vacant lot at the core of a downtown commercial district that draws some two million visitors a year. 
 "It's a hole right in the heart of downtown Mystic," said Linnea Lindstrom, executive director of the Mystic Chamber of Commerce, which has called an emergency meeting on Wednesday night to help relocate the ruined businesses. "It's had quite an emotional impact. These stores have a lot of memories for a lot of people. The store owners are our neighbors and our friends."
The building, built on pylons over the Mystic River, has always been at the center of town life. For much of the 19th century, it was filled with stores, offices and a large public meeting space where traveling performers like Tom Thumb and speakers like Frederick Douglass and William Lloyd Garrison came to find an audience. The rear of the wrecked building overlooks historic Mystic Seaport and its collection of tall ships, schooners and whaling boats. The building is three blocks east of Mystic Pizza, which became famous by lending its name to the 1988 movie featuring Julia Roberts. Firefighters were able to stop the fire from spreading to adjacent buildings, and no one was hurt.
The ruined stores, at 10-22 West Main Street, were exactly the type of quirky, independent shops that tourists adore poking around on summer afternoons, including Trade Winds, a gallery of antique maps and nautical prints; Dexter's handcrafted jewelry and pewterware; Radio Waves vintage music, and Pepper Grass & Tulip, which sold crafts and antiques.
"I'm unemployed for the first time in my life," said Tom Dexter, whose jewelry shop had been in the building for 22 years. "It's a disheartening feeling," he said, adding that he hoped to find temporary space and rebuild within six months.
Some of the business owners were away on vacation, residents said, taking a last break before spring and the onset of the heavy tourist season. Gov. John G. Rowland toured the fire scene this afternoon and promised that the state would assist in rebuilding. The owners of the building, Rufus Allyn and Roy N. Bohlander, did not have casualty insurance.
Mr. Allyn, whose family has owned the building for generations, said he could not estimate its worth. But Celeste and Judi Caracausa, sisters who run a real estate agency, said the building could have sold for $1.2 million to $1.5 million. "This part of downtown is like a little jewel," Judi Caracausa said.
Officials also said it was too soon to calculate the loss to each of the eight businesses. Few people in town were optimistic that a new building could be constructed in time for this year's high season. "Tourist season is going to be starting in a couple of weeks," said Tami Murray, who works in advertising for The Mystic River Press, the local weekly newspaper. "They are not going to be able to be open to get the majority of their revenue."
The Mystic fire chief, Fitz Hilbert, said an alarm was first received at 12:38 a.m. By the time firefighters reached the scene minutes later, he said, flames had already raced through a loft that ran the length of the wood-frame building, above all eight stores. Firefighters immediately set about breaking through the roof to let the flames escape, he said.
More than 100 firefighters from at least a half dozen surrounding towns joined in helping to suppress the blaze, Chief Hilbert said, and it was extinguished about 5 a.m. He said officials had not pinpointed a precise cause, but the fire did not appear to be suspicious. "There is no reason to believe at this time it's anything other than accidental," he said.
While the fire did not immediately draw huge crowds, the few people who saw it immediately pitched in to help. Christine Cooney-Breeding, the owner of a health food store across the street, stayed up most of the night providing firefighters with coffee. By morning staff members of the nearby Residence Inn arrived with more coffee, hot chocolate, instant soup, muffins and cookies.
Ms. Lindstrom, at the Chamber of Commerce, began contacting property owners with vacant retail space, including the Mashantucket Pequot Indian tribe, which owns the huge Foxwoods Casino as well as some vacant store properties on Holmes Street. "It was amazing to see all of the owners of the buildings taking care of each other," Ms. Scarpa said.

HEADLINE: China Army Renews Threat Against Taiwan Separatism

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING, March 6

 BODY:
In one of the most forceful statements yet on Taiwan, the Chinese military said today that it would "spare no effort in a blood-soaked battle" to protect China's territorial integrity and that China would not be tricked into negotiations with Taiwan leaders who secretly opposed rejoining the motherland.
While it did not mention by name any candidates in Taiwan's presidential election on March 18, the warning, in an editorial of the Liberation Army Daily, seemed to be aimed at Chen Shui-bian, the candidate of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party. 
 For years Mr. Chen and his party campaigned for Taiwan's formal independence from China, which considers the island an integral part of the nation that was separated by civil war.
Mr. Chen has recently moderated that position, saying a formal declaration would not be necessary because Taiwan already enjoys de facto independence. He promises that if elected, he will seek deeper economic ties and peace talks with the mainland.
But in language clearly intended to describe Mr. Chen, the editorial said Taiwan leaders who "consistently pushed for independence" had used "sweet-sounding rhetoric to bluff that they want to have 'benevolent harmony, positive cooperation and lasting peace' with the mainland -- all to swindle the Taiwan populace."
"We must on no account be dazzled by the pretty phrases," the editorial said.
The editorial from the military's official mouthpiece was reprinted in People's Daily and other newspapers, indicating that the views had been approved at the highest levels of the Communist Party. And the government also signaled its resolution when the Finance Minister, Xiang Huaicheng, announced a 12.7 percent rise in military spending for this year.
While Mr. Chen appeared to be the subject of the editorial, neither of Taiwan's other leading candidates has unambiguously accepted what China calls an unshakable precondition for talks: that Taiwan is legally part of a Beijing-centered "One China."
Some creative compromises in language will be needed if the hopes in Taipei and Beijing for renewed dialogue later this year, with a new president of Taiwan, are to be realized.
The military editorial was part of an orchestrated barrage of warnings from senior leaders here as Taiwan's election approaches, the American Congress debates a proposal for closer military ties with the island and the Clinton administration weighs Taiwan's request for advanced weapons.
It will be many years before China has the military capacity to mount a blockade of Taiwan, let alone invade it, foreign analysts say. But the Chinese leaders have clearly decided that they must put pressure on the island now to halt a slide toward independence.
In a policy statement on Feb. 21 that created new worries in Taipei and Washington, China said more clearly than before that Taiwan's indefinite foot-dragging in negotiations could set off an attack, a threat previously made against an outright declaration of independence. But the report stressed China's desire for a peaceful settlement and its willingness to grant Taiwan extraordinary autonomy.
That report gave no deadline for talks, and none of the subsequent statements indicate changes in the carrot-and-stick policy it outlined. But the recent pronouncements have stressed China's desire to secure the return of Taiwan "at an early date."
On Sunday, while expressing hopes for a peaceful settlement, Prime Minister Zhu Rongji, who is considered a moderate on the issue, said China "will not sit idly by and watch any serious separatist activity."
Sunday's newspapers featured a speech by President Jiang Zemin in which he restated China's preference for negotiations but also the threat of "drastic measures" if Taiwan delays indefinitely.
In a speech to legislators on Sunday, Gen. Zhang Wannian, a top military leader, said, "The two sides of the strait cannot remain perpetually divided," and "Taiwanese independence means war."
In Taiwan the three major presidential candidates have all described themselves as peacemakers, promising to encourage economic ties and engage in talks with the mainland.
At the same time, none have disowned President Lee Teng-hui's assertion that Taiwan's dealings with the mainland should be conducted on a state-to-state basis. Mr. Lee's stance has been popular, and it appears to be politically impossible for any candidate to backtrack too far.
On Sunday, Vice President Lien Chan, the candidate of the governing Nationalist Party, warned voters that it would be reckless to elect Mr. Chen, because of his "independence platform."
But Mr. Lien also said, "The so-called state-to-state relationship is the constant policy of my country and my government," repeating the phrase that outraged Beijing when Mr. Lee first used it last summer.

HEADLINE: Behind China's Threats

BYLINE: By CRAIG S. SMITH 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, March 6

 BODY:
China's renewed threat of war against Taiwan has caused anxiety in the West, but Beijing's military options for attacking the island remain limited and impractical, a fact often overlooked in the furor in Washington.
Though China's Army outnumbers Taiwan's six to one, the country lacks a transport fleet large enough to ferry a major invasion force across the Taiwan Strait. And even if it could muster the ships, China does not have the means to secure control of the sea or air separating it from the island to carry out such a deployment. 
 "There's no way at this moment that Beijing has the weapons in its arsenal in sufficient numbers to undertake and sustain a major, full-scale assault on Taiwan," says Jonathan Pollack, a China specialist at the Rand Corporation in California.
China does have nuclear weapons, but using them against avowed compatriots in Taiwan is highly unlikely. Most Western military experts say it will be years, if not decades, before the mainland mounts a credible threat.
Beijing's vow to use force, made in a policy paper last month at the start of Taiwan's presidential election campaign and repeated in an editorial in a military newspaper today, is meant to warn the island away from formal independence and push it toward serious negotiations on reunification with the mainland. Beijing still regards Taiwan as its territory, occupied by the Nationalist authorities who fled there during China's civil war in the 1940's.
But forcing the island to the table is a delicate game; were Taiwan to survive a misguided mainland military campaign, it would probably declare independence and win widespread diplomatic support abroad.
Beijing does have alternatives to an invasion, though none of them seem likely.
The option that experts in Taiwan and the West take most seriously, because it is the one most available to China today, would be a short, Kosovo-like missile campaign intended to devastate Taiwan's economy -- either by direct strikes on sites in Taiwan, or by disrupting shipping lanes. China has hundreds of short-range ballistic missiles pointed at the island.
Supplemented with information warfare -- using computer viruses and electromagnetic pulses to knock out Taiwan's communications and transportation, for instance -- and perhaps sabotage by Beijing's agents on the island, incoming missiles could demoralize Taiwan's people and undermine support for Taipei from the island's business elite. Many in that group have investments on both sides of the strait and might prefer political compromise to economic ruin.
"If it didn't work, Beijing may not be greatly harmed by great loss of forces, as may be the case with other options," said Eric McVadon, a retired United States Navy rear admiral and a former defense attache in Beijing. He says this is the possibility that most worries him.
But the domestic risks if such a strategy failed would be dire. Mr. McVadon added that such a dramatically belligerent act could isolate China diplomatically and halt most exports to the United States and other major markets.
Foreign investment might dry up, as it did in the year after Beijing's crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators at Tiananmen Square in 1989. China's economic engine, still dependent on export revenue and foreign investment inflows to keep its people employed, would probably sputter and slow to a crawl.
China's economy is already at low ebb and so in some ways more fragile than in 1989. The country has spent billions of dollars to prop up slowing economic growth in the last two years and cannot afford to do so indefinitely.
Unemployment is as high as 30 percent in some parts of the industrial northeast, and the economic shock that would follow military action against Taiwan would worsen conditions for many already disgruntled people. If an action against Taiwan failed, Beijing could face a groundswell of domestic opposition.
"A defeat would mean the end of the regime," said a Hong Kong-based economist who asked not to be identified. "The risk to the party is far more than just more economic stress."
Such a brutal approach, meanwhile, would cast China as an international pariah and reverse decades of diplomatic confidence building. Beijing is still stinging from the international condemnation that followed the killings of protesters near Tiananmen Square.
The trade concessions it has offered to join the World Trade Organization are, in part, an attempt to erase that legacy. The deal is contingent upon Congress ending its annual review of China's trade status, an exercise put in place after the Tiananmen crackdown.
And China would not win much of a prize if it did cripple Taiwan's economy. It would jeopardize a major source of investment -- Taiwan has invested more than $30 billion in the mainland -- and would destroy what little good will it has on the island.
In any case, China is years from being able to "take" Taiwan.
Any large-scale attempt to cross the strait would be obvious for weeks ahead of time as China massed men and equipment on its shores. And once at sea, such a force would be sitting ducks for Taiwan's Air Force or even two submarines positioned at either end of the strait.
China's chief problem is air cover: It has far more planes than Taiwan, but most are out-of-date blowflies compared with Taiwan's jets. The 72 SU-27 fighters that China has bought from Russia could outmaneuver Taiwan's aging F-5's, but probably not the island's 150 F-16's, 60 French Mirage 2000's or air defenses, which include advanced Patriot missiles.
Equally daunting are the many ground and airborne radar systems that the United States has supplied to Taiwan to coordinate air and sea assaults.
China lacks the technology in its offensive forces to cope with those defenses, military experts say, though it is trying to acquire such technology from Russia and Israel.
China does have air defense missiles, but they lack the range and ability to effectively clear the strait's skies long enough to permit safe movement of an invasion force.
The best China could hope for would be to disable Taiwan's Air Force by pounding its airfields and communications centers with short-range ballistic missiles and then land enough men to take an airport or other strategic installation, giving them a base to build on.
But the chances that such an isolated invasion force could survive would be slim, while the chances that those soldiers would end up as prisoners and bargaining chips for Taipei is high enough to argue against that course of action.
China could seize one or two of Taiwan's outlying islands; Jinmen and Matsu lie just a few miles off the mainland's coast. But those islands are heavily fortified with thousands of Taiwanese troops, and so the cost of taking them would likely be high and the gain slim.
Or Beijing could attempt a naval blockade, hoping to bring Taiwan to heel.
China's Navy has enough ships to enforce a quarantine. And the island's economy is almost entirely dependent on trade, including imported oil. Taipei might buckle to domestic pressure and negotiate terms of reunification if its factories stopped running.
But coordinating such an action is far more complex than anything China's Navy has attempted before. And blockades are easier to circumvent than to sustain.
Worse, Taiwan might decide to fight rather than negotiate if backed into a corner; that could prove disastrous for Beijing because it is outgunned both at sea and in the air.
For now, China's most likely military action will be more war games and other training exercises in the coastal provinces facing Taiwan. China has mounted such maneuvers many times before, most recently in September. The size and threatening nature of those exercises could increase, but they are likely to remain games for now.
Meanwhile, China's is working to upgrade its arsenal. It is improving the accuracy and number of short-range ballistic missiles aimed at the island and is developing a land-attack cruise missile with accurate "terminal homing" -- in other words, a "smart" bomb.
Russia has agreed to supply China kits for 200 more SU-27 jet fighters, and Beijing reportedly will soon buy even more advanced SU-30's. And Israel is expected to supply China with an airborne warning and control system mounted on Russian IL-76 jets that could be used for battle management.
But the new weapons will not necessarily shift the balance of power in China's favor anytime soon. Taiwan will also continue to improve its arsenal and operational skills. And it will take years before China's military is proficient enough to use the high-tech weapons effectively.
"Troops equipped with weapons produced by various countries are virtually incapable of integrating them in modern, high-tech warfare," said Wang Weixin, a senior researcher at China's Military Academy.
Mr. Wang, quoted this week in China's armed forces paper, Liberation Daily, was talking about Taiwan's troops, but the judgment applies equally to those of his own country.

HEADLINE: LEGACY;
Child Raising 201: A Graduate Course for Grandmothers

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS 

 BODY:
MARTA FELIZ, a Dominican grandmother, has been practicing public speaking skills in front of the bathroom mirror and projects with such verve she could pass for Evita.
Her subject is a touchy one for a woman of her background: how to discuss sex with grandchildren. But she is well prepared after 12 classes at Fordham University for grandparents who are raising their grandchildren -- hours of role playing, written homework and a thick binder of information. 
 On this winter morning, Ms. Feliz is trying out her speech in front of her classmates, all recent graduates of the Fordham program, in New York City. Now that they have their diplomas, Ms. Feliz and the rest are expected to take their show on the road, sharing their newfound wisdom with other custodial grandmothers and lobbying civic leaders for the services such women need.
Ms. Feliz would have aced the course if grades had been given. In session 11, she learned how to rehearse for a public speaking engagement, refer to note cards, make eye contact, use wit to engage her audience and open the floor to questions at the end. She has that all down pat.
In session 5, she learned that when talking about "el sexo" with her grandchildren she is supposed to be matter of fact. "Talk the way you would talk about teeth or ears," the training manual says. "Use the right names -- vagina and penis." And so this is what she tells her audience of fellow grandmothers.
The women in the room giggle, girlishly. One, Maria Peralta, said that when she first discussed sexually transmitted diseases with her 13-year-old grandson, after learning how to talk about it in her class, he was so shocked by her vocabulary that he crossed himself.
The program, created and taught by Carole B. Cox, a professor of social work at Fordham, is an outgrowth of the support groups for custodial grandparents that began in the late 1980's and proliferated in the early 90's as more inner-city children lost their parents to drugs, AIDS, incarceration or violent death.
The grandmothers' support groups -- common these days at senior centers, churches, social-welfare agencies and some public schools -- are an antidote to the isolation, exhaustion and guilt these women experience, an oasis of empathy in lives shadowed by pain and loss.
The program is not a substitute for the support groups but rather an adjunct, an opportunity for a handpicked group of grandmothers to study the skills they need to raise their wounded grandchildren and then go into their communities and spread the word.
Dr. Cox first taught the program in 1998 to a class of 15 African-American grandmothers who were members of a support group at the Harlem Interfaith Counseling Center. One of their first outreach efforts after graduation was to visit a group for Hispanic grandmothers at Public School 5 in Washington Heights.
Those women were so hungry for information that they clamored for training of their own, in Spanish. With money from the New York Community Trust, Dr. Cox taught a second round with help from Carmen L. Valcarcel of the Children's Aid Society, who was running the Spanish-language support group at P.S. 5.
The curriculum is rigorous and the grandmothers are discouraged from using the sessions to gripe or vent, as they do in the support group. Each session is devoted to a topic -- communication, behavior problems, sex, grief, the social service system, legal issues, advocacy skills and more.
They learn the difference between discipline and punishment, between talking with a child and talking to a child. They learn to distinguish between transient behavioral and emotional problems and enduring problems that require professional help. They learn to soothe a grieving grandchild who has lost a parent when they, too, are grieving over the loss of a child. They learn to cope with an uncomprehending toddler or a recalcitrant teenager.
They learn to be persistent and assertive when dealing with the social service agencies that award, among other forms of financial aid, Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, Supplemental Social Security and food stamps. They learn what information to provide when dealing with a social worker, case manager or lawyer and how to conduct such meetings and follow up. They learn how to lobby elected leaders, prepare a brochure for distribution at a senior center and make a presentation urging other grandmothers to seek help.
"We want to empower them to cope with their own problems and help others as peer educators," said Dr. Cox, who is the editor of a new anthology of scholarship about custodial grandparents and is writing a paper about the different experience of African-American and Hispanic grandmothers.
Many Hispanic women, Dr. Cox and Ms. Valcarcel said, are hobbled by their unfamiliarity with English and the fact that they are raising children in a culture different from the one in which they matured themselves. They are also less powerful forces in their own families than African-American women are in black families and, as a result, are not accustomed to taking charge, Dr. Cox and Ms. Valcarcel said.
Often, the grandmothers are sharing child-raising duties with their sons or daughters, who work long hours and go to school. This is a less tragic situation than a grandchild orphaned or abandoned. But it means the grandmothers have responsibility without authority. And in cases where drugs, AIDS or prison have fractured a family, Hispanic women are less likely than African-American women to talk openly about what happened, even in a supportive setting.
"They never talk badly about their own children," said Ms. Valcarcel, who was born in Puerto Rico. "They would never share such things with anyone else."
Even those who break the mold and discuss such issues do so sparingly. Aida Marriott, a retired custodian, for instance, is raising two teenage granddaughters, Julie and Vanessa Avila. The girls' father, Mrs. Marriott said, died in 1988 of AIDS, after years of drug addiction and several turns in prison. Their mother, Mrs. Marriott's only child, died in 1993. Mrs. Marriott said her daughter was an addict and a victim of domestic violence who died of a stroke at age 28.
The 15 Hispanic women, who still meet every few weeks as they prepare to become ad hoc outreach workers, said that Dr. Cox's curriculum, which will be published soon as part of the Springer Series on Lifestyle and Issues on Aging, was a godsend. But more than the individual lessons, the women appreciated the opportunity to learn in a college setting.
EACH week of training they were bused from Washington Heights to the Manhattan campus of Fordham, near Lincoln Center. For most of them, sitting in a college classroom was a first. Their graduation was an elegant affair, with corsages and finger food. The women treasure the snapshots taken that day nearly as much as their diplomas.
Mrs. Marriott, 71, is one of the few to have attended college in their native country; in her case, Ecuador. Her economics degree hangs on the wall of the living room in her Yonkers apartment, displayed even more prominently than the many crucifixes. On an end table is a photograph in a silver frame of a beautiful young woman on the day of her graduation from the University of Guayaquil.
That diploma and her new one, she hopes, will inspire Julie, 15, and Vanessa, 13, whose rebellious behavior landed them in a group home two weeks last year, sent there by a Family Court judge who hoped to scare them into coming home at night.
The girls are sullen and uncommunicative, just how Dr. Cox's training manual says they are likely to be at this age. "It takes patience and caring to hang in there when a teenager is behaving badly and seems ungrateful," the manual says. Mrs. Marriott tries her best.
She sometimes succeeds in rousing them to respond in kind, as they did when she graduated from the Fordham program. That day, Julie and Vanessa cleaned the apartment and cooked a celebratory dinner. Then they admired Mrs. Marriott's latest diploma.
"She told us this is what we need to get in the future," Julie said. "We need to achieve stuff. And it doesn't matter what age you are, you can still succeed."

HEADLINE: IDENTITY;
Going Home With a Postmodern Medicine Man

BYLINE: By BILL DONAHUE; Bill Donahue, a correspondent for Outside magazine, has also written for The New York Times Magazine.

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore.

 BODY:
IN the muted light of the museum, beside a diorama of a traditional Wasco Indian wedding, Spider Moccasin shared a piece of the creation myth of his grandmother's people, the Wasco of the Pacific Northwest: "Coyote was swallowed by Itc!i'xyan, this shapeless terror of a monster. And. . . ."
Spider Moccasin is an antic storyteller. His hands carved the air and his eyes flashed. For a second I imagined we were outside, on the Warm Springs Indian Reservation in Oregon, beside a campfire, the sound of drums in the distance. (The monster's name, by the way, is pronounced IX-lit-i-can.) 
 "And then Coyote was trapped in Itc!i'
xyan's belly," he continued, "and he couldn't communicate, so he pulled out his laptop and. . . ."
Well, maybe it is better to think of the campfire as virtual, a sort of holographic flame leaping in a dark void as MTV blares in the background. Spider Moccasin has not lived with his tribe for the last 20 years. He lives in Portland, where he graduated from the Pacific Northwest College of Art in 1990 and now spends most of his time in his dingy, cubicle-size art studio. He calls himself a "postmodern medicine man."
A 34-year-old cartoonist and singer-songwriter whose given name is Marcus Moseley, he has spent the last decade furiously reinventing himself. Through his political art, he has tried to reconcile his tastes for Spiderman comics and the rock band Rage Against the Machine with the ghosts of his ancestral past.
He has written a book that has yet to be published, a 400-page novel about an urban Indian who finds himself by going home; produced an urban powwow that starred an American Indian poet; and played his Dylanesque protest folk music in Portland clubs. In January, he released his debut compact disc, "Spider Moccasin," which focuses on important issues confronting Northwest Indians, including the Army's plans to incinerate nerve gas on Umatilla Indian land. "Fifty years ago, I would have been beaten to shreds" for playing such songs, he said.
Mainstream culture has long been exacting about the way Indians should express their ethnicity. Early-20th-century Indian youths were forced to go to boarding schools, where federal officials lopped off their braids and beat them for speaking their own languages. More recently, films like "Dances With Wolves" have saddled Indians with another expectation. "We're all supposed to be pure, like Sitting Bull," Spider Moccasin said.
In reality, American Indian life has long been a blend of ancient traditions and pop culture flotsam. Now, young Indians are increasingly deciding that they can keep their culture alive by modernizing it. Off the coast of Washington State, for instance, a small group of young Makahs has revived a tribal tradition of whale hunting by giving it a new twist. As they ply the Pacific Ocean in their hand-carved canoe, they carry a .577-caliber elephant rifle. At powwows, where drumming has long been an almost exclusively male activity, the Mankillers, a California troupe consisting of Indian women, is beating its own rhythms. The group has released a compact disc, "The Mankillers."
Kate Jackson, an elder at the Warm Springs reservation, is wary of such gestures, arguing that "our culture's music is for the reservations, not for wannabes looking for a payout." Her disdain is held only by ardent traditionalists, though, and even mainstream America is recognizing the complexity of Indian identity.
More than ever, people want to hear the voices of contemporary Indians. In Boulder, Colo., the Four Winds Trading Company, a large distributor of American Indian music, reported that its sales increased roughly 40 percent in each of the last three years. Hollywood's first feature film written and directed by Indians, Sherman Alexie's and Chris Eyre's "Smoke Signals," was released in 1998 to favorable critical reaction. Mr. Alexie, a Spokane tribal member, has contracted with Miramax to shoot his second film, an adaptation of his novel, "Reservation Blues." The film focuses on a Catholic Indian rock band that subsists largely on "wish sandwiches" -- you wish something was between the bread.
SPIDER MOCCASIN'S diet would be similar if his dishwashing job did not provide free food. He earns $600 a month, and he sleeps on friends' couches. When he is staying nearby, we chat. Once he told me about his great-grandmother, Pistol Packin' Annie, whose gun scared federal officials who were trying to drag her children to boarding school.
Another time, he described how he had chosen his name. It was 1988 and he was "running away from being Indian," he said. He had few American Indian friends; all his comic-book sketches were of white superheroes. One night he tried suicide, ingesting sleeping pills. In his delirium, he recalled a "supernatural incident," a healing ceremony he witnessed on his great-aunt Zelma Smith's ranch when he was 12. A spider appeared. The person being treated, he said, "was struggling with the same thing I was, culture shock, and suddenly I came to think of that spider as representing the modern world." He realized that the spider was "just an issue that Indians have to contend with."
"I made myself throw up," he said. "I wanted to live."
The ranch is in Warm Springs, about 110 miles from Portland, and on a recent weekend we went to the reservation to visit the place he calls home.
With his friend Jamie Stewart, a Karuk Indian, we drove east in Mr. Stewart's battered pickup truck, through the suburbs and over snowy Mount Hood. Spider Moccasin was wearing a T-shirt depicting the 1928 Wasco Royal Court, and one princess on the shirt was his grandmother, Mildred Smith. Ms. Smith was a full-blooded Wasco, a tribe that once lived on the banks of the Columbia River and fished for salmon. In 1855, the government moved the Wascos 50 miles south to Warm Springs, where they were forced to live beside two rival tribes, the Paiute and the Warm Springs.
The three tribes rarely mingled. But in the mid-1930's, Spider Moccasin's grandmother married a Warm Springs man. Their seven children, Spider Moccasin boasted, "united the tribes for business in the 20th century." One went to Harvard Law School; another became a champion at fancy dancing, a powwow tradition. The most successful was Ken Smith, who spent nearly 20 years as the chief executive of Warm Springs' confederated tribes.
As we rolled down Mount Hood and onto the reservation's red, sage-speckled plains, his legacy was clear. We passed many buildings he had helped build: the museum, a health center, a tribal administration center. Then we stopped at his lavish home and went in.
Spider Moccasin had not seen Mr. Smith in six years and had not been to Warm Springs in more than a year. We made polite conversation, sipped tea and then left for Spider Moccasin's childhood home, a modest yellow clapboard ranch house. His parents divorced in 1976, and he lived at Warm Springs with his mother, Rosella Moseley, until 1980, when they moved to Beaverton, a Portland suburb, for its good public schools.
Ms. Moseley is an advocate for poor people; she became outspoken on Indian issues at age 20. "She was in a car accident going over Mount Shasta in California, and her eye was torn from her head," Spider Moccasin said. "They rushed her to the hospital, but they said, 'We don't take Indians,' so then they took her to the vet's. They got her some whiskey and tied her down and they took some sandpaper to her skin. They got the glass out of her face and pushed her eye back into the socket by hand."
The next day, at Indian Trails restaurant, we ran into a cousin of Spider Moccasin's, Darreck Palmer. Mr. Palmer, 18, is a singer for a hip-hop act called Native Mobb, and his tales of the reservation's other rap bands enthralled Spider Moccasin. We followed Mr. Palmer to a remote house that was essentially hip-hop central in Warm Springs.
Inside, were seven young men from the reservation in sagging slacks. A keyboard track thumped on the stereo, and each young man rose in turn to blast his own rhymes into a microphone.
"You may think I'm in a gang," cried Brian Renfro, 20, "but I'm all about dat Native Mobb thang." Gerald Tufti, 21, sang of "words that left me open, living the life my grandma'd been hopin'."
Last spring, there was a rift among the rappers that began with the bands Straight Savage and Native Mobb mocking each other's music and culminated with both spouting threatening lyrics.
More recently, death has brought unity. Just after dawn on a Saturday last summer, Lance Thomas, a member of Native Mobb, was killed with three friends when he crashed his Thunderbird into a truck on the highway south of Warm Springs.
FOR Mr. Thomas, the crash ended a tumultuous adolescence. Warm Springs has neither a middle school nor a high school, so he rode a bus to school in Madras, a rough cowboy town 15 miles away. Like many Warm Springs youths, he dropped out. Robert Medina, a onetime substitute parent for Mr. Thomas, said that the young man had spent his last months "unemployed, partying and mouthing off to police."
His friends gave voice to his anguish. "Every breath that I take," Mr. Tufti half-whispered, half-sang, "I'm getting nearer to my end."
Spider Moccasin felt the power of the words. "Who said Indian kids couldn't write?" he said. He flashed his hand at the rappers, pinkie up, gangster style, and then stepped to the mike to sing his own song. "Manifest Destiny forgotten!" he shouted. "Who writes the history books? Manifest Destiny forgotten! A lost century or two slipstream, lost culture, no one else to turn into!"
Everyone cheered and shouted.
Spider Moccasin gave the rappers a copy of his compact disc. "Bro'," Derek Greene, 18, said, "we're going to sample it!"
As we pulled onto the highway, it struck me that his music, too, was a kind of sampling. I said it borrowed from the hard experience as well as the daring of his forebears to make something new.
Spider Moccasin disagreed: "No. I can't say I sample them. I'm not, like, patching their ancient voices into my recordings, not at all.
"But I'm definitely influenced by them," he continued. "They didn't wrap themselves up in the past and weep. They took public service jobs. They acted. They realized that American history isn't something that happened. It is still happening now."

HEADLINE: Coming of Age, Seeking an Identity

BYLINE: By ARLIE RUSSELL HOCHSCHILD; Arlie Russell Hochschild, author of "The Time Bind," is a professor of sociology at the University of California at Berkeley and co-director of the Center for Working Families.

 BODY:
I'M not part of the 1960's generation," said Sandy de Lissovoy. "I don't feel part of Gen X or Gen Y. I'm sure not part of the 'Me Generation.' Who made up that term? I hate it. What's really in front of me is my computer, but even with it, I'm between the generation that barely tolerates computers and the one that treats them like a member of the family."
Mr. de Lissovoy, a 29-year-old graphic designer in San Francisco, was expressing as well as anyone the feelings that, as a sociology professor, I frequently hear during office hours. At this moment he was having a hard time defining his generation. He raised his eyebrows quizzically, smiled and said, "Call me the @ Generation One and a Half." 
 Can we make up our generation, as Mr. de Lissovoy playfully did, or is it imposed upon us, like it or not?
These are questions that the German sociologist Karl Mannheim took up in his classic 1927 essay, "The Problem of Generations." Is a generation a collection of people born in the same span of years? No, he thought, that is a cohort, and many cohorts are born, come of age and die without becoming generations. For Mannheim, a generation is a cohort of people who feel the impact of a powerful historical event and develop a consciousness about it. Not all members of a generation may see the event the same way, and some may articulate its defining features better than others. But what makes a generation is its connection to history.
Americans who came of age in the 1930's, 40's and 60's have been branded by large events -- the Great Depression, World War II, Vietnam -- and the collective moods they aroused. But from the 70's through the 90's, history's signal events happened elsewhere. Communism collapsed, but not in the United States. Wars raged in Rwanda and the Balkans, but they had no major effect here. The forces in the United States have been social and economic, and they have shifted the focus to more personal issues -- matters of lifestyle that are shaped by consumerism, the mass media and an increasing sense of impermanence in family and work.
"There is no overarching crisis or cause for our generation, " Mr. de Lissovoy said. "It's more a confusing, ambiguous flow of events. There's a slow, individual sorting out to do."
But underneath this confusing, ambiguous flow of events is a trend toward a more loosely jointed, limited-liability society, the privatizing influence of that trend and the crash-boom-bang of the market, which, in the absence of other voices, is defining generations left and right.
People in their 20's and early 30's are often called Gen X'ers, a term derived from a novel by Douglas Coupland. The book, "Generation X," was followed by a film, "Slacker," directed by Richard Linklater, about a group of overeducated, underemployed oddballs. But for Jim Kreines, a 32-year-old graduate student of philosophy at the University of Chicago, the label fit loosely, if at all.
When I asked him what generation he belonged to, Mr. Kreines replied, "I'm not sure I care enough to argue about this." He had read the Coupland book and seen the film. But did the Gen X'er label apply to him? He was not sure it mattered.
"Slacker" dwells on its characters' decision to drop to the margin of society. But the film, which helped label this generation, does what our whole culture does -- portrays a social trend as a personal choice.
Many Gen X'ers may be trying to sort out this cultural sleight of hand. They feel luckier than previous generations because they enjoy many more options. In the 50's, said Charles Sellers, a 28-year-old urban planner in Portland, Ore., there was only one choice. "If you were a woman you were a housewife," he said. "If you were a man you married and supported your family. Today, except for the Mormons, Americans have a long cultural menu to choose from. If you're a woman, you can be a single woman, a career woman, a lesbian, a single mom by choice, a live-in lover, a married-for-now wife, a married-forever wife. And the same for work: I'm on my third career."
But the wider menu of identities comes with a decreasing assurance that any particular identity will last. This is because a culture of deregulation has slipped from our economic life into our cultural life. Gen X'ers, at least in the middle class, can be more picky in finding "just the right mate" and "just the right career." But once you've found them, you begin to wonder if you can you keep them.
In his book "The New Insecurity," Jerald Wallulis, a philosopher at the University of South Carolina, observed that in the last 30 years, people have shifted the way they base their identity: from marriage and employment to marriageability and employability. Old anchors no longer hold, and a sense of history is lost. For the generations of the 80's and 90's, this rootlessness is their World War II, their Vietnam. And it presents a more difficult challenge than the one faced by the 60's generation.
Mr. de Lissovoy's parents divorced when he was a baby and now live on opposite coasts. Consider, too, the shifting family ties of a 27-year-old computer programmer in Silicon Valley, who asked that her name be withheld. "My mother divorced four times and is living on uncertain terms with her fifth," she said, "so I'm not sure if she'll stay with him either. I haven't gotten attached to any of my stepdads. My dad remarried four times, too, only now he's married to a woman I like."
When her parents divorced, she spent every other weekend with her father. "My dad was glad to see me, but I'd have to remind him of the name of my best friends," she said. "He didn't know what mattered to me. After a while it just got to be dinner and a video, and after that, I didn't feel much like going to his apartment."
Talking about her love life, she said: "If I meet someone I really like, I become shy and tied up in knots. I can't talk about anything personal." It was as if she did not dare to begin a relationship for fear of ending it.
After the parents of another young woman divorced, her father married a woman as young as his daughter, and is very involved with his new, young children who are the same age as his grandchildren. Now, when his daughter tries to arrange a visit between her father and his grandchildren, he is often too pinched for time to see them. His daughter feels hurt and angry -- first to miss out on a father, then a grandfather.
Reflecting on these generational jumbles, Mr. de Lissovoy commented: "Today's hype is that 'You can get it if you really want it' -- a mate, career and love still sells a lot of tickets. We're the Generation of Individual Choice. Which? Which? Which? But the bottom can fall out from some of those choices. And in the end, we're orphans. We're supposed to take care of ourselves. That's our only choice."
NOT every young person I have talked with has felt so adrift. The 20-somethings of the 90's have more material resources than their predecessors -- ample job opportunities, for example.
Still, Mr. de Lissovoy's feelings reflect something true about America these days. Despite the recent economic miracle, we are experiencing a care deficit. Social services have been cut; hospitals release patients 24 hours after surgery to recover at home. But who is home to do the caring? Two-thirds of mothers are working. One-quarter of households are headed by single mothers. Paradoxically, American individualism and pride in self-sufficiency lead us to absorb rather than resist this deficit: "Care? Who needs care? I can handle it," thus adding one problem to another.
If in previous decades large historic events drew people together and oriented them to action, the recent double trend toward more choice but less security leads the young to see their lives in more individual terms. Big events collectivize, little events atomize. So with people facing important but private problems, and thinking in individual, not collective, terms, the coast became clear in the 80's and 90's for the marketplace to stalk into this cultural void and introduce generation-defining clothes, music and videos.
Generations X and Y function as market gimmicks nowadays. The market dominates not just economic life, as the economist Robert Kuttner argues in "Everything for Sale," but our cultural life as well. It tells us what a generation is -- a Pepsi generation, a Mac generation, an Internet generation. And a magazine about shoot-'em-up computer games calls itself NextGen.
Advertisers are appealing to children over the heads of their parents. Juliet B. Schor, an economics lecturer at Harvard, suggests that the younger generation is the cutting edge of a full-blown market culture. More than $2 billion is spent on advertising directed at them, 20 times the amount spent a decade ago. Most of the advertising is transmitted through television; it is estimated that youngsters increased their viewing time one hour a day between l970 and 1990. Three out of five children ages 12 to 17 now have a TV in their bedroom. Although advertisers are trying to collude with children against their parents, Dr. Schor said recently, overworked parents sometimes go along with it too. If Dr. Schor is correct, Generation Y might be defined even more than Generation X by what its members buy than by what they do or who they are.
Marketing strategists, meanwhile, are turning over all the generations faster, slicing and dicing the life cycle into thinner strips. In the computer industry, an advertising generation is nine months; in the clothing industry, a season. In department stores, between the displays for girls in their preteens and and teens, is a new age, "tweens." The identity promised by a style or a brand name for one generation is marked off from an increasing number of others. And the styles continually replace old with new.
This creates a certain consumer logic. Older consumers buy what makes them feel young, while young consumers, up to a point, buy what makes them feel older. So the preteenager will buy the tween thing while the teenager will buy the 20-something jacket, and the 40-year-old will browse in the racks for 30-year-olds.
TO be sure, every American decade has fashion marketeers define generational looks and sounds, but probably never before have they so totally hijacked a generation's cultural expression. Allison Pugh, a 33-year-old married mother of two and a graduate student in sociology at the University of California at Berkeley, said: "I definitely feel like people just two or three years younger than me are the beginning of another generation. But I can only say why by pointing to superficial things like how many pierces they have, how high their shoes are and what kind of music they listen to. I roomed with a girl just two years younger and she listened to Smashing Pumpkins, Nirvana and Hole. I was 'old' -- as in out of it -- even just a few years out of college. I started to sound like my mother: 'That's not music; what is that noise?' "
Like Ms. Pugh, Mr. de Lissovoy is considered old to the generation at his heels. He is wired, but feels ambivalent about it. "What I don't like is disposability, hyperspeed, consumption," he said. "I'd like to reduce these. What I want more of is face-to-face interaction, a value on repair, families living nearby each other. I'd love to live in a multigenerational, multiracial cohousing project. And a more leisurely pace of life. I want some pretty old-fashioned things."
The 60's generation is hitting 60, and with some computer nerds striking it rich, 60's-era protests are not defining the new generation. But that era's flame is not dead. In front of a large gathering at the Pauley ballroom on the Berkeley campus a few months ago, the Mario Savio Young Activist Award for 1999 -- named after the leader of the 1964 Free Speech Movement -- was given to Nikki Bas, a 31-year-old American of Filipino descent who coordinates Sweatshop Watch, a campaign against the poor pay and working conditions of third-world workers who make football uniforms and other clothing sold on American college campuses. Mr. de Lissovoy remembered hearing about Mr. Savio from his 60's activist mother, but he does not know Nikki Bas, and he is not signing up.
Still, from a distance he watched the protests in Seattle against the World Trade Organization last fall, and they kindled a sense of the importance of history that he feels the market is driving out. "I hated the mindless anarchists who broke shop windows," he said. "But the other protesters who went there to speak up against megacorporations running the show, and for the family farm, local communities, monarch butterflies and sea turtles -- they are taking the long view of the planet. We usually think it's the older generation that wants to preserve the past, and it's the young who don't mind tearing things up. In Seattle, the young environmentalists had their eye on history, and it was the old who had an eye on their pocketbooks."
Ultimately, market generations are generations of things, and they can make us forget generations of people. "My generation doesn't know how globalization will turn out," Mr. de Lissovoy said. "But we won't see how globalization is messing us up if we've forgotten how the world used to be. Whichever way, we don't see that what we are doing is forgetting the past. And we're nobodies without a sense of history."
He recalled how baseball caps with X's became popular with teenagers, especially in Detroit, after Spike Lee's film on Malcolm X came out. "When a TV interviewer asked a kid about the X on his cap, he didn't know who Malcolm X was," Mr. de Lissovoy said. "He didn't even know he was a person. We need to appreciate the work it takes to get us where we are. Otherwise we aren't anywhere."

HEADLINE: Ljubljana Journal;
Like Switzerland, but Without the Cuckoo Clocks

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. 

DATELINE: LJUBLJANA, Slovenia

 BODY:
To Eastern Europe experts who never confuse this country with Slovakia or Slavonia, it is, in their words, "a jewel," "a chocolate box," "Eastern Europe's best-kept secret," or even -- wait for it -- "the Switzerland of the former Yugoslavia."
President Clinton, who stopped here overnight last June to thank Slovenia for letting NATO jets fly over on their way to bomb Kosovo and other parts of Yugoslavia, said at the time that he foresaw "a Europe undivided, democratic and at peace for the first time in its history." 
 "And Slovenia can lead the way," he added.
But as devotees struggle for the words to praise without condescending to a country of two million people, economic statistics tell the story more plainly: on the lists of Eastern European countries ready to join the European Union, tiny Slovenia is in the first wave, sometimes ranked at No. 2, behind Hungary but ahead of the Czech Republic and Poland.
Since it broke away from Yugoslavia in 1991, its gross domestic product per person has doubled to $10,000, outstripping that of Hungary and rivaling those of the poorest European Union members, Greece and Portugal.
Alone among Eastern Europeans, Slovenes do not need tourist visas to visit the United States. The standard of living is so high and unemployment so low that it is assumed that they will go home. "It's the highest form of compliment the U.S. pays," a diplomat said.
"You never hear of real poverty here," he said. "There were people laid off when they did economic shock treatment, but the growing service industry absorbed them. There are retired people getting by on pensions, but it's a living wage. There are subsistence farmers, but they're in valleys where Heidi might have lived."
Slovenes quickly rebuff comparisons with rivals like impoverished Romania or even the rest of the former Yugoslavia. They were at the core of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until it was broken up after World War I, they say, and generations of their artists and intellectuals went to the Vienna court, so they judge themselves by the standards of Austria and northern Italy.
"Our misfortune was that we were divorced in 1918," said Karl Lavencic, a Slovenian journalist working in Britain. "We joined Yugoslavia, and standards began to deteriorate under Communism." Nonetheless, under Tito's "self-management" brand of Communism, Slovenia was allowed to lead the way in running industries that traded with the West.
When the Eastern bloc fell apart, 80 percent of Slovenia's export market disappeared, but it recovered, and the country now does 66 percent of its trade with the European Union. It exports Renaults, parts for BMW and Ford, pharmaceuticals, furniture, clothing and tires.
Beaches on the Adriatic, ski runs in the Alps and lots of German Baroque spires in tidy villages make tourism a growth industry, and Ljubljana itself has a strange medieval exoticism. Dominated by a hilltop fortress, it must have more dragons per capita than any city west of Beijing -- as the city's symbol, there are dragons guarding bridges, dragons climbing light poles, even dragons on the manhole covers.
By contrast, the name of its oldest hotel, the Slon, which claims to date from an inn founded in 1552, means the Elephant. A government spokesman said it was named for Hannibal's big-guy cavalry passing through to attack Rome, but that seems doubtful, since the Carthaginians took the Spanish route. More likely is the hotel's version: a circus working the Austro-Hungarian gig used to tether its elephants nearby.
Unlike every other piece of the former Yugoslavia, the country has no ethnic tensions. The population is 90 percent Slovene, and the Italian and Hungarian minorities in border areas have their own seats in Parliament and the right to bilingual education and the use of their own languages in dealings with government.
Slovenes joke that the shape of the country looks like a chicken fleeing east, but they actually stood their ground and won a 10-day war for independence in 1991 against demoralized troops from the Yugoslav Army.
"They thought Slovenians would just raise their hands and give up," said Miha Rott, a government spokesman.
Slovenia declared its independence on June 25 that year, depriving the old Yugoslavia of what had been its borders with Austria and Italy, and the Yugoslav Army attacked on June 27.
But everyone who describes the war acknowledges that Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian leader, had little interest in the fight because there were almost no Serbs in Slovenia, and he was husbanding resources for his plans to seize Serbian-inhabited portions of Croatia and Bosnia.
"The Serbs never regarded Slovenia as a part of the world they would die for," Mr. Lavrencic said.
Since then Slovenia has aggressively pursued entry to NATO and was almost included in the round of expansion that has already brought in Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic. One reason that Slovenia did not make that cut, say diplomats from many NATO countries, is that NATO was wary of embracing any former Yugoslav republic while war still raged farther south.
Qualifying for the European Union requires extensive overhauls of the legal system and economy, especially in a formerly Communist country, and Slovenia still has changes to make, said Vincent Piket, counsellor of the organization's delegation here.
The country's banking and insurance are dominated by government-owned companies that must be merged and sold. The telephone monopoly must be ended and electricity privatized. Antitrust laws need strengthening; laws favoring local bids for government contracts need weakening.
More than 1,000 laws and bylaws matching those of other European countries must still be passed and legislators taught their meaning. Some sectors are resisting change: farmers fear competition and judges resent being given a new body of laws.
Still, "from the point of view of the European Union we're not a problematic country," said Janez Potocnik, head of the country's negotiating team.
In the toughest areas for other would-be members -- inefficient small farmers, pollution and corruption -- Slovenia does relatively well. Though vocal, farmers are only 4 percent of the economy, and many have second incomes from factory work, guesthouses or hunting. There is little heavy industry. The justice system is slow but honest.
And, to the delight of the European Union, nervous about porous borders even before Jorg Haider's party in Austria made much of the issue, Slovenia is buying passport scanners, fingerprint scanners, X-ray machines, night vision goggles and other hardware needed to tighten its frontiers.
Mr. Piket agreed with his counterpart, Mr. Potocnik.
"The fundamental assessment is that they can join the union in two or three years," he said. "It depends on how fast they do their homework. If they work as hard as they did last year, they can do it."

Recasting BellSouth from telephone company to high-technology communications provider.

BYLINE: By Jane L. Levere 

 BODY:
THE BellSouth Corporation is introducing a campaign tomorrow meant to recast the company as a high-technology leader in an effort to become more competitive against telecommunications and online rivals.
Telecommunications industry analysts say this is the first time a regional Bell company has tried to turn its image into that of a data and digital service provider. The campaign, with a budget estimated at $35 million to $50 million, is being created by the BellSouth corporate agency, Merkley Newman Harty in New York, a unit of the Omnicom Group. Merkley Newman won that assignment in November after a review; previously, BellSouth divided the account between that agency and the Atlanta office of West Wayne. 
 The new campaign, which will extend beyond traditional advertising to all communications, carries the theme ">>>connect>> and create something." "The tag line is meant to convey that we can connect people to people, and people to the information they want when they want it, through e-mail, personal Web pages, e-business," said Alan Blount, assistant vice president for advertising at BellSouth in Atlanta.
Thus, a print ad promoting the service for operating a Web site shows a fictional Web address, www.prawntoshrimp.com, superimposed on a catch of shrimp. The text reads, "Since 1932, gulf prawns, 4th generation shrimper, 1st generation Web business, overnight shipping, secure transactions, 2nd boat ordered."
Humorous television commercials also focus on what are portrayed as the different ways the BellSouth online services improve customers' lives. One spot shows a 79-year-old man sitting alone on a bench; the voice-over explains that his wife died in 1993, but it goes on to say he remarried last year after getting e-mail and meeting a new mate online. Another spot shows a family with three children gathered for dinner; the father restrains one of them from answering her telephone as the voice-over says, "Three pagers, five e-mail addresses, two Web sites, 160 TV channels, four cell phones, and just one rule -- not at the dinner table."
Outdoor advertising conveys the same theme more simply: one billboard, showing two smiling boys whispering to each other, says "Chat," while ads created for phone kiosks merely say "Check voice mail" or "Whassssssss uuuuuppp!?"
All ads are a radical departure from BellSouth's previous corporate campaign, which ran from 1997 to 1999 and featured folksy ads depicting the town of Chatsford and a BellSouth employee named Tyler, both fictional.
According to Mr. Blount, the new campaign is primarily directed at adults age 18 to 49. However, William Pate, BellSouth's vice president for advertising, marketing and public relations, said some ads, like those created for phone kiosks, are meant for teenagers.
"That group is the largest cluster since the baby boomers; they can start and stop trends on a dime," he said. "We've got to speak to them, build their brand loyalty. We want to make the connection as early as we can."
"The new campaign is a recognition of what's going on in the marketplace," Mr. Pate added. "Our competition is no longer AT&T, MCI, Sprint. We now compete with Yahoo, Mindspring, AOL. We knew we were not getting as much credit as we should for the business applications we have in e-space. We felt our new brand effort should be totally focused on these applications, because we were already known for others."
Last year, BellSouth's digital and data revenues jumped 33.1 percent, to $2.8 billion, out of a total of $25.2 billion.
Advertising will appear during N.C.A.A. college basketball games and on cable networks like CNN, E and Oxygen; in daily newspapers in the Southeast, USA Today and The Wall Street Journal; and in magazines like Time, Vanity Fair, Inc. and Rolling Stone.
People involved with telecommunications generally applauded BellSouth's new strategy.
Jeff Kagan, a consultant in Atlanta who advises BellSouth and other companies, said the branding effort "makes a lot of sense."
"Traditional phone companies are perceived as stodgy, and perception is just as important as reality," he added. "The new strategy lets them compete and thrive in a marketplace that's become very noisy and confusing."
Philip Asmundson, national communications practice director for Deloitte & Touche L.L.P., said it was "about time" a regional Bell company ran a campaign like BellSouth's, because "they have been letting newcomers get too much press."
"And BellSouth has a name that connotes trust, which is crucial as the world becomes more connected in general" he said.
Mr. Asmundson said all Bell companies, including BellSouth, would have to reposition themselves, a task he predicted would be quite difficult: "BellSouth's problem is that it is trying to go from being your father's telephone company to a company that connects voice and data. Standard budgets won't do it. They'll have to look at spending more money, because it's harder for them to change the perception of who they are."
Another issue for BellSouth, said Brian Adamik, chief operating officer of the Yankee Group, a telecommunications research and consulting company in Boston, is whether "consumers will believe the brand can be extended, whether it's credible in the Internet economy."

HEADLINE: Productivity In 4th Quarter Revised Higher

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 7

 BODY:
Worker productivity in the fourth quarter of last year grew at the fastest pace in seven years and labor costs fell for the second consecutive quarter, the Labor Department said today.
Productivity, which measures output for each hour worked, rose at a revised annual rate of 6.4 percent in the period, up from 5 percent in the third quarter. Productivity for the last three months of 1999 was adjusted from an earlier estimate of 5 percent. 
 While the report suggested that businesses were finding new ways to absorb increases in labor costs and avoid raising prices, it was unlikely to stop Federal Reserve policy makers from pushing interest rates higher in coming months to keep the economy from overheating.
The Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, warned on Monday that productivity and stock gains had made businesses and consumers too optimistic about the economy's ability to grow without causing inflation.
In another report today, the Federal Reserve said consumer debt surged $17 billion in January, the biggest rise in almost five years. Credit card charges and auto loans both fed the rise, which followed increases of $10.4 billion in December and $13.2 billion in November.
Kevin Flanagan, an economist in New York with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, forecasts that the Fed will raise interest rates at least two more times in the next three months.
Productivity in the final three months of 1999 grew at the fastest pace since the fourth quarter of 1992, when the record 108-month expansion was starting to gain speed. Last year, productivity grew 3 percent, also the best since 1992.
Unit labor costs fell in the fourth-quarter of 1999 at a 2.5 percent rate, after a 0.3 percent drop in the third quarter. That measure of the effect of productivity on business costs showed the largest rate of decline since the fourth quarter of 1992. Productivity has grown more than 2 percent for four consecutive years. The last time that happened was 1961-1966.

Calculating the Stakes on the YankeeNets Private Bond Offering

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
Would you lend money to a sports conglomerate whose current operations do not generate enough profits to pay interest on the loans, let alone repay the money being borrowed?
That is the issue buyers of junk bonds are facing as the YankeeNets L.L.C. -- the new company that controls a winning baseball team and a losing basketball team -- tries to borrow $250 million. It is expected that the borrowing will go through tomorrow, but at a very high interest rate of about 12.25 percent. That is half a percentage point higher than the rate the company had hoped to pay. 
 The private offering will finance payouts to the owners of the two teams, enabling the former New Jersey Nets owners to pay back money they borrowed to finance the payments that enabled them to become equal owners of YankeeNets with the former owners of the New York Yankees baseball team. For the owners of the Yankees, led by George Steinbrenner, the payments will simply add to their wealth.
Mr. Steinbrenner realized about $135 million in cash when the Yankees and Nets combined business operations, and he is likely to collect $40 million more if the bond offering is completed and a related plan to sell a minority interest in the company also goes as planned.
The bond offering is being sold in a private placement open only to institutional investors, including high-yield mutual funds. While the offering memorandum is not public, a copy of it was provided to The New York Times. It gives a detailed look at the finances of the two teams and the unusual operating arrangement that will preserve Mr. Steinbrenner's ability to run the Yankees as he sees fit, notwithstanding the fact that he will no longer own a majority stake in the team.
The offering memorandum warns, in boldface type: "We may not be able to service our debt obligations if we do not increase cash flow." Indeed, on a consolidated basis, the two teams showed a net loss of $98.2 million on revenue of $241 million in the 12 months ended Sept. 30, 1999. While some of that loss represented noncash expenses, the combined company would have had a negative cash flow of $4.2 million even before paying interest on its existing debts.
Most of the losses have come from the Nets. The financial statements in the offering memorandum show that the Yankees are marginally profitable before post-season revenue is counted -- revenue that would vanish if the team failed to make the playoffs. For the first nine months of last year -- a period that does not include the playoffs -- the team reported operating income of just $556,000, and a net loss, after considering interest expense on its current debt, of $4.4 million. Figures for the fourth quarter of 1999, including the playoffs and World Series, were not disclosed.
For all of 1998, when the team had post-season revenue of $11.5 million, it reported operating income of $20.1 million and net income of $12.7 million.
This borrowing, if the interest rate is 12.25 percent, will require annual interest payments of $30.6 million, well above previous cash flows for the teams. The $250 million would be due in 2007.
The offering memorandum holds out two principal hopes for the teams' coming up with the money to meet their obligations. The first is a better local television contract for the two teams. The Yankees contract with the Madison Square Garden Network expires after this season, and the Nets have the right to terminate their contract with Fox Sports New York at the end of the 2000-2001 season. The second is a sale of stock in one or both teams to the public.
The negotiations for that contract should be interesting. Both MSG and Fox Sports New York are now controlled by Cablevision -- which tried to buy control of the Yankees before the deal with the Nets was made -- and competition between the two has diminished. But the Yankees and Nets could conceivably put together their own television operation if MSG and Fox Sports New York do not agree to pay enough.
The bond offering memorandum mentions the possibility of selling shares in one or both teams to the public by 2003 but does not commit itself to do so.
Neither the bond offering nor the planned sale of $75 million in ownership interests in YankeeNets will do much to provide cash to operate the teams. Only $15 million of the $325 million being raised will go to operations. Another $15.7 million will go to pay expenses connected to the offerings, and about $80 million will be put into escrow to assure that the company will have the money to make interest payments for the first three years that the bonds are outstanding. That leaves about $214.3 million to be distributed to the owners of the teams.
In a normal company, the board has complete control over the company's operations, although it delegates much of that control to management. But the YankeeNets company is different. The board of the Nets will have control over most aspects of that team, including the right to set the team's budget within certain parameters. Mr. Steinbrenner, as managing general partner of the Yankees, will have the right to set that team's budget and to make all major decisions on issues like personnel and player salaries.
There is, to be sure, a board for the company. But its powers are limited to certain decisions, including areas like real estate investments. There is also a board for the Yankees, but the agreement specifies that if the board and Mr. Steinbrenner disagree, Mr. Steinbrenner's opinion will prevail.

Mexico's Credit Rating Is Raised to Investment Quality by Moody's

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON 

 BODY:
In a surprisingly broad endorsement of Mexico's economic strength and financial management, Moody's Investors Service raised the country's credit rating today to investment grade for the first time.
The announcement was a powerful vindication of President Ernesto Zedillo's efforts to convince investors that Mexico will make it through national elections this year without the kind of economic disaster that has marred every presidential turnover for the last two decades. 
 "It's a signal that allows the investor to say, I can assume that the overall economic context is a sound one," said Finance Minister Jose Angel Gurria Trevino.
With the upgrading from the junk-bond category, Moody's moved Mexico into the league of countries that present a very low risk of failing to pay their debts. Now the government and many private Mexican corporations will have access to a wider range of financing at lower rates.
The new rating clears the way for many large institutions in the United States to buy Mexican bonds, which they were barred from doing without the investment grade status.
Moody's pointed to Mexico's "dynamic export sector" and successful integration with the United States economy since the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement. Because Mexico's foreign debt is clearly manageable, Moody's said, "a slowdown in the U.S. economy should not be seriously disruptive."
The agency was also unusually optimistic about the prospects for stability through the balloting on July 2 and the handing over of power Dec. 1. "The widespread consensus on the importance of sound financial policies combined with a vibrant multiparty democracy provides additional support to continued fiscal discipline," Moody's said.
Mr. Zedillo, a Yale-trained economist, has focused economic policy for the last year on taking Mexico through the end of his term without a devastating peso crash like the one that he faced in his first days in office. While foreign reserves stand at $31 billion, the country has already refinanced the foreign debt scheduled to come due this year, and faces "very comfortable" repayments next year, Mr. Gurria said.
Moody's decision immediately began to push interest rates down. The rate on the benchmark 28-day Mexican treasury bonds dropped to 13.95 percent, the lowest since the period before the crisis began in December 1994. As recently as September 1998, in the middle of a crisis created by turmoil in Russia and Brazil, the rate had soared to 41.33 percent.

Sound Advice For Jets Fans: Get Used to It

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY 

 BODY:
NOT only can management threaten to trade Keyshawn Johnson for a draft choice, it can also actually do it. There might even be some football justification for doing it.
Maybe Bill Parcells is just playing with Keyshawn's fertile mind, trying to make him appreciative of all the good things about playing for the Jets, whatever they happen to be. However, contemporary sports economics says Parcells just might deal Johnson to Baltimore because of the way Keyshawn could clog up the salary cap if he gets what he thinks he deserves. 
 Sure, Keyshawn looks like a franchise player, tall and tough and resourceful. But he is also a wide receiver, a category of player often only as good as the man lining up behind the center.
Star receivers are not any more valuable than dominant running backs or linebackers. This may sound like heresy, but you can bet this thought has crossed the mind of Parcells. Still, Keyshawn is the most magnetic player the Jets have.
In the best of worlds, he would remain a target for Jets quarterbacks for the next decade, a familiar and beloved icon. The trouble is, Keyshawn has already advertised that he will be expensive the next time around.
This is the other side of modern free agency. Players leave teams. Teams leave players. It's a two-way street. In these days of the pre-emptive strike by management -- get rid of the guy before he gets too expensive -- there are not going to be very many venerated locals like Ray Bourque or Dan Marino in the next generation.
Bourque was traded to Colorado on Monday night after playing 21 years of hockey with the same team. The Boston Ruins, who are not going anywhere, made it sound as if they did Bourque a huge favor by dealing him to a team with Stanley Cup pretensions, which, in hockey, means about two-thirds of the league.
Marino may go to Minnesota, where he could play first-string quarterback, apparently no longer an option for him after 17 years in Miami.
Ken Griffey Jr. is the face of the future. Junior had no desire to be the Tony Gwynn of Seattle: a lovable ancient staying put so he would not have to go through the trouble of redecorating another house in another baseball town.
Junior wanted to go home to Cincinnati -- for a while, anyway -- so he forced his way out with a year left in his contract. His old pal, Alex Rodriguez, might do the same by midseason.
"Doesn't anybody stay in one place anymore?" as Carole King once asked.
Cal Ripken, 19 years in Baltimore and counting, is a throwback, and Patrick Ewing, in his own weird way, is a throwback in New York, even though he has the most tepid relationship with his franchise city that you are ever likely to see.
Today's players are mobile, which forces franchises to be coldblooded in new and creative ways. The housecleaning in Buffalo at the end of the season was fascinating: Thurman Thomas, Bruce Smith, Andre Reed, gone.
In the old days, a team like the Mets could trade a young Nolan Ryan for baseball reasons, as ghastly as those reasons turned out to be. Nowadays, franchises move a player when he even sends out brain waves that he is speculating about revising his contract.
What can the fans do if the new ownership of the Jets decides to get Keyshawn before Keyshawn gets it? The fans can look at it this way: There is no law against wearing their green No. 19 Johnson jerseys to the games. That still falls under the framework of the First Amendment.

 Modern sports creates an almost sense of nostalgia. The stalwarts who thrilled you last season turn out to have just been passing through. The last 250 Islanders fans in the Nassau Coliseum still wear their Palffy jerseys. There will be some Olerud jerseys in Shea this season. There are Messier jerseys in the Garden.
Keyshawn Johnson could be next. Why not? He has been the obvious star of the Jets since he arrived. When they were losing, it was easy for fans and coaches to dismiss him as a ball hog with a high opinion of himself, but he has demonstrated his nerve as well as his touch, and the Jets have built around him.
He has been everything a franchise could want, but now he is becoming expensive, and maybe even expendable. The fans can only stop sniveling and pull out that little rectangular piece of plastic for the season tickets. That is their job.

HEADLINE: Annan Sets Up Panel to Study U.N.'s Peacekeeping Predicament

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, March 7

 BODY:
Secretary General Kofi Annan announced today that he was appointing an international panel to look at every aspect of United Nations peacekeeping and make recommendations on how missions can be more effective.
"Partly it is a question of being clearer about what we are trying to do," Mr. Annan said at a news conference. "And partly it is a question of getting the nuts and bolts right." 
 One of the questions to be posed to the panel, he added, is "What do you do if the peace you are trying to keep breaks down and large numbers of civilians are in danger of being massacred?" The question is not hypothetical: the United Nations has come under severe criticism for the failure to stop the killing of Muslims in the Bosnian town of Srebrenica in 1995 and the massacre of ethnic Tutsi in Rwanda the year before.
Two tough reports last year on those incidents found considerable shortcomings in the organization, including some in the peacekeeping department, which at the time of those events was run by Mr. Annan. But the new panel is not being formed to conduct another post-mortem. Instead it will look more broadly at how the United Nations is often handed difficult assignments by member nations on the Security Council and then not given the means to carry them out. The contrast to NATO-led missions or other operations outside the United Nations system is stark.
"When member states take on some of these operations under multinational force arrangements, they usually go in with much larger forces," Mr. Annan said today. "But when the U.N. is going to do it, we are often given a very low and arbitrary ceiling and resources do not always match the mandate. One of things I hope the panel will look at is the quality of the mandates we get. "
The panel is to be led by Lakhdar Brahimi, a former Algerian foreign minister who has been a troubleshooter for the secretary general in a number of countries, among them Afghanistan and Haiti.
"I hope that in the next six months or a year we would have enough ideas on when and how we intervene," Mr. Annan said. "Under our charter, we are allowed to use force in the common interest. But there are questions that we will have to answer. What is the common interest? Who defines it? Who defends it? And under what authority and under what circumstances?"
The secretary general asked the panel to produce a report by July, before a summit meeting of heads of government in early fall. The report is to be written by William Durch, an arms control and Balkans expert at the Henry L. Stimson Center, an independent institute in Washington that studies issues of war and peace.
Panel members announced today were J. Brian Atwood, former administrator of the United States Agency for International Development; Dame Ann Hercus of New Zealand, a former representative of the secretary general in Cyprus; Richard Monk of Britain, a member of the police task force in Bosnia; Gen. Klaus Naumann, former chief of the German defense staff and chairman of the military committee of NATO; Hisako Shimura, president of Tsuda College in Japan and a former peace negotiator for the United Nations; Gen. Philip Sibanda of Zimbabwe, a former peacekeeping force commander in Angola; and Cornelius Sommaruga of Switzerland, who has just retired as president of the International Committee of the Red Cross.
Mr. Annan said that one or two members might be added later.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Report SeeksBig Changes in I.M.F. and World Bank

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 7

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank should be radically shrunken and overhauled because they often do more harm than good in the developing world, a Congressional commission will recommend.
The commission, which plans to release its report Wednesday, also asserts that both the I.M.F. and the World Bank waste billions of dollars making loans to middle-income countries that could rely on private capital instead. 
 Among its findings, the commission said that the institutions should sharply curtail their lending programs, that they often interfere too much in the domestic policy and even the politics of countries they seek to help and that they had generally failed to lead nations out of poverty.
The report, more than a year in the making, is highly political. The Republican-led Congress ordered the 11-member panel of scholars to study how to remake the Washington-based sister institutions after agreeing to provide $18 billion for the I.M.F. during the financial crisis that began in Asia. The panel's conclusions seem certain to fuel a partisan effort by some in Congress to reduce or even eliminate the United States contributions to the two agencies, though officials consider the chance of that happening as small.
Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, anticipating the main thrust of the report's conclusions, proposed a plan late last year to streamline the monetary fund that embraces several of the report's recommendations. Mr. Summers is also conducting a study of the World Bank that aims to reflect some common criticisms of the way the bank works. But it will also defend its mission against people who argue that it has outlived its usefulness.
The Congressional commission, headed by Prof. Allan H. Meltzer, an expert on monetary policy at Carnegie Mellon University, split along political lines before drafting its final report, which had been debated openly in Washington for weeks. Four of the five commission members appointed by Democrats dissented. They then issued their own report that recommends more modest changes.
The report touches on a central issue in this time of globalization: What is the role of World War II-era international institutions set up to help relieve poverty and provide a stable financial environment now that private capital flows have become the overwhelmingly dominant influence on the world's economic health? The report reflects an often-heard criticism that the I.M.F. and World Bank have become ever larger even though they are no longer needed to do the jobs they originally did.
"There was a sense that something had gone awry at both institutions," said Jerome I. Levinson, a professor at American University and a member of the Meltzer Commission. But Mr. Levinson, along with the other dissident Democratic appointees, said he believed the commission was motivated by a preconceived notion that the I.M.F. and World Bank should be eliminated.
"There were real differences between those who want to fix things and those who think they do such harm that we're better off getting rid of them," he said.
The report seems unlikely to lead to a revamping of the World Bank and the I.M.F. during the Clinton administration. But it could serve as the blueprint for an overhaul if a Republican president is elected. Even then, however, other wealthy countries that along with the United States provide most of the money for the bank and fund would have to agree to make changes.
And at a time when Congress has proved stingy in financing world agencies, including the United Nations, it seems likely that the next United States president, as has Mr. Clinton, will find the I.M.F. and the World Bank indispensable. The World Bank alone makes $50 billion in development loans each year, more than three times the entire foreign aid budget of the United States. The I.M.F. played what some supporters argued was a crucial role defending against the spread of financial malaise in recent years, committing tens of billions of dollars that might have been difficult to appropriate from national legislatures on short notice.
The report recommends that the I.M.F. mainly help nations cope with temporary problems that arise when capital leaves faster than it enters, by making only short-term "liquidity" loans at high interest rates.
The report goes on say that the fund should stop trying to relieve poverty, calling that a task better left to other agencies. Moreover, the monetary fund should stop offering long-term, low-cost loans with conditions that countries like Russia or Turkey must meet I.M.F. goals on their finances and economies. Instead, the fund should refuse to make loans of any kind to nations that do not meet certain rigid criteria.
For the World Bank, the prescription is Draconian. The report recommends that the bank be renamed the World Development Agency and basically get out of the business of making loans. Such loans, the report says, should be the preserve of private banks and brokerage houses.
Instead, the bank should focus on providing grants to people who need them in the poorest countries, it says.
The report suggests that as a first step the bank should phase out all loans to nations where per capita income is $4,000 or more, which is the bulk of its lending today. Moreover, it should allow regional development banks, which have much less capital, to take the lead in Asia and Latin America, where there are many such middle-income countries.

HEADLINE: Trenton Ordered to Improve Preschool in Poorest Districts

BYLINE: By MARIA NEWMAN 

 BODY:
The New Jersey Supreme Court ruled yesterday that the State Department of Education had not moved quickly enough to provide preschool programs of good quality for all 3- and 4-year-olds in the state's 30 poorest urban school districts, as it was ordered to do in a 1998 decision on a long-running school financing dispute.
In its ruling yesterday, the court ordered the state to come up with tough, uniform standards for the programs by April 17, and said the maximum class size would be 15 children, rather than the 20 the state had wanted. The court also insisted that all new employees for the programs be certified teachers. 
 But while it chided the state for not acting quickly enough on its 1998 ruling, the court, in a 6-to-0 decision written by Chief Justice Deborah T. Poritz, emphasized that it did not believe critics' claims that the state was acting in bad faith. Therefore, the court refused a request to appoint a judge as a special master to monitor the state's compliance.
"We are satisfied that any discrepancies in the implementation of our decree have resulted from misunderstandings in executing the court's mandate," the chief justice wrote.
The requirement of preschool for all 3- and 4-year-olds, which many education experts say is important to future academic success, is only one part of a package of far-reaching changes the court ordered in 1998 to improve education in the state's 30 most economically disadvantaged districts. Other changes included more state money for school construction, tougher high school curriculums and more programs to encourage parental involvement.
Plaintiffs in the case, Abbott v. Burke, complained to the court last fall that the Department of Education had failed to deliver on preschool programs, and in large measure, the court agreed with them yesterday.
David Sciarra, a lawyer for the Education Law Center in Newark, which brought the case on behalf of children in the 30 districts, said yesterday that the ruling reaffirmed the importance of a good preschool program.
"This is a solid decision that is really important for both New Jersey and the rest of the nation," Mr. Sciarra said. "It reaffirms the court's prior order requiring the state to provide a high-quality preschool program that these children clearly need. The state's response to this order clearly fell short of the mark."
After the 1998 decision in the Abbott case, the Department of Education ordered all districts to use existing day care centers to house preschool programs for an estimated 45,000 children. Many of the districts instead asked the state for more financing to build their own preschool centers, but the state denied the money and rejected their preschool plans. Lawyers representing the poor children argued that many of the centers the state wanted them to use were not providing the rigorous education that the State Supreme Court ordered in its 1998 decision.
The court said yesterday that the state could rely on existing day care centers, but that state officials needed to issue clear, strict standards by April 17 that all centers throughout the state would follow. The State Education Commissioner, David Hespe, said in an interview yesterday that a committee he appointed in the fall to come up with such standards was close to completing its proposal.
"That will in no way be a problem," he said.
Mr. Hespe also said that he was glad the court agreed that the state had not been acting in bad faith.
"All of us in the state want quality early childhood programs in these districts," he said. "But there's been a lot of disagreement on how we got there. The court has settled some of those controversies with this decision, so now we can all get to the hard work that remains."
In its decision yesterday, the court directed state officials to require that all new employees for the preschool programs be certified teachers. Current employees will have four years to obtain certification, the court said, a shorter amount of time than Mr. Hespe had proposed.
The court recognized that the state had a daunting task of providing so many educational improvements in so many districts in such a short time. But justices also took both sides to task for constantly haggling over how to carry out parts of their landmark Abbott decision.
"Another generation of children will pay the price for each year of delay," the court wrote.

HEADLINE: Edward H. Levi, Attorney General Credited With Restoring Order After Watergate, Dies at 88

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS 

 BODY:
Edward H. Levi, who began his association with the University of Chicago as a 5-year-old in a special kindergarten there and became the university's president before going on to be a widely admired attorney general of the United States, died yesterday at his home in Chicago. He was 88.
A distinguished legal educator, he was called upon to restore the credibility of the job of attorney general after the turmoil of the Nixon era. 
 No one was more a product of the University of Chicago than Mr. Levi. He remained at the university's laboratory school through grade school and high school, then attended college, graduate school and law school at the university. He was at various times a law professor, dean of the law school, university provost and, finally, the university's president.
As someone who spent most of his life in the shadow of the University of Chicago, Mr. Levi had enormous influence on the university, the study of law and even the surrounding Hyde Park neighborhood in which he grew up and which he later helped revitalize. He thrilled at teaching Chicago's renowned "great books" curriculum to undergraduates, pioneered the pairing of law with other disciplines like economics and statistics at the law school and fiercely recruited leading intellectuals in order to maintain the university as a vibrant agora of ideas.
But he secured a wider place in history for his role in Washington, where he demonstrated that the skills he had honed and deployed in academic circles were equally successful at the highest levels of government.
As the 71st attorney general of the United States, Mr. Levi won wide acclaim for his stewardship of the Justice Department in the post-Watergate era. He has been regularly cited by political scientists and lawyers as the model of a modern attorney general.
When he was named to the post in 1975 by President Gerald R. Ford, there was confusion about his political affiliations and philosophy. Some news accounts questioned whether he was best described as a conservative, liberal or libertarian. When he left office two years later, the answer was no clearer, but the question seemed mostly irrelevant.
Justice Antonin Scalia of the Supreme Court, who was a senior official under Mr. Levi in the Justice Department, said in an interview that "there couldn't have been a tougher job in Washington where the whole executive branch was in disarray after Watergate."
Justice Scalia said that as attorney general Mr. Levi "brought the department through its worst years."
He added, "It was a bad time not only because of the disgrace of Watergate, which had affected the department most deeply, but there were also problems at the F.B.I." The Federal Bureau of Investigation had been conducting domestic surveillance operations, under the code name Cointelpro, that were probably unconstitutional. Mr. Levi forced through regulations setting limits on what the bureau and the Central Intelligence Agency could undertake in investigations.
"He brought two qualities to the job," Justice Scalia said, "a rare intellectuality and a level of integrity such as there could never be any doubt about his honesty, forthrightness or truthfulness."
Although he was appointed by a Republican president, Mr. Levi's performance was considered so nonpartisan that when he left the department to return to the University of Chicago, he was warmly praised by Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts.
In a speech in the Senate on Jan. 25, 1977, Mr. Kennedy said, "Mr. Levi entered office under the most difficult and trying circumstances, yet he leaves a department once again characterized by integrity, intellectual honesty and commitment to equal justice."
Edward Hirsch Levi was born in Chicago on June 26, 1911, to Gerson B. Levi, a rabbi who came to the United States from Scotland, and Elsa Hirsch Levi. His maternal grandfather, Rabbi Emil G. Hirsch, was an early member of the University of Chicago faculty and a leading architect of the Reform branch of Judaism in America.
After graduating from college, Mr. Levi began studying for a doctorate in literature at the university but dropped out of the program. Years later he explained that he had been told in a friendly manner by a professor who admired his family that he would never be given a position in the humanities department at Chicago or any leading institution because he was a Jew.
He recalled that incident not ruefully but joyfully in an essay in Newsweek magazine during the nation's bicentennial celebrations of 1976 to demonstrate how much the country had changed. He had, after all, become the first Jewish dean of a major law school. When he became the president of the University of Chicago in 1968, he said he believed he was the first Jewish president of a major private university other than one with a clear Jewish identity, like Brandeis.
Gerhard Casper, the president of Stanford University and a former colleague of Mr. Levi's at the University of Chicago law school, said that it was Mr. Levi who came up with the idea of teaming with an economist to teach his course in antitrust law. It was from that innovation, Mr. Casper said, that the notion of tying law to other forms of study was born. "This was the beginning of the 'law and economics school' of thought for which Chicago would become famous," he said.
Mr. Casper said that he often quotes Mr. Levi, who once told him that "universities are the custodians not only of the many cultures of man but also of the rational process itself."
Richard A. Posner, another law faculty colleague and now the chief judge of the federal appeals court based in Chicago, said that Mr. Levi's pairing of an economist and lawyer in teaching "was a major development, not only in the law and economics sphere but in creating interdisciplinary studies in general at law schools."
Judge Posner said that Mr. Levi followed the economics and law partnership by putting together a statistician and a law professor. A sociologist was added later.
In 1958, Mr. Levi founded the school's Journal of Law and Economics, which became a vehicle that helped the University of Chicago remain pre-eminent in the field.
Leon Botstein, the president of Bard College and a former student of Mr. Levi's, said that he was also a model in furthering the notion that intellectual arguments should be about ideas, not personalities.
"He resented the personalizing of arguments," Mr. Botstein said. "I remember he was asked if he was going to write his memoirs and he replied, 'If I were to write a book, it would be about ideas, not about myself.' "
Mr. Levi was also renowned among college and university administrators for his deft handling of civil disturbances on the Chicago campus in 1968. Unlike administrators at some other major universities, he did not call in outside authorities when more than 400 students occupied his office for more than two weeks. He waited them out, and after they were gone he suspended and dismissed many of their leaders.
His slim volume, "An Introduction to Legal Reasoning" (University of Chicago Press, 1949) has been a perennially assigned book at many of the nation's law schools.
Mr. Levi retired from the university in 1984; his wife, Kate Sulzberger Hecht Levi, said he had suffered from Alzheimer's disease for the last six years.
In addition to his wife, he is survived by three sons, John G., a lawyer in Chicago, David F., a federal trial judge in Sacramento, and Michael E., a particle physicist in Berkeley, Calif.
In the bicentennial essay for Newsweek, Mr. Levi said: "The one thing that we ought to worry about is the propensity of this country to overreact, and to engage in cycles of bitterness. There is a kind of theme which runs through the modern world that human relationships should be looked at in terms of power relationships, in terms of the manipulation of power. I really think that's one of the most wicked ways of looking at the world. It's a very incomplete way. It strips people of their humanness. It converts all the other good attributes people have into just an ability or a desire to manipulate others."

HEADLINE: Internet Registrar to Be Sold for $21 Billion

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, March 7

 BODY:
In the costliest acquisition of an Internet company to date, VeriSign Inc., a producer of online security software, agreed today to acquire Network Solutions Inc., the Virginia-based company that maintains the master list of Internet addresses.
VeriSign valued the deal, a stock swap, at $21 billion, although a drop in its share price took it down to $17 billion -- still a high premium for a company with 1999 earnings of $26.9 million on sales of $220.8 million. The deal exceeds Lucent Technologies Inc.'s $20 billion acquisition of Ascend Communications Inc. in January 1999 as the biggest high-tech acquisition ever. The major difference is that Ascend had $1.6 billion in sales in the previous year. 
 Analysts said the price was all the more astonishing because Network Solutions no longer enjoyed a monopoly in the registration of domain names, as Internet addresses are known, and will see growing competition in the years to come.
The merger also constrains VeriSign's ability to form partnerships or strategic alliances with a generation of companies that now compete with Network Solutions in registering domain names, analysts said.
Such concerns drove VeriSign shares down $47.4375 to close at $200, in Nasdaq trading. Network Solutions shares soared, closing at $407.3906, up $46.7656, to make it the biggest gainer on the Nasdaq.
"The combination of these two companies makes sense," said Charles Rutstein, an analyst with Forrester Research. "The cross-selling and up-selling opportunities are evident to most observers."
But he added: "What's a bit confusing is why VeriSign needed to own this company as opposed to being a marketing partner. The two have done business together before. At the end of the day, you have to wonder whether $21 billion was too much."
Under the agreement, VeriSign, whose software keeps sensitive information safe when people buy and sell things on the Internet, will issue 2.15 shares of VeriSign common stock for each share of Network Solutions stock, as constituted before a 2-for-1 split of Network Solutions stock on March 10. Verisign had earnings of $4 million on revenues of $84.8 million in 1999.
The companies said that by combining they would be able to offer services including domain registration, global directory listings, basic Web site creation and secure processing of online transactions.
Stratton Sclavos, VeriSign's president and chief executive, called Network Solutions "one of the most undervalued assets on the Internet by any of the standard metrics -- number of customers, type of business model, revenue growth, profitability, cash flow."
Analysts said there were regulatory issues and competitive pressures that made the outcome of the merger difficult to predict.
In 1998, the Commerce Department created the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or Icann, to end Network Solutions' monopoly and open up the registration of Internet addresses to competition. Today, at an Icann meeting in Cairo, people were caught off guard by the announcement.
"It's a real eye-opener," said Ken Stubbs, who runs a nonprofit group that now competes with Network Solutions. But he said he was not concerned about its impact on his group. "I think I'll register more names tomorrow than today," he said.
Founded in 1979, Network Solutions pioneered the registering of Web addresses ending in .com, .net, .org and .edu. It is the world's leading registrar with more than 8.1 million domain registrations. It also offers so-called registry services, meaning that it maintains the InterNIC database, the telephone directory of the Internet. Network Solutions' registry customers include all the new competing companies that register domains ending in .com, .net and .org.

HEADLINE: Clinton Decides to Visit Pakistan, After All

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 7

 BODY:
Arguing that important national security interests would be jeopardized if President Clinton stayed away, the White House announced today that he would visit Pakistan "for a few hours" at the end of his lengthier trip to India later this month.
The decision, which came after weeks of fierce in-fighting within the administration, was based on the need to urge Pakistan's military government to work toward resolving the heightened conflict with India over Kashmir and to crack down on terrorism, senior officials said. 
 Mr. Clinton has been described by his aides as confident that he can personally engage Pakistan's ruler, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, who took power in a coup last October.
The Pakistani government had made virtually no progress on the three major requests that administration officials laid out for General Musharraf in January -- to agree to a timetable for the restoration of democracy, improve its record on nonproliferation, and shut down a group Washington accuses of terrorism, the officials said today.
But they asserted that it was most important to "keep the channels of communication open" so that Mr. Clinton can develop the kind of relationship with General Musharraf that enabled the president to persuade the deposed prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, to back down in Kashmir last year.
A White House statement tried to dismiss the notion that Mr. Clinton's presence in Pakistan would confer legitimacy on its government. It added that Mr. Clinton was not going to mediate the Kashmir dispute, an involvement that India vehemently opposes.
In talks with President Clinton last summer, Mr. Sharif agreed to coax Pakistani-backed guerrillas to return from the mountain redoubts they had seized in Indian-controlled Kashmir. Mr. Clinton offered assurances that he was willing to take a personal interest in setting the half-century-old dispute over Kashmir, but after the coup that deposed Mr. Sharif, Mr. Clinton has had no opportunity to become involved in Kashmir talks.
In order to differentiate between General Musharraf, to whom Mr. Clinton will try to deliver a stern message, and the people of Pakistan, the administration is exploring the possibility of the president's addressing the nation in a televised speech, a senior administration official said.
The White House statement further argued that if Mr. Clinton had rebuffed Pakistan, he would strengthen the militant groups that threaten to send the country into a political and economic collapse and dishearten advocates of a secular democracy.
Events on the subcontinent -- including the testing of nuclear weapons by India and Pakistan in 1998 and the sharp deterioration in their relations -- have made the nature of Mr. Clinton's trip more difficult than when it was first contemplated some years ago as the celebration of a new American relationship with India.
Today, the White House stressed that the focus of Mr. Clinton's trip, which will start in Bangladesh on March 20, remained on India, where he will spend five days and visit five cities. The itinerary in India is geared to spectacular backdrops -- the Taj Mahal and possibly an elephant ride -- and to emphasizing the new India of technology and trade.
In contrast, Mr. Clinton may not venture outside the Islamabad airport, although senior Administration officials said arrangements for the Pakistani visit were only now getting under way.
Last week, a State Department official described the tussle over the visit as a "fight to the finish" between security and anti-terrorist officials, who did not want Mr. Clinton to go, and those who believed it was essential not to write off Pakistan.
But even those who could see the benefit of Mr. Clinton's going to Islambad acknowledged that there were problems in justifying the visit.
Among the obstacles the Administration had to address was the unwillingness of the Pakistan government to outlaw Harakat ul-Mujahedeen, a group the administration accuses of terrorism.
The severest action Pakistan has taken against the group is to place under house arrest one of its leaders, Maulana Masood Azhar, whom India had released from jail in December as a condition to end the hijacking of an Indian Airlines jet.
"We can spin it so we appear to have passed the test," an administration official said several weeks ago, as talking points were being composed in favor of the trip.
But on the details of Pakistan's progress toward the administration's goals, a senior administration official who briefed reporters today offered a poor scorecard. On democracy, the official noted that the Constitution and provincial assemblies remained suspended, politicians remained detained, judges had to take loyalty oaths, and a "road map" to democratic rule was yet to be seen.
The official noted on the positive side a "commitment" by General Musharref to local elections, a lively press, some action against corruption and the trial of the former prime minister, Mr. Sharif, being conducted with "due process."
The decision to go ahead with the Pakistan visit received a mixed reaction here.
In an interview initiated by Lanny J. Davis, a lobbyist for Pakistan and formerly a White House special counsel for Mr. Clinton, the Pakistani ambassador, Maleeha Lodhi, said Mr. Clinton's visit could help ease the Kashmir dispute and slow the arms race between India and Pakistan. "He will be received very warmly," she said.
But a former American ambassador to Pakistan, Robert Oakley, said that too much energy had been spent on the question of whether Mr. Clinton should go to Pakistan rather than on what would be achieved.
"Musharref is not one to back down in the face of United States pressure," he said. "If he's prepared to send a message to the Indian prime minister through Clinton privately that he's willing to take credible steps on Kashmir," then the visit might be worthwhile, he said.

Dow Industrials Drop 3.7% On Worries About Profits
The Dow Jones industrial average plunged 374.47 points, or 3.7 percent, to 9,796.03, on investor fears that rising oil prices combined with higher interest rates may do significant damage to corporate profits. Broader market averages fared a bit better. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 2.6 percent of its value, and the Nasdaq composite index lost 1.2 percent.
The decline began when Procter & Gamble said that its earnings in the current quarter would come in well below Wall Street expectations. Adding to investor anxiety, oil prices soared to $34.13 a barrel. Page A1.

HEADLINE: Top German Bank in Talks To Buy Rival

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, March 7

 BODY:
In a move that could lead to one of the biggest job reductions yet in Europe, Deutsche Bank A.G. plans to acquire a big German domestic rival, Dresdner Bank A.G., people close to the deal said today.
Deutsche Bank is already the largest bank in Europe in terms of assets and the world's second largest behind the pending combination of three big Japanese banks. If a deal to purchase Dresdner Bank goes through, Deutsche Bank would become a far bigger No. 2, with more than $1.2 trillion in assets, about twice the size of Citigroup, the largest bank in the United States. 
 Analysts said today that if the deal -- potentially worth more than $30 billion -- is completed, the two German banks would eventually eliminate 1,000 to 2,000 branches in Germany and, over time, cut tens of thousands of jobs. The two banks have combined work forces of 120,000 worldwide.
People close to the deal said the ultimate goal is a fundamental overhaul of the banks that have been the hub of this country's postwar economy.
A "new Deutsche Bank," they said, would largely retreat from the basic business of serving retail customers at local branches. The combined branch network of both banks would be spun off as a separate company. Though Deutsche Bank might still own a majority stake, it would concentrate on serving wealthy individuals and corporations.
Though huge, Germany's leading private banks make almost no profit on retail banking services. That has reduced their market capitalization, and they have lost valuable corporate clients to Wall Street investment banks.
Officially, Dresdner and Deutsche would say today only that they are in "advanced" talks about a collaboration and would hold a news conference on Thursday morning.
People close to the deal said it was to be structured as a three-way agreement between the two banks and the biggest European insurer, Allianz of Munich.
All three institutions hold stakes in one another, as well as many other German companies, and have been at the center of a web of cross-holdings.
The people close to the talks said that under a proposed agreement, Allianz would take a significant stake in the new branch network.
One purpose of the deal would be to guarantee Allianz a distribution channel for its insurance and investment products. At the moment, Allianz distributes many of its products through Dresdner Bank.
Allianz would also like to acquire Deutsche Bank's huge mutual fund business, known as DWS. People close to the talks said this may also become part of the agreement, because Dresdner Bank has its own mutual fund business and antitrust regulators in Germany or at the European Commission in Brussels may demand that one of the two businesses be sold.
In effect, according to one executive, a combined company would become what Deutsche Bank's top executives have long wanted: a bank focused on serving the wealthy and the corporate.
Investors reacted jubilantly to the prospect of a merger. Shares of Deutsche Bank rose nearly 8 percent today to 94 euros, or $90.01. Dresdner soared 21 percent, to 57.20 euros, or $54.77. Allianz shares gained 12.9 percent, to 383.30 euros, or $367.05.
Though German banking executives have speculated about mergers for years, the prospect of a deal between Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank caught many analysts by surprise.
The two held extensive negotiations last year about merging their retail networks, but Dresdner Bank's chief executive, Bernard Walter, broke off the talks in September.
Deutsche Bank's chief executive, Rolf-Ernst Breuer, has been restlessly restructuring his company from the time he took over the top post three years ago.
Mr. Breuer engineered Deutsche Bank's $10 billion acquisition of the Bankers Trust Corporation last year, a move that gave Deutsche Bank a much bigger presence in the United States and strengthened its position in investment banking and transaction services.
Under Mr. Breuer, Deutsche Bank has realized its biggest profits from trading in bonds and derivative securities like options and futures.
Thanks in large part to those businesses, Deutsche Bank's net income rose 50 percent in 1999, to 2.6 billion euros. Dresdner's profit rose 13 percent, to 1.1 billion euros.
But their retail banking businesses have consistently kept overall profitability below those of American and British financial institutions. Deutsche Bank's return on equity, a commonly used measure of bank performance, was roughly 9.9 percent last year, and Dresdner Bank's even lower. By comparison, Citigroup's return on equity was around 14 percent.
In recent months, rumors have repeatedly coursed through the markets that Allianz would push through a union between Dresdner Bank and Hypovereinsbank in Munich. Allianz holds big stakes in both institutions, and industry executives were convinced that Allianz was not eager to promote a merger involving Deutsche Bank, which has in many ways been a rival of Allianz and one of Germany's big power brokers.
But behind the scenes, Allianz executives apparently concluded that they would get a much faster return on their investment by dealing with Deutsche Bank, in part because Deutsche and Dresdner both had similar goals of becoming global corporate banks and were therefore more amenable to rapid cost-cutting.

HEADLINE: Injecting Change Into Argentina;
New President Tries to Keep Industry From Leaving the Country

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, March 1

 BODY:
When President Fernando de la Rua took office nearly three months ago, the unemployment rate stood at a stubbornly high 14 percent. Consumer demand remained sluggish. Shantytowns were spreading. And manufacturers seemed to be jumping over each other to relocate to Brazil where labor was cheaper.
That bleak picture has not changed much. 
 But since his Dec. 10 inauguration, Mr. De la Rua has shown himself to be an activist who will put the economy before all other issues. Whether his actions will be sufficient to repair Argentina's economy remains a big question, but even his critics say they are surprised by the vigorous pace of change from the president, who dared to suggest that he was a boring fellow in a signature television advertisement during his campaign.
In his first month in office, Mr. De la Rua rammed a new budget and tax package through Congress, slicing this year's fiscal deficit by more than half and silencing rumors of an impending devaluation. Then, he reached an unexpectedly generous $7.4 billion loan agreement with the International Monetary Fund that has allowed the country to swap bonds for new debt at lower interest rates.
He succeeded in lowering fuel prices, highway tolls and railroad freight prices. He ordered raids on tax-evading businesses to raise revenue and relieve law-abiding companies of unfair competition. He tightened the revenue flow to five provinces that were virtually bankrupt, forcing them to become more financially responsible. Declaring a national economic emergency, he has begun to trim the bloated government bureaucracy. He started by dismissing one-third of his intelligence service.
Late last month, Mr. De la Rua faced down a threatened strike by the nation's largest labor confederation, opening the way for enactment of a new labor code intended to reduce the bargaining power of labor unions and help businesses more easily hire and fire new workers.
"I am an anxious man," Mr. De la Rua said in his monotone, displaying a thin, stern smile during a recent interview at the Casa Rosada presidential palace. "I like things done quickly, without delay. But we are definitely on our way." He put Argentina's economic predicament in simple terms, saying, "If you ask me what is my chief concern in a word, that word is 'competitiveness.' "
Reducing business costs and expanding exports are urgent tasks if South America's second-biggest economy -- one with 37 million consumers that last year had a gross domestic product of $285 billion and $5 billion in imports from the United States -- is to recoup the high expectations of only a few years ago. The 3 percent growth rate that most economists expect this year may sound good but the economy declined last year by 3 percent in the aftermath of the Asian and Russian financial crises and the January 1999 Brazilian devaluation.
About 60 manufacturing companies have moved to Brazil in recent months, seeking lower labor costs and offers of tax breaks and other government subsidies. After Tupperware, Goodyear Tire and Rubber and Royal Philips Electronics closed factories outside Buenos Aires -- all decided it was better to supply the Argentine market from Brazil -- one local business magazine ran a headline that said, "Bye, Bye Argentina."
The Argentine auto and auto-parts industries, once seen as an economic juggernaut that would profit handsomely from a growing Brazilian market, are barely holding on after suffering a 33 percent loss of production and a 59 percent fall in exports last year. General Motors, Ford Motor and Fiat are all transferring production to Brazil, and with negotiations between Buenos Aires and Brasilia to revamp the Mercosur trade union bogged down, big layoffs are probably inevitable.
Two deep recessions in the last five years have dimmed the memories of the go-go years of the early 1990's. At that time, Argentina became the favored emerging market of Wall Street following a series of privatizations and a decision to link the historically unstable peso one-to-one with the dollar. But the policy, which was initiated by former President Carlos Saul Menem to end years of hyperinflation, has tied Argentina to a strong dollar and rising United States interest rates.
That is why Argentine interest rates, which start at 8 percent, are totally out of proportion with the country's negative inflation rate of 2 percent last year. When Brazil devalued its currency by 40 percent just over a year ago, making Argentine exports to Brazil far more expensive, there was no monetary policy card for Buenos Aires to play.
What cards the new Argentine leader has played have not received universal approval. Some economists say Mr. De la Rua's move to increase government revenue by $2.6 billion through higher income and sales taxes and to eliminate tax loopholes for private health care, transportation and entertainment may have pleased the I.M.F., but will only slow the economy. And once the tax increases begin to be felt by consumers, the economists say, Mr. De la Rua could suffer losses during a Congressional election next year that would hurt his effectiveness in the last three years of his term.
"They still haven't taken into account the distorting tax structure that costs Argentina competitiveness -- especially the high taxes on diesel and high payroll taxes," said Domingo Cavallo, the former economy minister who devised the plan to peg Argentina's currency to the dollar.
And few analysts see any progress in the effort by Mr. De la Rua to reinvigorate the Mercosur trade union and end a year of disputes with Brazil over sugar, chickens, textiles, shoes and motor vehicles.
Nevertheless, Mr. De la Rua and his aides predict that their early fiscal moves will stimulate bond and stock market rallies and produce strong growth in the second half of this year. They note that Standard & Poor's recently revised its view on the Argentine economy from "negative" to "stable."
"I know people have doubts," said Economy Minister Jose Luis Machinea, the chief architect of Mr. De la Rua's economic policies. "But you can quote me on this: this economy will grow a minimum of 4 percent this year."
The government's optimistic view is based in part on a nascent boom in high technology and the growing number of local Internet companies. The complete deregulation of the telecommunications industry, begun under the previous government, promises to lower business telephone and computer costs significantly by the end of the year. Meanwhile, rising agricultural commodity prices and the strengthening of the Brazilian currency as Brazil's economy expands should improve Argentine export earnings.
"Our eyes are focused on growth and whether we will be competitive or not," Mr. Machinea said. "How do you reduce business costs? You reduce the country-risk ratings and interest rates, then you lower labor expenses."
And officials continue to voice cautious optimism that they can fix relations with Brazil. "If there is a war of subsidies all our peoples will lose from the costs of expanding fiscal deficits," said Foreign Minister Adalberto Rodriguez Giavarini.
The crown jewel of the De la Rua economic policy is his labor reform, which passed the lower house of Congress on Feb. 25. The legislation would increase the probationary period mandated by law for new workers to 6 months from the current 30 days, giving companies more time to terminate an employee without paying severance. It would lower the payroll tax rate for new hires to 12 percent from 18 percent. It would eliminate a rule that obliges companies to retain old contracts if negotiations fail, a change that would prohibit union leaders from protecting anachronistic work rules by refusing to negotiate in good faith.
Perhaps most important, the new labor code would take away the power of national union leaders to determine salaries and working conditions across entire industries, allowing smaller and newer companies to bargain their own terms rather than having to pay the same salaries as large, established firms.
Passage of the labor code in the Senate, senior De la Rua aides predict, would give the new administration the momentum to further reduce business costs by deregulating the health care system.
"He used to be boring before he became president but now he is having fun," said Eduardo Elsztain, chairman of IRSA and Cresud, Argentina's largest real estate and farm companies. "He's making the right moves."
But most business leaders, particularly those in the manufacturing sector who are straining to compete with Brazil, are skeptical that Mr. De la Rua's policies will be sufficient to quickly return Argentina to the 6 and 7 percent growth rates that they had become accustomed to before last year.
Jorge Ganimian, owner of the Oxigeno shoe company, said he was happy about President De la Rua's labor reforms, and that the expected 10 percent decrease in his labor costs would enable him to add 10 employees to his staff of 80 at a factory outside Buenos Aires.
But Mr. Ganimian said that as much as he would like to build a new factory and double his work force, he felt constrained because of the competitive disadvantage he continued to suffer in relation to Brazilian shoe producers who pay their workers one-third the wage an Argentine shoemaker earns.
"I'd like to expand and export," Mr. Ganimian added, "but I can't put my capital on a roulette wheel."
Pablo Piqueras, a director of Casa Pi-Ro S.A., a medical supply company with $20 million in annual sales, said he applauded Mr. De la Rua's early moves but that he and his partners were still giving serious consideration to closing their plant in the city of La Plata and dismissing 150 workers. For the first time in its 70-year history, the company granted a vacation to all of its factory workers in February and suspended production for three weeks to reduce an inventory backlog.
Mr. Piqueras said it was impossible to compete with the flood of cheap Korean and Chinese syringes in recent years, and Brazilian officials were offering a package of tax breaks and subsidized loans to relocate to Brazil. "I'm an Argentine and I would like to believe in my country's future," he said, "but if there is no national policy to save us and we can't compete, its time to move."

HEADLINE: Troubled Trip to Pakistan

 BODY:
President Clinton's decision to include a stop in Pakistan in his visit to South Asia later this month should not be seen as an American endorsement of Gen. Pervez Musharraf, that country's military ruler. Since seizing power last October, General Musharraf has ignored Washington's concerns in three vital areas. He refuses to cut links with international terrorist groups, resists treaty commitments to curb Pakistan's nuclear weapons program and declines to take steps toward restoring democratic rule.
For these reasons, Mr. Clinton would have done better to skip Pakistan, limiting his visit to India and Bangladesh. But since he has chosen to add a stop in Islamabad, he should use his time there to encourage constructive changes in Pakistani behavior. 
 Administration officials concluded that a snub of Pakistan might drive the country toward even more belligerent conduct. With only 10 months remaining in Mr. Clinton's term, this is probably his last chance to visit Pakistan as president. He enjoyed some success interceding with General Musharraf's deposed predecessor, Nawaz Sharif, getting him to pull back from a dangerous military confrontation with India in Kashmir last summer. That border remains dangerous, with Pakistani-backed militants regularly attacking Indian positions.
Since both countries became independent a half-century ago, Pakistan has been challenging India's control over this restive Muslim-majority state. Mr. Clinton now seems eager to offer American help in resolving the longstanding dispute. But India remains opposed to any form of international mediation on Kashmir, and without New Delhi's cooperation any American effort would be doomed. For now, America should limit its role to trying to prevent further armed clashes.
Mr. Clinton should also press General Musharraf to sever ties with Harakat ul-Mujahedeen, a Kashmiri terrorist group backed by the Pakistani Army. He ought to insist that Pakistan use its close links with the Taliban government in Afghanistan to press for the expulsion of Osama bin Laden, the international terrorist implicated in the deadly bombings of two American embassies in Africa. Another goal should be to persuade Pakistan, as well as India, to sign the nuclear test ban treaty.
South Asia is home to more than a sixth of the world's population and is of growing economic importance. For too long it has been neglected by American presidents. This is not the ideal moment for Mr. Clinton to visit Pakistan. He should keep his visit as brief as possible and not flinch from telling General Musharraf what he must do to win American and world respect.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: POLITICAL MEMO;
The Winners' Challenge: How to Spend, Spend, Spend (but Mend, Mend, Mend)

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, March 7

 BODY:
For Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, tonight provided enough sweet victories to let both men begin to focus on running against each other in the general election.
Each planned to treat his primary rival with respect to unify his party. But neither worried anymore about losing the nomination. 
 Each has been toughened by a primary campaign that replaced a coronation. They now face some things they can try to change, like Mr. Bush's swing toward his party's right after losing in New Hampshire. There are matters they can do little or nothing about, like Mr. Gore's fund-raising appearance at a Buddhist temple in 1996.
But perhaps the biggest problem ahead is one they face jointly. A substantial -- quite possibly decisive -- minority of primary voters who supported their rivals, former Senator Bill Bradley and Senator John McCain, did so because they were fed up with the big money that dominates today's campaigns.
Yet in the fall, both Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush will raise and spend every last dollar they can find, while their supporters fill the airwaves with "issue ads" which the candidates will claim -- perhaps accurately, though not necessarily believably -- to have nothing to do with.
Thus, the two men will face the chore of winning votes of the self-styled reformers, while doing everything those voters find abhorrent.
Mr. Gore's effort at a solution is already on the table: a commitment to the same legislation Mr. Bradley and Mr. McCain backed. For Mr. Bush, the path is less clear, and he may choose to ignore the campaign finance issue in the hope that those voters who care will not trust Mr. Gore to do anything about it.
Mr. Gore tried to meet that issue tonight with a proposal that could eliminate the most objectionable way the money is spent, on 30-second and 60-second spots. He called, as he did in the primary campaign, for two debates a week and no 30-second or 60-second commercials. Mr. McCain might have agreed, but Mr. Bush almost certainly will not; Mr. Gore can then blame him for an enormously expensive campaign.
Mr. Bush has cause to worry about McCain supporters. A poll of voters in California today showed that of those who cast ballots for Mr. McCain in the Republican primary, about two-fifths planned to desert the Republican Party for Mr. Gore in the fall. Only a handful of Democratic primary voters who supported Mr. Bradley said they expected to defect from Mr. Gore in November.
The first steps toward McCain and Bradley voters were taken tonight when the victors praised the men who had made their lives difficult. Mr. Gore said in Nashville that Mr. Bradley was a "good man for whom I have great respect."
Similarly, Mr. Bush hailed Mr. McCain, saying, "We have had our disagreements, but I respect him and I respect his commitment to reform."
Of the two prospective nominees, Mr. Bush's immediate tasks are more obvious. The campaign answered one question about him: whether he could take a punch. But it shook him of the appealing stance he took when he began, that of the "compassionate conservative" who could draw Hispanic and African-American voters, the practical reformer who could offer something different from ideologically bound Congressional Republicans.
Just on Monday Mr. Bush tried to mend the tears in that robe, speaking out for tolerance and softening his opposition to talking to gay Republicans. But the need to win in South Carolina forced him to depend on the Christian right, a bloc that scares suburban Republicans, and the Gore campaign can be counted on to keep reminding them of that link.
Tonight Mr. Bush returned to the themes he championed in declaring his candidacy last summer.
"Republicans must expand our prosperity -- and extend it to those who still struggle," he said. "We must be a strong nation that also cares for the weak and forgotten. We must welcome the new Americans -- Americans by choice -- because legal immigration is not a source of national weakness, it is a sign of national success."
Conversely, Mr. Gore was drawn left by Mr. Bradley's challenge. But it involved no dramatic change in Mr. Gore's stands, and, except for his opposition to current military policy on gay soldiers, nothing that offers much of an opening for Mr. Bush.
Another apparent Bush need is to broaden the campaign's structure to include both non-Texans and Republicans with national experience. His campaign has not looked smooth while winning and squandered its huge financial advantage.
But there are eight months until Election Day, and both camps are counting on highlighting their opponents' inescapable weaknesses.
Mr. Bush began tonight to hammer Mr. Gore concerning the Buddhist temple and other campaign finance irregularities from the 1996 campaign, saying, "I will remind Al Gore that Americans do not want a White House where there is 'no controlling legal authority.' "
And Mr. Gore started tonight on the obvious counterstrategy by saying, "I've learned from my mistakes."
His hope is that the public will tire of the subject and prefer to consider the Clinton years in terms of a booming economy. Mindful of history, the Gore campaign will boast of it, for it has been many decades since the nation has thrown out the party in power in good economic times.
The Bush campaign, of course, is hoping that this year will be different, and that dismay about President Clinton's personal behavior will lead the public, as Mr. Bush put it, to deny "Clinton-Gore a third term."

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Gore Speech Celebrating Victory

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from a speech by Vice President Al Gore last night at his campaign headquarters in Nashville, as transcribed by The New York Times:
I want to say something to a good man for whom I have great respect, Senator Bill Bradley and Ernestine Bradley and to their supporters. I received a very gracious telephone call from him a few moments ago, and I appreciate that. I think that anybody who has heard Bill Bradley throughout this campaign has come away from the experience moved and touched by the strength of his commitment to healing the divisions in our country, especially divisions based on race. He believes in this healing heart and soul. I share his commitment to it. I have learned from his passion for it. Tonight I salute Senator Bill Bradley and Ernestine Bradley, his wife. . . . 
 Tonight I want to reach out to all who believe that this is the time for great progress, for great reforms, for an America of tolerance and high ideals. We stand at a mountaintop moment in our history, the longest period of economic growth this nation has ever known. Under President Clinton, almost 21 million new jobs. Welfare reform, crime down. We're putting 100,000 new police on our streets. More Americans are safer, more Americans have hope. America is strong, prosperous, at peace in the world.
But while we are here are to celebrate great victories, I say to you tonight, and hear me well -- you ain't seen nothing yet. Our fight has just begun. Our fight for the working families of this country has just begun and tonight I invite all Americans who seek the best America, all Americans regardless of party to join us in this cause. We need to build on our record of prosperity. We don't need to go back to where we were eight years ago. They tried their approach before. It produced a triple-dip recession and quadrupled the national debt. If you don't want to go back to that then join us now. Our campaign is your cause.
If you believe in common-sense, affordable tax cuts to help working families save for college, then join us now. And if you believe we can invest in our people and still live within our means and even pay down the national debt, then join us now. Because our campaign is your cause. If you believe in using our prosperity wisely to lift our nation up, not wasting the surplus on a risky tax scheme, then join us. . . .
If you believe in setting aside enough of the surplus to safeguard Social Security and strengthen Medicare, then join us now. Join us, our campaign is your cause. Join us to secure health care as a fundamental right to cover every single child in the next four years, to move forward step by step to universal coverage. And then pass a new program of medicoverage so that all of our seniors will have the financial help they need to purchase the prescription drugs that their doctors prescribe for them. Join us to pass a patients' bill of rights so medical decisions are made not by insurance company accountants or H.M.O. bureaucrats, but by doctors and nurses and medical professionals. Join us to bring revolutionary improvements to education, investing more but also demanding more. . . .
And if you believe in a just and tolerant society and not the politics of division, I say join us now. And to those Republicans and independents out there whose heroes are Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln, to all of you I say as well, join with us.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE VICE PRESIDENT;
Challenges by Rivals Sent Front-Runners to Plan B/Gore Emphasizing Practical

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: NASHVILLE, March 7

 BODY:
For someone who was embalmed just last fall by a New York tabloid as "Dead Veep Walking," it was a stunning achievement.
Twelve years after he embarrassed himself with an ill-conceived and inept presidential campaign and only a few months after he was nearly written off as a loser, Vice President Al Gore has revived his fortunes, sweeping aside an opponent who sneaked up on him last fall and nearly stole his political future. 
 Mr. Gore and his wife, Tipper, watched the returns in a hotel suite here. Shortly after 9 p.m., Mr. Gore took the stage at the hotel ballroom, where he claimed his last Senate title, in 1984. While he did not technically declare victory because the polls had yet to close on the West Coast, he said he had received "a very gracious" telephone call from his only Democratic rival, former Senator Bill Bradley. His conciliatory tone toward Mr. Bradley belied the heat of the campaign and the scare that Mr. Bradley had given him. He did not reveal the contents of the conversation, even to his aides, because he rushed to the ballroom right after hanging up.
Mr. Gore is fond of saying that competition from Mr. Bradley has been good for him, that the challenge by Mr. Bradley forced him to become a better candidate. Mr. Bradley "was a blessing in disguise," Mr. Gore said recently, invoking Winston Churchill as he hinted in a trenchant aside just how nervous he had once been: "Some disguise."
The fact is that Mr. Bradley did spur Mr. Gore into a wholesale overhaul of his candidacy, prompting an extraordinary political resurrection of the vice president after Labor Day, when a poll by The Boston Globe showed Mr. Bradley neck and neck with him in New Hampshire.
But the building blocks that helped Mr. Gore survive that period actually were put in place long ago. As Bill Clinton's vice president, he devoted himself to raising money and doing political favors -- and collecting i.o.u.'s from local and state politicians across the country. And in 1999 he called those chits in, racking up endorsements from county sheriffs to the president of the United States.
So formidable was the political infrastructure Mr. Gore assembled that by last year he had scared off any challengers. Most notable among them was Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, who decided that the Democrats had a better chance of recapturing the House than keeping the White House after eight years of Bill Clinton and impeachment.
So confident was the Gore team that when Mr. Bradley loped into the picture from left field, it paid him little mind. After all, Mr. Gore had locked up most of the so-called superdelegates, the elected officials and party leaders who will pick the nominee at the party's August convention. He had built a floor through which he could not fall. And he was campaigning at a time of peace and nearly unprecedented prosperity.
But then, perhaps feeling too secure, he lapsed into an imperious Rose Garden strategy that nearly led to his ruin.
His troubles have been well-documented, as has his very public makeover, in which he abandoned the podium in favor of the Oprah-style town meeting used with such great success by his mentor, Mr. Clinton.
"We had to bring an end to Gore Inc.," one Gore adviser recalled recently, referring to the sprawling, complacent, almost corporate entity that the sterile campaign had become. "It wasn't just a building on K Street; it was a psychology."
What secured his victory, however, were certain strategic decisions and a newfound discipline in the candidate and in his campaign to adhere to those decisions. As he was developing a warmer and fuzzier public image, his campaign was developing a sharper edge. That sharpness sometimes overtook the candidate in his debates with Mr. Bradley.
Mr. Gore deftly forced Mr. Bradley into a more negative campaign than Mr. Bradley had vowed to run. All the while, the vice president was nailing down the support of core constituents, relentlessly painting a worrisome picture of Mr. Bradley and resolving not to stray from his message of the day -- even to the point of laughing in recent days about his universal answer, no matter the question: "I am not taking a single vote for granted."
"The central decision was basically to keep the gas on and not let up," one top Gore strategist said. "That was the guiding principle, to stay disciplined, focused, on message, and campaign like hell."
Still, when the history of the Gore campaign is written, it may focus less on Mr. Gore's successful stratagems (and there were many) and more on Mr. Bradley's missteps (and there were many). Even as Mr. Bradley loomed as a potentially serious threat, he mystified Gore operatives for his inability to build on his assets, and he made blunders that in retrospect seem naive.
One telling moment went almost unremarked by the Gore campaign at the time. It was back on Dec. 16, when Mr. Bradley shared a stage in Claremont, N.H., with Senator John McCain, a Republican, to highlight their disgust with the campaign finance system. At the time, it looked like a coup for Mr. Bradley: lasso the maverick Republican, make a name for yourself as a new breed of politician, and build some excitement among independent voters.
As it happened, that "summit of the underdogs," as Mr. Bradley and Mr. McCain termed it, hurt Mr. Bradley more than it helped him. In the eyes of the Gore campaign, at least retrospectively, it validated the scrappier Mr. McCain as the true insurgent and seemed to give Mr. Bradley's stamp of approval for independent-leaning Democrats to vote for Mr. McCain.
"When Bradley stood with McCain, he provided a letter of transit for independent voters to go with McCain," one Gore confidant said. "It didn't matter that McCain was pro-life or pro-gun. People saw him as legitimized."
Such blunders, over time, created an opening for the vice president after months of self-inflicted wounds.
"His failures reinvigorated the Gore campaign," said Leon E. Panetta, a former White House chief of staff for Mr. Clinton and a close observer of the Gore candidacy.
In addition, the Gore campaign was lining up with all the core Democratic constituencies that vote in primaries. These efforts were led by Donna Brazile, the campaign manager, who has extensive experience in working with the party's core groups, like influential blacks, women and gays. The rest of the Gore team was also clicking into place, with Tony Coelho, the campaign chairman, Carter Eskew, the message man, Bob Shrum, the media strategist, and Michael Whouley, the top field marshal, on the ground.
The campaign averted a potential disaster by persuading organized labor to endorse Mr. Gore, which it did on Oct. 12. The A.F.L.-C.I.O. could have remained neutral and nearly did. Only after intense lobbying by Gore officials, with an assist from Mr. Clinton, did the unions, though not unanimously, bestow their prized backing and its promise of election-day manpower on the vice president. It helped restore a sense of strength that had slipped through his fingers.
Two weeks before, Mr. Gore had signaled a new aggressiveness. In twin speeches to the Democratic National Committee, Mr. Bradley made a lofty appeal to the party's highest instincts, while Mr. Gore, aiming his message less at suburban moderates and more at the party's base, said he would roll up his sleeves and fight for the traditional values of the party.
This was followed by a similarly disparate appearance at the Jefferson-Jackson Day Dinner in Des Moines, where again Mr. Bradley aimed for the ideal and Mr. Gore came across as more practical.
Mr. Gore, still the self-anointed underdog, pressed Mr. Bradley to agree to debates. Mr. Bradley demurred, a pose that he would often adopt, to his detriment, in the face of Mr. Gore's confrontational style.
It was then that Mr. Gore's campaign anthem of "Stay and Fight" emerged. He had accused Mr. Bradley of quitting the Senate (he retired after a third term), while Mr. Gore decided to "stay and fight" the Republicans.
Larry Grisolano, a direct-mail consultant in Iowa and a Gore supporter, proposed that Mr. Gore expand this phrase into a theme. By the night of the dinner, 1,000 signs had been printed up with the slogan, and over time it evolved into a full-fledged battle cry that Mr. Gore now gives full throat to at the end of nearly every speech: "I am a fighter! I want to fight for you!"
Mr. Panetta said: "The crucial thing is that Al Gore came out of this thing looking like a fighter. Bradley didn't. He wasn't willing to fight back. And in not fighting back, he let Gore look like the stronger candidate."
Mr. Gore's fighter persona emerged just as Mr. Bradley was putting his health-care proposal forward, and it offered Mr. Gore a chance to go after something substantive. The Gore team believed that health care would be a central concern of voters but there was some question about what approach to take since the Clinton administration's own proposal for universal coverage had failed in 1994.
One top Gore adviser described the internal debate: "There was a very active debate in the campaign between those who wanted a more sweeping health-care proposal -- those who frankly had lived with the ghost of Harris Wofford and Bob Kerrey, who had ridden it with incredible political power and momentum -- and those on the policy staff who said we should be more incremental."
The adviser said Mr. Gore had decided to put the brakes on a more ambitious health-care proposal.
Day after day, Mr. Gore ripped into Mr. Bradley's proposal as a half-baked plan that would cost too much and provide woefully inadequate coverage. His main charge was that Mr. Bradley's goal of universal coverage -- which Mr. Gore adopted as his own -- was worthy but that the approach should be step by step.
From this, Mr. Gore extracted a larger message about his candidacy -- that he was a political realist and would be a careful steward of the prosperity while Mr. Bradley was a dreamer with an academic approach to problems that would end up hurting people and ruining the economy.
"They were up against a Clinton/ Gore-style campaign," said Lee Miringhoff, director of the Marist Institute poll in New York. "They target, hit, morph their positions very closely to yours and poke a hole or two in them and then bore away -- and you have to be up at the same speed."
Mr. Gore honed his skills in debate practice with his friend Tom Downey, the former Congressman from Long Island, standing in for Mr. Bradley. More than one observer said that Mr. Downey was sharper playing Mr. Bradley than Mr. Bradley was in the actual debates.
The race in Iowa was effectively over on Jan. 8, when in a debate, Mr. Gore questioned Mr. Bradley's commitment to helping flood victims in Iowa and Mr. Bradley did not address the matter. New Hampshire, where Mr. Gore had been on television for most of October with no counter-advertising from Mr. Bradley, fell into line shortly thereafter.
"That month that we had to ourselves really helped us to get back in the race," said one strategist. He said that when Mr. Bradley did buy air time, he did so in Boston, and the Gore campaign could see Mr. Bradley gaining ground among voters who watched Boston television.
"We faced a serious financial decision, and that was whether to go up in Boston or not," this adviser said. "Unless you communicate through the Boston media, you won't reach a big chunk of New Hampshire voters. We knew it would cost more and be less efficient, but if you don't do it, you're cooked."
The Gore campaign was also monitoring another topic that no one wanted to be caught discussing in public. That was Mr. Bradley's heart palpitations, a seemingly minor problem that could have mushroomed into a larger one.
"The Bradley people say that if he hadn't had the heart thing, he would have won New Hampshire," a Gore adviser said. "Well, if we were trailing, we might have run a different kind of campaign," he said, not suggesting that they would have used Mr. Bradley's heart condition against him but that as long as Bradley supporters were engaging in hypotheticals, this adviser would, too.
"There is no lack of will to win over here," he said. "If we had found ourselves in a situation where we were short a vote, we probably would have tried a different route."
What would they have done?
"We would have drawn much stronger contrasts than we did," said this adviser. "We would have brought up that Bradley wants people to work until they're 70 when they retire. We didn't unload all our firepower."

Graying Population Has a New Reason to Keep on Working

BYLINE: By DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN 

 BODY:
The House vote last week to repeal a Depression-era policy intended to discourage older people from working could bring some of those people back into the labor-starved economy.
 For decades, people age 62 to 69 who received Social Security benefits and worked, but earned too much money, had their benefits reduced. That penalty was probably a reason that from 1962 to 1996, the latest year for which data are available, the proportion of people 65 and older who continued to work dropped to 21 percent from 36 percent. (During the same period, the proportion of people in that group receiving Social Security benefits rose to 91 percent from 69 percent.) 
 While people age 62 to 69 were penalized for earning too much, those 70 and older were exempt from the earnings limit. So even as the proportion of the workforce aged 62 to 69 declined over the last two decades, the percentage of the workforce 70 and up rose.
 Bob Greenstein, executive director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a research group, said that under the current law reduced benefits are restored after people turn 70, making the earnings limit a big wash for the average worker. Nevertheless, he said, the repeal of the limit may cause a modest increase in labor force participation. DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN

To the Editor:
Re "Do the Voters Really Hate Sprawl?" (Op-Ed, March 3): Rather than signifying a cultural preference for suburban living, the rise of suburbanism in Los Angeles was shaped by a history of state and federal policy favoring the car at the expense of public transportation. This legacy has widened the class, race and gender divide between the car-owning "haves" and the transit-dependent "have-nots." 
 While exurban commercial growth became the engine of Los Angeles' post-industrial economy, the city's overinvestment in the cult of the automobile effectively denied many inner-city poor and working-class residents access to jobs.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE BIGGEST STATE;
Gore Claims Popular Vote Is Harbinger of Results In the November Election

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, March 7

 BODY:
If California's jungle primary was the first harbinger of the general election, Al Gore today claimed he was the king of beasts, with surveys of voters showing he finished first among contenders listed on the same blanket ballot regardless of party.
But the surveys showed George W. Bush was a close second, and the overall news from the polls was more good than great for Mr. Gore, suggesting an advantage, but not a lock, for him in November in the most-populous state. 
 Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush each won the support of about 3 in 10 voters in California, with the surveys showing Mr. Gore slightly ahead. Senator John McCain drew about 25 percent, and Bill Bradley barely 10 percent, according to the surveys. Fully 20 percent of Mr. McCain's support came from voters who identified themselves as Democrats, and one-third from independents, and 40 percent of his supporters said they would support Mr. Gore in the fall.
Those were all positive signs for Mr. Gore. He had a more than 15 point advantage among the self-described moderates who made up almost 40 percent of the electorate, the single biggest chunk.
Mr. Gore, who has made scores of visits to the state in the last seven years, spoke to a ballroom of supporters by telephone, saying: "I can't tell you how important it is to me to win big in the California Democratic contest and to win the overall California primary contest. That is a harbinger of things to come."
But Mr. Gore ran well behind his fellow Democrat, Senator Dianne Feinstein, who drew the support of nearly 6 in 10 voters in her race against a split field of contenders seeking the Republican nomination and the opportunity to challenge her in November. Mr. Gore just edged Mr. Bush in a hypothetical general election match-up, while Mr. McCain ran about five points ahead of Mr. Gore. Half of independent voters said they would back Mr. Gore in the fall, but 4 in 10 favored Mr. Bush. About 40 percent said that Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush were both "about right" in terms of ideology. Both also had similar favorable ratings.
"It shows that Bush will be strong enough to strong enough to be competitive here and that there's plenty of time for healing to happen," said Steve Kinney, a Republican pollster here. "It just shows you that here in California there's not a lot of love for Gore."
At least one top Democratic strategist agreed: "My sense of this is Gore did O.K., but not as well as he should have. It scares me that he doesn't have more oomph on his own."
Drawing conclusions from today's results here posed particular hazards, because this was California's first presidential primary using the blanket ballot, and there were no comparable benchmarks.
All votes counted in the overall race, but under major party rules, only the votes of party members counted toward delegate selection. But two-thirds of those surveyed said they would consider the candidate who won the most total votes to be the "real winner" of his party's primary.
Because Mr. Gore won overwhelmingly among Democrats, taking 6 in 10 Democratic votes to just under 2 in 10 for Mr. Bradley, and Mr. Bush took just under 6 in 10 Republicans to slightly more than 3 in 10 for Mr. McCain, political professionals in both parties quickly turned their attention to handicapping the general election, and especially trying to discern where McCain supporters might go.
Among all voters, Mr. McCain drew his strongest support from moderates, those with post-college education, those over 45 years old, those earning more than $100,000 a year, veterans and those who decided to vote in the last week, a demographic slice much like those that were crucial to the victories of California's last Republican governor, Pete Wilson.
When those voters were asked who they would support this fall, Mr. Bush ran even with Mr. Gore among veterans and those over 45, came close with those earning over $100,000 and lost the others by margins of roughly 60-to-40.
"If Bush loses those people in the fall, he won't even be competitive in California," said Bill Carrick, a Democratic consultant. "That's a group he has to have."
Geographically, Mr. McCain was most competitive in the Central Valley, the vast agricultural swath that runs the interior of the state, which accounted for a quarter of today's electorate and often swings statewide elections.
Today, Mr. McCain, Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush each took about 3 in 10 votes there; in the hypothetical fall contest, Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush split the area evenly.
Mr. Bush's advisers have long contended that he could translate his appeal in Texas, a fast-growing southwestern state with a booming high-tech economy, to California, which national Republicans have not contested vigorously since Mr. Bush's father won in 1988.
Mr. Bush has also shown strength with Hispanic voters, who make up a growing part of the electorate but have favored Democratic candidates in recent years, mostly in a backlash against Mr. Wilson's strong campaigns against affirmative action and illegal immigration.
Hispanic voters accounted for about 10 percent of today's electorate, and Mr. Gore won the votes of just over half, with Mr. Bush and Mr. McCain together taking about a third. In a hypothetical fall match-up, Mr. Bush, who ran television advertisements in Spanish, drew a respectable 3 in 10 Hispanic voters, well above recent Republican statewide showings, compared to two-thirds for Mr. Gore. In his victory speech in Texas tonight, Mr. Bush declared: "Legal immigration is not a source of national weakness; it is a sign of national success."
Moreover, 6 in 10 Hispanic voters, roughly the same percentage as the electorate as a whole, supported a successful ballot initiative to limit marriage to heterosexual couples, which Democrats opposed by a like margin.
Republican analysts called that a sign of Mr. Bush's potential appeal on an issue of traditional family values.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 9, 2000, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article in some copies yesterday about the California primary election returns referred incorrectly to support for Al Gore among those who described themselves as moderates. In that group, he had an advantage of more than 15 percentage points over George W. Bush. But the lead over John McCain was only 9 percentage points.

HEADLINE: ONLINE SHOPPER;
Clicks, Not Licks, as Green Stamps Go Digital

BYLINE: By MICHELLE SLATALLA

 BODY:
BEFORE frequent flier miles, there were S&H Green Stamps. Before credit-card rewards programs, there were S&H Green Stamps. Before Web dollars, e-coupons and MyPoints.com, there were S&H Green Stamps.
And now, Green Stamps are back, this time in digital form. The S&H company recently went online with an Internet site, Greenpoints.com, in an effort to resurrect one of the most famous icons of 20th-century retailing as a reward for online shopping. 
 The challenge for S&H will be to persuade online users that a new digital currency called greenpoints -- which you can't see or hold or lick or print out -- is as meaningful as a stack of perforated Green Stamps that would accumulate in an old red Pyrex bowl on the kitchen counter.
For those of you who have not thought of S&H stamps since your mother redeemed them for a new blender, let me refresh your memory. At the peak of trading stamp popularity in the mid 1960's, most gas stations and supermarkets were offering them to shoppers. S&H operated 800 free-standing redemption centers nationwide, and in the mid-1960's it printed more stamps than the Postal Service.
Each stamp had a pale green background embellished by a jaunty red "S&H" logo, a serial number and fine print that read "Value 1 2/3 mills," which meant that you could redeem it for cash.
But when I was a child, nobody I knew would have considered trading green stamps for mere money; they were worth far more than that. For my family -- sitting around the kitchen table for hours, licking that tapioca-flavored glue and filling Quick Saver Books until the pages began to warp and sag under the weight of wet stamps -- the experience provided the opportunity to ask the big questions: Were we the sort of people who would redeem our hoarded stamps for the kinds of sensible items that you could really build a postwar lifestyle around, like a 12-cup coffee percolator or a toaster? Or would we blow everything on something frivolous, like that family down the block who redeemed their stamps for a basketball that their kids lost the next day?
Green Stamps confirmed us as proud members of the first generation that succumbed to the heady lure of fancy new appliances. "That was the year," my mother said, remembering one green stamp purchase in 1969, "that we upgraded from a two-slice to a four-slice." And toast never tasted so good.
Long after the popularity of Green Stamps waned in the 1970's, the S&H logo still exerts a powerful, Proustian pull on nearly everyone who was old enough back then to lick. "The most compelling thing about S&H Green Stamps," said Melissa Shore, an analyst at Jupiter Communications, "is that whenever I tell someone that the company is entering the online market, people immediately begin to relate an emotional story about their experience of growing up with S&H Green Stamps. They have strong brand equity and a hundred years of experience."
So it is understandable that S&H wants to repackage the old-fashioned appeal of Green Stamps into something the company's executives describe with straight faces as a "complete loyalty solution."
"This is a company founded in 1896," said Walter Beinecke, the executive vice president of Greenpoints.com and a great-grandson of an S&H founder, Thomas Sperry. "But we're also a 104-year-old dot-com startup."
Computers, however, do not come loaded with a sense of taste, at least not yet. Clicking on a Web site seems a poor substitute for giddy feelings that the original stamps induced in millions of consumers.
"The question is: can you convey, online, that emotional feeling that people remember?" Ms. Shore said. It is a question that could be asked of any old-style retailer poised to take its business to the Web. The S&H company has a few additional hurdles.
"Our parents remembered the Depression and the war, and collecting trading stamps was all part of the dream of affluence, which meant acquiring your Levitt home and your television and your first appliances," said David Monod, a historian and the author of "Store Wars: Shopkeepers and the Culture of Mass Marketing, 1890-1939." "It definitely had to do with the physical feeling of the stamp itself, and the fact that your whole family sat around the table doing it together."
The transition to the Web becomes even more problematic because the domain name Greenstamps.com belongs to two California lawyers, Sullwold & Hughes, who think of themselves as S&H, too, and say they would not give up the name.
But Greenpoints officials said the name would have been too old-fashioned. "We would not want to be Green Stamps on the Internet anyway, because that speaks to an older way of doing things," Mr. Beinecke said.
In 1896, Mr. Beinecke said, Sperry & Hutchinson became the the first independent trading stamp company to distribute stamps and books to merchants, beginning in Michigan, and by the turn of the century trading stamps were very popular.
The reason, Mr. Beinecke said, was that the S&H incentive program rewarded shoppers both for timely payment (the stamps were given out in exchange for cash purchases) and loyalty to specific merchants.
But after the First World War, "the novelty wore off and nobody used them," Mr. Monod said. "Trading stamps tended to be popular in inflationary times, when people were concerned about prices, but in the 1920's, prices were stable. And in the 1930's, prices were deflationary."
In the 1930's, to protect independent merchants from chain stores, states began passing fair-trade laws to prevent retailers from cutting prices.
"Retailers had to find ways to entice customers and give them price breaks," said Sandra Stringer Vance, a historian who specializes in retail history since World War II and a co-author of "Wal-Mart: A History of Sam Walton's Retail Phenomenon."
The popularity of trading stamps revived, and by the middle of the century, S&H had become a powerful national company whose success was imitated by scores of local companies with names like Gold Bond, Blue Chip and Plaid Stamps, said Jeff R. Lonto, a Minneapolis author who published "The Trading Stamp Story."
But the climate changed drastically during the 1973 oil embargo. "At that time, 40,000 gas stations were giving out Green Stamps, but a number of them went out of business or consolidated," Mr. Beinecke said.
The trading stamp craze quickly faded. Although S&H never stopped the program -- even today about 400 independent businesses, including gas stations and travel agents, give out stamps and the company still operates a central customer service center in Atlanta -- Green Stamps disappeared from the public consciousness.
Mr. Beinecke's family sold the company in 1981, but last year he led a group of investors who bought S&H in the hope of re-inventing the incentive program in a digital economy.
"Rather than licking and sticking stamps as a family," said Rod Parker, president of Greenpoints.com, "today's family will go to the Web site and see how many points they have and what they can get, and think, 'Wow, this can be rewarding.' It's today's culture. It's fast, it's simple and you never have to leave the house."
But how do you persuade people to abandon the physical sensation of holding and licking a stamp? This is the same question that the E-Stamp Corporation confronted after beginning to sell digital stamps online last year.
"We found that in the consumer market, people were tied to the physical stamp," said Nicole Eagan, E-Stamp's senior vice president for sales and marketing, "and we actually bridge the electronic and physical worlds, because you can buy the stamps in the e-commerce world but then you can still print them out." You can print it on Avery labels and peel it off and stick it on the envelope, or you can print it right on the envelope, or you can print it on a document to show through a window envelope."
Postage, of course, is very palpable: you need it to mail in the bills. But the points and coupons behind Greenpoints.com and a number of other online incentive programs that arrived on the Internet months ago -- like MyPoints.com, ClickRewards.com and FreeRide.com -- are less tangible.
Greenpoints.com will also offer shoppers offline opportunities to earn points, Mr. Parker said. One merchant, the Foodtown supermarket chain, has started the program in 10 stores in the New York metropolitan area. Shoppers keep track of their points with a card that looks like a credit card, Mr. Parker said, and will be able to redeem both offline and online greenpoints.
To be successful, the programs have to offer rewards that today's jaded shoppers really believe are worth earning. Airline mileage? Yes. The opportunity to donate your accumulated points to charity? Maybe. Toasters? No.
Many of the 300 rewards that you could earn when Greenpoints.com began last week (the list keeps growing, and the company plans to offer more than 1,000 rewards online by the end of March) were easy-to-earn items -- like a movie theater ticket (2,400 points) or five $1 gift certificates for Wendy's fast food (2,400 points). But so what if you can accumulate enough points to redeem those items very quickly? You earn 20 greenpoints for each dollar spent. Does that really feel like a reward to today's shoppers?
"We are wild consumers these days, but we're desensitized to it because we buy so much," Mr. Monod said. "The things that excite people today are terribly, terribly expensive, like travel, which most people consider a luxury, or a new stereo system."
If you manage to accumulate more than 100,000 greenpoints, you could get something of real value, like a 13-inch Panasonic color television (141,600), a travel certificate for a round-trip domestic flight on Continental Airlines (149,000) or a ski vacation in Canada (249,000).
But at the introductory rate of 20 points per dollar, you would have to spend $12,450 to get the ski vacation. Knowing that, would you be willing to sign up, provide personal information and use the Greenpoints.com home page as a shopping trip starting point so the company can keep track of your purchases?
I did. I visited www.greenpoints.com -- and was momentarily catapulted into the lost world of a particular spring morning in 1969, the year 80 percent of American households were collecting trading stamps and a trip to the redemption center in the next town meant that my mother first had to wrestle my little brother into "good clothes."
Signing up -- giving my e-mail address -- earned me 3,000 points. I got an additional 1,000 points for providing personal information like name, sex and number of people in my household, and 500 more by answering a survey question.
With that many points in the bank, I surveyed some of the possible purchases, many of which were not on any shopper's wish list: I'm thinking, for example, of the potpourri to "add soft fragrance to any room" (3,600 points). I decided to hold on to my points. Instead, I scanned the list of 61 partner merchants (as of this week, the number of merchants had increased to 88), which included well-known retailers like OfficeMax.com, Borders.com and LandsEnd.com.
I had been planning to buy children's bathing suits anyway, and when I clicked on LandsEnd.com, a second browser window appeared on the screen to take me there. I bought eight bathing suits for $170, and when I closed the second browser window I found myself back at Greenpoints.com, which according to my calculations now owed me 3,400 greenpoints.
Even after my points are credited -- I am still awaiting confirmation -- my 7,900 total will not be enough to get anything I want. Neither the Dr. Talking Clock (7,200 points) nor the rugged 50-foot garden hose (7,200) nor anything else in that range really appealed to me.
I would not mind earning a free airline ticket, and I might not even lose interest before I bought the necessary 372 bathing suits -- or their equivalents. Now, if Greenpoints.com wanted to send me the equivalent value in actual stamps, I would stay up all night, licking their backs and laboriously pasting them into books.
But then, I'm sentimental.
 
That Was Then, This Is Now
 
S&H Green Stamps have been around since the 19th century but reached the height of their popularity during the 1960's. The three items at left are from the S&H catalog of 1962, when approximately 10 stamps were awarded for every $1 spent and each book required 1,200 stamps. The other items are from the Greenpoints.com Web site. The site currently awards 20 greenpoints for every dollar spent, although that figure will drop to 10 points within a few months.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Ina fit of winter restlessness, two agencies reorganize, three enter deals and two align.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
THERE has been a spate of deals this week involving agencies and companies that work with them, ranging from reorganizations to acquisitions to affiliations.
Gunderson Partners in New York, an executive recruiter and management consultant that specializes in advertising, communications and marketing, is reorganizing to improve efforts to find managers able to meet the challenges of the New Economy. 
 Gunderson is reconfiguring by naming leaders for two new divisions. Norman M. Sherman, 51, a longtime agency and media executive, becomes president for North America, overseeing operations of offices in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., and New York. Mr. Sherman has held senior posts at D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles, part of the MacManus Group unit of BDM Inc., and was most recently managing director at the Senior Network in Stamford, Conn., a marketing services company focused on consumers age 50 and older.
Also, Peter J. Fitzpatrick, 41, becomes president for the international division at Gunderson, after serving most recently as human resources director for the international operations of the American International Group.
"Our searches now are global, for people with global expertise," said Steven G. Gunderson, chief executive at Gunderson.
"Our traditional clients continue to grow," he added, "and the new players, the dot-coms, are looking for the same kind of talent." Mr. Fitzpatrick noted that Gunderson had "recently moved executives from Singapore to New York, Taipei to North Carolina, Chicago to Paris."
In another revamping, the FCB Worldwide unit of True North Communications is combining its four offices in Southern California to form a single agency with 300 employees and total billings of $450 million from clients like Hilton, Mattel and Taco Bell.
Jim Harrington, 38, who had been executive vice president and general manager at the FCB office in Costa Mesa, becomes president at FCB Southern California, working with Scott Montgomery, 50, who becomes executive vice president and executive creative director after handling those duties for FCB Costa Mesa.
Also at FCB Southern California, Thom Miller, 51, who had been executive vice president and general manager at FCB Los Angeles, will be executive vice president and general manager, and Howard Casavant, 47, who had been senior vice president and senior group creative director at FCB Los Angeles, will be executive vice president and senior group creative director.
Thom McElroy, 38, who had been president and chief creative officer at FCB McElroy in Newport Beach, will be president of that operation as it becomes part of FCB Southern California. And Bob Gale, 42, who had been senior vice president and group account director for the FCB Field Service Network in Santa Ana, handling Taco Bell, will retain those duties as the network becomes part of FCB Southern California.
FCB Southern California is seeking space in Orange County to bring together the staff members who had worked at FCB Costa Mesa, FCB Santa Ana and FCB McElroy. Employees at FCB Los Angeles will move to the El Segundo area, where Mattel is based.
Turning to acquisitions, Publicis S.A. in Paris bought DeWitt Media in New York, a media services agency with 80 employees who handle accounts with estimated billings of $400 million for clients like Bacardi, BMW, Land Rover and the National Basketball Association. Terms were not disclosed.
Gene DeWitt, 57, president and chief executive at DeWitt, will become chairman and chief executive of a new United States division of Optimedia International, the Publicis worldwide media planning and buying network; the division will handle media duties for accounts with estimated billings of $1.25 billion.
It was the second American acquisition by Publicis in a month, coming after the purchase of Fallon McElligott in Minneapolis. Publicis and a rival French agency company, Havas Advertising, which last month acquired Snyder Communications in Bethesda, Md., are aggressively stepping up acquisitions.
Speaking of which, Hawkeye Communications in New York, an agency that is forming a network of companies through a series of acquisitions, is making another one. Hawkeye, started last year by G. Steven Dapper, former chairman and chief executive of the Rapp Collins Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group, acquired the Ffwd Group in London and Haddenham, England, for undisclosed terms.
Ffwd, which stands for "Fast forward," according to Mr. Dapper, has three divisions specializing in database marketing and services for e-businesses. It is the first Hawkeye acquisition outside the United States. Colin Glossop, 41, chief executive at Ffwd, will continue in that capacity as well as help Hawkeye expand further in Europe.
In another acquisition, Omnicom, based in New York, acquired majority ownership of Millsport L.L.C. in Stamford, Conn., a sports marketing agency. Omnicom, which has owned 25 percent of Millsport since 1996, acquired an additional 35 percent for undisclosed terms.
Millsport has 60 employees and clients like GTE and Visa. Michael Birkin, 41, president at the Diversified Agency Services division of Omnicom, joins the Millsport board.
Finally, Dentsu U.S.A. in New York, part of the Japanese giant Dentsu Inc., formed a nonequity alliance with Oasis Advertising in New York. The affiliation offers worldwide resources like research to Oasis, which has 31 employees and billings estimated at $35 million from clients like Alitalia and Toyota.

HEADLINE: Economic Growth Is Still Strong, Fed Reports

BYLINE: Bloomberg News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 8

 BODY:
The economy's record expansion showed no signs of slowing in the first two months of the year and, while the pressure on wages increased, inflation did not accelerate, the Federal Reserve said today in its latest report.
"The majority of districts reported strong growth during the survey period, with the remaining reports pointing to moderate growth or continued high levels of activity," said the Fed report, informally known as the beige book. 
 The pickup in the economy has made hiring increasingly difficult. "Reports of recruitment obstacles were widespread," the Fed said. "Labor markets were very tight in most areas."
As a result, companies have been forced to raise wages for new employees, which suggests that the low unemployment rate could drive up business costs. Companies in the New York district were paying recent college graduates 10 percent to 15 percent more than they did a year earlier, the Fed said.
In addition, companies are adjusting to a smaller labor pool by paying existing workers overtime, emphasizing bonuses and other benefits and hiring senior citizens and teenagers to fill jobs once held largely by working-age adults, the Fed reported.
"The March beige book paints a clear picture of an economy straining at the seams," said Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics Ltd. in Valhalla, N.Y. "There was more detail, and a more worrying tone, to the comments on the labor market."
Demand has picked up for consumer goods like cars, furniture and electronics, and for industrial commodities like steel, oil, paper and chemicals, the Fed reported.
Still, the effect of rising labor costs on consumer prices has been restrained, the Fed said. "Despite faster wage growth for some workers, increases in the prices of final goods and services were limited over all," the report said.
Today's report will help form the basis for discussion at the March 21 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank panel that sets interest rate policy.
The committee has raised the target interest rate on overnight loans between banks a full percentage point since last June, to 5.75 percent. The increase is aimed at keeping the economy from overheating and holding inflation in check.
The Fed's regional outlook is based on reports from the Fed's 12 district banks, and is published eight times a year before the open market committee meetings. The latest edition of the beige book was compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. Information was gathered before Feb. 29.

HEADLINE: Top Tax Expert Calls for Tougher Penaltiesto Deter Corporate Cheating

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 8

 BODY:
The tough penalties Congress enacted to discourage abusive corporate tax shelters are so riddled with loopholes that they fail to deter tax cheating by large companies, Congress's top tax expert told the Senate Finance Committee today.
During the first day of hearings on tax shelters and the use of penalties and interest to discourage sham transactions, Lindy L. Paull, chief of staff for the Joint Committee on Taxation, testified that "there is not a meaningful penalty facing someone who enters these transactions." 
 She called for tightening the penalties and also for imposing penalties on professionals who prepare abusive tax returns for both individuals and companies generally at least as high as those imposed on taxpayers themselves.
Her testimony came as the proliferating use of sham transactions by large companies to evade taxes is gaining attention on Capitol Hill, which over the last five years has focused on tax cuts and criticism of the Internal Revenue Service. The concern has been stirred not only by abusive tax shelters but also by complaints by four large American insurance companies about a legal loophole that lets property and casualty insurers stop paying income taxes by moving their headquarters to Bermuda.
Senator William V. Roth Jr., the Delaware Republican who is chairman of the committee, described corporate tax shelters as a serious problem. He also said he was worried that new laws sought by the Clinton administration to crack down on sham transactions would give too much power to I.R.S. agents.
The senator, whose hearings in 1997 and 1998 on abuses by the I.R.S. led to a reorganization of that agency, said he expected it would take a long time for his committee to decide what, if anything, to do about corporate tax shelters.
One witness dismissed the idea that corporate tax shelters were a problem. Kenneth J. Kies, who was Ms. Paull's predecessor as the tax committee's chief of staff, said research by his employer, the PricewaterhouseCoopers accounting firm, found no evidence that corporate tax shelters now were any different from those a decade or more ago. He said statements by Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers and other officials that abusive tax shelters were costing the government billions of dollars a year were "totally without support."
Mr. Kies, whose firm is a leading promoter of corporate tax shelters including one that the Treasury Department closed last year after declaring it a sham, said that a more serious problem was the taxes owed by individuals and small businesses that the I.R.S. failed to collect.
Ms. Paull and Jonathan Talisman, the acting assistant Treasury secretary for tax policy, said they were troubled by the legal loophole that allowed property and casualty insurers to stop paying income taxes by moving to Bermuda. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, the ranking Democrat on the committee, mused about whether "we are entering an era of corporate expatriation" with companies moving their headquarters overseas to avoid taxes.
Ms. Paull and Mr. Talisman said their staffs were studying the Bermuda tax shelter but had not yet figured out a way to have it closed without creating other tax problems.
These two witnesses and Peter L. Faber, a prominent New York corporate tax lawyer, all described corporate tax shelters as a serious threat to the income tax system, saying that the government must halt them or contend with serious long-term revenue loss and a breakdown of popular support for the income tax system.
Mr. Faber said lawyers at his firm, McDermott Will & Emery in New York, advised 50 of the top 100 corporations on tax matters and were continually fielding questions about tax shelters being sold by investment houses, the Big Five accounting firms and law firms.
He said that promoters of tax shelters often sold "garbage" to chief financial officers, who are often not expert in tax matters and who are increasingly inclined to buy these products over the objections of company tax directors.
Referring to testimony by Mr. Kies that the amount of corporate tax revenue has been rising, except for last year when it fell 2.1 percent, Mr. Faber said: "It is no answer to say that corporate tax revenues are up or that they are a high percentage of corporate profits. Were it not for corporate tax shelters they would be higher."
Mr. Faber and Ms. Paull both said they disliked the idea, promoted by Mr. Talisman, of enacting into law the "doctrine of economic substance" in tax matters. The doctrine, created by judges in tax cases, holds that if a transaction has no purpose except to avoid taxes it lacks economic substance and can be disregarded for tax purposes.
"Congress should tread cautiously" in defining tax shelters by statute, Mr. Faber said, adding that "some aspects of the problem are better dealt with by regulations and judicial doctrines than by legislation."

HEADLINE: How McCain Can Win by Losing

BYLINE: By Michael Beschloss; Michael Beschloss, author of "Taking Charge," the first volume of a trilogy on the Lyndon Johnson tapes, is writing a history of the Lincoln assassination.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
After his losses in the Super Tuesday primaries, John McCain promised that his crusade would continue "tonight, tomorrow, the next day, the day after that."
It is that idea -- that Mr. McCain is on a mission -- that leads many to wonder in what direction the senator plans to take his campaign. Although he has pledged to support this year's nominee "no matter who our nominee is," there are suggestions that Mr. McCain might support George W. Bush only weakly or even wage a third-party campaign this fall. 
 As he pondered what to do yesterday, sequestered in his Arizona retreat, he might be tempted to look to the examples set by his three Republican patron saints -- Barry Goldwater, Ronald Reagan and Theodore Roosevelt.
Each of them faced a choice about how to handle defeat for their party's presidential nomination, and their actions during the general campaigns that followed tell us much about their commitment to their principles and to their party.
Barry Goldwater would probably advise his fellow Arizonan to campaign for the nominee but redouble his ambitions to remake the Republican Party in his own image. In 1960, Goldwater reacted just that way.
Millions of Americans were swooning over "The Conscience of a Conservative," his best-selling jeremiad against high taxes, big government and cold war detente. His popularity was so high that his name was placed in nomination for president, even though he had not campaigned in any primaries. Goldwater, however, did not think for a moment that he would be chosen as the Republican nominee; he knew that Vice President Richard Nixon had the convention locked up.
Goldwater didn't much like Nixon. He wrote to his fellow Republican William Rehnquist (now the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court) that "Dick has shown a decided tendency to drift far to the left." Privately, he called Nixon "a two-fisted, foursquare liar."
Although thought of as a firebrand, Goldwater was a party loyalist. After the vice president was nominated, he exhorted Republicans to put their "shoulders to the wheel" for Nixon.
"Let's grow up, conservatives," he commanded. "Let's, if we want to, take this party back. And I think we can someday. Let's get to work."
That fall, Goldwater made 125 speeches for Nixon. After Nixon was narrowly defeated by John Kennedy, Goldwater spoke in language that today sounds like vintage John McCain.
"We cannot win as a dime-store copy of the opposition's platform," he said. "We must be different."
Goldwater's efforts in 1960 laid the groundwork for his nomination four years later. And even though he lost to Lyndon Johnson in a landslide in 1964, his campaign was not in vain. He had started moving his party's center of gravity to the right, creating the party we know today.
Mr. Reagan's lesson to John McCain is different. In 1976, he offered pro forma support to the successful nominee, Gerald Ford, but not much more. Though usually thought of as a party man -- his Eleventh Commandment was "Thou shalt not speak ill of another Republican" -- Mr. Reagan felt little compulsion to extend himself for Mr. Ford.
Unlike Mr. McCain, Mr. Reagan had real ideological differences with his Republican opponent. Mr. Reagan had opposed President Ford out of vehement opposition to his tax and spending policies, his championing of the equal rights amendment, his supposed giveaway of the Panama Canal and the Ford-Kissinger approach to the Soviet Union. (Under this pressure, Mr. Ford stopped using the word "detente.")
The differences between the two also became personal. Mr. Reagan felt that the Ford campaign had gone over the line, painting him as an irresponsible extremist. (One television commercial said, "Governor Reagan can't start a war. President Reagan could.")
Much as Mr. McCain has complained about Governor Bush's $70 million war chest, Mr. Reagan accused Mr. Ford of using presidential perks to lure delegates -- federal subsidies and appointments, invitations to state dinners and rides on Air Force One. Mr. Reagan gibed that Mr. Ford's anthem should be not "Hail to the Chief" but "Santa Claus Is Coming to Town."
Eking out victory at the 1976 convention by only 117 votes, Mr. Ford was desperate to reunite the party. After finishing his acceptance speech, he gave Mr. Reagan the unprecedented privilege of giving the final address to the delegates. In his impromptu talk, Mr. Reagan uttered not a single word in praise of Mr. Ford, no small achievement. In fact, he did not bother to mention the president's name at all. But so spectacular was the Reagan oratory, especially in contrast to the winner's, that many delegates left the hall shaking their heads and murmuring that they had chosen the wrong man.
That fall, Mr. Reagan made speeches and commercials that were, he pointedly said, "on behalf of the Republican platform" -- a conservative document that had been forced on Mr. Ford. By keeping Mr. Ford at arm's length, Mr. Reagan put his followers on notice that they should do the same. And this diffident stance probably contributed to Mr. Ford's hairbreadth loss to Jimmy Carter. Mr. Reagan's passive-aggressive approach allowed him to come back four years later to win the nomination and the presidency.
Theodore Roosevelt took a more confrontational tack -- with drastically different results. T.R. was one of only two presidents (the other is Bill Clinton) in the 20th century to single out and campaign for a desired successor -- William Howard Taft. In exchange for this, he presumed that Taft would carry on his program of brisk social and economic reform.
But by 1912, T.R. was furious at Taft's backsliding, and he missed the glory of the presidency a lot more than he had imagined. So Roosevelt plunged into the race for the Republican nomination, casting the confrontation as the bosses versus the people. He was extraordinarily personal, calling Taft a "fathead" and a "puzzlewit" who was "dumber than a guinea pig." (Mr. McCain emulates the rhetorical part of T.R.'s tradition too.) Taft was so baffled and mortified by his old patron's opposition that he broke down and cried.
T.R. won most of the primaries, but after party regulars at the Chicago convention defeated his managers in a rules fight, T.R. won only about a third of the delegates. Roosevelt declared that by "hijacking" Republicans to win the nomination, Taft had committed a "great crime" that jeopardized "our civilization itself."
Dislodging his forces from the Republican Party, T.R. cast himself as the prince of the Progressive Party and managed that fall to win 27 percent of the vote, still a record for a third-party presidential candidate. But he handed the White House to the Democrat, Woodrow Wilson. At the age of 54, T.R. was at the end of his career, and, more important, the progressive strain in the Republican Party flickered away.
Last week, while campaigning in the New York primary, Mr. McCain told Don Imus, "I've got to do what's right for the Republican Party and the country." Now, after his losses this week, he may face the same choice that T.R., Goldwater and Ronald Reagan had. Will doing what's right mean pulling down the temple? Or will he try to make Republicans bend to his ideas on campaign finance and party inclusiveness?
Should Mr. McCain consider the courses of his three heroes, he will realize that after a convention, the vanquished can have as much opportunity to change history, for better or worse, as the victor.

HEADLINE: Out There in Never-Bell Land;
Where Phone Service Is Way Above Average, and Competitive

BYLINE: By JULIE FLAHERTY

DATELINE: RICHMOND, Mass.

 BODY:
The hand-cranked phone boxes are long gone. The party lines are, too. But the residents of tiny Richmond, a former mining town in the Berkshires, still dial the operator when they need the local news.
"Someone called to ask who picks up the trash," said Melissa Perdue, a customer care specialist with the Richmond Telephone Company, the local exchange. "We pretty much know everything about the town." 
 Richmond is in many ways not your typical phone company. Its headquarters is a green-shuttered, white clapboard house on Route 41, in far-western Massachusetts just shy of the New York border. It has 13 employees, including a one-man repair crew named Maurice. Its phone book listings are 12 pages long, representing 1,168 residents and businesses. And it has handled the calls here for 97 years.
Ethel Hanson, 82, has known no other phone company. Richmond installed her first dial phone in the 1960's and, before that, ran her parents' party line. "When I heard someone ring two long and two short, I knew that was mine," she recalled.
As archaic as it may seem, more than 1,000 small, independent phone companies like Richmond Telephone still do business, mostly in rural areas of the nation. Each incumbent, as they are known in the industry, handles as few as 60 access lines or as many as 50,000, and altogether they serve nearly five million customers. Many are family-run companies, dating to the early 1900's, that were never part of the Ma Bell system, were never bought out by competitors and were basically left to their own devices all these years.
Not that they have stayed in the dark ages of telecommunication. Richmond Telephone's old magneto switchboard was retired to a museum in Springfield, Mass., long ago, the president, Lorinda Ackley-Mazur, is quick to point out. Like many other independents, her company, with roughly 1,200 access lines, provides services like call waiting and call answering, just like Bell Atlantic, the dominant company in the Northeast, with nearly 44 million access lines. Richmond installed fiber optic cable in 1996, and last year it began Richmond NetWorx, an Internet access service. High-speed connections are also available.
"Plus we have excellent customer service," Ms. Ackley-Mazur said, a contention that is hard to refute when a first name and a street are usually all that any of the four customer-care specialists need to find an account. One customer, Patrick Hanavan, said he stopped by the Richmond Telephone offices to sign up for call answering and found the service activated by the time he made the five-minute trip home.
Another praised the prompt repairs. "They don't tell you that you have to wait when the phone gives out," said Tynia Harrington, 44, a cook at a restaurant in nearby Lenox. "They'll get right on it."
The basic rate is just $12.50 a month, but calls outside the five-square-mile Richmond service area and Pittsfield, the nearest urban area, count as long distance. That does not bother Ms. Harrington, who usually drops off her payment in person so she can chat with the employees. "I can be late on a bill," she said. "I'll say, 'Is two weeks O.K.?' And they'll say, 'That's fine.' "
Maurice Garofoli, 41, the company's sole repairman for the last 21 years, is so well known that customers often call him at home when they have trouble. Having the only repair truck in town makes him popular for other reasons, too.
"I change the light bulbs in the Town Hall, put the rope on the flag," he said good-naturedly.
Richmond Telephone was formed in 1903, when a group of town residents paid $70 each to become shareholders. Back then, about 6,000 small phone companies were started out of necessity, in areas around the country that the Bell system had overlooked as unprofitable.
"They weren't in there to make money," said Martha Silver, a spokeswoman for the Organization for the Promotion and Advancement of Small Telephone Companies, a Washington-based trade group. "Many of them, 100 years ago, they were farmers. They were in many ways pioneers." Eventually, through mergers and consolidations, largely since 1950, the numbers dwindled.
Now, as phone service becomes an increasingly important economic factor to even the most rural places, little telephone companies that serve out-of-the-way communities are finding themselves in demand by new business. A village in Maine is now home to a credit card call center; a Midwest farm town can employ dozens of residents as telemarketers.
The town of Richmond, with its pastoral setting, has attracted its share of business people, mostly telecommuters, and Richmond Telephone is setting up more and more home offices. Last September, Mr. Hanavan, 33, forsook San Francisco for the quiet of a five-acre farm here, but he still dials in to his employer in Seattle through dedicated fax, modem and computer lines.
"Coming here I was a bit nervous," said Mr. Hanavan, the director of East Coast sales for SpotTaxi.com, the Web site of Central Media Inc., an audio distributor. "Then Maurice came over and hooked me up. I'm not missing a beat."
Richmond Telephone bills itself on the cover of its slim blue phone book as "the small company with big connections," and Ms. Ackley-Mazur says that is not an illusion of grandeur. In January, the company burst out of its comfortable niche to offer local, long-distance and Internet service to all of Berkshire County, a market of about 42,000 access lines, essentially putting itself head to head with Bell Atlantic. For now, Richmond Telephone is leasing Bell Atlantic lines and providing long-distance services in partnership with GFC Communications of Albany.
The direct competition, said John H. Johnson, a spokesman for Bell Atlantic, is "good for consumers and it represents growth in the industry." It also serves another important purpose, as Bell Atlantic needs to show that its market is open to competition as it awaits federal approval to move into the long-distance market in Massachusetts.
Rex G. Mitchell, an analyst for Banc of America Securities, said many rural telephone companies, already set up to serve the more costly low-population areas, are finding that they can branch out into neighboring towns without much added expense. That is a result of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which allowed federal regulators to push down the cost of leasing phone lines to jump-start competition.
Independents that do not grow seem headed for consolidation, he said, as the swirl of acquisitions and mergers in the telecommunications industry has affected the rural areas. The former Bell companies have not shown much interest because arcane regulations make such acquisitions too costly. But consolidators, companies that specialize in acquiring telecommunications businesses in rural markets, have been snapping up local access lines at $2,400 to $5,000 each.
Ms. Ackley-Mazur is aware of the big money involved. Two years ago, when she was acting president and general manager for the Taconic Telephone Corporation of nearby Chatham, N.Y., a concern her grandfather founded in 1908, the company was acquired by MJD Communications Inc. of Charlotte, N.C., a consolidator, for $67.5 million. Taconic had grown to have more than 24,000 access lines and interests in cellular, wireless and cable. Divesting, she said, was the most profitable move for Taconic's 240 shareholders.
Still, Ms. Silver, the trade group spokeswoman, said she expected most small incumbents to retain their independence for some time; only about 20 or 30 are sold each year, she said, usually when no one wants to take the helm of the family business.
As for Richmond Telephone, Ms. Ackley-Mazur said she had made it clear that she wanted to expand the company, not sell it. For one thing, she likes keeping the business in the family, the way it has been since her father, J. Benedict Ackley, bought it from the remaining 22 shareholders in 1961. He is still chairman and still regularly goes over the books.
Despite her small-town surroundings, Ms. Ackley-Mazur is as closed-lipped as the president of any private company. She would not comment about the company's finances except to say that the established telephone part of the business was profitable. She would not even say what her father paid for the company 40 years ago. "I know he borrowed the money from his mother," she said. "His father wouldn't give it to him."
And yet another generation seems set in place. Ms. Ackley-Mazur's daughter, Catherine Dullaghan, was also raised in the phone business. She dropped off phone books at age 14 and flagged traffic for the repair truck and installed cable during her college breaks. Now 26 and a business school graduate, she manages marketing and customer care.
"It really wasn't a decision for me," she said. "I just knew I was going to be here."

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC SCENE;
Is the relationship between inflation and unemployment a curve or more of an economics knuckleball?

BYLINE: By J. Bradford DeLong

 BODY:
WHATEVER happened to the Phillips curve?
You remember the Phillips curve, the relationship between unemployment and inflation proposed by the British economist A. W. Phillips late in the 1950's and developed into its present form in the late 1960's by Edward Phelps and Milton Friedman. 
 For more than 25 years mainstream economists' forecasts have rested on the idea that should unemployment fall below an unknown (but very real) level called the natural rate of unemployment, then inflation would start to rise. And inflation would keep rising further until unemployment climbed back to or above its natural rate.
Today, however, the Phillips curve is missing. All of a sudden, economists are a lot less useful as forecasters. For as it stands now, economists' forecasts of economic growth, unemployment and inflation are no longer projections based on historical patterns but, instead, pure guesses based on gut feelings about when, how and if the Phillips curve will return.
If economists are to be of any use for forecasting, they need to come up with a better -- and probably more complex -- theory about inflation.
When last seen during the 1990-92 recession, the Phillips curve looked very healthy. In the second half of the 1980's the unemployment rate fell to a low of 5.3 percent in 1989 and inflation, which had averaged 2.4 percent a year in 1984-87, picked up to 4.1 percent a year and rising by early 1990.
Back then the Federal Open Market Committee -- under the leadership of Alan Greenspan, who was relatively new as chairman at the time -- reacted sharply by pushing up interest rates. Tighter monetary policy and the shock to expectations from the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait caused total spending to fall. Unemployment rose above its natural rate to a peak of 7.6 percent in June 1992. And inflation fell.
No one at the end of the 1980's knew exactly what the natural rate of unemployment was. But even the most optimistic did not think it could be lower than 5.5 percent, and even the most pessimistic knew it could be no higher than 6.5 percent. Still, the end of the 1980's retaught the lesson that the Phillips curve was very real and had to be taken into account.
That is why officials in the Clinton administration and the Federal Reserve, as well as independent analysts, bit their fingernails throughout the 1990's as they awaited the return of rising inflation. By 1994 unemployment -- at 6.1 percent -- was in the range where inflation had started to accelerate in the late 1980's, so the Fed spoke of undertaking pre-emptive strikes against inflation.
Yet no inflation followed. By 1996 the unemployment rate was as low as it had ever been in the 1980's. Yet inflation fell to less than 2 percent a year. By 1999 unemployment was at 4.2 percent -- well below anyone's previous estimate of the natural rate -- yet inflation was an even-lower 1.5 percent.
Where was the Phillips curve? There was confidence until the end of 1997 that the Phillips curve would soon return. Temporary special factors -- health care costs, rapid falls in computer prices and so on -- were momentarily retarding the tendency of inflation to rise when unemployment was lower than its natural rate.
Such factors could not last forever, could they? Of course not. So when their influence came to an end, inflation would begin its rise. But years passed, and inflation did not rise.
So mainstream economists' opinion shifted to the belief that the natural rate of unemployment had fallen, though how far no one really knew.
Economists began spinning theories of what had caused the natural rate to fall. James Medoff of Harvard began arguing in the early 1990's that technological and organizational changes had led the labor market to do a better job of matching workers needing jobs to vacancies, thus substantially lowering the natural rate. Others pointed to faster productivity growth that allowed higher wage increases to be consistent with relative price stability. Still others pointed to workers' fears for their jobs generated by the memory of the recession and widespread layoffs of the early 1990's.
Still, at some primal level, economists continue to believe in something like a Phillips curve. They believe that unemployment will fall if demand expands faster than the economy's long-run productive capacity. And they believe that if demand keeps expanding faster than the economy's long-run productive capacity, then in the long run, inflation will rise.
It is just, they kept saying, that the natural rate of unemployment -- the signal that this long run had arrived -- has fallen mysteriously far and mysteriously fast.
But, truth be told, the Phillips curve has not worked well outside America. Only in the United States has there been a relatively stable natural rate of unemployment to serve as a reliable indicator of when demand pressure is about to raise inflation. Elsewhere, the causes of rising inflation have always been too complex to be summarized by simply comparing unemployment to even a semistable natural rate.
And even in the United States, as Douglas Staiger, Mark Watson and James H. Stock pointed out in the Journal of Economic Perspectives, the Phillips curve relationship was never as strong or as good at forecasting inflation as was taught in intermediate macroeconomics.
Thus perhaps the surprising thing is not that forecasts of inflation based on the Phillips curve have gone awry the last half decade. Perhaps the surprising thing is that the complicated economic processes determining changes in inflation could be summarized for so long by such a simple relationship as the standard Phillips curve.
In any event, it is now clear that the simple theory of the relation between inflation and unemployment that economists have peddled for a quarter-century no longer works. If economists are to be of any use, they need to come up with a better -- and in all likelihood more sophisticated -- approach to understanding why inflation rises.

It used to be an accepted doctrine in economics that periods of low unemployment would create upward pressure on prices. But, the 1990's have challenged conventional wisdom by combining both low joblessness and low inflation.

HEADLINE: Old Wall St. Firm Seeks Aid for Battery Park City Move

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Brown Brothers Harriman & Company, the country's oldest and largest private commercial bank, is negotiating to move to Battery Park City from its headquarters on Wall Street, where it has been since 1843.
The bank, the epitome of an old money, white-shoe firm, has asked state and city officials for tax breaks and a special land deal to build a 23-story glass tower on the waterfront just north of the New York Mercantile Exchange, according to real estate executives. Although Brown Brothers Harriman would take only about half the space in the proposed building, it wants to put its name on the 740,000-square-foot tower. 
 Like many other banks, Brown Brothers has threatened to move some employees to Jersey City if it cannot strike a deal in Manhattan. The bank has 850 employees at its mahogany-paneled offices at 63 Wall Street and 550 more at the Newport Office Tower in Jersey City.
According to people involved in the talks, city and state officials are divided over whether to give Brown Brothers Harriman the land and subsidies, although all sides agree that there is little vacant office space available in Manhattan.
Radford W. Klotz, a Brown Brothers Harriman partner, confirmed that the bank was considering a move to Battery Park City. He said the bank might stay at its current location and send more employees to Jersey City. He declined to discuss the status of his negotiations with the state and the city, as did Michael G. Carey, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation.
The bank was formed in Philadelphia in 1818 by Alexander Brown, a member of a family of importers of Irish linen. His brother, James Brown, opened a branch in New York seven years later, and moved to Wall Street in 1843. The bank helped reorganize the nation's chaotic railroad network during the late 1800's. Two years after the 1929 market crash, Brown Brothers merged with the private banks of another old family led by W. Averell Harriman, who was later governor of New York from 1955 to 1958.
Although the bank has looked at other downtown locations, like 140 Broadway (near Liberty Street), it has focused on what may be its most expensive option: Battery Park City. The bank has hired a real estate adviser, Insignia/ESG, and an architect, Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum, and solicited proposals from a dozen developers, including Brookfield Properties, Tishman-Speyer Properties, the Durst Organization and the Minskoff Organization.
According to the schematic plans, the project would entail a 23-story building on a site bound by River Terrace and North End Avenue, between Murray and Vesey Streets.
But getting to Battery Park City, 92 acres of parks, museums, office buildings and residential towers, may be no small feat. Under the master plan for Battery Park City, the site is designated for an apartment house, not a commercial building. The Battery Park City Authority would have to abandon its plans to auction the site to the highest bidder. The authority has provided the city with more than $200 million in revenues in the last 10 years.
But in a potential deal at Battery Park City, Brown Brothers Harriman wants to pay far less than the $975,000 a year in rent that Rockrose Development will pay for a similar residential parcel nearby, according to two people who have talked with the bank. The bank is also seeking sales tax breaks. Mr. Carey of the development agency is in favor of the deal, but some government officials are balking at subsidizing Brown Brothers Harriman.
"This is a very valuable piece of property," said one official involved in the negotiations. "Why shouldn't we see what other developers will pay rather than sole-source it to Brown Brothers?"
Budget watchdogs and urban planners have criticized the Giuliani administration for giving more than $2 billion in tax breaks, grants and other incentives to 50 corporations, most of them financial and media companies. These often unnecessary deals, they say, shift the tax burden to small and medium-size companies, while depriving the city of badly needed tax revenue.
"Many companies can't find space and can't deal with the rising rents, but only a few have the entree to City Hall to get these tax breaks," said Jonathan Bowles, chief researcher for the Center for an Urban Future. "It doesn't make sense to pick out a handful of companies and give them financial assistance. Is Brown Brothers more deserving than some dot-com company?"
But some downtown landlords contend that the deal with Brown Brothers Harriman would result in the construction of a building that could provide some much-needed space for companies that might otherwise move to New Jersey. The vacancy rate for prime downtown office space has dropped to 7.5 percent from 23.1 percent in 1996, Insignia/ ESG says. More space could open up, however, if Chase Bank moves out of 52 Broadway, as many real estate brokers expect.
"There is no place to go downtown," said Michael T. Cohen of GVA Williams Real Estate. "It doesn't matter how big or small you are, you're in trouble."

Shake-Up of Stocks in Key British Market Index

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: LONDON, March 8

 BODY:
The biggest shake-up in the benchmark British stock market index was announced today as nine highflying technology and related issues replaced "old economy" laggards including brewers, utilities and building-material companies.
The changeover, which takes effect on March 20, adds Internet, telecommunications and biotechnology companies to the Financial Times Stock Exchange index -- the FTSE 100. As in United States markets, these businesses have soared in value as investors shift from slow-growing "bricks and mortar" concerns to technology-driven companies. 
 Paradoxically, many of the brightest technology stocks fell today as investors took profits.
Securing a place in the premier index will provide the newcomers a strong following from major financial institutions and tracker funds.
New entrants include the Internet service provider Freeserve P.L.C. and Cable and Wireless Communications, both of which benefited from a rules change allowing subsidiaries of listed companies. Other entrants include the Scottish telecommunications group Thus P.L.C., the hand-held computer devices company Psion P.L.C., the Web security company Baltimore Technologies and the Celltech Group, the first biotechnology company to make the FTSE 100. The remaining three newcomers are the publisher Emap; the Capita Group, an outsourcing company, and a health care group and gene mapper, Nycomed Amersham.
Companies being deleted are the food and beverages concerns Whitbread, Scottish and Newcastle, Associated British Foods and Allied Domecq; the utilities PowerGen and Thames Water; the building materials groups Hanson and Wolseley, and the Imperial Tobacco Group.
