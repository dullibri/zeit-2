HEADLINE: It's Sunday Afternoon and Here Come the Blahs

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER

 BODY:
It is Sunday afternoon, sometime past 3 o'clock.
The weekend hourglass is spilling its treasure. Only Sunday night remains before the Monday-morning blahs -- return to the office, school or work. 
 Imperceptibly at first, then unmistakably, there is company.
The Sunday blues have dropped by for a visit.
 
Flip Side of TGIF
 It's the flip side of TGIF (thank God, it's Friday). The weekend, which started with such bright promise, is now inexorably rolling toward a conclusion. Even if things are going right, those Sunday blues have mysteriously reappeared, bringing mild depression, echoes of loneliness, or a twinge of malaise or melancholy.
Not everyone gets them, and it is impossible to quantify how many people do, but the anecdotal evidence is there. If people are asked whether they have a downward mood swing by late Sunday afternoon, chances are they will recognize the symptoms and confess that the visitation shows up like clockwork.
Some researchers say the problem result from the resetting of internal biological clocks after weekend disruptions of sleep patterns and activity.
Unsure that something as vague as the Sunday blues is a verifiable complaint, scientists nonetheless can extrapolate from weekend behavior to try to explain its occurrence.
The most likely culprit, they speculate, is the imbalance between weekend sleep-wake cycles and the internal biological clock set by evolution to the cycle of day and night. These scientists, chronobiologists, say that mood shifts on Sunday afternoon or blahs on Monday are not surprising because people usually stay up later and rise later on weekends. Such disruptions can confuse the control center in the brain that is wired in some primordial shop.
"The demands made upon the circadian pacemaker by weekend behavior and sleep-wake cycle changes may affect mood," said Dr. Charles Czeisler, a professor at Harvard who specializes in sleep disorders. "No one knows the mechanism or, in fact, if it occurs at all, but there is a lot of writing in medical literature that it may take place."
With some people, sleep-wake cycles over the weekend are so altered that by the time the alarm goes off Monday at 6 A.M. the brain (and therefore the body) reacts as if it were 4 A.M.
 
A Sense of Dread
 With the end to summer vacations, the opening of school, and the excitement or gloom that accompanies turning Sundays over to doubleheader and tripleheader football, comes a deepening awareness of this phenomenon.
For some the answer to Sunday blues may be all too obvious.
They hate work. They hate school. They hate housework. Like Garfield, the cartoon cat, they loathe Mondays and a sense of dread envelops them by Sunday afternoon.
Dr. Herbert J. Freudenberger, a Manhattan psychoanalyst who has written books on situational anxiety and job burnout, said: "I hear about it from patients who are very unhappy in their jobs, who fear going to the office on Monday morning to prove themselves all over again. It has increased in recent years because of the unpredictability of what's happening to the economy."
 
Blues Come to Happy People, Too
 That doesn't explain why Margery Komninos, a 36-year-old computer programs manager in Denver who loves her job and her husband, slips into a Rocky Mountain low on Sunday afternoons.
"I never really thought about the reason for the Sunday blues, but there's no question something happens to me that drags my energy and mood down even when I'm having a good weekend," she said. "It doesn't happen on Saturday -- just Sundays."
Mary Aloe, a 29-year-old publicity agent in Los Angeles, gets it too. "People need to know they're not alone in this," she said. "I've mentioned to my friends what happens to me on Sundays and they say: 'Oh my gosh, is that what it is? I've got the same thing.' "
"Things might be going real well in life, and this empty feeling grips you, a form of depression or sadness or stress, and you can't shake it," she said. "I have no scientific evidence, but it seems more prevalent among women. I ask men if they experience it and they say, 'What are you talking about?' "
 
At Nap Time, a Window
 Highly organized personalities, like nature, abhor a vacuum, and such people may feel lost noodling around in unstructured expanses of time. Sunday may be the longest stretch of unscheduled time they encounter in a week.
Saturdays in most American households tend to be filled with shopping, errands, chores, exercise and socializing. Sundays bring a more leisurely pace. Some people sleep in. Some go to church. Many drift through brunch, the newspapers and try to plan the rest of the day.
Midafternoon, when thoughts of a nap beckon, is the window of opportunity for the blues. Subtle memories, perhaps from childhood, slip past the drowsy veil as defense mechanisms falter. Or the mind may track ahead to the week's burdens. Or back to the triumphs or disappointments of the weekend.
"Some people have difficulty being alone with their memories or can't stand mulling over their lives," said Dr. Thomas Wehr, a psychiatrist at the National Institutes of Mental Health. "They suffer a form of existential angst."
Other researchers suggest that those in stressful jobs suffer withdrawal after two days of weekend rest. The body may relax, but the brain is demanding adrenaline, they say.
Still others say the Sunday letdown has all the earmarks of withdrawal from caffeine by workers who taper off their coffee intake on weekends.
Those who stay up and drink too much on weekends do not need expert advice on why they feel out of sorts on Sunday. Abuse of alcohol and other drugs can turn Sundays into a land of the living dead, compounding any existing physical or emotional complaint.
 
A Price for Weekend Leisure
 While scant scientific study has been made of the Sunday blues and Monday blahs, a suspicion has lingered that weekend leisure carries a price. Monday's reputation is supported by statistics showing that suicides peak on that day, 12 percent higher than the average for the rest of the week, according to figures compiled by the United States Public Health Service in 1989. Saturday is usually the low and Sunday is about average.
Sandor Ferenczi, a Hungarian psychiatrist, in a 1919 paper entitled "Sunday Neuroses" reported a weekly resurfacing of repressed memories among his patients. Others over the years have noted neurotic behavior associated with the weekend and have attributed it to the new leisure won by the working classes, declining church attendance or loss of faith.
The biblical proscription against work on the Sabbath in the Judeo-Christian tradition made Saturdays or Sundays special through the centuries, but that did not always translate into a day of rest for the faithful.
Modern trends have elevated the weekend to a special status separate from relgious observance.
Witold Rybczynski in his book "Waiting for the Weekend" (Viking Press, 1991) says: "The weekend has imposed a rigid schedule on our free time, which can result in a sense of urgency that is at odds with relaxation. The weekly rush to the cottage is hardly leisurely, nor is the compression of various recreational activities into the two-day break."
Those who escape cities for the country on a summer weekend may find the thought of clawing their way back through Sunday night traffic depressing.
Rory Stockel, a 34-year-old production assistant for Home Box Office in New York, said she and four friends formed a club to have dinner, play games or go to the movies together on Sunday evenings to avoid the blues. "I thought it was a condition of being single and living in a studio," she said. "Now I'm married and I still have it. I know part of it is anxiety about the coming week and if I have enough clothes to wear, things like that. But it is also a lonely, empty, sad kind of thing that grabs me every Sunday about 3 o'clock."
People have been routinely disturbing their circadian rhythms ever since the light bulb was invented a century ago. Instead of going to sleep when the sun sets, as humans did through the ages, modern workers stay up late, then roust themselves from bed with an alarm. Most visibly affected are shift workers, who radically alter their sleep patterns, but even 9-to-5 workers pay a price in sleep deprivation.
On weekends the tendency is to stay up even later on Friday and Saturday nights and catch up on sleep Saturday and Sunday mornings. The body clock resets to the new timetable, but not completely, according to chronobiologists.
Daylight is still a potent signal to the internal body clock that regulates hormones, temperature, blood pressure and other functions.
 
Rhythms for the 7-Day Week
 Perhaps the most intriguing thought comes from Dr. Franz Halberg of the University of Minnesota's Chronobiological Laboratories. Dr. Halberg, 73 years old, who is considered the father of chronobiology, says he has found significant evidence, yet to be published, of seven-day rhythms in humans.
The seven-day week, alone among the components of the calendar, has always been thought to be a product of divine instruction or social convention, not set by natural phenomenons as the day, month or year are.
Dr. Halberg said he is convinced that body rhythms of approximately seven days might be the force that impelled mankind toward the seven-day week.
"I believe we can now demonstrate, with the help of computer analysis, overwhelming evidence that there are seven-day rhythms produced by nature," Dr. Halberg said. "They are in our genes, and it is very big news."

HEADLINE: AREA JOBLESSNESS CONTINUES TO RISE

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO

 BODY:
August unemployment in New York City neared double-digit levels and reached its highest mark in seven years, 9.3 percent, according to the Labor Department.
The number of unemployed was 50 percent higher than the level a year earlier and was also significantly higher than the city's July jobless rate, 8.8 percent. 
 Unemployment in all of New York State rose to 7.5 percent in August from 7.1 percent the month before, and in New Jersey to 6.7 percent in August from 6.3 percent. The state figures are seasonally adjusted; the rate for the city is not.
August unemployment rates were not available for Connecticut; the July jobless rate was 6.6 percent, up from 5.9 percent in June.
Nationally, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for August was 6.8 percent, the same as in July.
Unemployment in New York City rose to 306,000 in August, from 205,000, or 6.2 percent, in August 1990, according to the Labor Department. Three-fifths of the jobless said they had lost their jobs. A year ago, that margin was about one-half.
 
Women and Teen-Agers
 Meanwhile, the New York City employment rate, another key factor for measuring economic health, dropped by 100,000 people in the last year.
Declining employment across the state reflects a leveling off in the number of women entering the job market, the Labor Department numbers showed. Women were the largest-growing segment in the market during the 1980's.
"It's not the statistics that trouble us; it's our worries about the people behind those statistics," said a spokesman for Mayor David N. Dinkins, John H. Beckman. "Each month that we hear discouraging or bad news about unemployment offers more compelling reasons for Federal anti-recession legislation, and we hope that the Congress and the White House, will be attentive and responsive."
Another factor for the employment drop was the number of teen-agers in the job market. That number fell by 60,000 this year, a sign that members of the post-Baby Boom generation is moving into their late teens. The summer job market for the state was also the weakest in nine years.
In New Jersey, unemployment increased from 4.9 percent a year ago, up by about 200,000. Employment levels in the state also dropped by about 100,000 people.

HEADLINE: Dinkins's Plan to Incinerate Draws Environmentalists' Ire

BYLINE: By ALLAN R. GOLD

 BODY:
Environmental groups in New York City are reacting to Mayor David N. Dinkins's decision to build trash incinerators with a sense of betrayal and a determination to fight any waste disposal plan that includes the burning of garbage, leaders for the groups say.
The groups are saying that they will do whatever they can legally and politically to block the move to incinerators. Given their track record of holding up projects that they oppose on environmental grounds, this shift almost guarantees a continuation of the stalemate on solid waste policy that occurred during the Koch administration, which wanted to build as many as eight new incinerators. 
 Even leaders of environmental groups that were willing to support a limited amount of incineration say they have now changed their minds because they no longer believe the Dinkins administration's promises about recycling. Instead, the administration must first introduce a broad recycling program and prove that recycling alone cannot address the city's trash problems, they say.
Influential environmental groups like the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Environmental Defense Fund and the New York Public Interest Research Group have banded together to oppose the incineration proposal. Borough Presidents Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan and Howard Golden of Brooklyn were among several elected officials who expressed bitterness and disappointment at the Dinkins administration's decision.
 
'Cynical Politics'
 They all said that the Mayor's credibility on this issue has been greatly eroded, although his campaign speechespromised only to delay a decision until 1993.
"This plan repudiates everything that had been told to us by mayoral candidate Dinkins and suggests that cynical politics as usual is the engine driving this decision," said Rabbi David Niederman, executive director of United Jewish Organizations of Williamsburg, where the construction of an incinerator at the Brooklyn Navy Yard has long been under consideration.
The groups also complained that the Sanitation Department wasted the time of citizens who advised it on developing a solid waste disposal plan. After months of consultation, "the department has decided that it knew the answer all along -- resurrecting from its files an ill-conceived conclusion reached long ago by the Koch administration: burn it," the three environmental groups said in a statement.
Any plan that includes incineration that fails to maximize recycling is "dead in the water," said James T. B. Tripp, counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund, a group that has previously been open to incineration.
 
'People Are Livid'
 In particular, what has infuriated many elected officials, community groups and environmentalists is a sense that the city is prepared to make incineration its main disposal approach before giving recycling a fair try. The current recycling program has been enfeebled by budget cutbacks and a host of management and operating problems.
"At a time when recycling is getting peanuts, people are livid that the administration would even float the idea of a billion dollars worth of incinerators," said Eric A. Goldstein, a lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental organization.
The conflict over solving the disposal problem is occurring while space at the only remaining city landfill is running out and other states are increasingly reluctant to allow imports of other people's trash.
The environmentalists' backlash came about after a statement last Thursday by Sanitation Commissioner Steven M. Polan that the city could recycle only 25 percent of its residential trash and would eventually have to burn about two-thirds.
In testimony before a state legislative hearing on solid waste, Mr. Polan said additional recycling would prove too costly because markets had not developed enough to absorb some kinds of trash and the city did not have enough space for the necessary recycling-related operations. In addition, incineration is the least costly disposal technique, he said.
 
29 of 59 Districts
 Two and a half years after the city's mandatory recycling law took effect, just 29 of 59 community districts have some curbside recycling. Budget cuts beginning last November froze expansion into the remaining districts and have left a barebones program with a 6 percent citywide recycling rate. Also, the Sanitation Department failed to meet its legal daily average tonnage target for recyclables last April.
The program barely survived budget cuts last July, and questions remain about whether money will be found to save it for the second half of the fiscal year.
Under the Mayor's proposal, which Mr. Polan described as preliminary, two or three incinerators would have to be built, and three existing plants would be expanded. In total, the incinerators would handle 10,000 tons a day, about two-thirds of the city's residential tonnage.
But the environmental groups say a fully financed recycling program must be allowed to operate for several years before a conclusion should be reached on incineration. Residential recycling levels can easily exceed 25 percent, they say, and can reach 60 percent or higher.
 
Open to Other Strategies
 Building incinerators "puts a ceiling on the amount of recycling the city is willing to do," said Larry Shapiro, toxics project counsel for the New York Public Interest Group, a longtime opponent of incinerators.
In an interview on Friday, Mr. Polan said he would be open to other strategies before the city's solid waste plan is submitted to the state's Department of Environmental Conservation after public hearings in November and December. Acceptance of a plan is a prerequisite for building any incinerator or recycling center.
"If there's a way to do this with more recycling and less burning that is feasible and cost-effective, I'd be all for it," he said.
For now, though, the department has concluded that there must be somen incineration.
"Whether you recycle 25 percent or 35 percent or more, there's still going to be a residual that needs to be burned," he said.
Those who advocate delaying incinerator construction to see how far recycling can go are pretending a problem does not exist, Mr. Polan said.
"We cannot afford to risk the economy of New York on uncertain markets and uncertain projections," he said.

HEADLINE: Study Finds Sex Bias in Connecticut Legal System

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Sept. 7

 BODY:
A task force study has concluded that sex bias pervades the Connecticut legal system, extending to judges who whistle at female lawyers, offend them with suggestive remarks and sometimes make sexual advances on them.
Three years in the making, the 200-page report is replete with insulting remarks reported by female members of the Connecticut bar. The task force, commissioned in 1987 by Chief Justice Ellen A. Peters of the Connecticut Supreme Court, also said that female lawyers are less likely to get lucrative case referrals or judicial appointments than men. 
 "Women are treated differently from men in the justice system and, because of it, many suffer from unfairness, embarrassment, emotional pain, professional deprivation and economic hardship," the study concluded.
 
Wolf Whistling
 One judge publicly complained about the "feminization of the public defenders' office" and said that women are unable to handle criminal clients roughly, pushing them up against a wall, for example. As a result, the judge said, these cases are not handled properly.
The report said that another judge had "wolf whistled" at a passing female lawyer during lunch break.
A prosecutor responding to a female defense counsel's request to examine a rape victim's clothing said, "Do you want to try them on?"
And a judge speaking to a female lawyer in a courthouse hallway, in front of several male colleagues, used crude language in stating that the woman would be as busy on a certain case as a bride "on her wedding night."
The report also said that female lawyers are sometimes subjected to sexual advances by judges, other lawyers and court personnel.
None of these instances resulted in disciplinary action because the task force did not ask for names from the lawyers who reported the remarks.
Superior Court Judge Francis X. Hennessy, a co-chairman of the task force, said the group feared that lawyers would be reluctant to come forward with instances of improper behavior or remarks if they were asked to give names. Judge Hennessy said future complaints of such behavior could result in punishment.
 
Loss of Credibility Seen
 "Treating a woman in this manner undermines her ability to function properly in the system because the woman loses credibility in the eyes of her client and even in the eyes of the court," Judge Hennessy said at a news conference at the State Supreme Court building on Thursday. "Gender bias breeds unfair treatment and unfair results."
Justice Peters said that some of these instances of offensive remarks were the result of ignorance and insensitivity rather than maliciousness.
"This problem is pervasive throughout our society," Justice Peters said. She added that the task force's conclusion that bias pervades the judicial system was "no surprise."
Today, 18 of 150 trial judges on the Superior Court are women. Women have 1 of 9 judgeships on the Appellate Court, 1 of 7 on the Supreme Court and 42 of 133 on the Probate Court.
Sex bias in the judicial system is not confined to the courtroom, the study said. A lawyer in the New Haven area told the task force that the Judicial Selection Commission routinely asked female candidates: "How does your husband feel about you seeking a judgeship?" and "How will you handle your children or having a baby if a judgeship is given to you?"
A survey of lawyers and judges confirmed a tendency -- documented in other studies -- to give women lighter sentences. One exception was among female juvenile delinquents, who tend to spend more time in detention than boys because judges believe they need more protection, the report found.
Recommendations by the task force include: changing the language in judicial rule books and codes of conduct to make them "gender-neutral"; providing courses on sex bias for judges, lawyers and other participants in the judicial system, and condemning and punishing sexist conduct by judges, lawyers and other court officials.

HEADLINE: Fortress Cuba, Lonely Cuba

 BODY:
Stunned by events in Moscow, Fidel Castro now talks of a "zero option": Cuban socialism will carry on alone, even without Soviet aid. "Whatever happens in the Soviet Union," blusters the party newspaper, "we will not move away from the path we have chosen. We will continue with our independent, Cuban, socialist line."
But who is "we"? Not once since seizing power in 1959 has Mr. Castro submitted his reign to electoral judgment. Like other Communist fortresses in China, North Korea and Vietnam, Cuba has scorned democratizing reforms. And who is the "we" responsible for Cuba's colonialist dependence on a no-longer-willing foreign partner? Mr. Castro. 
 For three decades, Cuban socialism has been propped up by Soviet subsidies, roughly $3.5 billion last year. Under complex barter arrangements, Moscow has overpaid for sugar, while providing nearly all of Cuba's oil and three-fourths of its imports. Now fuel shipments are lagging and a collapsing Soviet state can no longer afford what Boris Yeltsin describes as foreign charity.
During fat years, Cuba did little to anticipate this eventuality. In the 1960's, a French journalist, K. S. Karol, asked whether the Russians might someday cut back on Cuban sugar. Mr. Castro saw no reason why Moscow would not buy Cuban sugar "when their own sugar used to sell for three times the price of ours. Of course, political factors may come in, but so far the Russians have never resorted to economic blackmail."
Other Cubans with more foresight urged diversification. When the first sugar agreement with Moscow was signed in January 1964, Nikita Khrushchev promised to provide a miraculous cane-cutting machine; it proved comically unworkable. The reality of the sugar pact was tersely expressed by Carlos Franqui, a defecting veteran of the Sierra Maestra:
"In the old days, the difference between the market price and the price the United States paid for sugar was called the differential, and what it did was to guarantee a market for our product. Now we were doing the same thing; we were tied to the same monoculture and the same single market, only this time with the Russians."
By then, Mr. Castro had reshaped Cuban politics on the one-party Soviet model, eliminating the check of independent criticism. Slogans and incantation replaced debate as Mr. Castro played the world leader, sending armies to Angola and Ethiopia and backstopping Soviet policy everywhere. Now, with the collapse of Communism, slogans can no longer conceal Cuba's poverty, isolation and humbling dependence.
For Cubans, the cruel result is hardship and hunger even if Moscow buys sugar at reduced prices. Some U.S. cold warriors remain eager to meddle in Cuban affairs in an effort to topple Mr. Castro. But the Cuban dictator has painted himself into his own corner. Fidel Castro's reign deserves to end in home-grown failure, not martyrdom.

HEADLINE: Judge Thomas Takes the Stand

 BODY:
After a summer of wrangling over what Clarence Thomas believes and what his Supreme Court nomination portends, the judge will present himself on Tuesday to the Senate Judiciary Committee. On political grounds alone, his prospects for approval are thought to be good. But his voluminous written record leaves him with much to explain and the burden of proving that he will protect some treasured civil rights and liberties.
The senators, too, will be on public trial; the quality of their questions will reveal whether they are both eager and competent to fulfill their constitutional role as a full partner in the appointment process. Contrary to theories that the Senate's "advice and consent" role is limited to measuring a nominee's technical fitness, the confirmation power is as broad as the President's power to nominate. No less than the chief executive, the senators can weigh policy and ideology. 
 Here are some key areas to explore:
Legal qualifications. The senators can test for themselves whether Judge Thomas, an accomplished, personable lawyer who now sits on the Federal Court of Appeals in Washington, is the best-qualified candidate in the land, as President Bush claims, or simply "qualified," as the American Bar Association concluded. If the latter, they must ask themselves if "qualified" is good enough.
Family background. The senators can give great or little weight to the fact that Judge Thomas has experienced both poverty and prejudice against black Americans. President Bush rightly boasts that his nominee would bring racial and economic diversity to an upper-middle-class institution. Yet senators must explore the significance of his experience. Does his background suggest a special understanding of poor blacks and empathy for their needs? Or does it suggest that he has distanced himself from their problems?
For example, why did Mr. Thomas cite his sister, still stuck in rural Georgia, as a prime example of the national problem of welfare dependency? "She gets mad when the mailman is late with the welfare check," he was quoted as telling a conference of black conservatives. "That's how dependent she is."
Civil rights. Senators may legitimately ask whether the nominee's repeated challenges to some forms of affirmative action -- the kind of stand that made him attractive to the White House -- make him the right person for the high court in its current turmoil over civil rights issues.
As chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Mr. Thomas rightly stressed the need to do justice to individual victims of race, sex and other discrimination. But he also disparaged attempts to provide broad-based relief that would efficiently bring more minorities into the work force without requiring each beneficiary to prove that specific acts of bias had held him or her back.
His posture is mystifying because Mr. Thomas himself appears to have been a deserving beneficiary of an affirmative action program at Yale University that expedited his entry into the law school and gave him a chance to earn his degree. The senators must ask how Judge Thomas really feels about group remedies for discrimination and whether his approach fits the needs of the nation at this point in its social development.
Natural law. It is crucial for the Judiciary Committee to discover what Clarence Thomas means by his frequent praise of "natural law" as a judicial resource for constitutional review. He has commented many times in favor of applying a "higher" law than the written Constitution to judicial decisions. In one controversial speech he praised an article that opposed abortion as a violation of natural law.
Does Mr. Thomas adhere to a coherent natural law philosophy, whose tenets and bedrock values he can describe to the senators? Or does he mostly search for natural law on an ad hoc basis when dealing with a particular legal issue? Whichever the case, how will his philosophy shape his judicial judgments?
Personal liberty. Those who fear for the continued vitality of Roe v. Wade, the landmark case granting women the right to abortion, which is now under attack within the Court and hanging by a thread, are not paranoid. Judge Thomas has disparaged the legal reasoning behind the Roe decision. Will his views threaten a broad range of personal liberty and privacy rights that many Americans hold dear?
Conservative ideology. The senators need to examine where Judge Thomas fits on the ideological spectrum. Is he a radical rightist who will push the court's majority even further to the right, as critics fear? Or is he a more moderate and unpredictable jurist, as some analysts suggest? The Senate has every right to consider the balance and direction of the Court, not just the qualifications of this particular nominee.
Clarence Thomas may prove a strong witness for his own cause. If so, he will dispel the cynicism surrounding Mr. Bush's claims and his choice of a black whose philosophy has forced some liberals and minorities to choose between ideology and racial loyalty. These are momentous hearings for the judge, the Senate, the Court and the country.

HEADLINE: Can Jefferson Make It in Moscow?

BYLINE: By David K. Shipler; David K. Shipler is a former Moscow bureau chief for The New York Times and author of "Russia: Broken Idols, Solemn Dreams." He writes on Soviet affairs for The New Yorker.

DATELINE: CHEVY CHASE, Md.

 BODY:
As exhilarating and revolutionary as the events in the Soviet Union have been, they have failed to break that society's most troublesome governmental tradition -- the habit of anti-constitutionalism.
Boris N. Yeltsin rallied tens of thousands by condemning the coup as "anti-constitutional." When the plotters were defeated, Mikhail S. Gorbachev was restored to the presidency in the name of constitutionality. But this was only lip service to an idea that has never taken root in Russia. 
 In truth, the coup and the victory over the coup have combined tragically to sweep away the fragile structure of constitutional democracy that Mr. Gorbachev and liberal reformers erected 18 months ago. The urgent task now, which some key democrats understand, is to draft a new constitution in an effort to institutionalize political pluralism.
Drawing on the French and American models, the reformers amended their constitution in March 1990 to provide what the Soviet Union had never had: the separation of legislative and executive powers, a procedure to override presidential vetoes, a limited term for the President, a succession mechanism and other checks and balances.
Significantly, Mr. Yeltsin did not attend the session of the Congress of People's Deputies where this Western system was painstakingly negotiated and approved. And Mr. Gorbachev -- although trained as a lawyer and possessed by a noble vision of his country under the rule of law -- did not follow through afterward to nurture the legislative process and bolster the separation of powers.
On the contrary, finding himself pressed by hard-liners to address the twin crises of economic catastrophe and nationalist separatism, Mr. Gorbachev undermined his own endorsement of a constitutional system by ruling increasingly by decree. He often evaded the standing legislature, the Supreme Soviet, which rarely resisted him. Ironically, his decrees went largely unheeded as power spun wildly away from the center and into the republics.
His extra-constitutional step last week, taken in a frantic attempt to hold the tattered union together, further diminished the legislative branch even as it decentralized power to the republics. He browbeat the Congress of People's Deputies into voting itself essentially out of existence, reconstituting the Supreme Soviet into a republic-dominated body with limited authority and creating a strong State Council comprising republic presidents and himself. Granted, the Congress was only quasi-democratic; when it was formed in 1989, fewer than half of its 2,250 members were chosen by popular vote in competitive elections, with the rest running unopposed or assigned by the Communist Party and other organizations. But as the only nationally elected body, it leaves a vacuum, with no timetable for new elections.
The failure of constitutionalism has not surprised reformers, many of whom have warned that the cultural patterns of a long history could prove more powerful than words on paper. "In pre-revolutionary Russia, the decree of the czar was the real law," Aleksandr N. Yakovlev, a legislator and legal scholar, has said. "The bad Russian tradition of vesting legislative powers in the executive, dating from the old times, bothers me."
Successive Soviet constitutions were widely regarded as mockeries. Article 56 of the one adopted under Leonid I. Brezhnev stated, "The private life of the citizen, the secrecy of letters, telephone conversations and telegraph communications are protected by law." Article 52, providing that "the church in the U.S.S.R. is separate from the state," was used to bar the church from doing anything that the state did, such as running schools.
Nor have the tumultuous six years of perestroika taught the Soviet public to respect the constitutional process. This is dangerous, for democracy is not just a policy. It is a culture and a structure. Unless the liberty that was defended in the streets is now codified in a constitutional system, and then honored for a long time, the country will not succeed in securing its freedoms.

HEADLINE: Who Is Hurt the Most By Defense Dept. Cuts

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"So Far, St. Louis Handles Arms Cuts" (Business Day, Aug. 8), the fifth and last article in your "Military-Industrial Upheaval" series, well describes the severity of Defense Department cuts in St. Louis. But your accompanying map rates Missouri as relatively unaffected by cuts. 
 The map omits two key factors:
(1) The level of state unemployment. This helps predict how quickly laid-off arms-industry workers will find new jobs. Unemployment in your map's three most affected states (Alaska, Hawaii and Virginia) averages 5.3 percent, whereas in Missouri it's a worrisome 7 percent.
(2) The mix of cuts in Defense Department contracts in the state and cuts in base personnel. This helps predict the effects on the local economy. Cuts in the high earnings of Pentagon-contractor employees can have double the local impact of cuts in relatively transient base personnel, who shop at their PX. Procurement in the map's most affected states averages only one-third of Pentagon income; in Missouri, it's 84 percent, almost all going to St. Louis.
The dislocation index for Defense Department cuts of the Council on Economic Priorities includes the two missing factors and shows Missouri is truly the worst-hit state, followed by Texas and Arizona. New York State ranks No. 6; the cuts will hurt most in Long Island, where Bethpage (Grumman) by itself gets 28 percent of the state's Defense Department income.

HEADLINE: Can't We Also Save Backyard Animals?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Our little town's first rabid raccoon has been detected, to our collective dismay. My wife and I are also dismayed at the lack of action by government agencies and wildlife organizations. In five years since this problem was identified, those supposedly protecting the welfare of citizens and wildlife alike have done nothing but take defensive actions like vaccinating pets. Now they are going door to door making people prove their pets have been inoculated. (I suppose they confiscate your cat if you can't find the receipt from the vet.) Meanwhile, people must worry about the safety of their pets and children. 
 This could have been avoided if our elected officials (whom we support with taxes) and wildlife organizations (which we support with contributions) took action to try and stop the spread of rabies among the raccoon population. Instead, they sat in their offices issuing warnings or chasing that brave upstate New Yorker who fled with his raccoon friends.
When rabies broke out among foxes several years ago, the French developed an oral vaccine, put it in fish balls and dropped them by helicopter. This rapid if scattershot response stopped the spread of the disease. Our "experts" have done nothing but conduct experiments on islands off the Carolinas and report that efforts to develop a raccoon vaccine are proceeding. Are they going to wait until every raccoon in the East is dead before finding a vaccine?
I'll admit to a personal interest, because my wife and I enjoy our Candlewood Isle raccoons. They visit us on our deck to take food out of our hands with their mouths. (Yes, we know feeding wild animals is discouraged, but these aren't wolves that will lose their hunting ability. Raccoons won't forget how to scavenge any more than the birds we feed sunflower seeds forget how to find wild seed.) Never once has one of these gentle and entertaining animals so much as scratched us. The current kits (raised in our chimney) even let us pet them.
We had hoped to protect them. We planned to trap them one at a time and take them to be inoculated. Our local vet, an animal lover, was sympathetic, but since the dog and cat vaccine had not been tested on raccoons, he could not legally inoculate ours. We tried to obtain the vaccine the French used to protect their foxes, but it cannot be brought into this country. We're about ready to round up the three babies and keep them inside until this passes.
As a people, we've put tremendous energy into saving such esoteric species as snail darters and spotted owls, at a cost of millions spent and economic opportunity lost, protecting animals only a handful of people will ever see. But we can't muster any effort to help the animals who share our backyards.

HEADLINE: The Nation;
Light at the End of the Elevator Shaft

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
WANT to rent an office cheap? How about 10 offices -- or 10,000? From downtown Los Angeles to the suburbs of Boston, buildings sit half filled, monuments of an era in which commercial lenders traded their green eye shades for tinted aviators and the word thrift took on a whole new meaning.
"This cycle is the worst since the 1930's," said Anthony Downs, a specialist in real estate economics at the Brookings Institution. Some analysts now worry that what The Economist called "growth's dead weight" will dog the economy for a decade, helping to stretch the recession deep into the 1990's. 
 But this water glass could prove half full. While everyone agrees that tens of billions of dollars were wasted on see-through office buildings in the 1980's, many economists believe that the commercial real estate crisis is, at most, a precipitating factor in the overdue downsizing of the bloated construction, development and financial services industries.
And while the agony of banks, life insurers and their regulators will take years to play out, it need not slow economic growth or inhibit future gains in productivity.
Real estate in general and office buildings in particular have always ridden a roller coaster; the last cycle bottomed in the mid-1970's with overall office vacancy rates of 13 percent. But this downturn has been especially severe, and seems built to last.
In most big city and suburban markets, one of five square feet of office space is empty. David Shulman, a real estate analyst for Salomon Brothers, notes that the figures do not include a lot of underutilized space leased in the 1980's in anticipation of business expansions that never took place. Were a moratorium placed on all new office construction, he reckons that it would take 11 years to absorb the backlog.
Average rents in central business districts, where markets are most clogged, have fallen by half in real terms since the last peak in 1982. In many cases, projected revenues will not come close to covering mortgage payments. In some, they will not even cover operating expenses and taxes.
What happened? The manic growth of savings and loans in the early 1980's played a part, particularly in Texas. New rules liberated the thrifts to expand their investments beyond boring old home mortgages, while Federal deposit insurance allowed them to tap the vast pool of personal savings with no questions asked. Construction deals -- even patently bad deals -- were irresistible because loans were larded with fat fees, paid in advance. And financial regulators accustomed to dealing with lenders more interested in their golf handicaps than their balance sheets proved utterly incapable of keeping the razzle-dazzle in check.
But the super-boom in office construction would not have been possible without the support of more experienced, more conservative lenders. Banks, unable to hang onto blue-chip corporate customers who had discovered ways of borrowing directly from money markets, tried to recoup their losses by plunging into commercial real estate. The 100 heaviest bank lenders have over $120 billion tied up in commercial mortgages.
Life insurers had their own reasons for taking more and bigger risks. Eager to shed their image as the Ozzies and Harriets of high finance, they aggressively marketed new products ranging from annuities to guaranteed investment contracts for retirement accounts. Success left them with more money than they could profitably place in low-risk securities -- and much of the surplus ended up in office buildings. During the 1980's the amount life insurers invested in commercial real estate rose to $250 billion from $100 billion.
Many developers ignored signs of sagging demand in the late 1980's because they could afford to. Unlike in the past, lenders were often willing to put up 100 percent of construction costs without a single signed lease in hand. Mr. Shulman notes, moreover, that when revenues failed to meet expectations, owners no longer had a tax crutch to support property values: The 1986 Tax Reform Act effectively eliminated the market for commercial real estate as an income shelter for the rich.
A compilation by Barron's magazine of giant banks with problem real estate loans in excess of half their net worth reads like a Who's Who of American finance: Citicorp, Security Pacific, Chemical, Chase Manhattan, Bankers Trust. Many lenders, it seems, dove into real estate just as they got their heads above water on third world debts.
Investments in commercial real estate represent about a quarter of the life insurance industry's total assets of $1 trillion. Real property losses have already forced the closure of one multibillion-dollar insurer, Mutual Benefit Life.
All this is obviously bad news for developers, banks and life insurance policy holders -- and just about everyone else who works or invests in commercial real estate. It also bodes ill for taxpayers, who backstop the Federal bank deposit insurance system. Mr. Downs of Brookings said he worries that the pressure on banks to reduce further exposure to risk will make it difficult for otherwise creditworthy businesses to raise money.
But Lawrence White, an economist at New York University's Stern School of Business, cautions against exaggerating the social cost of the crisis. From the perspective of the economy as a whole, he said, the only irretrievable loss from the real estate bust is the steel, concrete and labor wasted on unwanted buildings. "It's as if we had built a bunch of pyramids," he said, and thus had less to invest in bridges, factories and high-tech research.
The cost, a reduction in the average productivity of America's capital, is not trivial. But Mr. White argues that this toll should be distinguished from the transient trauma of streamlining the industries that grew flabby on commercial real estate. Banks are expected to shed thousands of branches and hundreds of thousands of employees over the next few years as they merge and consolidate operations. Life insurers will follow suit, albeit in less spectacular fashion.
 
Temporary Grief
 The changes will cause a lot of grief for the people consigned to the unemployment lines, Mr. White acknowledged. But the grief will almost certainly be temporary, as workers are absorbed elsewhere. And the economy will be left with a financial services industry that is leaner and more efficient -- and, perhaps, less prone to lemming-like rushes into risky businesses.
Construction will be slammed equally hard. And Mr. Shulman suggests that the part of the industry specializing in office buildings may never come back to mid-1980's strength because businesses are discovering ways to expand without increasing white-collar payrolls. But the $20 billion office construction industry just isn't big enough to block the recovery of the $6 trillion American economy. Indeed, the overhang of unrented space should aid the recovery a bit by dampening inflation, much as the oil glut did in the 1980-82 recession.
The boom and bust in commercial real estate reveals the worst about capitalism, American style. Markets failed to channel valuable resources to their most productive uses. Regulation, which was supposed to be part of the solution, became part of the problem. People who would never dream of gambling with their savings will bear a good chunk of the multibillion dollar loss.
But the story also offers hints of the system's resiliency: The capitalist phoenix is rising from the ashes, as it has countless times before.

CORRECTION-DATE: September 22, 1991, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sept. 8 about the effects of the commercial real estate glut on the economy included an erroneous generalization about loans causing problems for five large banks. Problem loans of all types exceed half the adjusted net worth of each bank -- Citicorp, Security Pacific, Chemical, Chase Manhattan and Bankers Trust -- but the proportion of such loans committed to real estate varies widely among them.

HEADLINE: FOCUS: Chicago;
A Housing Surge Gives Tenants the Edge

BYLINE: By CHERYL KENT

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
WITH the addition of nearly 4,000 units in six new downtown rental apartment complexes in the last 18 months, tenants are now dictating the terms here.
Competition is forcing leasing agents to offer a variety of inducements, from free health-club memberships to months of free rent and guarantees of limited increases at renewal time. 
 The new apartment buildings are all within the orbit of Cityfront Center, a 52-acre mixed-use development that has opened an area at the juncture of the Chicago River and Lake Michigan to residential and commercial development, and two are within Cityfront's boundaries. Concessions are being offered at all but one of the buildings.
The Chicago situation is unusual from a national standpoint.
Few cities have developed as much new downtown housing in the last 15 years. A total of 18,900 units were built between 1979 and 1991, according to Chicago's Department of Planning. Absorption has been high until recently, say industry experts.
But the latest crop of towers suggests the city's appetite may have been sated. The six apartment buildings were built without subsidies or tax write-offs and thus face hurdles to profitability. And all aim for the same target, forcing them to compete against one another for a share of the market.
The management of each buildings describes its tenants as young professionals and "empty nesters."
Among the projects is Cityfront Place on North McClurg Court, a complex with one 39-story building and two 12 stories tall with a total of 906 units.
Two of the three buildings have opened within the last four months. So far, they are less than 50 percent occupied.
The second is North Pier Tower, a 61-story, 529-unit building completed in January at 474 North Lake Shore Drive. It is 55 percent occupied.
When it was devoted to shipping, Cityfront's land was covered with rail lines and warehouses. The property is now prized for its proximity to the lakefront and the downtown business and retail districts, features that developers say will help to attract professionals in their 30's with incomes of $60,000 or more.
Construction of Cityfront, whose site is owned by Chicago Dock and Canal Company and Equitable Real Estate, was begun in 1986. In addition to the three apartment houses, a 40-story, 850,000-square-foot offfice tower and a 7-story, 451,000-square-foot office-retail building have been completed and a 1,125-room convention hotel is now going up.
Irving Markin of the Markin Group said his decision to build a 41-story apartment tower at 420 East Ohio Street had a great deal to do with Cityfront's beingjust two blocks from his site. His tower, completed 10 months ago, has 263 units ranging from studios to three-bedroom apartments.
Mr. Markin, who said his tower is 55 percent occupied, is not offering special incentives. He declined to give a range of rentals, but a leasing agent said one-bedrooms range from $1,020 to $1,100.
THE sudden addition of so many units within a mile of Cityfront has attracted bargain hunters. Newspaper ads spelling out rates and offering "August Rental Specials" have led prospective tenants to think haggling will be rewarded. They are right. Donna Morgan, leasing director for one of the new buildings described the spiralling effect of concessions.
"They make the market tough," she said. "People walk in here with their hands out. I don't want to offer incentives but I have to."
The significant reductions tenants have won mean these apartment buildings are producing less revenue than expected when they were conceived. Most of the buildings were planned at least three years ago when the prime lending rate went from 8.5 percent in February to 10.5 percent in November 1988. Under the dual pressures of operating costs and financing charges, developers are working hard to bring in what cash they can by filling the apartments they have built.
Many leasing agents said they are giving one month rent-free on 13-month leases and two months on 26-month leases. But it is easy for prospective tenants to get substantially better offers by calling a leasing office.
The Park Shore, a 56-story high rise at 195 North Harbor Drive that opened nine months ago, is offering two months' free rent on a 14-month lease for a one-bedroom apartment costing $990. The building has 1,382 units and is 20 percent leased. North Pier Tower is giving free cable television and two free months for an 18-month lease on a one-bedroom renting for $1,052.
At the 49-story, 406-unit 401 East Ontario Street apartment house, new tenants are offered a half-month's free rent. One-bedrooms there rent for $1,000 to $1,407.
Four months' rent on a 26-month lease for a one-bedroom renting for $728-850 is available at Cityfront Place.
The 37-story, 221-unit Chicagoan has been open 18 months, making it the oldest of the new apartment buildings. It is 85 percent leased. The first renewals are coming and the leasing manager says 90 percent have signed again. Murray Wolbach, a vice president of Draper and Kramer, a partner in the Chicagoan, says he is offering the standard one free month on a 13-month lease.
DRAPER AND KRAMER may feel less pressure partly because there is no mortgage on the Chicagoan. "With the new tax laws in effect you can't leverage by offsetting losses in real estate with gains elsewhere," Mr. Wolbach said. "You can only offset losses in real estate with gains in real estate. I didn't want a mortgage on this building."
The Chicagoan was developed in conjunction with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers pension fund.
The $70 million North Pier Tower is owned by Broadacre Development Company and the General Electric Master Retirement Trust. The 420 East Ohio Street building is a joint venture of the Markin Group and an unidentified pension fund. Others would not discuss the financing of their projects.
With many lease packages guaranteeing renewals will not rise more than 3 to 7 percent within one year, rents are likely to remain a bargain in this part of the city for at least a year. Even so, rents in these new buildings are, on average, substantially higher than in other parts of the city. In Lincoln Park, a favored neighborhood for young professionals, one-bedroom apartments in the walk-ups most characteristic of the area rent for $550 to $800. High-rise rents average $900 a month.
Building managers and leasing agents for older apartment buildings around Cityfront Center say their tenants are moving out. To combat this, managers in older buildings -- the 10-year-old Doral Plaza and the 19-year-old McClurg Court, an apartment building as well as a street -- are offering concessions, too.
At McClurg Court, new tenants are given 8 or 12 rent certificates, depending on the size of the unit they have taken. Each is worth $100 and can be used towards rent in any combination the tenant chooses. All of them can be used at once to pay for one month or they can be spread over the year.
Young professionals in their 30's or middle-aged couples with adult children are consistently described as the target tenants for the new buildings. Income levels, according to these profiles, start at $60,000. Several building managers say that roughly 30 percent of the tenants who have moved in are new to Chicago. One-third are single men and another third are single women.

HEADLINE: Colleges Aim Courses at Older Students

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

 BODY:
SCHOOL BELLS start ringing this week for 12 million students older than 25 returning to school, and thereby helping themselves and their colleges.
College enrollments for traditionally aged students have fallen. Last year, the number of 18-year-olds entering college fell 44 percent compared with those entering college in 1979. So colleges have been forced to seek other sources of students, particularly older ones, said Joseph Cullen, director of public relations at Iona College in New Rochelle. 
 At Iona, executive-education programs have been created for adults seeking to do better work at their jobs or hoping to make career changes, Mr. Cullen said. "In many instances, a good part of their tuition fees are paid by the companies they work for."
And this year, enrollment in one such program, the Certified Employee Benefit Specialist program for trustees, administrators, actuaries, corporate benefit and union benefit managers, is high, said Teresa R. Gallo, the coordinator of Iona's School of General Studies.
"We feel it's because benefits have become so complicated and so expensive that those who administer corporate-benefit plans have to have a very specific knowledge of their structure today," she said. "The course, which is sponsored by the International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans and the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, also gives students the opportunity to earn professional accreditation."
For adults re-entering the job market or making a career change, Ms. Gallo said, Iona offers certificate programs in legal assistance, word processing, travel and tourism and fund-raising. "And our School of General Studies also offers baccalaureate programs in the evening and on weekends for those who want to earn a degree," she said.
Adults who have earned at least 60 semester academic hours and who have at least five years of practical work experience can now enroll in a new accelerated-degree program at Concordia College in Bronxville, said Lois Mills Chianese, assistant professor of business administration and co-director of the accelerated-degree program.
"The program is the first of its kind in Westchester specifically designed for the working adult," Ms. Chianese said. "By attending school one night a week and one Saturday a month, adult students can finish a New York State-accredited bachelor of science program in business administration in as little as a year." The accelerated-degree program has been available at four affiliated Concordia Colleges nationwide, which have reported having great success with it, Ms. Chianese added.
 
Global Perspective Stressed
 "A lot of people left college without getting a degree, and at some time or another in their career feel that the lack of a degree is a handicap toward advancing in the workplace," said John W. Westerman, co-director of the Concordia program and an associate professor in business administration.
"And there are other people who, perhaps because of the recession, are realizing that a degree is essential if they are going to compete successfully in jobs in this tight economic climate," he added.
The Concordia program was developed to provide each student with a well-rounded, global perspective of the business world, Mr. Westeman added. He said 50 percent of the corporations in the area have offered tuition reimbursement to employees enrolling in the program.
Mr. Westerman, who recently met with some potential students from the human resources department at the Philip Morris Corporation in Rye Brook, said they liked the program's structure.
"We have made it very convenient for adults," he said. "We're holding the program on our campus in Bronxville over the span of 12 months, with class meetings held once a week in four-hour blocks of time. It also includes 10 mandatory Saturday seminars."
The curriculum of the Concordia program is based on the work of the traditional junior and senior years of business majors, Ms. Chianese said. "Students will earn 42 semester hours toward a bachelor of science degree in business administration." The degree requires a total of 122 hours.
 
Tuition Is All Inclusive
 The cost of the accelerated executive education degree program has been set at $9,000 and includes tuition, lab fees, books and parking for the entire year. "We have structured it so there are no hidden costs," Mr. Westerman said. "Even lunches at the 10 Saturday seminars and evening snacks are included. All textbooks for each course will be available the first night of each class, because we don't think adult students should have to make special trips to the college book store in the middle of a workday."
In White Plains, the new Mercy College weekend program, also designed for working adults, will begin Friday.
Dr. John J. McGrath, dean of the White Plains campus, said: "We've been working on the program for a year, and after a year of market research plus our own experience of nontraditional student populations, we think we've designed a sensible program for those whose work schedules or personal commitments make it impossible for them to enroll in a traditional program. We've taken adult life styles into consideration.
"For instance, every third weekend is off for professional or family obligations. And our location in downtown White Plains makes the school convenient for a lot of students. Our enrollments are running well, just about as we predicted."
 
Credit for Experience
 Tuition for the Mercy weekend program, Dean McGrath said, has been reduced to $185 a credit from Mercy's $276 a credit. "This gives our weekend program the lowest tuition for any bachelor's degree program within any independent college in Westchester," he said.
Students in the weekend program can take one to five classes each semester to help them earn a bachelor's degree in accounting or business administration with a specialization in management or office information systems in about four years, said Dean McGrath, who added that under Mercy's life-experience credit program, students may also be given college credit for work experience.
At Manhattanville College in Purchase, Rae Fischetti, assistant dean of adult special programs, said adult students are often turning toward liberal arts studies.
"This fall semester in our registrations, we are seeing out-of-work men and women who can afford it coming back to college to retrain," Ms. Fischetti said. "There are others who are looking for intellectual stimulation and are taking courses in the humanities, literature, philosophy and psychology."
 
Employers Give Aid
 And many adult students enrolled in liberal arts master's degree programs are there with some financial support from their employers, she added.
"We find that corporations are giving employees tuition reimbursement for courses that develop critical-thinking skills and writing skills," she said.
Thomas N. Schappert, an International Business Machines human resources executive, has taken courses in the humanities one night a week at Manhattanville for three years. Mr. Schappert, who said he majored in business as an undergraduate and later received a master's degree in business administration, said he wanted to earn a master's degree in humanities through the Manhattanville adult program.
"I am back in college because I want to be there," he said, "I'm 48 years old, and I felt it was about time I rounded out my background. There are so many things I wanted to learn more about. The three hours I spend in class one night a week have opened my eyes to other worlds. And I think that's what learning's all about."

HEADLINE: THE VIEW FROM: ESSEX;
As Banking Failures Increase, A New Bank Opens Its Doors

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
A RECORD number of banks in Connecticut are going broke, but a new one has opened in the town of Essex, which already had almost one bank for every 1,000 residents. Maritime Bank and Trust Company, the first new bank in the state in more than a year, opened its single office on Route 153 in the lower Connecticut River Valley town.
"We started this project three years ago and quickly found out that timing is everything," said the chairman of the bank, Richard R. Manning, who also heads City Coal Inc., in nearby New London. "We'll probably be the only bank to start up for a long time." 
 Plans for at least two other eastern Connecticut banks in Windham and Canterbury, which were organizing at the same time as Maritime, have been abandoned. And Maritime's president, William R. Attridge, said there were some nerve-wracking moments over the last couple of years for his bank as well.
 
Good Mixture of Accounts
 "There was somewhat of a risk involved," Mr. Attridge said. "When I joined them, they were still raising money, and it was not a good environment to be trying to raise money for a bank."
But Maritime raised $4.6 million from 300 stockholders as seed money, and the bank said it has been steadily attracting $600,000 to $700,000 a week in new deposits since its May opening. In one week in July Maritime brought in $1.2 million in deposits, bank officials said, and the mixture has been good, with a higher percentage in checking and savings accounts than expected.
"If all your money is in certificates of deposit, that money can disappear tomorrow, if the bank across the street offers a higher rate," Mr. Attridge said. "If it's in checking and savings accounts, it implies the money is there to stay for a while."
In Mr. Attridge's case, "the bank across the street," is not merely a figure of speech. Across the street is the former Chester Bank, now taken over by Connecticut National Bank. But having such a close competitor does not seem to have harmed Maritime. "We expected an initial rush of deposits from directors and their friends," Mr. Attridge said. "What we didn't expect was how consistently the influx of deposits has continued. It really hasn't trailed off."
Banks in Connecticut lost a total of $649 million in 1990, which was worse than 1989, when $505 million was lost. But Dr. Lewis Mandell, a professor of finance at the University of Connecticut, said the market is ripe for banks like Maritime.
 
'Only Time to Start a Bank'
 He recalled his efforts to help a group that was starting the first minority-owned bank in Texas in the 1970's, just before the banking collapse there. When he went back to Texas several years later, he called the lawyer for the group to apologize for such poor timing, he said.
"He said the bank was fine, that they opened just as real estate prices collapsed, and every loan they had on the books was made after the collapse, so they had no bad real estate loans," Dr. Mandell said. "That made me realize the only time to start a bank is when things are at their worst."
But it is also the time when people are least likely to invest in a new bank, he acknowledged, and when regulators are scrutinizing new charters.
"You need to put in a lot of capital now," Dr. Mandell said. He noted, however, that investors would be scrutinized closely, and that if any of a bank's organizers "even spit on a public sidewalk in their youth, the F.B.I. is going to knock them out of the roster."
Mr. Attridge said the poor economy hurt Maritime a little when it was raising capital. The planned stock offering of $5.1 million had to be scaled back to $4.6 million, he said, and the investors do not expect to double their money soon. The sole stock transaction since the bank opened was at $10 a share, the price the shares brought during the public offering.
"People who bought stock in this bank didn't buy it for the quick flip," Mr. Attridge said. "They knew they were getting in for the long haul."
With parking in the rear and a decidedly residential facade, the bank looks more like an elegantly restored sea captain's home than a commercial establishment. Inside the front door a plate of cookies and pitcher of lemonade greet visitors, and in the waiting area, a cherry-wood coffee table holds banking and finance journals along with the local Main Street News.
 
Profit in Second Year Seen
 The interior is done in white and forest green, with brass lighting fixtures and plush carpeting. Customers exchange pleasantries with the tellers, who often find no need to check their identification. Maritime has gone out of its way to make people comfortable, Mr. Attridge said.
He said that if the bank's goals are reached, it will be the second year before it turns a profit, and perhaps two years or more before it reaches the $40 million in deposits it would need to make a second stock offering.
"It's not appropriate, 10 weeks out of the box, to be talking about where your next branch will be or potential mergers and acquisitions," Mr. Attridge said. "But we are looking around."
The bank's 11 directors include people in the oil business, accounting, computers, restaurants, finance, and retail, and none draw a salary, Mr. Manning said. Among them they own more than 50 percent of the stock.
Mr. Manning said with no bad loans on the books, and with $600,000 or more coming in every week in new deposits, Maritime should be able to avoid the pitfalls that have claimed so many other banks.
"Obviously, if we're bringing in that kind of money, people are saying there's a need for community banks, and community bankers," Mr. Manning said. "We've been inundated with new business, particularly from medical professionals, because a lot of people are concerned about other banks."
The people at Maritime "really did their homework," said the executive director of the Middlesex County Chamber of Commerce, Lawrence D. McHugh. "I think they're going to do very well, because they're filling a void." Middlesex County, while it has been affected by the recession, has still seen some expansion, Mr. McHugh said. His organization is taking in an average of 15 members a month, with only 6 or 7 dropping out.
 
A Positive Message
 In Essex, he said, several businesses have expanded, and the bank's opening will send a positive message to businesses looking to relocate.
"The older banks have no money to give out," Mr. McHugh said. "Maritime is going to pick up business, because they're new, and they can write loans without regulators climbing up and down on them."
John A. Johns, the First Selectman of Essex, said he is not surprised Maritime's directors chose the town.
"At the time they started the bank, construction was doing well, particularly the construction of costly new houses, which I'm sure would be attractive to any bank," Mr. Johns said. "And our tax structure is attractive, the third lowest taxes of the 169 towns in Connecticut."
Mr. Johns said it might seem that Essex had too many banks. The town, with 5,800 residents, is home to the Essex Savings Bank and has branches of four regional banks.
"But for myself, if I were seeking a mortgage, I'd want to go to a place where I know the people I'm dealing with, and where I know the stockholders," Mr. Johns said.

HIGH ROLLERS
Inside the Savings and Loan Debacle.
By Martin Lowy.
321 pp. New York.:
Praeger. $24.95.  
 Among the general public, the savings and loan mess arouses at least as much puzzlement as anger, probably because most people aren't sure exactly what happened and are even less sure who is to blame. In "High Rollers," Martin Lowy, a banker and lawyer with 25 years' experience in finance, chronicles the savings and loan calamity and comes up with reasonable explanations that shed light on many aspects of the most expensive financial disaster in American history.
Unhappily for those who want a scapegoat, the thrust of Mr. Lowy's analysis is that no single person, institution or incident is wholly or even largely responsible for the shocking disintegration of what only a short while ago was an apparently thriving industry. "The real causes," he writes, "were and are far more fundamental and far more frightening. This wasn't a bank robbery; it was a fundamental economic failure of a substantial part of our financial system, and the same forces are threatening other parts of the system today."
Mr. Lowy traces the roots of the savings and loan collapse to the double-digit interest rates that erupted in the late 1970's in the wake of double-digit inflation. Savings and loan associations suffered severe losses because most of their income was derived from long-term fixed-rate mortgages acquired when interest rates were much lower, whereas they had to pay out high interest rates to prevent depositors from withdrawing funds in search of better yields elsewhere.
Infatuated with the then-popular siren song of deregulation, Congress responded, as Mr. Lowy recounts, with a rescue operation that abolished many of the rules under which savings and loans had traditionally functioned. They were authorized to offer new kinds of deposits and given enhanced power to make loans. In addition, several states relaxed restrictions on direct investments and permitted state-chartered savings institutions, including savings and loans, to invest in real estate developments and other business ventures.
In the end, Mr. Lowy explains, these measures only made matters worse. Many oil and real estate loans and investments turned sour in the 1980's, when the price of oil nose-dived and regional oil-producing economies encountered hard times. Other risky investments, like junk bonds, went up in smoke. The problem was further compounded by widespread fraud, embezzlement and mismanagement on the part of high-flying savings and loan officials. As a result, hundreds of savings and loan associations became insolvent: their liabilities, mostly deposits, exceeded the market value of their assets, so that their net worth became negative.
Holding the bag was the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, the governmental agency responsible for reimbursing insured depositors or failed institutions. When its well ran dry -- which, Mr. Lowy notes, didn't take long -- it was the taxpayers' turn to foot the bill. The cost to the general public will eventually amount to some $400 billion, half of which is bailout money and half interest payable by the United States Treasury because the necessary funds are being raised not by tax collections but by borrowing through the sales of Government bonds.
Because managing large sums of money invariably breeds temptation, examination and supervision of financial institutions by honest and independent government regulators has always been an indispensable ingredient of a sound financial system. However, as Mr. Lowy says, all regulation was viewed as superfluous in the naive fervor that sparked the initial wave of deregulation. On the basis of the simplistic premise that government can never solve social, economic or financial problems, but can only make them worse, the examination and supervision of financial institutions was disparaged, ignored, impeded and obstructed.
Since vested political and ideological interests are at stake in the savings and loan debacle, the story usually differs depending on who is doing the telling. Republicans like to blame former President Jimmy Carter for the inflation that caused the high interest rates that got the savings and loan associations into trouble in the first place. Democrats blame former President Ronald Reagan for spreading the gospel that deregulation plus free markets will cure all our economic ills. Some blame the Federal deposit insurance system, because insurance premiums paid to the Government by financial institutions are not adjusted for the riskiness of their portfolios. And just about everybody -- except Mr. Lowy -- blames the former House Speaker Jim Wright; Charles H. Keating Jr., the former head of Lincoln Savings and Loan; and the United States senators known collectively as the Keating Five -- Alan Cranston, Dennis DeConcini, John Glenn, John McCain and Donald W. Riegle -- for insinuating themselves where they didn't belong and undermining the integrity of the supervisory process.
"High Rollers" tends to overemphasize the trees at the expense of the forest. A good editor would have cut about 20 percent. But such criticism borders on nitpicking. In fact it is hard to find a clear, knowledgeable and impartial analysis of the savings and loan mess, and Martin Lowy has done us all a favor by providing just that.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
As Publishers Cut Costs, Book Packagers Thrive

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

 BODY:
Book packagers have traditionally had an image problem. Their role has been dimly seen as having something to do with mail rooms and wrapping works of literature.
"We have labored under our tawdry and non-literary name," said Carter Smith, the president of Media Projects Inc., a New York packager. 
 Other names have been considered as a way out of this problem: book producer, book developer, even "booklisher." But none have stuck.
Now, after years of relative anonymity, this unglamorous niche in the publishing industry has been rescued by the economy.
 
Surrogates for Publishers
 Packagers are thriving. While publishers struggle, squeezed by sagging sales and soaring advances to writers, packagers are finding their services in increasing demand. They act as surrogates for publishers -- conceiving, writing, editing, illustrating, indexing and even sometimes manufacturing books. Because they have small staffs and low overheads, they are able to work more cheaply than conventional publishers.
As a result, publishers are turning to them to produce books on everything from women's health to American history. By commissioning books from packagers, whose role is generally only discreetly mentioned on the book itself, publishers save on their own staff's time and the costs of their overhead.
For example, Prentice Hall's successful "Best Vacation Rentals" guides are in fact written, illustrated and manufactured by the Philip Lief Group, a packager.
"Our problem is no longer selling our ideas to publishers; it is keeping up with their demands on us," said Mr. Lief, the company's president. "We used to have to originate all projects, but most are now initiated by publishing houses."
 
Soaring Revenue
 Among Lief's recent projects are a new thesaurus to be published by Dell, an encyclopedic guide to gardening for Macmillan and a complete guide to bartending for Berkley Books. The company's gross revenue has soared by 30 percent, to well in excess of $1 million in the last year, and its profit margin is more than 10 percent, Mr. Lief said.
Mr. Smith of Media Projects said that his company's revenue had risen 20 percent in the last year and that "business has never been better."
"We have lower overheads than publishers, we hustle, and we're ready to do anything," he said. "In hard times, we thrive."
Packagers like to compare themselves to independent film producers. Less cumbersome than big houses, just as the independents are more flexible than the big movie studios, packagers will provide publishers with anything they need: an idea, writers, editors, manuscripts that are ready for production and even finished books to which the publisher merely adds its name.
Indeed, the packager effectively removes from the publisher the responsibility for much or all of the time-consuming and costly editorial work that goes into a book, allowing the publisher to be just a distributor.
 
'They Need Us'
 "Publishers are trying to do more books with less overhead, so they need us," said Stephen R. Ettlinger, president of Ettlinger Editorial Projects and of the American Book Producers Association, a trade group for packagers. The group has grown to 63 members from 50 last year. In all, there are an estimated 160 packagers, compared with 10 in 1980.
The total volume of the packagers is not known because most companies are private. But analysts believe that perhaps 15 percent of all books are produced by them.
The most recent project for Mr. Ettlinger is "Everything Sold in Garden Centers," published by Macmillan. And he is working for Addison-Wesley on a book about how to dispose of garbage. His company's staff consists of himself and an assistant, and he hires freelance help as needed. This is typical of the means by which packagers keep costs down.
 
Avoiding 'an Enormous Strain'
 The advantages of a packager to a publisher are illustrated by Roget's New American Thesaurus, currently being produced for Dell by Lief. Leslie Schnur, the editorial director of Dell, said such a book would "have put an enormous strain on us, and it's much easier to get a good independent packager to do it."
Lief contracted with Dell to produce the work, found a lexicographer, Barbara Ann Kipfer, to compile it, and will provide the book to Dell for publication next summer.
"Publishers are simply overwhelmed with all the books they are acquiring and editing," Ms. Schnur said, "so this sort of arrangement makes sense."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
11.6% Decline Is Expected For Corporate Campaigns

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
CONFIRMING the belief that corporate advertising has fallen victim to the recession, an annual survey of members of the Association of National Advertisers has found that budgets this year are expected to drop 11.6 percent from 1990. The consultant who conducted the survey says the decline is the largest since he began tracking spending on such campaigns during the 1975 recession.
Executives participating in the survey, which is known as the association's corporate advertising practices study, reported that they intended to spend $404.4 million this year, compared with $457.4 million last year. Another sign of the spending slowdown was a finding that only 52.8 percent of the respondents sponsored corporate ad campaigns within the last three years, compared with 62.8 percent who did so from 1988 through 1990 and 70.4 percent who did so from 1987 through 1989. 
 The study is scheduled to be released by the association at its annual corporate communications conference, to be held Wednesday through Friday in Atlanta. Thomas F. Garbett, the consultant who conducted the survey, offered an advance look at the results during a telephone interview from his office in Waterford, Conn.
These days, "corporate advertising is almost an afterthought," said Mr. Garbett, who has served as a consultant in the field since 1984, after 23 years at the Doyle Dane Bernbach agency (now DDB Needham Worldwide) in New York. Increasingly, he added, the executives responsible for corporate advertising "are having a hard time selling their budgets" to financially hard-pressed top management.
The survey considers corporate advertising as embracing all sponsored messages meant "not to result in an immediate sale," Mr. Garbett said, "but to position a company for better sales." That includes campaigns usually referred to as image advertising, he added, as well as so-called issue or advocacy advertising, which discusses or takes stands on social and political topics, and what is known as financial or investor advertising, which addresses the investment community, from brokerage firms to shareholders.
The survey indicates that the effect of the recession, which began in July of last year, has intensified as tough economic times have continued; the expected 11.6 percent drop in spending from 1990 to 1991 compares with a drop of six-tenths of 1 percent from 1989 to 1990. Spending in 1989 totaled $460 million.
Another trend affecting corporate ad budgets, Mr. Garbett said, is a trend that he playfully termed "Nimbo," for "Not in my budget, out!" He described it as a tug-of-war between the executives at the head of a large company with many subsidiaries and the executives in charge of those subsidiaries. Each side insists that the other commit its increasingly scarce dollars, he added, to any advertising "that has to do with enhancing the corporate reputation."
Apart from an end to the recession, one factor that might aid a turnaround in corporate ad spending, Mr. Garbett said, is that "foreign companies are stepping up their activities a great deal" in the United States. That is partly a result of their perceived need "to develop reputations in this country," he said,
In addition, Mr. Garbett said, companies based overseas, particularly in Japan, generally place a higher value on burnishing a corporate image than do domestically based companies.
The association has been surveying its members on their corporate advertising plans since 1975; the survey became an annual undertaking six years ago. Members of the association, which was founded in 1910, account for almost 80 percent of all regional and national ad spending in the United States.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Need Is Seen for the Fed To Consider Consumers

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Private economists say that now that the Federal Reserve has engineered a turnaround in the manufacturing sector, it should devote its energies and attention to consumers.
Unless relief comes soon and demand picks up, the production gains recorded so far in the third quarter could taper off in the final three months of the year and into 1992, they say. 
 The Fed has no direct link to consumers, whose spending constitutes two-thirds of the country's economic activity. But at this juncture, lowering the interest rates that the Fed does control would in all likelihood prompt banks and other lenders to cut their prime lending rate, and cause mortgage rates to decline.
 
Restoring Consumer Confidence
 "One of the problems the economy faces is a consumer sector that is not feeling very good about itself," said Steven A. Wood, director of financial markets research at the Bank of America. "One way to help restore that confidence is to get rates that consumers identify with, like the prime and mortgage rates, lower. If the Fed can do something to get those rates down it would help."
Analysts are concerned about the consumer because recent data indicate that the pickup in manufacturing activity over the last few months is little more than a restocking of inventories.
Car sales remain at very low levels. Sales of new and existing homes appear to be slowing again. And, as leading chain stores reported last week, back-to-school shoppers were in short supply in August.
"The conventional wisdom is that if back-to-school shopping is bad, then Christmas will be bad," said Sandra Shaber, a vice president and economist at the Futures Group Inc. in Washington. "I am not so sure that will happen, once we get some improvement in the job market," she said. "But retailers are going to be pulling their hair out."
 
Little Optimism Over Jobs Data
 The August employment report offered some basis for optimism, but not much.
Goods-producing businesses generated their first employment gains since May. But many service-sector companies, which account for three-quarters of all jobs, continued to cut back. More chilling: During the last two months the number of workers who gave up even looking for work rose by 750,000.
The results of a quarterly survey of more than 15,000 employers conducted by Manpower Inc., the supplier of temporary help, do not provide much basis for optimism in the near term.
In its current survey, to be released today, Manpower said that 21 percent of the employers polled said they planned to add to their work force in the fourth quarter, down from 22 percent in the third. Twelve percent said they planned to cut payrolls, compared with 10 percent in the third quarter.
 
Recovery 'Depends on Christmas'
 Seasonal factors are largely responsible for the lower hiring numbers, the Manpower survey said. Nevertheless, the survey notes that hiring projections in areas like services and public administration are at their lowest since the 1982-83 recession. Meanwhile, manufacturers reported they intended to raise hiring in the fourth quarter.
Nevertheless, "the recovery in manufacturing depends on Christmas," said Neal M. Soss, chief economist at the First Boston Corporation. "And a successful Christmas depends on domestic demand holding up. A cut in interest rates would make the continuance of demand more assured."
A cut in the prime rate, currently at 8.5 percent, would lead to lower rates on loans like prime-based home equity loans. But a lower prime would almost certainly have no effect on rates charged by credit card issuers. Despite the sharp declines in market interest rates during the last year, rates on credit card balances are currently at their highest levels in more than a decade.
 
No Rate Cuts Seen in Credit Cards
 As of Sept. 3, the national average for credit card interest rates stood at 18.94 percent, according to the Bank Rate Monitor, a newsletter that tracks bank interest rates.
In addition to the rate's being high, the interest paid on these cards is no longer tax deductible. But these two disincentives to running up credit card debt have not had much effect, said Robert Heady, the Bank Rate Monitor's editor.
"The convenience of the cards makes users insensitive to the high rates," he said.
 
Retail Sales Data Due This Week
 Evidence of the consumer's weakened state is likely to be visible in August retail sales data, which are expected to be released Friday.
Based on the poor chain store and auto sales reports, many analysts are projecting that retail sales, which rose by half of 1 percent in July, may have actually declined in August.
Based on recent statements by some Fed officials, the central bank still seems confident that the recovery is well in place.
On Thursday a Fed governor, John P. LaWare, said growth in the second half of the year should average 3 to 4 percent. The same day, Robert Parry, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, forecast that the economy would expand at a 3 percent rate over the next 12 months.
 
Fed Forecasts Are Questioned
 A weak retail sales report, in conjunction with other recent reports showing that final demand is not building strength, may alter that view somewhat, analysts said, and prompt the Fed to engineer a further reduction in short-term interest rates.
"We find it difficult to see" the type of growth described by the Fed officials, said Maria Fiorini Ramirez, president of Ramirez Capital Consultants. "We still believe that growth will be positive in the second half, but only because inventories have stopped being pared.
"And if the consequent upturn in consumer spending doesn't occur," she added, "and we don't expect it to, then shouldn't there be inventory shedding in the beginning of 1992?"

HEADLINE: Regulatory Overhaul Advancing

BYLINE: STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 8

 BODY:
Momentum is building rapidly in Congress and among Federal regulators to repudiate and rewrite many laws and economic regulations that were pillars of the New Deal of the 1930's.
The changes, advanced by the Bush Administration and moving quickly through Congress, which returns from its summer recess on Tuesday, represent a fundamental shift in the philosophy of regulation. Earlier in this century, rules were formulated to restrict the growth of financial powerhouses; the new view holds that conglomeration is better for the economy and helps the nation to compete internationally. 
 The House and Senate Banking Committees have already adopted important legislation to repeal Depression-era regulations that restrict the ability of banks to grow and enter new businesses, and other legislation making its way through Congress would overhaul laws restricting the growth of utilities.
 
Sweeping Changes Seen
 Already the Banking Committees have approved legislation that would eviscerate the Glass-Steagall Act, which broke up the House of Morgan by restricting commercial banks from underwriting corporate securities. The committees' swift approval of the legislation has been taken as a sign by many officials and lawmakers that Congress will adopt sweeping banking legislation this fall.
"We think it's very likely that there will be Glass-Steagall reform this year," Treasury Under Secretary Robert R. Glauber said. "The only question is whether it's good reform or bad reform," he added, referring to the Administration's preference for the Senate version, which would permit commercial banks to lend money to affiliated investment banks.
The final legislation is likely to constitute a refutation of the progressive populist movement that arose after the market crash of 1907. The movement, whose intellectual father was Louis D. Brandeis, sought to decentralize economic power through laws that established a central bank and ultimately broke up the House of Morgan, the leading trusts of the day, and the public utilities that dominated economic life. For more than a half century, those laws and regulations have framed the nation's financial system.
But now the Bush Administration, many lawmakers and the regulators themselves have concluded that these laws are outdated and that they inhibit the United States' ability to compete. The new philosophy, which is rapidly gaining widespread support, is that the Depression-era rules have lagged behind the realities of the marketplace, contributing to the crisis in the banking industry and hindering energy policy by restricting industrial companies from the power business.
"In the 1930's, we assumed that decentralization was the way to prevent mischief, and there was a basic mistrust of bigness, fueled by a period of populist upheaval," said Robert B. Reich, a professor of political economy at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. "Now the world has changed fundamentally, through advances in technology and the globalization of the marketplace.
"As a result, the concerns of the 1930's are not on anyone's mind. Washington is acting as if the Great Crash and many of the excesses of the 1920's never existed."
 
Reasons for Change
 Lowell L. Bryan, head of the banking group at McKinsey & Company, the management consulting group, said the change reflects a shifting view from "the fear of bigness in the 1930's to the new fear that American institutions in the international sphere have become pygmies."
As a consequence, such cornerstones of the New Deal and its aftermath as the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933; the McFadden Act, which was amended in 1933; the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, and the Public Utilities Holding Company Act of 1935, are coming under assault. Another product of the Depression, the Investment Company Act of 1940, which regulates the enormous mutual fund industry, is also in the process of undergoing a thorough re-examination by the Securities and Exchange Commission, although changes in that law are not likely to be as radical as those in the other laws.
At the same time, a movement has been gaining ground to overhaul the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, a law that gives the Securities and Exchange Commission jurisdiction over certain kinds of conglomerates that generate power. The law has not only kept industrial companies out of the power business, but has also kept utilities out of the business of building generating plants outside their territories and selling the power on the open market.
In a letter this year to House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, Democrat of Washington, Energy Secretary James D. Watkins wrote that "regulatory structures that were appropriate in the 1930's are no longer appropriate" for public utilities.
 
Bank Fund Is Threatened
 Paradoxically, many of the same forces that led to the laws in the 1930's are contributing to their demise: a banking system in turmoil and securities markets plagued by scandal. By 1933, half of the $50 billion of securities sold in the nation during the prior 13 years were worthless. More than 5,000 banks failed from 1930 to 1932, resulting in depositor losses of almost $800 million, or more than $6 billion in 1990 dollars. Four thousand banks failed in 1933.
The fund that insures bank deposits is now at its lowest level since it was created in the Depression, and by many accounts it will be out of money by year's end. In the last few years, an annual average of about 200 banks have failed, a rate that is significantly higher than that of previous decades. Lawmakers and the Bush Administration are using the plight of the fund as the political vehicle for a trainload of changes that would tear down many barriers erected during the Depression.
"The new view stems from a deregulation ethic and a belief that it will cost the Government less if the industry is able to consolidate," said Representative Jim Leach, Republican of Iowa. "The banks have come in demanding legislative changes with the clout of weakness, rather than strength. They are coming plaintively, saying survival is at issue."
The emerging political forces for change also reflect a fundamental shift in the debate.
"There is a different focus in the debate in Washington now," Professor Reich said. "The major voices are those of the securities industry and the banks. The concerns of the consumers, the small investors and the depositors that had been essential to the New Deal have been brushed aside. We are not in a period of populist upsurge. Most of America is quiescent."
There is significant empirical data to suggest that the fragmentation of economic power has contributed to the crisis. A report to be released on Monday by the staff of the House Banking Committee has found that the bank insurance fund's precarious position is largely a result of the failure of small banks.
 
Fears of New Dangers
 The study said 99 percent of the 1,009 banks bailed out by the Government in the last six years were smaller than $1 billion in assets, resulting in net losses to the fund of more than $9.2 billion. By comparison, only 18 medium-sized and large banks failed, at a net loss to the fund of about $3.1 billion.
While the new view is likely to lead to significant new legislation over the coming weeks, some skeptics in Congress have raised concerns about its effect on the economy.
"The Administration is tying together the collapse of the banks, of which they are participants, with new powers that will lead to new losses," said Representative John D. Dingell, the Michigan Democrat who heads the Energy and Commerce Committee and is fighting to block many of the proposed changes. "It's the most ludicrious thing I've ever heard of."
He added, "I'm not going to attack my sister committees," referring to the action by the House and Senate Banking Committees. "But I am also not going to tell you that Congress always acts wisely."
Mr. Dingell's committee is expected to begin drafting an alternative bill this month that is less comprehensive than the House banking measure, but how the two will be reconciled remains to be played out.
Other members of Congress insist that while the legislation making its way through Congress does remove many of the Depression-era barriers, it also has adequate regulatory safeguards to prevent the catastrophic excesses of the 1920's.
"They have very careful safeguards and limitations," said Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., the Michigan Democrat who is chairman of the Banking Committee, referring to the legislation's new capital standards and requirements that regulators intervene earlier when an institution shows signs of trouble. "The legislation is intended to allow consolidation to occur, but only when it makes sense."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
For Once, Thin Look Is Out at Fashion Magazines

BYLINE: By DEIRDRE CARMODY

 BODY:
As the recession hits home in the fiercely competitive world of fashion magazines, the buzzword is now "partnering."
"You become involved in your clients' business and become partners with them more so than ever before," said Julie Lewit-Nirenberg, publisher of Mirabella. "The attitude is very different now. It's no longer selling the page; it's selling the relationship and saying to them, 'What can we do for you?' " 
 Publishers of fashion magazines are helping department stores around the country to woo shoppers. Magazine fashion directors are flying to San Francisco, Cleveland, Dallas and Boston to assist with store promotions and conduct fashion shows. The hope is, of course, that bonds formed with advertisers during lean times will be firmly in place when better times return.
 
Decline in Ad Pages
 Unlike some previous recessions, this one has come down hard on the rich, making itself particularly felt by advertisers of real estate, travel, cosmetics and expensive clothing.
Industrywide, magazine advertising pages were down 10.4 percent for the first seven months of 1991, the most recent figures from the Publishers Information Bureau show.
But the drop at fashion magazines is more severe. At Vogue, advertising pages were down 12.8 percent for the first nine months, as tracked by Media Industry Newsletter. For the same period, Elle was down 23.5 percent, Harper's Bazaar 24.6 percent And Mirabella 11.4 percent.
Even more significant was the drop in pages in each magazine's September fall fashion issue, which is one of the fattest of the year. Vogue was down 12.2 percent, to 423 pages; Elle was down 22.6 percent, to 257 pages; Harper's Bazaar was down 43 percent, to 130 pages, and three-year-old Mirabella, the youngest of the four, was down 14.8 percent, to 132 pages.
"Business simply doesn't exist; people are not buying at retail and stores are not putting in the inventory," said Anne Sutherland Fuchs, publisher of Vogue.
In addition to the unrest brought about by the advertising slump, Vogue, Elle and Harper's Bazaar have brought in new publishers in the last year, creating still more stir in the fashion field.
"The most constant of the bunch has been Mirabella, but there is a sense that the other publications are still groping and feeling their way to finding their identity," said Claude Fromm, executive vice president and media director of TBWA, the ad agency that represents Carillon Importers' Absolut vodka.
"The one that has it most together is Elle, in terms of where they are going," Mr. Fromm said. "Vogue is still considered the leading fashion publication, but there is a sort of ambivalence in terms of identity: Are they going younger? Are they making a fashion statement? And Harper's is still trying to get its act together."
Lean times, however, breed innovative and sometimes controversial ploys. "They are all being incredibly creative," said Matthew Rubel, president of Revlon's speciality-store unit. "Business is tough to come by and they have to work harder to get it."
Elle, for instance, packaged a videotape commercial and scented blotter card for Estee Lauder's Spellbound perfume, which were attached in plastic to the covers of 14,000 copies of the magazine in 10 cities.
"It's a new and different way for Estee Lauder to reach customers," Elle's publisher, Lawrence C. Burstein, said. "This is a way to reach people who were not in the stores."
 
Calvin Klein's Supplement
 But Ms. Fuchs of Vogue said called it "inappropriate to use the cover for commercial value."
"We do feel the cover is sacrosanct," she said. "We simply will not do it and we did turn it down."
One of the most innovative advertising efforts of the year came from Calvin Klein, a stalwart advertiser in fashion magazines, but the ad was not offered to them. Instead, the 116-page ad supplement for Calvin Klein Jeans, estimated to have cost more than $1 million, is being sent out with the October issue of Vanity Fair.
Mr. Klein said he had chosen Vanity Fair because it was "the hot book."
What no one wants to talk about on the record is which magazines give special discounts on their advertising rates. While most publishers deny discounting pages and most media directors or advertisers decline any comment on the subject, it is generally accepted that Conde Nast, publisher of Vogue and Vanity Fair, sticks to the rates listed on its official rate cards, while the others are what is usually referred to as "flexible."
"The other magazines will tailor their business to a client's needs," Mr. Fromm said. "There is nothing wrong with that. The whole idea is to have advertising work. My hunch is that if business continues the way it is going, Conde Nast is going to have to become a little more flexible."
In the meantime, however, the magazines are wooing advertisers as hard as they can. Recently, Harper's Bazaar teamed up with the Emporium, a San Francisco retailer, for a luncheon for 500 people.
Jade Hobson Charnin, the creative director at Mirabella, was the host of a fashion show at high tea at the Ritz Carlton in Cleveland.
Elle is including a miniature shopping bag in its October issue that will be filled with "Parisian chic" if presented at the Galeries Lafayette store in New York, which is scheduled to open in the fall.
And Vogue will be the host to 30 fashion shows with charity tie-ins around the country.
"We are seeding prospects for the future," said Carl Portale, Harper's Bazaar's publisher.

HEADLINE: Radio Outlet In Boston May Be Sold

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
The Emmis Broadcasting Corporation, whose seven radio stations include WFAN-AM and WQHT-FM in New York, may sell its Boston jazz station to help pay off $150 million in debt, its chairman, Jeffrey H. Smulyan, said yesterday.
Mr. Smulyan, who bought the Seattle Mariners baseball team with partners in 1989 for $75 million, also said he was considering selling the team. "Baseball has never been successful in Seattle," he said yesterday in a telephone interview. 
 But Mr. Smulyan said Emmis had no plans to sell WFAN, the country's first all-sports station. Crain's New York Business reported in its current issue that Emmis, based in Indianapolis, might be forced to sell WFAN.
 
Pressure to Cut Debt
 "We are not going to do that," Mr. Smulyan said . "You never say 'never,' but it is not something we are considering." He said WFAN had annual revenues of more than $20 mllion and was one of the top three stations in New York in billings.
Saying "Boston is on the block," Mr. Smulyan acknowledged that Emmis was losing money and was under pressure from banks to trim its debt, which consumes $16 million a year in interest payments. The Boston station, WCDJ-FM, is likely to sell for about $10 million, he said, adding that no other deals were pending.
Emmis borrowed heavily in the 1980's to acquire stations, including five that it bought from NBC in 1988 for more than $100 million. By 1989 Emmis owned 11 stations and had $230 million in debt, but has since sold 4 of them to reduce the debt by $80 million. The company also owns stations in Los Angeles, St. Louis, Chicago and Indianapolis.
 
Effect of Interest Payments
 Mr. Smulyan said that although cash flow from the stations was enough to cover interest payments, they were not profitable after paying interest.
He said the company's financial problems were caused by a downturn in the radio market. Radio stations, along with newspapers and other media, have been hurt by a drop in advertising amid the recession.
"The world has changed," Mr. Smulyan. "It is not the best of times for the communications industry."

HEADLINE: Regulation, Japan Style

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 8

 BODY:
For American trade negotiators and other outsiders who complain that Japan's economy is closed and indecipherable, two weeks of parliamentary hearings here about the continuing stock market scandals have offered fresh evidence of how difficult it can be to figure out what is permitted or prohibited in Japan and how foreigners might compete on equal terms.
In their testimony, the barons of Japan's securities industry offered no new bombshells about the unfolding financial scandals, in which 21 securities firms have acknowledged that they compensated their largest customers for trading losses. 
 But the unusual hearings have proved a milestone of sorts by exposing what many people regard as the most opaque feature of Japan's stock market regulation: the administrative guidance provided by the powerful Finance Ministry.
The agency's guidance has no solid legal basis and is often given orally, but securities firms are expected to follow it rigorously. Some foreign and Japanese experts have complained that this guidance is formulated, disseminated and enforced in such a secretive manner that outsiders are often left in the dark.
The testimony has provided ammunition for United States trade negotiators, who have promised they will renew their assault next month on what they consider a barrier to foreign participation in the financial markets. American officials have been pressing the Japanese Government to issue all regulatory guidelines publicly, in writing, and to apply them equally to all market participants.
"The problem of transparency has been an issue for a long time, and this just means it will continue to be a keyand important issue," one American official said.
At the heart of the issue is a seeming contradiction that emerged from the hearings: The top executives of major securities houses admitted that they explicitly permitted their brokers to violate a Finance Ministry ban on covering trading losses of customers. This brought an apparently unprecedented wave of improper behavior, with the 21 securities houses making at least $1.3 billion of compensation payments.
At the same time, it has also been disclosed that the ministry knew about this practice but did nothing to halt the violations or punish the firms until the tax authorities uncovered the violatons earlier this year.
Clearly, many experts agree, the Finance Ministry appears to have tacitly approved of loss-compensation. In other words, the ministry issued an order explicitly banning loss compensation but secretly permitted it because of unusual circumstances that existed at that time. The ministry had issued an order forcing the securities firms to close a kind of corporate stock-trading account. Since many of those accounts appeared to be in the red, it was widely expected that some kind of compensation would have to be provided to avoid alienating major customers.
"The visible guidance was clearly just a pose to the public -- to try and show the ministry did not approve," said Takaaki Wakasugi, a professor of finance at Tokyo University and co-head of a research institute at the University of Michigan. "They are just pretending to be in the right. They must have known that this was going on and quietly permitted the compensation. That's why these hearings were not testimony, they were ceremony."
 
Whose Scandal Is It?
 Chalmers Johnson, a professor of Japanese political economy at the University of California at San Diego, observed: "What this underscores is that this is not a securities industry scandal as much as a Finance Ministry scandal. In this case, the real administrative guidance was camouflaged. They're just playing grand Kabuki and pretending their dictates were violated."
Perhaps the key moment in understanding what happened came in June, at the annual meeting of the Nomura Securities Company. The firm's president at the time, Yoshihisa Tabuchi, startled his own firm and the Finance Ministry by proclaiming somewhat angrily that the ministry had approved the payment of compensation.
Mr. Tabuchi later resigned, and Nomura tried to erase his outburst by calling the remark inappropriate. But most Japanese seemed to accept that Mr. Tabuchi's sin was candor.
Nobody would be questioning Japan's regulatory system, of course, if the ministry relied on laws rather than guidance. Japan has securities laws, many of them patterned after American statutes and written by the American Occupation forces after the war. But they are rarely if ever invoked.
 
No Formal Charges
 For instance, although a variety of penalties have been meted out for the improper compensation -- from pay cuts and resignations to fines and suspensions -- there has yet to be a formal charge of wrongdoing or an open legal process in which evidence was presented.
Some Japanese have justified relying on guidance by arguing that theirs is such a harmonious society and that bureaucratic dictates are so respected that the most efficient means of regulating the huge financial markets is not through cumbersome legislation and the courts, but with extra-legal commands.
Left unstated is the fact that when guidance is employed there is no check or counterbalance and no means of airing the dictates in public debate.
Nearly all the improper compensation payments were made to cover losses in a type of corporate account known as an eigyo tokkin, roughly translated as a money trust. These are discretionary accounts where corporations put spare cash, with the brokerage firms making all the investment decisions.
 
Phase-Out Ordered
 Several years ago the ministry decided to reduce conflicts of interest by forcing brokerage houses to do all their management of stock-market funds through independent asset management subsidiaries. The idea was to insure that investment decisions were made out of professional judgment and not to generate commissions or to push up the prices of stocks through heavy buying.
But when the brokerage concerns were instructed to phase out the eigyo tokkin accounts, it was well understood that those accounts in the red would require some compensation, several experts said. Nonetheless, the ministry issued its public guidance that compensation was prohibited.
"There was an understanding that the securities firms could not comply at once," said Michiya Matsukawa, chairman of the Nikko Research Center and a former top Finance Ministry official. "There had to be some time to handle this situation in an orderly way."
 
Inadequate Warning
 Making matters worse, brokerage-house customers were not given ample warning of the rule change or ample time to prepare for the shift, some experts said.
"The real problem was that the ministry issued two incompatible guidances," said Yukio Noguchi, an economics professor at Hitotsubashi University and a former ministry official. "That is why I don't think defiance is the appropriate word for what the securities firms did in paying the compensation. The issue was that formally speaking, the ministry could not admit it created a situation where there was loss compensation."

HEADLINE: SOVIET TURMOIL;
Soviet Georgia Chief, In Quest of Freedom, Sees Only Enemies

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TBILISI, U.S.S.R., Sept. 7

 BODY:
For the beleaguered and increasingly insecure leader of Soviet Georgia, who has struggled for decades to get the Soviet Union and the world to recognize the independence of his fiercely proud republic in the Caucasus Mountains, the victory in Moscow of the forces of democracy after last month's failed coup was nothing to cheer about.
President Zviad K. Gamsakhurdia says he wants nothing to do with the Soviet Union any more, whether it is a democracy or a dictatorship. All he wants is real autonomy for Georgia, which he rules like a freely elected despot, preoccupied with plots, real and imagined, to do him in and keep his land under Moscow's domination. 
 Since Georgia declared independence on April 9, only Romania has recognized it, and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has ignored it.
Mr. Gamsakhurdia, as if paralyzed, has let the Georgian economy go to ruin until the republic is free, and last week his government forbade the export of meat, milk, vegetables, building material and most other goods, all in acute shortage.
His government's price controls and tax laws discourage private enterprise, seemingly a natural tendency for a land known over the centuries for its traders. Mr. Gamsakhurdia blames a Soviet "embargo" for the shortages, and said on Saturday that Georgia could not even begin to make economic progress until Moscow let it go its own way.
The difficulties of this republic of five and a half million people seem to show that autonomy is hardly the end of trouble for the long-unwilling partners of the Soviet Union; independence for the Soviet republics also raises new problems.
Mr. Gamsakhurdia's behavior has puzzled many former friends, even those who know that Georgia is the land of Medea and the birthplace of Stalin -- an old, querulous mountain country where intrigues are as gnarled and thick on the ground as the grapevines in people's backyards.
On Saturday, speaking of plots against his leadership by Georgia's enemies in Moscow, Tbilisi and even in the United States, he said that his recently dismissed Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, the head of the national guard, and the leader of the opposition in the republic's Parliament had all betrayed him.
He recently suspended publication of the most critical Georgian-language opposition newspapers, setting off nightly demonstrations in the streets of the capital calling for his resignation. And a small-scale civil war continues in the South Ossetian Autonomous Region north of Tbilisi, where separatists want to secede from Georgia and join a similar region just north of the Caucasus, in Russia.
 
All a Plot
 To Mr. Gamsakhurdia, all this is part of a conspiracy to thwart Georgian independence.
"Moscow wants to create civil war here," he said Saturday, and he held little hope that things would change. "I believe Gorbachev continues this usual line against Georgia," he added. He said that Boris N. Yeltsin, President of the Russian federated republic, had promised to consider recognition, but so far had done nothing.
Anti-Georgian provocateurs in the United States are keeping Washington from extending diplomatic recognition, he said, and Moscow and its agents are waging a whispering campaign in the West: "Here is a fascist dictator, and the people are against him. You must not recognize Georgia."
These hardly sound like the words of a man who was elected with 87 percent of the popular vote in May. Now, in early September, his power seems to be waning prematurely.
Last Monday, a violent clash between demonstrators and special police units in Rustaveli Square, near the center of Tbilisi, raised fears that there might be a macabre replay of the events of April 9, 1989, when Soviet troops used entrenching tools, and allegedly poison gas, against demonstrators, killing 20 of them.
This time it was Georgian versus Georgian as gunshots were fired, by policemen and perhaps also by demonstrators. Twenty people were wounded, four seriously.
Protesters have been out in the streets every night since. But the police, instead of charging them with shields and nightsticks, have sealed off part of the area with buses drawn up in front of the pink stone neo-Classical government headquarters. Down a winding boulevard, demonstrators and onlookers ambled under trees, listening to recorded speeches demanding Mr. Gamsakhurdia's resignation and new elections.
 
The Coup
 Treading Carefully, And Getting Burned

The 52-year-old President, dignified in a dark suit and a thin mustache, sounded irritated, chopping the air with impatient gestures.
Surrounded by bodyguards and journeying back and forth from his home in the hills above Tbilisi in a cavalcade of armored black Mercedes limousines, Mr. Gamsakhurdia seems increasingly distant from his dissident past.
The son of the pre-eminent writer of modern Georgia, Konstantin Gamsakhurdia, he was first jailed for nationalist activities in 1956, at the age of 17. He finished his last prison term in 1980, after three years behind bars for "anti-Soviet activity."
His latest troubles have intensified since the failure of the coup in Moscow.
By his own account and those of others, President Gamsakhurdia trod a tightrope during the revolt, agreeing to cause no trouble in Georgia and appealing to his people to remain calm, while calling on the world to show its support for the forces of democracy -- in Georgia and elsewhere.
Defying an order by the coup leaders, he said, he also refused to dissolve his 15,000-member national guard, a group created in November from the ranks of Georgians who objected to service in the Soviet Army.
Gen. Valery A. Patrikeyev, the Soviet troop commander of the Caucasus Military District, appeared on Georgian television during the coup and said his relationship with Mr. Gamsakhurdia was "excellent." Mr. Gamsakhurdia later carefully distanced himself from the putsch attempt, saying it had not been clear to him that it might not have been a charade.
But his opponents seized upon the events and charged that he had been ambivalent. Last Monday's rally was called by Georgi Chanturia, the head of the National Democratic Party, one of a coalition of groups that boycotted Parliament elections last year and the presidential voting in May.
"We wanted to expose his links with the coup leaders," Mr. Chanturia said in an interview, saying he had proof of the President's complicity. The proof turned out to be an assertion, made by the dismissed Prime Minister, Tengiz Sigua, that a Deputy Prime Minister "must have" discussed plans with the coup makers during a one-day trip to Moscow on Aug. 18, the Sunday the coup began.
Before last Monday's rally began, Mr. Chanturia said, the President's commandos charged the crowd with batons, firing pistols into the air. A videotape of the incident was broadcast on Soviet television the next evening. Mr. Gamsakhurdia's officials say the police were attacked first, but the President said they should not have used their weapons in any case.
On Wednesday, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, the former Soviet Foreign Minister and a Georgian, commented on the violence. He said on television that it was a direct result of Mr. Gamsakhurdia's refusal to talk with the opposition.
People here remember Mr. Shevardnadze as their Interior Minister and Communist Party leader, the job he held in Tbilisi when Mr. Gamsakhurdia was being prosecuted for nationalist activities. Now, in the President's eyes, Mr. Shevardnadze is in league with those who want to bring him down.
The violence also split the Georgian national guard, whose commanding officer, Tengiz Kitovani, broke with Mr. Gamsakhurdia and said the force would "resist any activity directed against the people."
Mr. Gamsakhurdia said Saturday that he no longer recognized Mr. Kitovani as being in charge. Now he groups him among his enemies -- along with Mr. Sigua; his former Foreign Minister, Georgi Khoshtaria, dismissed in August for "wanting to make his own foreign policy," and Nodar Notadze, another longtime former comrade of the President's, who is now the leader of the opposition in Parliament.
"He is very close with the armed opposition now," Mr. Gamsakhurdia said of his onetime colleague in the dissident movenment, "and he protects them in Parliament -- also now these criminals."
 
Home and Abroad
 Little Recognition; Rebellion Aplenty

At the empty and echoing Foreign Ministry, a former Communist Party school and agricultural institute up one of Tbilisi's steep hills, Deputy Foreign Minister Nodar Gabashvili complained about how difficult it was to get foreign nations to recognize Georgian independence.
"The extra-parliamentary opposition wants the world to see Georgia as a Soviet colony, and not to recognize us until the Soviet Army is forced out and new general elections are called," he said. "Under our former Foreign Minister, our ministry didn't make much effort at counter-propaganda."
Mr. Gabashvili said he hoped that the new minister, Murman Omanidze, would have better luck. Mr. Gamsakhurdia said the new Prime Minister, Vissarion Gugushvili, would meet with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d in Moscow on Monday to plead Georgia's case for recognition by the United States.
"We have more democracy than in your countries," Mr. Gamsakhurdia told a group of Western correspondents. "Nobody can stop traffic in the streets in your country and make rallies, can they?" But, he added, "When you are in war, you cannot think of democracy. Now we are in war."
The struggle in the South Ossetian Autonomous Region, which has been formally abolished by Mr. Gamsakhurdia, has taken perhaps a hundred lives so far this year, and sent 50,000 Ossetians fleeing north across the mountains.
On Thursday, the government says, four Georgian partisans there were killed and a herd of sheep was stolen by the Ossetian rebels, who have vowed to continue the struggle for their own independence. The Soviet press agency Tass reported that more Ossetians and Georgians were killed in shootings on Saturday.
Mr. Gamsakhurdia refuses to give independence to the Ossetians because, he said, the separatist leaders are agents of Moscow, which hopes to divide and continue to rule Georgia. He has declared a state of emergency in what he calls "the former southern Ossetia" and issued orders to arrest its leaders. They have gone underground.
"The leaders of South Ossetia officially supported the coup in Moscow," he said, reading from statements published in their Russian-language newspaper, Sovetskaya Ossetiya, on Aug. 20. "This territory belongs to Georgia. National minorities have only cultural rights in every country, not political autonomy."
Mr. Chanturia, once Mr. Gamsakhurdia's friend, said of him, "He is a pathological coward, and a coward who holds power is very dangerous."
The Georgian leader is a complex character, a man who told the court at his sentencing in 1978, "I sincerely regret what I have done and condemn the crime I have committed." The statement, taped and edited, was broadcast over Soviet television at the time, and made many people wonder what had come over Mr. Gamsakhurdia.
In an interview with this correspondent in January, he explained that he had bargained with the K.G.B. and expressed regret for distributing "anti-Soviet propaganda," books and materials on the United States that had been provided by an American diplomat and several journalists. "I never renounced my Georgian nationalistic activities," he said, but added he feared that if he did not compromise, he would lose his citizenship and be expelled.
He said he had also agreed to testify as a prosecution witness against this reporter and Harold Piper, then a correspondent for the Baltimore Sun, in a July 1978 case charging the American reporters with slander. The Soviet State Committee for Television and Radio brought charges against the reporters for writing articles reporting friends' and relatives' doubts about the genuineness of his televised confession and apology. The correspondents did not take part in the trial in Moscow, where Mr. Gamsakhurdia testified that the broadcast confession had been accurate.
His three-year sentence was later reduced to two years, since he had been held in solitary confinement for a year before his arrest. And instead of being exiled to Siberia, he was released after serving the two years in jail and allowed to work in Georgia.
Despite all his troubles, Mr. Gamsakhurdia remains popular among many Georgians. Crowds of supporters who gather in front of his headquarters every day do not want him to go.
"Those people just want disorder so the West won't recognize us," said Gabunia Daredzhali, 40 years old, a Tbilisi office worker. "They want the world to think we're killing each other. Our President is not a dictator; he's a good Christian believer."
Mr. Gamsakhurdia addressed a rally of several thousand in front of the government buildings on Saturday afternoon, to cheers. But the police had barricaded the square with buses yet again, giving the event an almost claustrophobic air.

HEADLINE: Using Books Instead of Brooms to Escape Welfare

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TULSA, Okla.

 BODY:
Each weekday morning, Alica Kimble, a single mother of four, joins what is meant to be a revolution in the nation's welfare system.
She takes her 3-year-old son to a community center, where he attends a preschool class while she studies for her high school equivalency degree. She is one of hundreds of thousands of welfare parents newly required to leave home and take steps toward self-support. Like many others, she is hoping that the investment in education can rewrite a life story so far filled with the sad endings of dead-end jobs and welfare office waiting rooms. 
 Three years after Congress pledged sweeping changes in the welfare system, the question that arises is this: Do the experiences of Ms. Kimble and others like her represent welfare's promising future? Or will their experiences repeat its discouraging past?
The law, which took effect last November, requires states to place a rising percentage of their welfare recipients in work, training or education programs. But it gives states much discretion in designing those programs. And in a policy shift that carries great but untested hopes, many states are urging people to return to the classroom rather than seek immediate, low-paying jobs.
The move from brooms to books is especially striking in Oklahoma, which has a long history of promoting work programs. Administrators here, as across the country, herald the change as a hopeful one, meant to respond to changes in the labor market.
"You've got to have some skills to be competitive," said Paul Walker, programs supervisor for the Oklahoma Department of Human Services. "If we don't do it, we'll be a Third World country like Mexico."
But some critics worry that the trend sets up welfare parents for further failure by putting them back in classroom settings where they have already had problems.
 
Avenue of Escape?
 "My biggest fear is that they're going to put people into a never-ending stream of self-esteem classes," said Mickey Kaus, who is writing a book on the welfare system and who advocates replacing it with a system of public jobs. "It becomes an excuse for not coming to grips with the labor market."
Nationwide, only about a quarter of the welfare parents participating in the programs are working or looking for work, while the rest have returned to some sort of classroom.
The choice between education and work flows from the Family Support Act, the heralded 1988 law that sought to impose a new social contract on the world of welfare. Calling on the poor to do more to help themselves, the law threatens to reduce the aid of those who refuse to seek training, schooling or work.
But it also pledges society's help in new ways -- by creating more programs to help parents off welfare and providing them child care and transportation. The law also allows parents to keep receiving child care and Medicaid a year after they leave public assistance and promises to make more absent fathers pay child support.
 
Earlier, Modest Results
 When the act passed, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat and the law's chief architect, said it would "bring a generation of young American women back into the mainstream of American life."
In lobbying for the law, its supporters pointed to research by the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation, which showed that experimental welfare-to-work programs begun in the early 1980's had increased parents' earnings and decreased welfare expenses. But most of those programs emphasized quick work-oriented activities, like job search clubs, intended to put parents immediately to work. Few stressed education.
Many of those who left welfare found only low-paying jobs and remained poor. And the programs did little to reach the most disadvantaged. States are now gambling that education can make a bigger difference.
While evaluation data is still years off, those on either side of the work-versus-education debate might find their views confirmed in Ms. Kimble's past. One of 11 brothers and sisters raised on welfare by a single mother, Ms. Kimble, who is 28 years old, left school at age 14 and had her first child two years later. Since then, her life has followed a hopscotch pattern of dead-end jobs, pregnancy, adult education classes and welfare.
It is possible to argue that, with an eighth-grade education, she has never had the skills to make it on her own. She has worked as a hotel dishwasher and housekeeper, a Burger King counter attendant and a washwoman at a commercial laundry. But she quit each job. "I didn't want to be on my knees cleaning the tubs and making up the beds," she said.
It is also true that past educational programs have not seemed to help. She has attended two other programs to help her get a general equivalency degree. She joined a job club meant to give her the confidence to handle employment. And she attended a private trade school, where she dropped out and accrued a $2,500 student loan debt. Is this program different?
Ms. Kimble gives conflicting answers. "I think it's about the same," said Ms. Kimble, a pleasant woman who has painted the letters of her first name across the five shining red nails of her left hand. But then she added that having the associated preschool classes for her son puts her mind at ease by having him nearby as she studies. And he is so eager to attend, she said, that he gets angry if she wants to stay home.
"If he didn't motivate me, I wouldn't get here half the time," she said.
 
States Stress Classroom
 In a recent interview, Senator Moynihan said he was encouraged by reports from state officials who have lauded education as the missing welfare link. "Gee, I wish people wouldn't knock this until we have 10 years to find out," he said.
Under the 1988 law each state was required in November to have 7 percent of its welfare population enrolled in a job or education program.
The programs can be expensive, especially in a recession. Congress offered states $800 million for the program in 1990, but states, short on the necessary matching funds, spent only $272 million of it.
Reports from the Department of Health and Human Services bear out the emphasis on education. Nationwide, 4.5 million families were receiving welfare in March, and 510,000, or 11 percent, were said to be participating in a job or education program.
Of them, 33 percent were enrolled in a basic education course, 11 percent in a post-secondary school and 16 percent were learning a technical skill. Another 15 percent were in miscellaneous school programs. By contrast, only 4 percent were in an actual work setting, and another 21 percent were in programs to help them quickly find work.
In Oklahoma, Mr. Walker said that the shift toward education also allows states to save money by piggybacking onto programs with independent financing.
Oklahomans now have a cornucopia of programs. One of the most creative is at Parkview Terrace, a south Tulsa housing project, where a nonprofit group teaches welfare recipients to run day care centers from their homes.
At Tulsa Junior College, Project Esteem tries to prepare welfare parents for high school degrees through special counseling and computerized lessons.
Sarah Battle, a 30-year-old mother of six who joined the program in mid-August, said she had dropped out of about a half-dozen basic education programs. But she says now that walking college hallways "does something for my self-esteem." After the course ends, she said, she plans to study accounting at the college rather than immediately seek work.
Mr. Kaus, the advocate of a public jobs program, said some education programs encourage unrealistic expectations. "You're not going to get the $25,000-a-year job unless you start with the $15,000 job," he said.
Administrators at Oklahoma State University in Okmulgee, an hour south of Tulsa, provided 22 promising welfare parents with free housing, tuition, food, books, child care and counseling as they studied technical trades like air-conditioning repair and computer programming.
About 16 months into the two-year program, 12 have left. Bob Klabenes, the campus director, says, "I was a little naive," but argues the program can still work for the right kind of person. He offers as an example Connie Brunk. The salutatorian of her high school class in rural Muldrow, Ms. Brunk, 35 years old, said she has often held two jobs at a time and was never on welfare until a recent divorce.
She brought her two children, and a Norman Vincent Peale book, to the campus. "I got out of a dead-end job, a dead-end life," Ms. Brunk said. But, she added, "I'm not the typical one."

HEADLINE: Grateful Dead: Alive and Thriving

BYLINE: By PETER WATROUS

 BODY:
In a recessionary pop music environment in which tours keel over and die and radio and MTV stars hit the road only to cancel their tours, the Grateful Dead, 26 years old and counting, are doing better than ever. So far this year, their gross for live shows has been higher than any other band's. For the first six months of the year, the Dead earned $20 million. Playing stadium-size venues -- something no other tour has dared do this summer -- the band has sold out virtually every show it has played, and the prediction is that for the rest of the year, it will sell out everything that's left.
Yesterday the Grateful Dead arrived in New York to play nine sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden. 
 "If I knew what made us popular, I'd bottle it," one of the group's leaders, the guitarist Jerry Garcia, said in a telephone interview. "Whatever it is, it invented us, we didn't invent it. The audience thinks we're providing more than music, but we don't let on what we're providing, intentionally. We're elliptical. Someone once wrote that we're a real cheap vacation to Bermuda, which is kind of right. But insofar as we're providing a safe context to be together with a lot of people who aren't afraid of each other, which is real valuable in New York, I'd guess, we're important."
Part of the Grateful Dead experience is its audience. However the baby-boom generation has ended up making a living, it still likes to go to concerts, perhaps dreaming of California freedom and San Francisco bohemia. People sliding in from a hard day on Wall Street sit next to people two generations younger in tie-dye whose glazed eyes don't come from staring at a computer all day and who have been following the tour, showing up at every concert. Standard parts of the scene are the Grateful Dead A.A. chapter, out in force, and the officially sanctioned bootleggers, who sit beneath a forest of microphones taping each precious drop of music. And unreconstructed older hippies, role models and mentors to the teen-agers in the audience, also show up in tie-dye but with streaks of gray in their hair.
Each show is an event, a spectacle that draws meaning from itself as much as it does from the music.
"With all the kinds of people that come, old-timers and kids, it's a little hard to tell what makes them all have a valuable experience," Mr. Garcia said. "I used to wonder about it and worry. Suppose we're misleading all these people? But it's not really like that, I realized, because we're not selling a point of view. We stay away from advocating much at all, so people are left on their own to imagine who we are."
Though the core of the band -- Mr. Garcia and Bob Weir on guitars, Phil Lesh on bass, and Mickey Hart and Bill Kreutzmann on percussion -- has been together since 1968, the loss of its pianist, Brent Mydland, to a drug overdose last year and the subsequent inclusion of Vince Welnick and Bruce Hornsby on keyboards have meant that the band has been changing its sound. Though it still does its standard two-set shows, with a long drum interlude, and though it still performs many of its classic songs -- playing without a set list, the band can do six nights without repeating itself -- it is developing a thicker and harder sound. Not that this has changed the audience's experience too much; the shows still feature people dancing in the aisles, performing a particularly arrhythmic dance that's specific to Grateful Dead shows.
"The band is basically a new band with the two new guys," Mr. Garcia said. "Those guys have to catch up with 25 years of stuff, and we have to learn to hear what their unique capabilities are. In the short run, it's a setback, but in the long run it's an advantage. The band is more solid now; it's lost some of its lightness but there's a little more rhythmic precision, which we could always use."
 
Going Out Separately
 Mr. Garcia has been busy recently, putting out two albums, including one, "The Jerry Garcia Band," (Arista) culled from a tour he did with his own band, featuring songs like "The Way You Do the Things You Do," "Dear Prudence" and "Tangled Up in Blue." Typically, the songs are completely remade, as much a comment on the tunes' potential as about the original version of the songs. The other album, "Jerry Garcia/David Grisman" (Acoustic Disc), is a series of acoustic pieces by Mr. Garcia and his old mandolinist friend, David Grisman.
"I can afford to be more selective now, and I have the luxury to pick and choose that I haven't always had," Mr. Garcia said. "I worked as a studio musician in the late 1960's and early 70's, without that much concern for who I was recording with. Everything I've done recently is something that I wanted to do."
Mr. Garcia mentioned possible projects with Paul Kantner, the former Jefferson Airplane and Starship guitarist, and with Mr. Hornsby. And he has just appeared in some ads for Levi's jeans: "Me, Hornsby and Branford Marsalis," Mr. Garcia said. "Spike Lee directed, and I figure if Spike can sell out, so can I."
Of all the major rock guitarists to arrive in the 1960's, Mr. Garcia is arguably the most musically literate. He's just as at home talking about Indian improvisation as he is about John Coltrane or about Brazilian mandolin players. Taking bluegrass and jazz as a conceptual framework, his solos, shifting easily from harmonic color to harmonic color, always sidestep cliches. And his improvisations swing and crest the same way a jazz musician's might, with an intensity that isn't predicated on volume. He's one of the few rockers, in fact, who can sustain a lengthy improvisation.
"I'm still learning," he said. "As long as I'm still learning I can keep playing, and it's going to be fun. There's a certain problem-solving aspect to improvisation that I like, it's thinking on your feet. There's an intellectual and emotional side to it, and the emotional side I can't quite articulate. It's one of those things you feel or you don't. The intellectual is easer to grasp, it's the bead game, with infinite ways a solo can go. Freezing the choices in time and choosing, that's the satisfaction. As I get older I'm starting to perceive a greater sense of composition, a sense of contour and development that is missing in my early stuff. The earlier stuff, truthfully, is embarrassing."
It is the improvisational aspect of the Grateful Dead's music that keeps it fresh, even as the band's members reach an age that at one time would have been thought impossible for a functioning rock group. (Mr. Garcia is 49 years old; Mr. Lesh is the oldest at 51.)
"If Benny Goodman and Pablo Casals could do it, so can we," said Mr. Garcia. "I keep playing and touring because I enjoy it. But it can be labor intensive. Rehearsing the Grateful Dead is major work. It's one of the reasons we don't come up with new material every tour. The band is evolutionary, and where everybody learns a new tune right away, deciding what to play goes on for years. Everybody in the band is so amazingly idiosyncratic, nobody plays a formula. From a writer's point of view, there's two years' worth of discomfort performing a new tune. About the second year it starts turning into something.
"But, you know, everything is always subject to change."

HEADLINE: In Japan, Mostly Mozart Plays Well, or Even Better

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 8

 BODY:
Mozart in the department stores. Mozart coins. Mozart on television and radio. Even a Mozart brand of rice wine, or sake, has been produced in this bicentennial year of the great composer's death, as Japan has taken what in other countries was a preoccupation and made it an obsession.
Last week Japanese audiences flocked to a nine-concert version of the Mostly Mozart Festival, imported direct from Lincoln Center, the first time that the popular New York City ensemble has traveled abroad. 
 Under the baton of Gerard Schwarz, Mostly Mozart has been a hit, drawing enthusiastic applause and large crowds -- though not a sold-out hall. A reviewer said today that opening night "made one well understand the festival policy of enjoying Mozart to the utmost with the best performers."
Festival promoters are so pleased that they have already announced plans to bring Mostly Mozart back to Japan next year.
The annual festival in New York City finished its 25th season two weeks ago. After a day off and a day of rehearsals, the orchestra left for Tokyo, where it has been at Orchard Hall at the Bunkamura (Culture Village), a sleek complex established two years ago by the Tokyu department store.
"Of all the places we could bring our festival, this is the place I would choose," said Mr. Schwarz. "One reason for Japan's great economic success is its respect for culture. We as artists want to play for a sophisticated and appreciative public. That exists here."
 
Consumers of Classical Music
 To which might be added that Japan, because of its growing economic clout, also accounts for an enormous percentage of classical music sales on tapes and compact disks. Thus the festival's coming here is testimony to the power of Japanese consumers in the classical music world.
"When I say cultural capital, I mean that careers can be made in this city, just the way they can be made in New York," said Mr. Schwarz.
Vladimir Feltsman, who performed the Concertos No. 23 and 24 to great applause this week, agreed. "Let's face it, Japan sells more classical CD's than any other single country in the world," he said. "Japanese are always striving for the best -- and fortunately for them, they can buy it."
Although the festival began Aug. 30 and ended on Saturday night, after nine concerts, only one review has appeared so far. It was extremely favorable. The Japan Economic Journal singled out the performance of two arias from "The Marriage of Figaro" by Cecilia Bartoli, a mezzo- soprano.
"She showed a kind of Oriental beauty and sensitivity," the paper said. "Schwarz's conducting offered good assistance to her excellent performance."
The Japanese music season generally does not begin until late September, so no one seems disappointed that the festival has sold only about 70 percent of its tickets in the 2,150-seat hall, a shoebox-shaped auditorium with a high ceiling and swept-back balconies.
Uzuhiko Tanaka, managing director of the Tokyo Bunkamura, said ticket sales were defraying only about half the $1.5 million it cost to put on the festival. Part of the problem, he said, was that at the request of Lincoln Center, the Bunkamura has lowered the price of tickets.
 
Appealing Prices
 Ticket prices range from $22 to $58, whereas the minimum price of a normal ticket for an international orchestra is usually about $88. Mr. Tanaka said he admired Lincoln Center's philosophy of keeping prices low to appeal to an audience of students and tourists, and readily agreed to its request.
"If we succeed with the Lincoln Center philosophy, we'll be getting a new kind of audience accustomed to going to concerts," he said.
It has been an arduous time for the orchestra, Mr. Schwarz said. Mostly Mozart has toured upstate New York and a few other places and had a shortened version for several years in Washington, but nothing like the Tokyo trip has been attempted before.
"At Lincoln Center, we do about 45 concerts, including repeats," Mr. Schwarz said. "It's actually 14 orchestra programs in 28 performances. Here we're doing seven different programs -- in essence, half our season in a very condensed fashion. It's a great testament to the orchestra."
The festival has performed a smattering of symphonies, concertos, arias and other works, including an evening devoted entirely to music for winds, supplemented by a few dozen bassoonists, oboists, horn players and other Japanese players based in Japan.
Mostly Mozart is hardly the only Mozart observance in Japan this year, however. Most of Tokyo's orchestras are slating special Mozart programs, and on Jan. 27, Mozart's birthday, there was an unusual concert of Mozart music conducted by Norio Ohga, president of Sony. Mr. Ohga is famous for making a personal commitment to the quality of the Sony Walkman and other audio equipment.
There was a Salzburg Mozart Week last March, and Hiroshi Asakawa, editor of a leading classical music magazine, said the amount of Mozart music being heard here was extraordinary. "Within two years, I think we'll see every piece of Mozart music played in Japan," he said.
Various city governments have held Mozart festivals. Mozart books have sold well, partly because of the phenomenal success of "Amadeus," the movie and the play, a few years ago. The Japanese production of the Peter Shaffer play featured a popular Kabuki actor as Mozart's rival, Salieri.
And recently Toshiba got into the act by capitalizing brazenly on the popularity of the shy and smiling daughter-in-law of Emperor Akihito, Kiko Kawashima, who is pregnant. The company has put out a cassette of Mozart music billed as something to help "Kiko-san" enjoy her pregnancy.
At the other extreme, a sake brewer from the coastal area west of Tokyo is marketing a Mozart brand of sake, asserting that Mozart is regularly played at the brewery. "It seems that the malt grows well especially with Mozart music in the background," the company director told a newspaper.
"Japanese have always loved Mozart -- but this much?" asked the Asahi newspaper in a recent editorial. "The fuss that surrounds the 200th anniversary of his death makes us wonder what is going on."

Islander Takes Time Out as Negotiator

BYLINE: By JOE LAPOINTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LANSINGBURGH, N.Y., Sept. 8

 BODY:
For the first phase of training camp, the 64 Islanders on hand here are divided into four teams that play one another in a round-robin scrimmage tournament. One of those teams is called "Baumgartner's Heavy Metals." The captain is Ken Baumgartner, a veteran with a shaggy blond mane. The team is called "Heavy Metals" because he enjoys that brand of rock music and a rugged style of play.
On an as-yet unspecified day later this week, Baumgartner will travel to an as-yet undisclosed city in Canada to play yet another leadership role among another group of co-workers.
 
The Goal Ahead
 He is one of nine players on the committee of the National Hockey League Players Association that is trying to negotiate a new collective- bargaining agreement with team owners to replace a five-year pact that expires next Sunday.. 
 Never in its history has the players' union called a strike, nor have the owners ever ordered a lockout. But this summer's negotiations have progressed more slowly than any before. The season begins on Oct. 3. Is a strike a possibility?
"More than in any other year," said Baumgartner, who also serves as team player representative. "A work interruption can work both ways: a lockout or a strike. We've made considerable preparations for either in the last year. But our one goal is to work out a collective-bargaining agreement by Sept. 15."
Coming into the negotiations, the main aim of the union was to increase free agency. A limited version now exists, but in many cases a team that signs a free agent takes a severe risk because an arbitrator can award compensation in return.
Last week, because Brendan Shanahan left the New Jersey Devils to sign with St. Louis Blues, an arbitrator shocked many around the league by ordering Scott Stevens of the Blues to move to the Devils. Stevens had moved the previous summer as a free agent from the Washington Capitals to St. Louis. Although no arbitration was involved in that case, the Blues have to give Washington five first-round draft choices in exchange for Stevens.
Will the arbitrator's ruling have a chilling effect on teams trying to sign free agents?
"It certainly will," Baumgartner said. "A lot of people say it's a fix. But the arbitator was a judge, he wasn't appointed by just John Ziegler and the league. When you have to uproot Scott Stevens, he becomes a martyr for the system."
The harsh ruling against the Blues underscores how hockey players have less mobility than their colleagues in baseball.
"We'd love that," Baumgartner said of the free agency enjoyed by many baseball players. "The owners feel an open market would ruin hockey. They say they can't bid against each other and how could the Winnipegs survive against people like New York and Detroit?
"We feel that free agency hasn't hurt baseball teams like Minnesota. Baseball has enjoyed great prosperity under free agency. In hockey, in the past, we've made lots of concessions to keep jobs. We have given up some economic aspects for job security. It's our turn to be rewarded."
 
Boss Sits Across Table
 Bill Torrey, Baumgartner's boss, is president of the Islanders and a member of the negotiating committee for the board of governors. With his management colleagues, he sits across the table from Baumgartner and the other player negotiators -- one of whom is Bryan Trottier of Pittsburgh, the former Islander, who is president of the players' association.
Torrey said he couldn't speak about the bargaining issues because only Zieglerhas that authority. When asked last week about the talks, Ziegler, the league president, offered no details.
A new factor in this round of negotiations is the presence of Bob Goodenow, the deputy executive director of the union, who is soon to replace Alan Eagleson, the executive director, who established the union in the 1960's. Eagleson's critics have charged, in increasing volume, that the players have been too timid in their demands because Eagleson is too close to many team owners and to Ziegler, the league president.
"No extreme action needs to be taken on the 15th," Baumgartner said, referring to the current contract's expiration date, "but both sides would be susceptible to it. We're not asking for the world. We have the good of the league in mind. But we want to grow with the league. The owners are successful businessmen. They thrive on these negotiations. It's a little different for the players. It's a real-life experience you won't get in any classroom."

HEADLINE: Awaiting Congress in Capital: Soviet and Israeli Aid Questions

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 8

 BODY:
Congress comes back from vacation this week to face all the domestic problems it left behind five weeks ago and two major foreign policy questions it had not seen coming.
Hearings on the nomination of Clarence Thomas to be a Justice on the Supreme Court will begin Tuesday morning. Floor action on issues like abortion and unemployment will soon follow. 
 The lawmakers have had weeks, sometimes months, to make up their minds on those matters and on other domestic measures, among them banking, cable television, crime, gasoline taxes, energy policy and civil rights. But neither the upheaval in the Soviet Union nor the question of putting off $10 billion in loan guarantees for Israel was on their minds before they left Aug. 2.
A few lawmakers have been at the Capitol for at least some of the recess, but most scattered to their home states, took trips abroad or even went on old-fashioned family holidays, so there is nothing approaching cohesion on either issue.
 
A Mixed-Media Approach
 The lawmakers have talked more about the Soviet Union, arguing by news conference and fax machine about sending food, technical assistance and long-term aid to whatever government or governments have asked for help. There is a general expectation that food, at least, will be shipped, but there is uncertainty about where in the budget the money will come from.
One simpler step involving the Soviet Union is likely to be settled first, with both chambers expected to approve favored trade status in a relatively inexpensive move that would encourage change and unity. Its most noticeable impact on the low level of current trade would be to cut the price of imported vodka by about $1 a fifth.
Late last week another international issue -- one with important domestic political implications -- was dumped in their laps when the Administration said it would ask that action on a request for loan guarantees to Israel to help settle Soviet Jews be postponed until after a Mideast peace conference in October.
The initial reaction from those leaders who had anything to say was agreeable, but the rank and file, and the Israeli lobby, had not been heard from.Earlier this year they combined to overcome opposition in the Administration and the leadership to emergency aid for Israel during the Persian Gulf War.
Underlying how Congress will proceed on those issues is an insistent Democratic charge that President Bush cares more about foreign policy than domestic policy and would be quicker to justify enlarging the deficit for foreign emergencies than for American suffering.
That is the case lawmakers expect to make again in the next few days when they try once more to legislate additional benefits for workers who have been out of a job for at least half a year. On the day they adjourned for vacation, they passed a $5.8 billion bill to provide an additional 5 to 20 weeks of benefits for three million people.
 
Another Debate on Benefits
 Mr. Bush signed the bill in Kennebunkport, Me., but blocked the actual benefits by refusing to declare an emergency, a step required under last year's budget act if the deficit is to be increased. The lawmakers are likely to pass the measure again, and they may structure it so that Mr. Bush has to veto it to block benefits. "Congress will not allow the Bush Administration to ignore the plight of the unemployed," Representative Thomas J. Downey said Friday. Mr. Downey, Democrat of Long Island, is the bill's chief sponsor in the House.
Another immediate issue will be abortion, as the Senate votes Tuesday on cutting off debate on taking up the appropriation bill for the Departments of Labor and Health and Human Services. It now includes provisions that would allow Medicaid to pay for abortions in cases of rape and incest (abortions to save the life of the mother are the only ones now allowed under Medicaid) and it would keep the Administration from denying money to family planning clinics that provide information on abortion. The provision on clinics is more likely to survive, and Mr. Bush has threatened a veto if it does.
This is one of several appropriations bills likely to take up most of September in the Senate. Foreign aid may be postponed to keep the issue of loan guarantees from being forced to a vote, but appropriations for the Departments of Defense, Interior and Transportation will come up this month in the Senate. The appropriation for the District of Columbia that was vetoed by Mr. Bush over a provision allowing it to spend its own money on abortions is due for another vote in both chambers without that provision.
Mr. Thomas is not the only major appointment awaiting Senate confirmation. Hearings on Robert Gates's nomination to be the Director of Central Intelligence will begin Sept. 16, with the Intelligence Committee still seeking to determine just what he knew about the Iran-Contra scandal.
Another possibly stormy confirmation will be the Senate Banking Committee's examination of Robert L. Clarke, who is up for a second five-year term as comptroller of the currency beginning Sept. 26. His own investments and his office's supervision of the banking industry are among the issues.
There seems to be little doubt about the confirmation of Alan H. Greenspan to another term as chairman of the Federal Reserve or of William Taylor as chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, but the hearings are likely to develop into examinations of problems of the economy and of the banking and savings and loan industries.
 
Issues of Bank Business
 Legislation on issues of bank ownership and investments and interstate branching will probably reach the floors of both houses this fall. Replenishing the nearly insolvent F.D.I.C. is a major element of the legislation.
The House is expected to deal with broad anticrime legislation, which was passed by the Senate in July. It is also expected to contend with the highway authorization bill that was pulled back from floor action just before the recess when sharp opposition developed to the bill's nickel-a-gallon gasoline tax. The tax will probably be dropped, along with billions of dollars in projects it was intended to pay for, but the bill would still be quite different from the companion measure in the Senate that allows much more flexibility for states to spend "highway" money on mass transit and other projects.
A major civil rights battle is ahead for the Senate sometime this fall. In dealing with a bill that would make it easier to sue and collect damages in job discrimination cases, Administration supporters oppose a compromise effort by Senator John C. Danforth, the Missouri Republican who is also Mr. Thomas's chief sponsor. The Democrats are expected to line up solidly with Mr. Danforth, hoping he can bring enough Republicans with him to override a threatened veto.
And besides the bills that actually get voted on in committees or on the floor, there will be large-scale Democratic efforts to discuss health insurance and health care and tax cuts for the middle class. Some limited health care legislation, intended to make it easier for small businesses to get health insurance coverage, may come to the floor, but most of the discussion of health and taxes will be more political than legislative in purpose.
Capitol Hill generally may regard Mr. Bush as an almost certain winner in his re-election effort, but that is not the contest they care most about. The elections that matter most to them are their own, the balloting for 35 senators and all 435 members of the House.

HEADLINE: For Family Of Builders, Brick Walls

BYLINE: By ANDREW L. YARROW

 BODY:
Joshua and Stephen Muss may not be the closest of cousins, but they do have several things in common. Each is part of a legacy of builders in the New York area, and each feels frustration over separate construction projects planned for Brooklyn.
Joshua, the head of the Muss Development Company, is trying to build a 31-story office building and hotel complex in downtown Brooklyn, while Stephen, the head of Alexander Muss & Sons, has plans for a five-building, 1,600-apartment complex in Brighton Beach. 
 Both projects are stalled despite support from many Brooklyn politicians and community leaders who say the projects are of particular importance to the borough.
The hotel, the leaders say, would be Brooklyn's first in half a century. The apartments, at the site of the Brighton Beach Baths in Brighton Beach, would be the first unsubsidized complex in the borough in about 20 years, they say. Each would help to revitalize a borough that has been seen as in decline for several generations, leaders say.
"Here you have a family long invested in real estate and development in Brooklyn," said Edward T. Rogowsky, the Brooklyn member of the City Planning Commission, "and you have two projects at different ends of the borough -- one commercial and one housing -- and both are symbolic in re-invigorating Brooklyn."
The projects are stalled in part because some real-estate experts and Brooklyn residents question their economic wisdom, as well as the sociological and environmental impact of Stephen Muss's Brighton-by-the-Sea complex. And in part because of the recession.
"A hotel would be a great symbol for Brooklyn," Irwin Fruchtman, a former city Buildings Commissioner, said of Renaissance Plaza, the complex that Joshua plans between Jay and Adams Streets at Myrtle Avenue. "But I can't see that much office space being built when Metrotech is begging for tenants and Manhattan has an 18 percent vacancy rate." Metrotech, a partially completed office complex nearby, was conceived in the 1980's as part of the revitalization of downtown Brooklyn.
Mr. Fruchtman, who is a member of the Committee to Preserve Brighton Beach, which has been opposing the apartment complex for five years, added: "There's no market there for luxury housing. But our main objective is to preserve the open space of the baths, and we want a smaller-scale residential development."
The Musses see things quite differently, of course.
 
Projects Throughout the Country
 "We were born into a building family," said Hyman Muss, who is the only surviving son of Issac Muss, who immigrated from Russia via South Africa 85 years ago.
"My father came to Brooklyn in 1906, and built himself up by his bootstraps," added Hyman, who is Joshua's father. "He made it through the Depression by saying, 'There are always so many children born each year, and they'll always need homes.' "
The Muss family dynasty is not as well-known as other New York families involved in development, like the Trumps, Helmsleys and Zeckendorfs, although Isaac Muss and his descendants have built 120,000 housing units and countless shopping centers and office buildings in New York City and throughout the country.
But building in the New York City of Issac Muss and his sons -- Charles, David, Alexander, Louis and Hyman -- was quite different than building in the New York City of Joshua and Stephen.
Joshua has been planning Renaissance Plaza since 1983, while Stephen has been trying to carry out Brighton-by-the-Sea since his father first envisioned it in 1954. The slow progress on the projects illustrates what many builders say is the undue complexity of the public-review process in New York, which can deter developers from even considering to build in the city.
The Muss family began its building dynasty in Brooklyn, when Issac Muss started building homes in the Brownsville and East New York sections of Brooklyn. Over the last 85 years, the family has built mostly in Brooklyn and Queens, and on Staten Island and Long Island.
Issac Muss's sons collaborated on only one project, though, the Northridge apartments in Jackson Heights, Queens, in the 1950's, and passed on the tradition to just three sons -- Joshua, Stephen (Alexander's son) and another Joshua (David's son), who has been a builder in Illinois and Washington.
A fourth generation of Musses -- Joshua's daughter Robin and son Joseph -- has recently started work at the Muss Development Company's headquarters in Flushing, Queens. While maintaining a Brooklyn office, Stephen Muss followed his father in the 1960's to Miami Beach, where Alexander Muss & Sons is now based.
 
Disappearing Tenants
 Muss Development is also involved with projects in Flushing and on Staten Island, but the company's top priority has long been Renaissance Plaza. The complex, which was conceived in by Joshua and many Brooklyn politicians as a linchpin in the rebirth of downtown Brooklyn, has yet to be built because several prospective tenants have bailed out.
Joshua said he expected the Brooklyn District Attorney to soon sign a lease for about half of the building's 750,000 square feet. If that happens, because the city has already approved the project, it could be completed by late 1993, he said. The building will also include a 380-room Hilton hotel.
"We've had a long, frustrating process trying to convince users to come to Brooklyn," he said, adding that two potential tenants had agreed to lease space in the building, but each pulled out after months of negotiations and planning. Joshua pursued other possible tenants, but settled for the district attorney's office. He would rather have had the insurance company than the District Attorney, the 50-year-old developer said, "but it's almost as important for Brooklyn for the D.A. to function properly as to get a new tenant."
If Joshua has been frustrated and angered by his eight-year ordeal with Renaissance Plaza, Stephen has been even more exasperated.
"In 1954, we leased this land with the dream of building 3,000 apartments," the 63-year-old Stephen said during a recent visit to the site.
Stephen said he decided to revisit that plan after the community began to change with the influx of Russian immigrants and the baths' membership dwindled to barely 2,000 in 1980, from 13,000 in the 1950's.
The plan was eventually scaled back to the current 1,600 apartments to win approval from the community and the city. But it was killed in January 1990, although the Planning Commission voted 3-to-2 in favor of the plan. The project needed four votes to proceed and because there were two vacancies on the commission then, Stephen was unable to garner that deciding vote.
He said he was persuaded this spring by Mayor David N. Dinkins, Howard Golden, the Brooklyn Borough President, and the Planning Commission to re-file a proposal for the project.
The $300-million, luxury apartment complex is currently navigating its way through the approval process, and Stephen said he hoped to begin construction next year and to complete the project by 1995. But he must still overcome opposition from groups that say the project would block public access to the waterfront.
Joshua understands his cousin's feelings.
"The gestation period for building can be so long because of the city-approval process," Joshua said. "So, when you're working with projects that take 20 or 30 years, you wouldn't be able to see them through without more than one generation in the business."

HEADLINE: Ferry Terminal a 'Banal Portal to Joy'

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

 BODY:
The American Institute of Architects calls it "the world's most banal portal to joy," a squat, pale sea-green hulk that is "a blight on the celebration of arrival and departure at a great city."
The South Ferry terminal of the Staten Island ferry has over the years endured decay, derision and, most recently, the collapse of a development project that would have seen it topped with a 60-story, pink and gray granite and glass tower. 
 A four-alarm fire may now do what all of that had failed to do: replace or remodel what one angry delayed ferry passenger yesterday called "a cavernous urinal" that had fallen on hard times.
"The building has never had much esthetic appeal," said Joseph De Plasco, a City Department of Transportation spokesman. "But it does function."
 
A Cherished Symbol
 The terminal, officially the Whitehall Street Ferry Terminal, represents the beginning or, depending on whom one asks, the end of one of the most recognizable and most cherished symbols of New York City. The ferry, which has existed by name since the 1840's and by fact well before that, shuttles 22 million people each year between the city's most famous borough and the least.
For hardened commuters, the ferry ride is a chugging, shuddering, 20 minutes of oil fumes and boredom, in which the best view is the newsprint held in front of their bleary eyes.
For thousands of wide-eyed tourists, it is a spectacular harbor cruise, taking in Governors Island, Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty, Brooklyn's waterfront, New Jersey and the stunning Manhattan skyline -- all for about the price of the paper in the commuters' hands.
The original South Ferry terminal and the adjoining Battery Maritime Building, which was undamaged by yesterday's fire, were built in 1907, two years after the city acquired the ferry from the B.&O. Railroad and turned it into the nation's first publicly owned mass-transit system.
The terminal was rebuilt in 1957, using the steel framework of the original, but little else, though the huge waiting room retained parts of the original.
 
An Urban Renewal Plan
 In the mid-1980's, during the height of the downtown real-estate boom, the administration of Mayor Edward I. Koch began to see within the tired terminal the possibility of a lucrative urban renewal project and sought proposals from anyone interested.
In 1986, the city chose a proposal by six developers, headed by William Zeckendorf Jr., for a $384 million commericial and cultural center with a library, a church and a museum. A 60-story tower, topped with a glass dome that would when illumated be a symbolic lighthouse over the harbor, was to have risen above a rebuilt ferry terminal.
But as the economy collapsed, dragging the real-estate market with it, the glowing project, called South Ferry Plaza, foundered. Last January, it died.
The project's failure left the terminal adrift. Mr. De Plasco said that "given the age and the needs of the building" the Transportation Department has considered ways to revive some sort of rehabilitation but has so far found scant interest.
Meanwhile, the ferries have continued to dock and debark, and commuters have grown increasingly irritated by what they see as deteriorating conditions, an increase in the number of homeless people making the terminal their home and talk of a fare increase only a year after the fare doubled to 50 cents.
 
'Lifeline to the City'
 On July 1, the city reduced the ferry service in an effort to save money, but, facing a court order and the wrath of ferry riders, restored it 18 days later.
"It's Staten Islanders' lifeline to the city," Rena Singer, a regular ferry rider, said yesterday, trying to explain the depth of emotion attached to the ferry. "Staten Islanders take this boat very seriously."
Another rider, Sonia Kramer, sardonically suggested that perhaps the fire was not a bad thing. "I hope they take this opportunity to improve both terminals," the 27-year-old passenger said. "I wish the Staten Island side had burned down, because it's in worse shape."
The only possible consolation for those beleaguered commuters is that as long as the ferries use the United States Coast Guard dock in the Battery Maritime Building, the fare will be free.

HEADLINE: Stop Trifling With the Jobless

 BODY:
Almost two million out-of-work Americans have exhausted their unemployment benefits during 1991. For them, the recession, mild by historical standards, is a personal horror. Before adjourning in August, the Democratic leadership pushed a bill through Congress that would extend benefits for as many as 20 additional weeks, depending on a state's unemployment rate.
That might seem a humane response. But the bill was a hoax. Congress refused to raise taxes to pay for the promised benefits, making it impossible to provide the promised relief without violating last year's budget law. The new benefits could be released only if President Bush declared a budget emergency. And Congress knew that Mr. Bush, to his credit, would commit no such chicanery. So the unemployed remain hungry. 
 This tragedy has a simple, honest solution: Upon its return next week, Congress should repass the bill, but this time pay for it with a compensating hike in payroll taxes on higher-paid workers.
A sobering study by Isaac Shapiro of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates that a record 318,000 jobless Americans exhausted their benefits in July. In past recessions, individuals out of work for more than 26 weeks and living in states with high unemployment rates qualified for up to 13 additional weeks of benefits. During the 1970's and 80's virtually every unemployed worker was made eligible for extended benefits.
But many states, reeling from huge deficits, have recently tightened eligibility standards as a way of pruning expenditures. Mr. Shapiro estimates that only 5 percent of jobless workers whose benefits ran out in July were eligible for extended benefits. That's an appalling statistic.
Opponents of extending benefits raise two arguments, both specious. The first is that a tax hike would worsen the recession, throwing millions more out of work. But the bill wouldn't just raise taxes; it would also raise spending. Taking money out of Joe's pocket and putting it right back into Frank's doesn't diminish private consumption.
Opponents also claim that extending benefits would encourage the unemployed to turn down acceptable job offers, especially if acceptance would mean swallowing a stiff wage cut. This disturbing possibility has driven some economists to propose paying benefits retroactively, after an unemployed worker accepts a job offer. That would encourage the unemployed to find work quickly, even at lower wages, because the benefits would absorb part of the shock.
But a 1988 survey by the Department of Labor showed that 60 percent of the unemployed still did not have jobs even 10 weeks after their benefits ended. Obviously, strong forces other than benefits keep the unemployed from finding work.
Unemployment benefits were once a safety net insulating workers from a stricken economy. But during the past decade, the net has sprung gaping holes. Now Congress can plug the holes without traducing the budget law or the economy. The jobless deserve more than a legislative hoax.

HEADLINE: Candidates Crowd the Field in Primary for Council

 BODY:
MANHATTAN
 
1st DISTRICT
MANUEL S. CAVACO Jr. (D) -- Truck driver, rock musician and artist; Democratic county committee member. 
 MARGARET S. CHIN (D-L) -- Director, Chinatown Center of La Guardia Community College; member of Community Board 1 and State Democratic Committee.
JOHN A.FRATTA (D) -- Youth co-ordinator; member of Community Board 2 and district leader.
KATHRYN E. FREED (D) -- tenant lawyer and Counsel to State Assembly Consumer Affairs and Protection Committee; district leader; endorsed by Council's political action committee.
THE CAMPAIGN: This is one of the most bitterraces in the city, in a lower Manhattan district that has a white plurality but a sizable Asian population. Ms. Chin, trying to become the city's first Asian member of the Council , has been haunted by accusations of Communist affiliation. Her main challenger is Ms. Freed, a longtime TriBeCa resident.
 
2d DISTRICT
MIRIAM FRIEDLANDER (D) -- Council member for 18 years; pressed for creation of Council's Committee on Women, which she leads.
PHILIP K. HOWARD (D) -- lawyer; vice president of Municipal Art Society; former chairman of Community Board 6 zoning committee.
ANTONIO PAGAN (D) -- Executive director of Coalition Housing, nonprofit developer of low- and moderate-income housing; member Community Board 3; active in efforts to clean up Tompkins Square Park.
HYMAN DECHTER (D) -- lost bid for Assembly in 1965; works as a criminal lawyer; political maverick whose strength is based in the predominantly Jewish Grand Street housing projects.
THE CAMPAIGN: The power of money will be put to the test in this district, which stretches from the Lower East Side through Gramercy Park. The Democratic primary pits Ms. Friedlander, a longtime Council member with strong left-wing credentials against two strong opponents. The surprise is the previously unknown Mr. Howard, who has used prodigious fund raising.
 
3d DISTRICT
LIZ J. ABZUG (D) -- Vice president of State Urban Development Corporation; active in feminist and gay issues; member of Community Board 2; endorsed by Mayor David N. Dinkins.
VICTOR A. DEL MASTRO (D) -- high school science teacher; member of Community Board 4; affiliated with Lower East Side Democratic Club.
THOMAS K. DUANE (D) -- Manhattan co-ordinator for City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman; former broker; gay-rights advocate.
THE CAMPAIGN: With Mr. Del Mastro a longshot, the winner here is likely to become New York's first openly gay Council member.
 
4th DISTRICT
CAROLYN B. MALONEY (D) -- Council member for 10 years and chairwoman of subcommittee on City Contracts; former teacher.
STEVEN ROSEN (D) -- lawyer; has worked for Ralph Nader's Center for Responsive Law; former chairman of Community Board 6.
THE CAMPAIGN: Ms. Maloney, the veteran, is in a tough primary race in this Upper East Side district. If she survives, she should face a strong challenge in November from David A. Goldstein, a liberal Republican lawyer.
 
5th DISTRICT
CAROL GREITZER (D) -- Five-term Councilwoman; former advertising copywriter; active in women's rights and development issues.
CRAIG MILLER (D) -- aide to Assemblyman Alexander B. (Pete) Grannis; former researcher for clothing workers union.
JESSIE RADEMAKER (D) -- nurse; former member of Community Board 8.
SANDRA A. NEIS (D) President, Roosevelt Island Residents Association; former member of Community School Board 2; Manages Greenmarket on Roosevelt Island.
THE CAMPAIGN: Robert Dryfoos, the powerful veteran here, opened up a vacuum when he dropped out amid investigations of his finances. Ms. Greitzer, who represented the Village until Mr. Dryfoos's departure, is the favorite in the primary, but she, too, should get a tough challenge in November from a liberal Republican, Charles Millard.
 
6th DISTRICT
No primary; Councilwoman Ronnie Eldridge is the incumbent.
 
7th DISTRICT
FRANKYE GRAVES (D) -- former longtime supervisor for Board of Education; former delegate to Democratic National convention.
C. VERNON MASON (D) -- lawyer, formerly with NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund Inc.; active in several recent high-profile cases, including the Tawana Brawley case.
STANLEY E. MICHELS (D) -- Council member for 13 years; lawyer.
KEITH STEPHEN MITCHELL (D) -- Council aide; member Community Board 9; active in tenant issues.
PEGGY M. SHEPARD (D) -- community advocate in Harlem and writer; district leader.
THE CAMPAIGN: The racial politicking is intense in this upper Manhattan district. But the racial diversity of the 7th -- with a black plurality but large white and Hispanic populations -- is most likely to benefit the white incumbent, Mr. Michels, and make life difficult for his two leading, and sparring, black opponents, the radical Mr. Mason and the more-moderate Ms. Shepard.
 
8th DISTRICT
CARMEN E. ARROYO (D) -- community worker and executive director of South Bronx Community Corporation; longtime school board and community board member.
WILLIAM DEL TORO (D) -- executive director of Hispanic Housing and Economic Development, a nonprofit housing agency; former district leader; endorsed by C-Pac.

NELSON ANTONIO DENIS (D) -- lawyer and former teacher; member Community Board 11.
WILLIAM M. PERKINS (D) -- Deputy chief clerk of Board of Elections; and district leader.
ADAM CLAYTON POWELL 4th (D) -- son of Adam Clayton Powell, the late Harlem Congressman; former assistant district attorney in the Bronx; worked for Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman; endorsed by Majority Coalition.
PHILIP REED (D) -- Director of East New York HIV/AIDS Project; district leader.
JORGE A. SEGARRA (D) -- insurance agent; appointed to the youth and education committee by Community Board 11.
PHILIP V. SHELLY (D) -- Former intern in Senator Edward M. Kennedy's Washington office and staff member of the Ripon Society in Washington.
THE CAMPAIGN: This district, which encompasses parts of the Upper West Side, Harlem and the South Bronx, has a slight Hispanic majority. But the leading Hispanic candidate, Mr. Del Toro, must deal with questions about his past -- a conviction on bribery charges -- and several strong contenders.
 
9th DISTRICT
C. VIRGINIA FIELDS (D) -- First-term Councilwoman; co-sponsored bill restricting city contracts with companies doing business with South Africa; social worker; former chairwoman of Community Board 10.
REGINA L. SMITH (D) -- director of New York City Housing Partnership; community advocate in Harlem.
MARVIN SOCHET (D) -- president of an interiors company; community and peace advocate.
THE CAMPAIGN: Ms. Fields beat an incumbent to win election in 1989; now she must face an insurgent challenger in Ms. Smith.
 
10th DISTRICT
ADRIANO ESPAILLAT (D) -- official of city's Criminal Justice Agency; member of Community Board 12; endorsed by C-PAC.
HARRY C. FOTOPOULOS (D) -- insurance and real estate broker; district leader.

VICTOR L. ROBLES (D-L) -- incumbent Council member; former Assemblyman; former Commissioner, New York City Commission on Human Rights.
THE CAMPAIGN: The incumbent, Mr. Robles, has built up a strong base in this poor, solidly Hispanic district, but faces challenges from all sides -- community advocates who charge he has not done enough for his constituents, and Mr. Olmedo, who represented much of the area.
 
35th DISTRICT
MARY PINKETT (D-L) -- incumbent Council member since 1974 and chairwoman, Council's Committee on Government Operations; former president, Local 371, Social Services Employes Union; endorsed by Mayor David N. Dinkins.
PETER M. WILLIAMS (D) -- lawyer; project associate, Medgar Evers College Center for Law and Social Justice; former assistant, Representative Ed Towns; member, New York City Commission on Public Information and Communication; endorsed by Majority Coalition.
THE CAMPAIGN: The controversies that have consumed Crown Heights recently are very much in evidence in this Council race; the district encompasses the heart of the neighborhood. The incumbent, Ms. Pinkett, who is black, has maintained good relations with the Lubavitch Hasidim, who compose one of the district's most potent voting blocks.
 
36th DISTRICT
ROBERT A. HUNTER (D) -- financial adviser, Merrill Lynch; member, Community School Board 16, Community Board 3, Area Policy Board 3.

RICHARD TAYLOR (D) -- executive director, Van Buren Corporation; member, Community Board 3; former Democratic district leader.
THE CAMPAIGN: Over the last two decades, the Coalition for Community Empowerment established itself in central Brooklyn as the strongest force for black insurgent politics in the city. In several Council districts the coalition has fragmented, but here it is united behind Annette M. Robinson.
 
37th DISTRICT
MAURICIO HERNANDEZ (D-L) -- lawyer, Brooklyn Legal Services Corporation.; member, Puerto Rican Bar Association and National Lawyers Council; endorsed by Assemblyman Vito J. Lopez, Majority Coalition.
MARTIN MALAVE-DILAN (D) -- aide, Representative Edolphus Towns; Democratic district leader and state committeeman; endorsed by Mr. Towns, State Senator Ada L. Smith, Assemblyman Thomas F. Catapano and C-Pac.
THE CAMPAIGN: The Justice Department at first rejected the city's districting plan in part because this district, ostensibly established as a Hispanic stronghold, lacked sufficient numbers of Hispanic voters. Now nearly half the registered voters are Hispanic.
 
38th DISTRICT
BEATRICE BYRD (D) -- teacher; member, Community Board 6 and Area Policy Board 6; president, Brooklyn Branch N.A.A.C.P.
ANN ENGLISH (D) -- businesswoman; president, Fourth Avenue Enterprise Piping Corporation; assistant director, Downtown Brooklyn Development Corporation; Democratic state committeewoman; member, Community Boards 2 and 7.

RAUL OCTTAVIAMI (R) -- member of the Theodore Roosevelt Republican Club; addiction counselor, Lutheran Medical Center; endorsed by State Senator Christopher J. Mega.
THE CAMPAIGN: This, at least in terms of population, was seen as a Hispanic district, but it also includes much of the working Brooklyn waterfront. In a multi-ethnic and racial Democratic field of nine, Lou Valentino, an Italian-American with strong ties to the scandal-ridden International Longshoremen's Association, has emerged as the key object of controversy and, perhaps, the frontrunner.
 
39th DISTRICT
STEPHEN DIBRIENZA (D) -- Council member since 1986 and chairman of the panel on Waterfront Development; lawyer; former Democratic state committeeman.
BERNARD J. GRAHAM (D) -- one-time real estate and tenant lawyer, now has neighborhood practice; former member, Kings County Democratic Committee.

CARL ANDREWS (D-L) -- professor, New Rochelle College; community coordinator, Department of State; former aide to Representative Major R. Owens and Assemblyman Albert Vann; former member, Community School Board 17, Community Board 8; endorsed by Assemblyman Clarence Norman Jr. and C-Pac.

MAURICE A. GUMBS (D) -- school teacher; adjunct professor, Medgar Evers College; vice chairman, Community Board 17; co-chairman, 71st Precinct Community Council.
THE CAMPAIGN: This race has been shaped in part by unusual divisions. Black insurgents have been uncharacteristically divided between Mr. Andrews and Ms. Clarke. The strength of the growing Caribbean-American population in the area is underscored by the candidacies of Ms. Clarke and Mr. Gumbs.
 
41st DISTRICT
RONALD WARD (D) -- New York City Housing Authority supervisor; former manager, New York City Parks Department; member, Community School Board 23; endorsed by Majority Coalition.
ENOCH H. WILLIAMS (D-L) -- incumbent Council member, chairman, Environmental Protection Committee; retired brigadier general, New York Army National Guard; endorsed by C-Pac.
THE CAMPAIGN: Enoch H. Williams has long represented this impoverished area and, as chairman of the Council's environmental protection committee, has emphasized the environment as an issue. His opponents have stressed other concerns -- crimehousing, and drugs among them.

ROBERT J. MILLER (D) -- lawyer; former law partner of Andrew Cuomo; vice president, Flatbush Development Corporation; endorsed by Assembly Speaker Mel Miller.
THE CAMPAIGN: This district stretches through many white, long-established borough neighborhoods.

ISRAEL RUIZ Jr. (D-L) -- real-estate-financial consultant; former state Senator, former member of Community School Board.
THE CAMPAIGN: A widely diverse district, it is the center of a race that many observers have called among the most troublesome in the city. Of the two leading candidates, Ms. Ramos-Alamo, chairwoman of School Board 10, has been criticized for pursuing policies called ethnically and racially divisive. Mr. Ruiz served time in prison after being convicted in 1989 of falsifying a loan application. He claimed the case was politically motivated. Ms. Ramos-Alamo disputes the charges against her.

THE CAMPAIGN: Long represented by Jose Rivera, who points to improvements in his councilmanic attendance record, this hard-pressed district has the option of voting instead for Mr. Rivera, Mr. Martinez, whose performance as an Assemblyman was widely criticized, or Mr. Alamo, who over the last decade may have run for public office more often than anyone else in the city without success.

CORRECTION-DATE: September 10, 1991, Tuesday
PUB-DATE: September 12, 1991

 CORRECTION:
A voters' guide yesterday to the primary elections for the New York City Council this week omitted the 13th District in the Bronx. There is no primary in the 13th, where Michael DeMarco is the incumbent. In addition, one of the candidates in the 15th District, Jose L. Rivera, was incorrectly described; the biography given for Mr. Rivera actually described one of his opponents, Councilman Jose Rivera, whose name was omitted from the guide.
A voters guide on Monday to the New York City Council elections today incorrectly described Louis Valentino, a candidate in the 38th District in Brooklyn. Mr. Valentino is executive director of the Political Action Fund of Local 1814 of the International Longshoremen's Association. He is not an officer of the local itself, which is a target of Federal civil racketeering charges.

HEADLINE: Careers;
Veterinary Jobs Grow In Variety

BYLINE: By Elizabeth M. Fowler

 BODY:
THERE are two notable trends involving veterinarians these days, according to Franklin M. Loew, dean of the Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine. There is more interest in veterinarians working abroad and there are a growing number of displaced middle managers choosing to become animal experts.
"I know the international sector is growing," Dr. Loew said last week, explaining that many nations in Eastern Europe need medical help to increase their cattle, pig and other livestock numbers. He called the food situation in the area "a ticking bomb," with time running out for feeding populations this winter. 
 For years the Eastern European nations have been trying to build up their supplies of food animals without too much success to supplement their agricultural products and provide more protein sources for their people.
"My sense is that there wlll be a need for more veterinarians abroad," he said, "perhaps some from this country even though there are 38 veterinary schools in what used to be the U.S.S.R. We have 27 in the United States, plus four in Canada."
He said he did not know about the quality of the Russian training, or whether embarrassment might stand in the way of importing veterinary experts from the United States. Perhaps, he said, some of the major American foundations will support more programs for sending animal experts abroad after some of the current fact-finding groups return.
"There is also growing stress on endangered species of animals, especially in Africa and South America," he added.
In the United States, he said he noticed a continuing trend for more middle-aged people, sometimes those who have lost their jobs in corporate layoffs, to apply for veterinary school at places like Tufts, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of California and Purdue University, to mention a few leading schools.
"This year our class averages 26 years of age," he said, "but ranges from students 21 years old to 40 years old. Sometimes we have older ones. We call the middle-aged ones resumers."
Most of the resumers are women, who now constitute about 60 percent of the 280 students in the Tufts veterinary school.
"That is a trend that is substantially the same at all veterinary schools," Dr. Loew said. "It's a sea change, and I think the main reason is that general societal strictures against women in professions like engineering and law have eased as well as in veterinary medicine."
Veterinary school admissions officers used to argue against women in the field, saying they could not handle large animals like bulls and stallions.
"They never said that to men 4 feet tall," Dr. Loew said, explaining that nowadays tranquillizers can be used on large animals to make handling easier.
"In the early 1980's we had too many veterininarians graduating, Now it is the other way around, and there might not be enough in the the 90's," he said. In the United States, he said, $9 billion is spent on animal food each year, compared with $4 billion to $5 billion on baby food -- one indication of the size of the animal population.
There are about 55,000 veterinarians in the United States, and about 2,200 graduate from veterinary schools each year, compared with 15,000 new medical doctors and 5,000 new dentists. Veterinary training is four years, but there is no residency afterward.
As reasons for the increasing need for veterinarians, he said that in the last decade what he called the moral status of animals had been raised.
"We travel with them, we treat them kindly, we need more dogs perhaps for protection and we have more cats for companionship," the dean said. "It has been the stick of the environmentalists insisting on improving the animal quality of life, and the carrot of much better research into animal health and needs."
Also, many communities have stricter laws about animal welfare and easier acceptance of animals. In Switzerland, for example, dogs are so highly appreciated that they can travel with their masters on trains and buses in some cities and are allowed into restaurants with their masters.
Dr. Loew said that today's students tended to come from urban areas and had quite different concerns about ethical handling of animals and the environmental impact, compared with several decades ago, when most veterinarians were expected to deal with farm animals.
As might be expected, in view of the growing numbers of household animals, the curriculum offered in veterinary schools is changing, with more focus on specialized studies in the senior year, Dr. Loew said. States will probably have to revise general veterinary licensing exams soon, he added.
While the recent economic slide has affected employment of veterinarians somewhat, he thinks job opportunities are good. Today, he said, about 70 percent work in the private sector and 30 percent in research, welfare, teaching, the biotechnology industry and government, as well as for international organizations like the Peace Corps.

HEADLINE: Consumer Credit Down 1.4% in July

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, sept. 9

 BODY:
Consumers continued to pay off more installment debt than they took out in July, the Government said today. It was the seventh decline in consumer credit in eight months.
The Federal Reserve said installment debt dropped 1.4 percent, or a seasonally adjusted $838 million, after revised declines of 2.8 percent in June and 2.2 percent in May. Those declines were reported last month to have been 3 percent in June and 1 percent in May. 
Installment loans have grown this year only in April, a 1.9 percent gain.
Consumer credit includes all consumer loans except mortgages and home-equity debt. It helps to pay for much of consumers' overall spending, which represents two-thirds of the nation's economic activity.
 
Consumers Are Wary
 Many analysts contend that consumers have adopted a wait-and-see attitude toward the economy before committing themselves to more large debts.
For example, automobile loans dropped 3.8 percent in July, or a seasonally adjusted $880 million. Auto loans have fallen every month this year, although the July decline was not as steep as the 8.7 percent drop in June or the 13.9 percent plunge in May.
But revolving credit, which includes credit cards, grew 2.5 percent, or a seasonally adjusted $474 million. That was up from a 2.3 percent increase in June but was less than half the 6.9 percent advance in May.
Bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate were off 1 percent, or $173 million, after falling 1.4 percent in June and 5.3 percent a month earlier.
Mobile home loans, which rose 6.7 percent in June for the first gain in six months, plummeted 15.6 percent, or a seasonally adjusted $259 million.
The changes left consumers holding $729.7 billion in installment debt at the end of July, four-tenths of a percent less than they held a year earlier.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Below 1.70 Marks; New Weakness Is Feared

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The dollar fell below 1.70 German marks yesterday, possibly signaling a new period of weakness for the American currency.
This is the first time the dollar has moved decisively below 1.70 marks since May, and then it only paused in a rally that carried the dollar up 27 percent from 1.44 marks in February to 1.83 in July and again in August. It has now fallen 7 percent from that recent high. 
 "It looks like a decisive break," said Christopher Bourdain, the head of foreign exchange sales at Credit Suisse in New York. He said yesterday that he saw some big dollar owners selling and suggested that the new bearish mood could send the dollar to the mid-1.60's before new developments allow it to rebound or make it fall further.
In late trading in New York yesterday, the dollar closed at 1.6935 marks, down from 1.7145 on Friday and the lowest close since the 1.6940 close on May 28. The dollar also fell against other leading currencies. Against the yen, the dollar closed at 134.62, down from 135.65 Friday.
The factors that have been weighing on the dollar include the sluggishness, so far, of the recovery from recession, the expectation of another cut in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve Board and the apparent lack of concern about serious economic and political problems after the failure of the hard-line coup in the Soviet Union last month. A drop in interest rates here makes the dollar and dollar-denominated assets less attractive.
Some analysts also contend that the elimination of the Communist threat from the Soviet Union will make German and other European investments more attractive and divert money from the United States.
The most immediate factor in the dollar's fall was the unemployment report on Friday, which gave another murky signal about the economic recovery. Analysts say the jobs figures will still allow the Federal Reserve room to push down interest rates in its effort to assure that the United States economic recovery does not stumble.
On Friday, the dollar fell after the jobs report, then rallied to around 1.7400 marks. But in the afternoon, when no more buying occurred, many people apparently decided the dollar would rally no further and sold. And suddenly the dollar was down more than two pfennigs to close at 1.7145.
Mr. Bourdain of Credit Suisse said that before yesterday most of the selling was from people or institutions trading in small amounts. And he said that the expectation that the Fed would lower interest rates had been in the market so long that it should already be reflected in the dollar's price.
This means that much of the dollar selling could be what traders call technical. This happens when dollar owners set particular levels, based on recent moves of the dollar, for buying or selling. Because the 1.70 level has been an important level on recent dollar charts, a drop below it set off a lot of automatic selling.
But some traders think that if the Fed does cut interest rates, the dollar could rebound a little, rather than fall further.

HEADLINE: BAKER SEES MEXICO AS A SOVIET MODEL

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Sept. 9

 BODY:
On the eve of a visit to the Soviet Union, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d again praised Mexico today as a model that the United States will urge on other countries facing economic difficulties.
A dozen Cabinet-level American and Mexican officials met here today for their ninth annual round of wide-ranging negotiations. The talks focused on the three-month-old negotiations for a North American free trade agreement between the United States, Mexico and Canada, but no new deals were announced. 
 As senior Administration officials debate whether to help the Soviet Union's foundering economy, Mr. Baker held up for the second time in two days the example of the Administration of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico.
"President Salinas's bold economic reform and modernization program is a model for countries both in this hemisphere and other countries around the world, and don't think we're not going to make mention of it as we talk to developing nations and reforming nations undergoing revolutions," Mr. Baker told Mexico's Foreign Minister, Fernando Solana.
"You have successfully reduced inflation, privatized formerly inefficient industries and you have inspired investor confidence," Mr. Baker added.
Mr. Baker told reporters on the flight here from Washington on Sunday that the Salinas Administration had introduced "the kinds of reforms, quite frankly, that we hope we see in the Soviet Union and elsewhere."
In Mexico, however, there are few checks on the power of the central Government. Mr. Salinas and a handful of aides have been able to reduce subsidies and open protected industries to international competition with limited public and corporate opposition.
By contrast, central authority has dwindled in the Soviet Union and with it the ability of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to impose the kind of sweeping changes that Mr. Salinas has introduced here.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasuries Up in Active Trading

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities rose in fairly active trading, and bond yields fell below 8 percent for the first time since mid-February yesterday, largely on the continued belief among credit market participants that the Federal Reserve Board is on the verge of easing short-term interest rates.
Expectation that the Fed might move quickly to lower its discount rate and the overnight Federal funds rate was fueled by a report from the Labor Department on Friday that showed the job market expanded at a very slow pace in August. Those expectations pushed prices up strongly early in the session. 
 Based on the 34,000 increase in payroll employment reported for August, many analysts said the Fed would probably have to ease interest rates further to shore up what appears to be a hesitant, shaky recovery.
 
No Change in Rates
 The Fed, however, did not satisfy those hopes yesterday. Its open market operations left no question that for the time being the Fed funds rate, which banks charge each other on overnight loans, remains at 5.50 percent, traders said. And the Fed made no announcement that it was lowering its discount rate, which the Fed charges member banks, also 5.50 percent.
Prices fell back somewhat after the Fed did not act.
"I suspect the market will act in much the same manner on Tuesday," said James R. Capra, a principal at Moore Capital Management, a money management firm. "Then, if the Fed doesn't move, I think participants will wait to see the inflation and retail sales numbers later in the week."
Thomas J. Steffanci, director of fixed income at the Fidelity Management and Research Company in Boston, which manages $15 billion in fixed-income securities, said: "I think a Fed ease is imminent. They will probably wait for the inflation numbers, and move then."
On Thursday the Government is expected to release producer price information for August. The report will be followed on Friday by August consumer price data.
"If inflation looks good and the retail sales numbers continue to show weakness, that will provide a window for the Fed to lower the discount rate and the funds rate, and give an insurance policy to the economic recovery," said Lawrence N. Leuzzi, a managing director at S. G. Warburg & Company.
 
Sales Data Due Friday
 Figures from leading chain stores and automobile manufacturers suggest that a report, also expected on Friday, on August retail sales will show that the consumer remains hamstrung.
That sense received some credence yesterday, when it was reported that outstanding consumer credit fell by $838 million in July. The number was close to market expectations, and prompted no reaction in the credit markets.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 101 1/2, up by a quarter of a point, to yield 7.99 percent, down from 8.01 percent late on Friday. It is the first time the closing yield on the benchmark issue has fallen below 8 percent since mid-February.
Among Treasury note issues, the 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 100 3/32, up by 7/32, to yield 7.71 percent. And the 6 3/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 11/32, up by 2/32, to yield 6.18 percent.
 
Short-Term Rates Off
 Rates on short-term bills fell at the Treasury's weekly auction.
At the auction, three-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 5.29 percent, down from an average rate of 5.34 percent at last week's sale.
Meanwhile, bids on the new six-month bills produced an average discount rate of 5.30 percent, compared with an average rate of 5.39 percent a week ago.
"The fact that Treasury bill rates are trading under the discount rate certainly puts the Fed in a position to ease" monetary policy, said Edward S. Hyman, president of International Strategy and Investment, a New York money managment firm.
In the investment-grade corporate bond market, the Private Export Finance Corporation offered $150 million in securities maturing on March 31, 2000, through an underwriting group led by Citicorp Securities Inc.
The 7.90 percent notes were priced at $99.873 to yield 7.92 percent, 38 basis points, or 38 one-hundredths of a percentage point, over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 1/4 percent seven-year notes at the time of pricing.
The securities, which are noncallable for life, are rated AAA by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, traders said prices of most issues were unchanged to up about an eighth of a point in slow trading.
In the tax-exempt bond market, prices of most widely quoted secondary municipal issues improved by about an eighth of a point, traders said.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: U.S. Credit Union Fund Is Expected to Impose a Premium

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
The heavy losses from credit unions in New England have led Federal regulators to decide that the nation's 13,000 federally insured credit unions should pay about $160 million to their Government-run insurance fund. The payments would be the first made by the industry to the fund since 1985.
When directors of the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund vote on a premium this Friday, "it's fair to say that the likelihood of an assessment is extremely strong," said Roger W. Jepsen, chairman of the National Credit Union Administration. He is recommending a premium of about 8.3 cents for every $100 of deposits, sharply lower than 23 cents that banks are charged. 
 In a speech yesterday at a conference of credit unions that serve military bases, Mr. Jepsen said the credit union insurance fund was far stronger than the fund for bank deposits. The extra money would maintain the federally backed credit union fund at slightly more than $1.25 of assets for every $100 of insured deposits. Losses over several years to the bank insurance fund operated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation have reduced the fund covering bank deposits to about 23 cents for every $100 of deposits.
To prevent politicians from questioning the safety of the credit union insurance fund and perhaps consolidating it with the F.D.I.C., Mr. Jepsen recommended that credit union executives pay a premium, even though the fund would remain healthy without the additional money. The content of Mr. Jepsen's speech was obtained from a copy of his remarks and was first quoted in yesterday's issue of the American Banker newspaper.
The addtional financing is needed because the credit union fund expects a shortfall this year of about $40 million, mostly because of $120 million of losses at three credit unions in New England that were heavily involved in commercial real estate lending.
Mr. Jepsen did not name the three credit unions, which are in conservatorship and scheduled to be closed or reorganized soon.
Industry officials said the credit unions that caused the $120 million loss were the Progressive Consumers Federal Credit Union of Saugus, the Blue Hill Federal Credit Union in Brookline and the Barnstable Community Federal Credit Union, all in Massachusetts.
Deposits at the three troubled credit unions, like the other approximatly 13,000 credit unions whose deposits are backed by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund, are insured up to $100,000 each.
Since the credit union insurance fund was strengthened by a large industry contribution in 1985, the fund has reported steady earnings yearly with only low losses from payments to depositors of failed credit unions. But the downturn in the New England economy and real estate market and the push by some credit unions to lend for commercial real estate projects are leading to larger losses for the year ending Sept. 30.
The insurance premium, while a noticeable expense to individual credit unions, many of which operate on shoestring budgets, comes when credit unions are solidly profitable.
Credit union profits, which are retained as a capital surplus, totaled $900 million in 1990 and $560 million in the first six months of 1991, up 15 percent from a year earlier.

HEADLINE: SOVIET TURMOIL;
Soviet Forces Begin a Drill In Democracy

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Sept. 9

 BODY:
Three weeks after the abortive coup in the Soviet Union, 28 senior Soviet military officers entered Harvard University today for a crash course on how to help build a democracy.
At a news conference and later in interviews, the officers said the Soviet military of the future would be a smaller, professional force free from the Communist Party's control. The central army, the officers said, will work in concert with newly created militias in the former Soviet republics. 
 To help reach these goals and better understand the military's role in a popularly elected government, the officers are studying for two weeks at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. The program is one of the first of its kind in the United States for Soviet officers.
 
Added Meaning of Classes
 Their classes -- ranging from the American legal system to arms-control strategies to the future security role of the United States in Europe -- were planned months before the coup attempt and have now taken on an added meaning.
"The military forces of the Soviet Union together with the whole country are now being restructured," said Lieut. Gen. Anany V. Politsyn, a Soviet military planner who is leading the delegation.
Speaking from a lectern in front of a portrait of George Washington, General Politsyn told reporters that the new leadership of the Soviet military was wrestling with democratic changes that would include placing a civilian in charge of the Soviet Defense Ministry, "like in the United States."
Under the restructuring, he said in an interview later, the four-million-member Soviet armed forces could shrink to two million, and perhaps lower, in the next several years, and gradually shift to an all-volunteer force from a conscripted one, as the American military did 18 years ago.
"There will have to be a transition period," the general said.
 
'Very Rigid Measures'
 General Politsyn reiterated earlier statements by other top-ranking Soviet generals that the Soviet Union had taken "very rigid measures" to prevent the unauthorized launch of long-range or short-range nuclear weapons, and that strategic forces would remain under centralized control in the future.
Final details of the Soviet military's future shape and size hinge in large part on the signing of a union treaty, which will give the Soviet republics greater authority over their own armed forces.
Under such an agreement, General Politsyn said, each republic would contribute a mutually agreed-upon number of forces to the central military and muster its own state militia.
"If sovereign republics decide not to join the Soviet Union, they will have the right to maintain their own armed forces," General Politsyn said.
The officer said the republican militias would perform duties similar to those by National Guard units in the United States, which are called up for such tasks as quelling riots and aiding in disasters.
 
Greatest Threat Is Economic
 As the Soviet Union continues to withdraw thousands of tanks, artillery guns and other weaponry from Eastern Europe, General Politsyn said the union treaty should settle where the equipment would finally be deployed.
General Politsyn also said the Soviet Union's greatest national-security threats now stemmed from the country's dire economic woes and political problems at home.
American specialists on the Soviet military have raised myriad questions that officials in Moscow and the Soviet republics are trying to deal with.
What steps can be taken to prevent civil war? What type of future military cooperation can the United States and other Western nations expect from the new Soviet state and its former republics? What happens to the thousands of Soviet political officers who are sure to lose their jobs?
"Members of the military can join whatever party they want now, but their party activity has to be strictly extracurricular," said Col. Vladimir N. Danilov, the deputy director of information for the Soviet Defense Ministry, explaining the effort to depoliticize the military.
 
General Powell's Speech
 Dressed in coats and ties, the delegation also took a walking tour of Harvard Square today and heard from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Colin L. Powell.
"Democracy is not an easy form of government for military professionals," General Powell told the group at a lunchtime speech that was closed to the press. "We will subordinate ourselves totally to the will of the people and their elected representatives."
General Powell said in an interview afterward that he had just written his new Soviet counterpart, Gen. Vladimir Lobov, to reaffirm the American commitment to continuing the two countries' military-to-military exchanges.
Indeed, the head of the Soviet Navy, Adm. Vladimir N. Chernavin is scheduled to visit the United States soon, while the American Air Force Chief of Staff, Gen. Merrill A. McPeak, is to meet with officials in the Soviet Union in the next several weeks.
 
Aspirations for Democracy
 Perhaps the most poignant example of the fledgling Soviet aspirations for democracy came from Col. Vladimir V. Seleznev, a Soviet Army officer who is also a member of the Russian republic's Parliament.
Colonel Seleznev said he was one of about 200 men who had holed up with President Boris N. Yeltsin of the Russian republic in the Russian White House during the coup.
"The Soviet Union is a poor country," said Colonel Seleznev, 42, a former social sciences instructor at a Soviet military academy in Siberia. "It can be wealthy only if it becomes a free country. I want my 14-year-old son to live in a free country."

HEADLINE: MANILA SENATORS SHOW OPPOSITION TO U.S. BASE PACT

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANILA, Sept. 9

 BODY:
A majority of the Philippine Senate declared its opposition today to a 10-year extension of the American lease on the Subic Bay Naval Station, raising the threat that the United States may soon be forced to withdraw from its largest military installation in Southeast Asia.
Although today's vote was a preliminary one, it was taken seriously in Washington, where Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said, "We obviously can't stay where we're not wanted, and we won't." 
 "It's a choice they have to make," Mr. Cheney added. "If they're not prepared to ratify the treaty and extend the agreement, then we will in fact depart."
 
Outcome Is Unclear
 The Senate's foreign relations committee, made up of all 23 members of the Senate, voted today 12 to 11 against the treaty.
But it was uncertain whether the committee's nonbinding vote and the statements in Washington represented continued diplomatic sparring, or signaled the coming end of the 90-year American presence where thousands of American forces are based.
At one time, because of the need to confront the Soviet Union and China, the American military presence in the Philippines was deemed vital to American strategic interests. But with the changed world situation, the strategic concerns have faded, although Washington professes to want still to keep the Subic base to maintain stability in the Philippines and to protect against unforeseen developments in Asia.
 
Final Vote Yet to Come
Since the 23 senators voted today only as the committee, the formal vote by the Senate is yet to come, possibly as early as the latter part of this week.
Under the Philippine Constitution, the lease extension for Subic would require a two-thirds vote of the Senate -- a margin impossible to imagine if the vote were held today, but perhaps not impossible to obtain several weeks or a year from now. A new Senate will be elected next spring.
President Corazon C. Aquino has called on supporters of the new treaty, which was hammered out this summer between her negotiators and envoys of the United States, to join in a march on the Senate Tuesday to convince the lawmakers of the political risks they face by voting against it.
Commercials broadcast repeatedly on Manila television stations tonight called for a large-scale turnout at the march as a means of "letting the voice of the silent majority be heard."
Late tonight, the Philippine left made its feelings known, as well. About 50 demonstrrators, some wearing death masks, marched outside the United States Embassy and tried to burn an American flag. The police broke up the demonstration, a common sort of protest here. There were no reports of serious injuries.
The protesters' objections to the presence of American bases runs deeper than a demand for more money to extend the leases. Opposition to the bases has spread in recent years from left-wing radicals through the middle-class establishment.
A consensus has emerged that the American military presence is a vestige of colonialism, and that the nation cannot be truly free as long as the American troops remain.
The Philippine Foreign Secretary, Raul Manglapus, the chief negotiator, has repeatedly said the Philippines must "slay the American father image" before it can be a mature nation.
Besides the $203 million in annual payments under the new lease agreement, the Subic naval base is worth additional hundreds of millions of dollars each year to the Philippine economy and thousands of jobs. Public opinion polls suggest that the majority of Filipinos support the new treaty, even if some of the nation's most prominent politicians and intellectuals do not.
American officials have taken the position that they could accept rejection of the treaty and were ready to consider establishing an installation in Singapore or other more hospitable places. But officials in Washington also say they hope that they can keep the extensive, deep-water harbor at Subic Bay, with its accompanying Naval Air Station.
 
Huge Cost of Moving
 The cost of moving would be huge, and Subic Bay possesses one of the most highly skilled local work forces in the world. They are paid considerably less than comparable workers in the United States or Guam, another possible substitute base.
The Senate foreign relations committee made its opposition to the treaty known today in the form of a resolution describing the new lease on Subic as "a one-sided, unequal agreement that does not provide for reciprocal rights" and that tends to perpetuate "Philippine dependence on the United States for defense and security."
After the vote today, the Senate President, Jovito Salonga, said, "For all practical purposes, the treaty is defeated."
Yet while the base agreement would now appear to fall far short of the required two-thirds vote, it is believed in some political and diplomatic circles that it will eventually be approved in one form or another, and that the 7,000 Americans now assigned to Subic will be allowed to remain.
 
One-Year Grace Period
 Although the current lease agreement for the sprawling base runs out next Monday, the United States could invoke a clause permitting Americans to remain at Subic for another year, allowing time to reach a new agreement on the base.
In a televised address to the nation, Mrs. Aquino -- whose term ends next year and who appears ready to make ratification of the base agreement the last great battle of her administration -- declared that it would be "ill-advised, even foolish," for the Senate to reject the treaty.
Under the base agreement, the United States will pay the Philippines $203 million annually for a 10-year extension on the lease for Subic, a huge repair and logistics center for the United States Seventh Fleet.
The United States is now in the process of abandoning Clark Air Base, the other major American military installation in the Philippines, after it was smothered by volcanic ash released in the eruption in June of Mount Pinatubo.

The Annual Game Of Auto Pricing

BYLINE: By Louis Uchitelle

 BODY:
THE 1992 model cars go on sale this month, and in advance of their debuts, the auto manufacturers have been announcing hefty price increases. The increases amount to 3 to 4 percent for the average car, and more -- sometimes much more -- if a car is redesigned, as the Ford Taurus or the Toyota Camry have been, or is equipped with costly new devices, like the driver-side air bags in the 1992 Honda Accord.
On the face of it, such increases in a car's list, or sticker, price are likely to discourage many Americans from buying 1992 models at a moment when the national economy is weak and people are nervous about job security. Given this reluctance to spend, the laws of supply and demand suggest that prices should fall, or at least not rise, if the industry is to sell all of the 1992 cars soon to be made. But the auto companies -- American and Japanese alike -- do not easily give ground on prices. 
 "People say, 'How in the world can you raise prices when your sales are down and times are tough?' " said Joel Pitcoff, manager of research and analysis at Ford. "But there is a fundamental philosophical issue here. If manufacturing costs go up, as they have, you must at least raise the list prices to try to cover the higher costs."
And then comes the caveat that has undercut sticker price increases since the mid-1980's. Remember, Mr. Pitcoff says, "we are talking about list prices that no one ends up paying."
So why not forgo the announced sticker price increases and sell 1992 cars at 1991 prices? The answer from the industry is that survival is at stake. Ford, General Motors and Chrysler have lost tens of millions of dollars in recent months, and the Japanese manufacturers are also watching their profits shrink or disappear. Higher stickerprices, however unrealistic they may turn out to be, are nevertheless, as Mr. Pitcoff suggests, the industry's main hope of becoming profitable again.
The goal, of course, is to sell cars for as close to sticker prices as possible. But in these times of reluctant consumers, at least half of the increase in sticker prices is likely to be given back through sales incentives intended to lure buyers and hold on to market share. These incentives include such things as cash rebates from manufacturers, an artificially high trade-in allowance on the old family car and smaller margins for car dealers.
Not all car makers and dealers offer the same givebacks. Japanese auto makers that are gaining market share are less likely to give ground than the Americans. A Honda is under less pressure to return some of its announced sticker price increases than a General Motors, which has lost customers. But taking all the companies into account, what Americans actually end up paying for 1992 cars will, on average, probably be less than 2 percent above the average price for 1991 models, many experts say. And that modest rise has been roughly the annual increase since 1988.
Even so, cars are expensive: more than $16,300 apiece, on average, representing half a year's earnings for an American consumer with a median family income. That is a daunting outlay for many Americans and a major reason the auto companies find themselves stuck with givebacks.
"They raise sticker prices to give themselves room for rebates, but they don't seem to understand the damaging psychological impact of an announced price increase," said Thomas O'Grady, president of Integrated Automotive Resources Inc., an industry consulting firm.
Still, the auto companies and their dealers think that with a little luck, 1992 might turn out to be better than usual for price increases. Many Americans, for example, are driving six-year-old cars, purchased in 1985, a big year for sales. The owners are eager to replace these aging vehicles before they break down, says Ronald Glantz, an auto analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds. If a recovery from the recession materializes, they might even be willing to pay close to the new sticker prices, or so the industry hopes.
What's more, the recession has kept many lower-income people on the sidelines. The average buyer is more affluent, more willing to pay a bit more for a car, says Terry Sullivan, a General Motors spokesman. "Price increases are possible with low sales volume, and, with fewer unsold cars in inventory these days, you don't have to be as generous in your negotiations," he said.
But too few sales, even if all are at the higher sticker prices, also wipe out profits. That has been the danger for Frank Anderson Jr., president of the National Automobile Dealers Association and owner of Sir Walter Chevy in Raleigh, N.C. He says his dealership must sell 100 vehicles a month -- new and used -- to break even. Lately, sales have fallen to as low as 110 a month from more than 200 in good years. To keep above the 100 mark, Mr. Anderson has trimmed his dealer's profit to give back some of the sticker price.
Auto manufacturers are similarly afflicted by declining volume. As Mr. Glantz puts it: "All it takes is one company saying, 'Oh, gee, we want to keep the factory running, so let's offer rebates.' One does it and the others soon say, 'We'll offer incentives, too.' "

HEADLINE: Chip Indicator Off in Month

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 9

 BODY:
Seasonally weak economic activity in the United States electronics industry caused the semiconductor industry's leading indicator to fall for the fourth straight month in August, a trade group said today.
The organization, the Semiconductor Industry Association, based in San Jose, Calif., reported a book-to-bill ratio of 0.94 for the three-month period that ended in August, down from 0.96 in July, and from a revised figure of 1.01 in June. 
 The ratio compares orders with shipments and is considered a leading indicator of the industry's performance. A ratio of 0.94 indicates that for every $100 worth of product shipped, $94 was ordered, indicating that demand had declined.
At $1.21 billion, three-month orders for August were down 2.5 percent from $1.24 billion for the period ending in July, and 1.2 percent lower than the comparable figure for a year ago, which was $1.22 billion.
Three-month average shipments for August totaled $1.28 billion, down six-tenths of a percent from July. At $1.24 billion, actual United States market shipments for August were up nine-tenths of a percent from $1.18 billion in July.

A.T.& T. In Link to Armenia

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
In a step that could provide a model for modernizing telephone communications throughout the technologically backward Soviet Union, A.T.& T. next month plans to provide long-distance service directly to Armenia, a first for a Soviet republic. Like the rest of the Soviet Union, Armenia has received its few calls through the scarce and sternly monitored lines funneling through Moscow.
But Moscow itself is able to receive fewer calls through normal telephone channels than a medium-size Manhattan apartment building, or 91 simultaneous conversations. And even that is a sharp increase from as few as 16 simultaneous calls as recently as 1987. The Communist Party kept telecommunications primitive as a means of political control. Some switching equipment, essential for completing a call, dates to before the 1917 Revolution.
 
First Direct Dialing
 The American Telephone and Telegraph Company in mid-October will provide 200 new long-distance circuits into Armenia using A.T.& T.'s flagship 5 ESS digital switching system. That would make direct-dial calls possible for the first time. Calls today go through a central operator in Moscow and can take three days or more to complete. 
 The new circuitry, a result of an accord negotiated last year, patches calls through Intelsat, a satellite network run by a Western consortium. It can be expanded over the next few years to make as many as 500 simultaneous conversations possible.
Armenian-Americans, the largest group of Armenian heritage outside Armenia, are pleased with the move. "We are absolutely elated," said Ross Vartian, executive director of the Armenian Assembly of America, a lobbying group in Washington.
 
Circuits Overloaded
 The Armenian venture, however, still makes little headway in the enormous problems confronting the Soviet Union's telephone system. Last month, during the turbulent days of the coup, circuits from the United States into Moscow were routinely flooded. Last week, with phone traffic subsiding, as many as 13,000 calls were tried every hour from the United States, A.T.& T. said.
To comfortably handle normal phone volume into the Soviet Union, A.T.& T. figures it would need enough capacity for 2,300 calls. Because of the shortage of capacity, businesses, news publications and others must often rely on expensive satellite communications that can cost $18 or more a minute. A.T.& T. service, while scarce, costs $1.70 to $2.25 a minute. Rates for the new Armenian service have not been determined yet.
If the A.T.& T. venture is successful, it could well provide a model for expanding modern phone service into the other republics that, like Armenia, have either declared or are leaning toward independence.
While the A.T.& T. deal with Armenia is structured as a joint venture, it involves only a small outlay by Armenia of scarce hard currency. Much of the $6 million expense will be borne by A.T.& T. and by American consumers paying for calls into the republic. A.T.& T., as well as other companies like United Telecommunications Inc.'s U S Sprint, say such ventures will pay off in the long run as the flagging economies of the Soviet republics eventually revive.
"It's an incredible breakthrough," said Paul G. Quinlan, A.T.& T.'s managing director of the European region, including the Soviet Union. A.T.& T. officials were worried that the recent coup might undo more than a year's worth of negotiations, but say now that the coup's failure will make possible Armenia-style arrangements with other republics.
"The situation is fluid, but we're very hopeful about our talks with a number of other republics," Mr. Quinlan said. He would not be more specific.
U S Sprint's international division had also bid for service to Armenia, but acknowledged it was at least a month behind in putting together a full proposal. "A.T.& T. beat us to the punch," said Philip M. Walker, U S Sprint's vice president of international affairs. "But there's more than enough work to go around."
Armenia has the second-busiest international phone traffic in the Soviet Union after Moscow, largely because so many Armenians live outside Armenia. A republic of 3.6 million people, 1.7 million Armenians live elsewhere in the Soviet Union or abroad because of ethnic massacres by Ottoman Turks dating to before the turn of the century.
 
Tangle During Earthquake
 Some one million ethnic Armenians live in the United States. When a devastating earthquake in 1988 killed or made homeless one out of seven Armenians, the lack of long-distance lines tangled emergency relief.
Moscow may have agreed to Armenia's independent phone service as a way of relieving congestion into Moscow. Moreover, the central Government's inability to deal with the earthquake's continuing devastation may have played a role. With improved telecommunications, Armenia is in a better position to lobby for international aid.
"Soviet telecommunications today is like the United States in the 1920's," said Mariam Nigohosian, an Armenian-speaking A.T.& T. official who helped negotiate the deal. She had previously worked with Soviet officials for three years on improving phone service in Moscow.
In August 1990, Armenia began the process of declaring independence by changing its name to the Republic of Armenia from the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic. On Sept. 21, it plans to hold a referendum in which voters can decide whether the republic should stay within the Soviet Union.
In Leningrad, now to be known officially as St. Petersburg, U S West Inc. announced yesterday the beginning of cellular telephone service to about 750 subscribers.

HEADLINE: Dow Off 4.47, to 3,007.16, in Quiet Trading

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stock prices fell slightly yesterday in sleepy trading, with many investors absent in observance of Rosh ha-Shanah. Smaller stocks showed gains, but over all the market was sluggish, weighed down mainly by the blue chips.
The Dow Jones industrial average drifted 4.47 points lower to close at 3,007.16. The bond market's firmness helped stocks trim some of their early modest declines. Some traders thought the market would be susceptible to futures-related program trades, but that did not materialze. 
 Big Board volume was 115.1 million shares, down from 167.5 million on Friday. It was the lowest trading level since Friday, July 5, when volume was 69.9 million. Declining issues outnumbered gainers by 803 to 732.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index slipped 0.37 point, to 213.4, while the Standard & Poor's index of 500 mostly blue-chip stocks was down 0.53 point, to 388.57.
On the American Stock Exchange, the composite index fell by 0.64, to 369.06, while the over-the-counter composite index, representing the small issues, rose by 1.13, to 518.07.
 
Lower Blue Chips
 Blue chips were under pressure throughout most of yesterday, trading lower despite a rise in bond prices. Bond traders, hopeful for an easing of interest rates by the Federal Reserve, pushed prices up, and the rate on long bonds dropped below 8 percent.
Robert C. Walberg, equity analyst at MMS International, said the stock market was awaiting a signal, either in the form of a Fed easing or a series of strong economic reports. "Until then, we may experience a modest correction, with the Dow slipping to 2,910 at the bottom," he said.
Within the last two weeks, Mr. Walberg said, there has been a decoupling of the stock and bond markets as investors shifted their focus from interest rates to company earnings.
"Steady declines in bond yields will prop up stocks," he said, "and prevent a sizable correction, unless of course the economy is much weaker than expected and company earnings have a difficult time coming back." And if a correction should come as a result of a weaker economy and softer earnings, it could be in the 5 to 10 percent range, Mr. Walberg added, although he said he did not think that would happen.
 
Gain for I.B.M.
 I.B.M., which expects to announce several products this week, rose 1 5/8, to 101. The company was also helped by reports that it would enter a second joint venture with Apple Computer. Apple gained 1 3/4, to 53 1/4.
Ameritrust fell 1/2, to 28, as analysts reported rumors that the company's board had met, or would meet, to consider possible bids for the company.
Nevada Power fell 1 3/8, to 17 7/8, as the company announced that the Nevada Public Service Commission had recommended that Nevada Power cut rates by $4.6 million annually. The utility had requested a $37.6 million rate increase.
NCR, which reported a poor earnings outlook, dropped 1 7/8, to 107 3/4. In its merger talks with A.T.& T., which fell 5/8, to 38 1/8, NCR estimated 1991 net of $386 million on revenues of $6.62 billion, both higher than 1990. The company now says the 1991 results will be lower than that projection. NCR shareholders are to vote on the proposed merger with A.T.& T. this Friday.
Volume in the three most-active stocks -- Salomon, the Limited and Pepsico -- was about two million shares each.
Salomon rose 1/4, to 24 1/4, despite news that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had entered the investigation of possible trading violations by the firm.
The Limited, a retailer, slipped by 1/8, to 24 3/4, while Pepsico gained 3/4, to 29 3/4. Both issues have been rebounding from earlier declines.
U.S. Healthcare fell 2 1/8, to 22 1/4, as Peter Grua, an Alex. Brown & Sons analyst, lowered his recommendation to neutral from a buy.

HEADLINE: Hoboken-Newark Rail Link Opens as Part of Multimillion-Dollar Expansion

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOBOKEN, N.J., Sept. 9

 BODY:
Four trains carried 498 rush-hour passengers over $16 million worth of new rail line between Newark and Hoboken this morning, in the first phase of a $500 million plan to expand rail access in New Jersey to the Hudson River waterfront and midtown Manhattan.
The new commuting option, called the Waterfront Connection, is the first extension of train service in northern New Jersey since 1967. Officials of N.J. Transit, the state's mass-transit agency, said the multimillion-dollar price tag for the entire expansion project, which will connect New Jersey's 12 commuter train lines over the next decade, was justified on grounds including economic expansion, urban revitalization and the possibility of reducing the use of cars, cutting polluting emissions and improving air quality. 
 "Railroad expansion projects are cost intensive," said Rose Sheridan, a spokeswoman for N.J. Transit. "We view these projects as a commitment to the future of the waterfront area and as a catalyst for more economic development there." The waterfront attracted hundreds of millions of dollars in development in the 1980's.
This morning's four rush-hour trains attracted a ridership two shy of N.J. Transit's first-year goal of 500 rush-hour passengers, said Sandra Check, a spokeswoman for the agency. Officials expect that 1,400 passengers will ride the new service daily each way by the end of the third year.
 
Increased Connections
 By 1995, the expansion is to include a new $61 million link that will give residents from Morris, Essex, Passaic and Somerset Counties a direct route to Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. And by the time the project is finished, around the turn of the century, it is to provide a new $400 million terminal and track system in Secaucus, near the Meadowlands, that will for the first time allow passengers from Bergen, Hudson and Passaic Counties in New Jersey and Rockland and Orange Counties in New York to travel directly to midtown Manhattan, to Newark or to points south and west in the state.
Financing for the project is to come primarily from New Jersey's Transportation Trust Fund, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the Federal Department of Transportation.
The new Hoboken-Newark service provides a second rail route, in addition to existing PATH trains, to New Jersey's Hudson waterfront for residents from the New Jersey shore, the Trenton-Princeton region and Somerset, Union, and Middlesex Counties.
The bulk of the $16 million for the project was used to buy and install 4,000 feet of new track and new electrical signals and track switches. The project links two track systems: the Amtrak-N.J. Transit line between Newark's Penn Station and Manhattan's Pennsylvania Station, and a Morris and Essex Line that terminates in Hoboken. New Jersey's Transportation Trust Fund and the Port Authority each paid $8 million, officials said.
Twelve trains will run daily, including four each in the morning and evening rush hours. They provide direct Newark-Hoboken service for riders on the North Jersey Coast Line, which serves Ocean, Monmouth and Middlesex Counties. In addition, riders on the Northeast Corridor line that serves the Princeton region and the Raritan Valley line that runs through Hunterdon, Somerset and Union Counties can switch trains in Newark for Hoboken.
Richard O'Day, a 24-year-old employee of the corporate banking section of Credit Suisse on Wall Street, was on the 7:54 from Newark this morning for the 19-minute run to Hoboken. Normally he switches at Newark to the PATH train for the World Trade Center.
"It seems like this might be a little quicker," Mr. O'Day said. "It'll certainly be more convenient than getting on PATH and standing all the way and getting squeezed at every stop."
At the Hoboken train terminal, Mr. O'Day took the ferry that has been operating to the World Financial Center in Battery Park City on weekday rush hours since October 1989.
Later, he reported that he got to work at 8:55, about 15 minutes later than most mornings.
"Maybe it was slow for the first day, but it was a nice trip," Mr. O'Day said. "I'm probably going to take it again, probably toward the end of next week."

HEADLINE: Dinkins's Trip to Africa: Who Will Pay?

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
With an entourage of several dozen city officials and black business people in tow, Mayor David N. Dinkins is to leave the daily maelstrom of New York on Monday for a whirlwind tour through even more turbulent precincts: the cities and black townships of South Africa.
But less than a week before the delegation's scheduled departure, city officials have yet to say just how or from whom they will raise the $400,000 needed for the trip, which the Mayor has said would be paid for by private contributions. Last night, some mayoral aides said the fundraising was far behind pace and expressed concern about whether enough can be raised in time. 
 The Mayor's press secretary, Leland T. Jones, said yesterday that not all the money had been raised, but that he did not know how much had been. He said names of the donors would be made public eventually. Mr. Dinkins said last week that he and his wife, Joyce, would not contribute anything.
Mayoral aides have billed the trip as an effort to foster cultural and economic ties between New York and whatever post-apartheid regime emerges in South Africa, and to lend support to the black majority there. But it is also shaping up as a hectic weeklong ramble, part sentimental journey, part pep rally for the African National Congress, whose leader, Nelson Mandela, was given a triumphal welcome by the Mayor in New York last year.
The group, including the city's health and finance commissioners, the Dinkins family's Episcopal parish priest, the president of the Board of Education and the Mayor's official photographer, will fly by chartered plane to Johannesburg, Durban and Cape Town, with a brief stopover in Rome for a papal audience on the way and a night in Lagos, Nigeria, on the way home.
The city has been active in pressing sanctions against companies that do business with South Africa, and in using its pension fund investments to prod American companies to divest themselves of their holdings there. As the first black mayor of the nation's largest city, he has approached the trip with great anticipation and emotion.
"Aside from sort of going to the homeland aspect of it, that clearly is an aspect," he said yesterday. "But also in South Africa, we have the only legalized form of white supremacy in the world. It is immoral, and to be able to visit South Africa and be of some assistance in the general situation, and to help ease the transition when freedom really comes to South Africa is a tremendously satisfying thought, to be some small part of it."
Mr. Dinkins said he also hoped to meet with President F. W. deKlerk and with Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi of the Inkatha Freedom Party, the Zulu-based archrival of Mr. Mandela's A.N.C. Over the weekend, renewed factional fighting among blacks killed more than 40 people. But the Mayor made it clear where his sympathies lay, and said a Congressional representative would be with him wherever he went "so that there will not be any misunderstanding of what my posture is."
New York has long practiced foreign policy, and former Mayor Edward I. Koch took official or quasi-official jaunts to Japan, Ireland, China and Nicaragua, financed by both the city and private groups. But in recent days, even some of the Dinkins aides who scrambled for the ultimate expression of their boss's favor -- an invitation -- have quietly acknowledged concern at how elaborate this trip has grown, at a time when the city is facing so many problems of its own.
"It's a big list, a big list," said one aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The one cost the city will pay is for the Mayor's bodyguards. No one will say how many are going (since that would breach security). The charter airfare alone is $6,000 a person.
The delegation has been divided into teams, in fields from education and health, to business development and religion, and has produced some strange bedfellows. For example, the Rev. Herbert Daughtry, the fiery Pentecostal minister who has been at the center of a number of racially charged cases in recent years, will team with the Rev. Canon Frederick Williams, the staid rector of the Church of the Intercession, the Dinkins family church in upper Manhattan.
Other members of his delegation conceded that their friends had asked them some skeptical questions, but they defended the trip as important.
 
Raising Money
 "I've gotten a fair amount of it myself," said Vincent McGee, the executive director of the Aaron Diamond Foundation, who is paying his own way because the foundation supports only New York institutions.
H. Carl McCall, a vice president at Citibank and the President of the Board of Education, said: "I know we've got our own problems. I think if the Mayor were to go to Jersey City tomorrow, people would ask why. But I think it's an appropriate part of his responsibility."
The administration is raising money through the New York City Business Assistance Corporation, a nonprofit city-run corporation that has raised private money to finance other efforts, including the ticker-tape parade for veterans of the Persian Gulf war and Mr. Dinkins's "Urban Summit" meeting of big city mayors last year.
The City Charter bars officials from accepting gifts from people who do business with the city, and some civic groups have questioned whether it is appropriate for the Mayor to finance the trip this way. But past rulings from the city's Conflicts of Interest Board have found that soliciting money from private parties through the Business Assistance Corporation did not constitute a conflict.
"We will make the list of major donors public," said Mr. Jones, the mayoral spokesman. "We operate in the full light of day."
At least one member of the delegation said he was not only paying his own way, but trying to persuade friends to contribute too. Lee Dunham, the head of the Harlem McDonald's Group, which owns eight of the fast-food restaurants with 625 employees, many of them black youths, said he wanted to scout out the possibilities of bringing the Big Mac to South Africa.

HEADLINE: Where Sununu Stands

 BODY:
TO John H. Sununu, Chief of Staff to President Bush and the person who is by all accounts the single individual most responsible for the United States's wait-and-see stance on global warming, the question is a straightforward one of economic growth versus an unproven environmental threat.
And he suggests that the drive to put a cap on carbon dioxide emissions, a byproduct of growth that many scientists fear will cause the earth's climate to warm, is the latest vehicle adopted by a perennial "no-growth" movement whose roots go back at least to the early 1970's. 
 The Administration argues that when all heat-trapping atmospheric gases are taken into account, rather than just carbon dioxide by itself, actions already taken by the United States will stabilize its total contribution to the potential for global warming at 1990 levels in the year 2000. But European governments, and virtually all American environmentalists, advocate targets for capping carbon dioxide emissions separately.
This focus on carbon dioxide alone, Mr. Sununu said in an interview, "increases skepticism that some people are less concerned about climate change and more concerned about establishing an anti-growth policy." Such people "keep finding surrogates for no-growth," he said.
As Governor of New Hampshire before he became the President's Chief of Staff, Mr. Sununu gained a reputation as favoring economic growth over environmental regulation.
On global warming, he said that the Administration had "a very strong commitment toward making sure we develop a superior understanding of the reality of global climate change" before making "either national or international decisions that are multi-trillion dollar decisions in terms of impacts on the economy and jobs."
A particular concern of his, he said, is that the mathematical models that predict global warming are unrealistic and have led to assessments that are "either incomplete or inconclusive." The Administration's basic concern, he said, is that "when we do implement policies they are based on fact rather than perhaps on not-so-solid assumptions."

HEADLINE: Economic Pulse: The Southeast -- A Special Report.;
Reminders of Its Old Poverty Hit South in Recession's Grip

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SPARTANBURG, S.C.

 BODY:
It is about 70 miles from Spartanburg to Great Falls, but the distance between these South Carolina towns is the difference between the Southeast's future and its past. Spartanburg has been able to replace lost textile jobs; Great Falls has not.
Spartanburg and the neighboring communities along the Interstate 85 corridor in the northwest corner of the state are now home to companies like Michelin, Mita and Hoechst Celanese. The area boasts one of the largest concentrations of foreign manufacturing companies in the United States. 
 In contrast, Great Falls has long been a one-company town. In the 1980's, that company, J. P. Stevens, closed its three textile mills in Great Falls, eliminating 1,600 jobs in a town of 2,600 people.
 
Reminder in Recession
 "The South is still a split-level economy," said Wayne Gantt, chief economist with Interstate/Johnson Lane, an investment company in Charlotte, N.C. "When you get the upturn, you see the beauty of the New South. When you get a downturn, you sometimes see the problems of the Old South. Fortunately, the patina that's lasting and working is that the bulk of the economy is really in the New South."
After decades of outpacing the nation in economic growth, the Southeast now finds itself growing at about the national rate. The current recession has provided a chilly reminder of how close the faltering economies of the Old South are to the dynamic economies of the New.
The recession has bruised some of the South's highest fliers, like Atlanta and Charlotte, which had come to expect uninterrupted prosperity. And with the downturn has come an insistent message: The low-wage, low-skill businesses that built much of the modern South can no longer deliver prosperity in a world where the low-skill jobs once done in Great Falls can be done more cheaply in Taiwan or Mexico.
There is no perfect definition for "the South" -- indeed, the southernmost state of all, Florida, has such a huge and distinctive economy that it hardly seems part of the region. But the six other states clustered in the southeastern corner of the country -- North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Mississippi and Alabama -- share enough economic characteristics that regional trends emerge.
Most experts expect the economies of these six states to outpace the rest of the nation in economic growth over the next decade or so. But to do that, they say, two things must happen.
First, these states will have to bridge some of the gap between prosperous metropolitan areas and the small rural towns, many of them desperately poor, that have been left behind. Second, they will have to upgrade their lagging school systems to insure that the work force has the skills employers will be looking for in the 21st century.
Many of the region's historic business advantages -- low labor and living costs, a pro-business, anti-union environment and a good quality of life -- still remain, if in a somewhat diminished form, as the Southeast's economy becomes more like the nation's. But now the region must contend with an era when employers need more than cheap, unskilled labor.
"Until the 1970's, our economy really was based on a low-skill work force; then all of a sudden the earth plates of economic life in the world shifted," said Jesse L. White Jr., an economic development consultant in Chapel Hill, N.C., and former executive director of the Southern Growth Policies Board. "All of a sudden, workers had to be skilled, they had to be flexible and our work force was completely ill equipped because we hadn't really educated them. So our human capital base was our most impoverished. That's what we're trying to overcome, and we've still got a long way to go."
 
Growth
Outsiders Supplant Regional Traditions
 The rebirth of the Southeast is most often depicted in terms of its biggest cities. There is Atlanta, where the metropolitan area grew by 600,000 persons to slightly more than 2 million in the 1980's; Charlotte, now one of the nation's banking centers, and Birmingham, once a symbol of racial division and the South's isolation from the nation, and now dominated by the medical and educational complex of the University of Alabama at Birmingham.
But the picture may be more stark in less glamorous places like Greenville and Spartanburg, once the heart of the textile industry in the Carolinas. In the 1950's, textiles accounted for 86 percent of Spartanburg's jobs, and Greenville was billed as the Textile Capital of the World. Now, textiles employ only 41 percent of workers in Spartanburg, and people in Greenville and Spartanburg are more eager to talk about international companies locating there than they are about the still-formidable textile base.
"We're not into Japan bashing here in Greenville," said Richard S. Kadzis, a spokesman for the Greater Greenville Chamber of Commerce as he stopped by a $50 million plant under construction for Mita Inc., a giant of the copying industry. Greenville, where the metropolitan area has grown from 414,000 in 1960 to 650,000 now, has an unemployment rate of 5.1 percent, the lowest in South Carolina. "In fact, all the international firms create a natural environment that encourages Asians to move in," Mr. Kadzis said.
Some defunct textile plants have been recycled for other uses, like the one that now makes all the tennis balls sold by Wilson Sporting Goods, which is now owned by a Finnish corporation.
 
A New Economic World
 What is most striking about the economy of the Southeast is that, despite the fierce attachment to the culture of the past, most of the economic bright spots reflect an utterly new economic world.
Few of the traditional industries that built the South -- tobacco in Durham, textiles in Greenville, steel in Birmingham, shipping in Mobile, cotton in the Mississippi Delta -- have figured significantly in its resurgence.
Instead, there is the new Nations Bank in Charlotte helping lead the nationwide consolidation in the banking industry; the service-driven econonomy of Atlanta; the high-tech corridors of the Research Triangle in North Carolina or in northern Alabama around Decatur and Huntsville; the modern automobile manufacturing plants run by Nissan and General Motors' Saturn division in Tennessee.
Much of the growth, as can be seen here, is fueled by foreign investment drawn to places like Dothan, Ala., or Columbus, Ga., by the Southeast's non-union work force and access to both the East Coast and and important American markets. In 1989, for example, South Carolina led the nation in per capita foreign investment.
 
No Sneers for Overseas
 Thus, Atlanta's snaring of the 1996 Summer Olympics has more to do with economics than with sports.
"Foreign investment is probably the biggest positive investment trend we have in the South," said Prof. Donald Ratajczak of Georgia State University in Atlanta. "In the Midwest, they kind of sneer at foreigners. In the Northeast, they kind of ignore them. We kind of love them. We've been geared at trying to bring in development for so long, so what if the guy coming in is Japanese or German?"
For optimists, those gains are part of a pervasive, long-term upward trend that is seeing the nation's population inexorably move south, with the Southeast's metropolitan areas the greatest beneficiaries. In the 1980's, all the Southern states except Mississippi rose in their rankings among the 50 states for per capita income.
North Carolina rose from 44th to 35th, Georgia from 38th to 30th, South Carolina from 48th to 42d. Mississippi, 50th in 1980, was still 50th in 1990.
"I run a workshop for newcomers to the South," said David R. Goldfield, a historian and expert on Southern cities at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. "The one comment I always get is that life is so much easier here than in New Jersey or Michigan or wherever they came from. You don't have to fight the climate, you don't have to fight the people, you don't have to fight the traffic as much as in other parts of the country. You're going to continue to get that migration, and that's very important for the economy of the metropolitan South."
 
Poverty
A Dazzling Sun But Deep Shadows
 It is a measure of how far the South has come that people most often think of it now in terms of economic prosperity rather than the economic backwater it used to be.
But in vast bands of poverty like the Mississippi Delta or stretches of the South Carolina low country, and just off the interstates in the sagging mill towns of the Carolinas, the past lives.
Thus, while Spartanburg and Greenville prosper, the old mill towns nearby, with simple frame houses spreading outward from brick factories in the center of town, are trying to reinvent themselves.
Many, like Great Falls in Chester County, are still trying to recover from the recession of the early 1980's. After three mills closed in the past year and a half in the county seat of Chester, unemployment in the county stood at 15.3 percent, highest in South Carolina.
The dislocation is part of a structural change slowly making its way through the South -- a shift away from the low-wage, labor-intensive manufacturing that once defined the region but now cannot compete with workers in Taiwan, Singapore or Mexico.
 
What's Left to Close?
 "You always thought that something that was here for so long could never close down, but it did, and there's not much left here to close anymore," said Randy Campbell, as he gazed at the deserted shell of the last of the three J. P. Stevens textile mills to close here. "I don't think in my lifetime this town will ever recover to what it was."
Mr. Campbell, now 51 and working at a Mack Truck plant in Winnsboro, 17 miles away, worked at all three Stevens plants here, moving from one to the other as they closed, with the final shutdown coming in 1984.
Small producers use some of the space, but much of Great Falls's downtown is still shuttered and the town is still struggling to get back on its feet.
Similarly, the textile industry throughout the Southeast, which employs about 495,000 of the nation's 706,000 textile workers, is cutting back. Older, inefficient operations are being halted, and new plants tend to be highly automated ones that employ fewer people. In North Carolina, the largest textile-producing state, 43,000 textile and apparel jobs have been lost over the past 10 years. Textile employment has fallen from a peak of 290,000 in 1973 to 208,000 now.
"Part of what has happened in this industry over the past 10 or 11 years has been a shaking out, a survival of the fittest kind of thing," said Dennis Julian, executive vice president of the North Carolina Textile Manufacturers Association. "I think at this point, I see it stabilizing. Whether it's going to turn around to the point we would see our employment numbers go up, I can't say."
The recession has heightened the pressure on the low-end manufacturers, and it has dealt an unexpected shock to cities like Atlanta and Charlotte that had begun to feel invulnerable.
While Atlanta was basking in the glow generated by the Olympics, it found itself in its worst economic downturn since the mid 1970's.
A recent report by Salomon Brothers ranked the city 81st among 100 cities in total job growth over the past year. The report said Atlanta's labor force declined by about six-tenths of 1 percent, or 9,300 jobs. Professor Ratajczak said Atlanta had been hurt by a slump in building, the demise of Eastern Airlines, a downturn in convention business because of the Persian Gulf war and other factors.
Some $418 million in construction generated by the Olympics and a cyclical turnaround are expected to help before long. But when Atlanta, long the standard-bearer for the South's economic growth, stumbled, it was a cautionary note for the region.
In fact, as the Southeast was becoming synonymous with growth instead of poverty, the region was growing at a rate at or below that of the nation as a whole for the first time in decades. Optimists see that as a temporary lull, but many others also see it as a signal that the region has an unfinished economic agenda that could pose difficult problems.
 
Problems
Keys to Future In the Classrooms
 The very different worries of Great Falls and Atlanta merge in one area: education.
By almost any standard, the educational problems in the South are the nation's worst. During the era when industrial promoters were selling an ample, undemanding work force, the lack of education was not a problem.
Now, when even factory jobs often require skilled, adaptable workers, the major alarm sounded by public officials and industrial leaders is often about schools. But despite optimistic rhetoric, there is little sign of dramatic progress. Typical is the situation of Mississippi, where the Legislature approved dramatic educational reforms -- and then found itself unable to find money to pay for them.
Figures for 1989 show the six Southeastern states ranking near the bottom in A.C.T. and S.A.T. scores, ranking from a high of 23d to a low of 49th in high school graduation rates and from a high of 25th to a low of 47th in average teacher salaries.
In a report entitled "The South's Achilles Heel: Education Must Improve to Sustain Economic Growth," Gary W. Tapp, chief economist for the Robinson-Humphrey Company, an investment concern in Atlanta, said that over the rest of the century, an estimated 10 million new jobs could be created in the South, about half of which will require some post-secondary education and about a third of which will require college graduates.
"Education is the No. 1 obstacle that the South needs to overcome to go to the next phase of economic growth," he said in an interview. "Even someone who runs a printing press or a textile loom has to be able to read and understand a fairly complicated manual, and it's bound to be a computer-driven machine. If the South can't respond quickly enough to its educational needs, those jobs are going to go some place else."
 
Despair in the Outback
 And others worry that the South, home to half the nation's blacks, is perpetuating some of the nation's most entrenched two-tier economies, with boundless opportunity for the well educated in the cities and little more than despair in the rural outback.
Still, in a region where optimism, like football, seems to be genetically wired into the culture, most people are more sanguine. They say the region is likely to continue to import talent much as it has over the past two decades. And, as the nation ages, an influx of retirees, who already have transformed coastal areas like Hilton Head, S.C., and mountain towns like Asheville, N.C., will provide a huge boost to the Southeast, probably at the expense of communities to the north.
And, at the least, the South is still marked by a mania for development, an uncynical adherence to the ethic of growth dating back to the industrial-recruitment strategies of the first Southern economic revolution.
That could change as environmental problems grow. A recent study by the liberal Institute for Southern Studies ranked the South's environmental problems and policies the nation's worst. But for now, there is little of the no-growth sentiment of the Pacific Northwest or the skepticism about flat-out boosterism found in New England or the Northeast.
Thus, even in ailing Great Falls, the town's funeral home owner and Mayor, James R. Baker, drives around in his van with his slick "Great Falls . . . Great!" brochures and plans for the town's new city-built industrial park and sewer line linking the town to the nearby Interstate.
"We're survivors," he said. "We're not going to be defeated by a textile crunch or anything else."

HEADLINE: Food for the Soviet People

 BODY:
As the Soviet economy implodes, the Soviet people are finding it harder and harder to put food on the table. The onset of the harsh Soviet winter won't make food shipments any easier. That's why the Bush Administration is wise to act now to assess the shortages and determine the best ways to distribute food donations.
Americans in good conscience stand ready to help. That's the humane thing to do. It's also prudent. Americans have no interest in aggravating the severe economic crisis now gripping the Soviet Union. That would only intensify popular discontent and sow disorder -- unfavorable conditions for democratic politics and a market economy. 
 An Agriculture Department fact-finding mission is scheduled to visit the Soviet Union in October. That might, in compassion, be moved up. And the Administration needs to consider new ways to provide food instead of simply offering loan guarantees that banks seem reluctant to accept.
Experts estimate that this year's harvest in the Soviet Union will fall 25 percent below last year's record high. Last year, despite the bumper crop, distribution difficulties caused spot shortages. This year is almost certain to be worse. Political turmoil has interfered with planting and harvesting and disrupted the flow of food from the countryside to the cities. Food-exporting republics have embargoed sales to food-importing republics. And triple-digit inflation gives producers an incentive to withhold food from the market in anticipation of higher prices later on.
Aid from the U.S. and others could put some food on the shelves. More important, it would give producers an inducement to bring food to market by deflating expectations of price rises.
The Bush Administration needs to consider other ways to provide food. It has already given $1.5 billion in credit guarantees to banks that issue loans to the Soviet Union to import food. The guarantees provide that in the event of a Soviet default, the U.S. Government would repay 98 percent of the principal plus the first 4.5 percentage points of interest on that principal.
Even so, no U.S. bank has been willing to make a loan to the Soviet Union, with its soaring foreign debt and doubtful creditworthiness. Four European banks, under pressure from their governments, did participate in a pre-coup installment of $600 million in loans for grain purchases. Not one has responded to a post-coup $315 million installment.
Moscow has asked the U.S. Government to guarantee 100 percent of the loan, but there may be better ways to do it. Another possibility is to provide food on easy terms under Public Law 480, the law governing disposal of agricultural surpluses. A third is to declare the Soviet Union eligible for disaster relief from the U.S. However it does so, America needs to act expeditiously to relieve Soviet hunger and discontent.

HEADLINE: Israel Should Have $10 Billion Loan Guarantee

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Israel, Most of All, Needs a Just Settlement" (letter, Aug. 18), David Rubenstein's otherwise insightful response to your July 28 Week in Review analysis on the Middle East, contains a blatant misconception regarding United States aid to Israel. 
 He erroneously links United States aid of $4 billion to the requested $10 billion loan guarantee Israel is seeking strictly for humanitarian purposes. The emergency fund would aid in the resettlement of Soviet and Ethiopian emigres facing horrendous conditions in housing and employment.
The Israeli Government is asking the United States to co-sign a loan to be granted by private commercial banks. In no way does the requested assistance entail additional financial support from our Treasury, save for some standard administrative costs, which are under negotiation. And Israel has an indisputably sound record of repayment. The American Jewish community is grappling with these points to educate the American public at large.
The Jewish leadership in the United States is keenly sensitive to the economic hardships confronting our cities and communities. It is precisely this type of misinterpretation -- however unintentional -- that feeds resentment and dangerously reinforces the unjust belief that the United States dotes on a spoiled Israel at the expense of our own domestic agenda.

HEADLINE: Washington at Work;
Balancing Influence and Integrity

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 9

 BODY:
Frank Mankiewicz was nervous. He played with a pencil on the desk in his glass cubicle office. He took a call from his son in California. He hung up and twirled the pencil like an airplane propeller, round and round and round on the desktop.
Mr. Mankiewicz, the consummate Washington survivor, campaign manager to Robert F. Kennedy and George McGovern, now a high-priced rainmaker for America's largest public relations firm, a man whose reputation for ease with the media was legendary, was uncomfortable being interviewed. 
 He was, he explained, gun shy after last month's testimony at a Senate subcommittee by the former Customs Service Commissioner, William Von Raab. Mr. Von Raab charged that his agency's investigation of the scandal surrounding the Bank of Credit and Commerce International had been hampered by "the influence peddlers in Washington."
They included, Mr. Von Raab said, Hill & Knowlton, the firm whose Washington office is headed by Mr. Mankiewicz and Robert F. Gray, who like Mr. Mankiewicz had a successful political career before entering public relations. Mr. Gray toiled in Republican circles for the Eisenhower Administration and the 1980 Reagan Presidential campaign.
Hill & Knowlton officials did provide guidance to B.C.C.I. several years ago when the bank was indicted for money laundering, but the firm denies offering any recent counsel.
"I know people joke with me and say I've sold out, but when we get down to it, I've found my clients defensible," Mr. Mankiewicz said. A lawyer by training, Mr. Mankiewicz contended that clients had a right to good public relations, just as they had the right to a lawyer.
"I don't have a problem with it," said Mr. Mankiewicz, who is 67 and has the beefy, pleasant look and self-deprecatory mien of a seasoned politician. "I think people are entitled to their day in court. I've not represented a single client that I've been ashamed of."
Mr. Mankiewicz, who called Mr. Von Raab's allegations "incredibly irresponsible and totally false," declined to talk about B.C.C.I., but later faxed a reporter a copy of a one-paragraph letter sent to him by Mr. Von Raab. The letter stated, "I do not have any information that Mr. Gray or you spoke to or contacted any official in either our Federal Government's executive or legislative branch on behalf of B.C.C.I."
That is not the enthusiastic exoneration people once expected for a man who began his Washington career in the days when the Kennedy name evoked images of the Peace Corps, not Palm Beach, and who, when he ran unsuccessfully in 1976 for the Democratic nomination for a House seat from Maryland, proudly listed on his resume that he had been on the Nixon White House enemies list.
 
A Link to 'Citizen Kane'
 As a boy in Los Angeles,Mr. Mankiewicz played on Rosebud, the sled from "Citizen Kane"; his father, Herman Mankiewicz, won an Oscar for writing the movie's screenplay. His uncle, Joseph Mankiewicz, was the screenwriter and director of "All About Eve."
But Frank Mankiewicz chose drama on the national stage, coming to Washington, he said, because of the excitement that was in the air during the Kennedy Administration.
Mr. Mankiewicz became the head of the Peace Corps in Peru, then the director for all of Latin America. He was press secretary for Robert Kennedy, then his Presidential campaign manager. After Robert Kennedy was assassinated, Mr. Mankiewicz found work on the Washington circuit as a syndicated columnist, television commentator, author, political adviser, president of National Public Radio, and now as vice president of Hill & Knowlton's Washington office.
Mr. Mankiewicz said he did not think he had abandoned any of his principles in the process. "I think I still believe in the same things," he said. Others disagree.
 
'Knows a Lot of People'
 "He's very witty and charming, and he knows a lot of people in Washington," said Jerry Blizen, a former senior vice president of Hill & Knowlton who left the firm in 1988 and is now retired. "And because his father was a Hollywood screenwriter, he knows damn near everybody in the communications business. But I think he's a guy who has practiced being devious for quite a while now."
But Gary Hart, the former Senator who worked with Mr. Mankiewicz on the 1972 McGovern Presidential campaign, said such criticisms showed that liberal Democrats were unfairly held to higher standards than others.
"He does what he's good at," Mr. Hart said. "I think he does it honorably and well. There is this tendency among critics of liberals that if they ever take a few years out of their life to put together a nest egg that somehow they're not as pure."
Another friend, Milton Viorst, the Middle East correspondent for The New Yorker magazine, said Mr. Mankiewicz had never portrayed his current job as anything but what it is.
"He had different financial needs and went into something that would satifsy them," Mr. Viorst said. "I could quibble with him over some things, and we have from time to time, but he is the last guy in the world to be pious and self-righteous."
Others say there has been less a change in Mr. Mankiewicz than a change in the nature of public relations work. Gone are the days when public relations firms were easily identifiable as Democratic or Republican, conservative or liberal; when the cause as well as the cash was the motivating factor behind taking on a client. Nowadays, firms offer full-spectrum personnel; one-stop shopping for spin control; everyone welcome.
Since he joined Hill & Knowlton in 1983, Mr. Mankiewicz or the firm has represented Turkey, where the human rights situation is regularly deplored by Amnesty International; the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, in an anti-abortion campaign that caused an uproar among women at the firm, and Clark M. Clifford, the former Secretary of Defense who recently resigned as chairman of First American Bankshares, a Washington bank linked to B.C.C.I.
But Mr. Mankiewicz said any member of the firm could recuse himself from any project, noting that he is Jewish and does not work on contracts for Arabs. It was Hill & Knowlton that did the aggressive public relations campaign for Kuwait during the Persian Gulf war.
"I didn't participate in the Catholic bishops' anti-abortion campaign either, and threatened to resign when we were thinking about taking on the contras," Mr. Mankiewicz said. "And we turned down the Government of Libya, and Chile and Colombia and some other things."
Asked about projects he is proudest of, Mr. Mankiewicz paused a long time and told a reporter to get back to him.
When asked again several days later, he said, "I like the effort we put out for Ray Donovan when he was on trial in New York." Raymond J. Donovan, who served as Labor Secretary in the Reagan Administration, was acquitted in 1987 of fraud and larceny charges involving accusations of ties to organized crime. "I thought that was a real miscarriage of justice and obviously a jury agreed with us."
He added, "I like some of the things we did with Turkey."
He was most disappointed, he said, with his failure to control the fallout from disclosures this year that Stanford University overbilled the Federal Government on research projects. Among other things, taxpayer money was apparently spent on improvements to the university president's house and flowers and laundry for his home. Donald Kennedy, the university's president, recently announced that he would resign, largely because of the scandal.
"I can't avoid the feeling that somehow we let him down," Mr. Mankiewicz said. "That's the one I'm unhappiest about."
 
His Radio Days
 What he was probably more unhappy about, his friends say, was having to leave his job as president of National Public Radio.
Mr. Mankiewicz, whom many credit with popularizing the public radio network and raising the number of listeners, with programs like "Morning Edition," blamed the recession and a fall-off in corporate contributions for the $3.2 million deficit that threatened to put the network off the air in the early 1980's. Congress and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting blamed him.
"Frank was looking around for new sources of revenue, but the drop in revenue was so precipitous you had to be able to turn on a dime," said Barbara Cohen, Washington bureau chief of CBS, who was vice president for news and information programming at NPR during Mr. Mankiewicz's tenure. "And the people in charge of the finances did not do a good job telling Frank where the money was. He was the one out front. It was a kind of buck-stops-here performance."
Mr. Mankiewicz resigned, and a shadow hung over him as a result. It was a big fall in a little group that is fickle about its favorites. "The liberal community did not reach out and embrace him," said Cokie Roberts, Congressional correspondent for NPR and another Mankiewicz admirer. "There was a man in need ofa friend and a job, and he found one with Robert Gray."
But what Mr. Mankiewicz keeps coming back to is the past.
"I wanted to be with the group that wrought changes in the world," he said, though he acknowledged that the changes he wrought did not now seem so global. Perhaps, he said, he had altered some college students' lives through one of his speeches. He was for women's rights, he said.
"The longest pleasure and happiness I got was from my time with Robert Kennedy," he said. "I used to say -- still do say -- that I could win a Nobel Prize and be named Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and serve two good terms as the President, and they'd write in my obit, Frank Mankiewicz was an aide to Robert Kennedy, and they'd be right. And I'd accept that proudly."

 CORRECTION:
A profile in Business Day yesterday about Frank Mankiewicz, the Washington public relations executive, misattributed a comment about working for Arabs. It was Jerry Blizen, a former Hill & Knowlton executive, and not Mr. Mankiewicz, who said he was Jewish and did not work on contracts for Arabs. The article also misidentified countries that Hill & Knowlton has refused to represent. They include Libya and Chile, but not Colombia.

HEADLINE: At Meeting on Global Warming, U.S. Stands Alone

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS

 BODY:
IN a contest between uncertain science and uncertain economics, negotiators from around the world convened in Nairobi yesterday for what promises to be a contentious effort to act against the prospect of a possibly catastrophic heating of the Earth's atmosphere in the next century.
The talks, aimed at hammering out a treaty to be signed next June in Rio de Janeiro, are the first major test of whether the world can unite against a threat that appears real in the long term but whose magnitude and pacing are unclear and whose remedies may exact substantial economic costs. 
 The crucial point is what to do about rising emissions of carbon dioxide, the principal man-made atmospheric gas among several that trap heat like the glass panes of a greenhouse.
On this point, the United States, the world's biggest emitter of carbon dioxide, is the odd man out.
The European Community and the Japanese strongly favor the adoption of concrete targets and timetables for stabilizing carbon dioxide emissions, specifically, holding them to 1990 levels in the year 2000. The United States just as strongly opposes such a target. The Bush Administration fears that meeting it would hurt the nation's economy in the short term for no demonstrable long-term climatic benefit. Rising levels of carbon dioxide come mainly from the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil, on which the country's economy depends. The Administration favors waiting, and remaining flexible, until further research makes the dimensions of the threat clearer.
The Administration also says that if all the other heat-trapping gases besides carbon dioxide are taken into account, actions already taken by the United States will hold its net contribution to the atmosphere's heat-trapping capacity to 1990 levels in 2000. Besides carbon dioxide, the main heat-trapping gases are chlorofluorocarbons, methane and nitrous oxides. All of the latter are believed to be more powerful heat-trappers, molecule for molecule, than carbon dioxide, although their atmospheric concentrations are lower.
United States emissions of carbon dioxide are still expected to rise over the next decade, but at a lower rate because of the new Clean Air Act and energy efficiencies mandated by Congress. The remaining growth, according to a study by the Environmental Protection Agency, will be offset by reductions in other greenhouse gases, mainly chlorofluorocarbons, which are already being phased out under an international agreement.
Administration officials also argue that the United States's energy profile is different from that of Europe, relying more on motor vehicles to knit together vast distances and sprawling suburbs and on coal to produce electricity. Stabilizing carbon dioxide emissions, the Administration says, would therefore impose a bigger burden on the United States than on Europe. United States officials, including William K. Reilly, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, argue that within some broad framework, each country should be allowed to adopt a mixture of solutions that suits it best.
The Bush Administration's arguments do not cut much ice with American environmentalists and some politicians, who see the Administration as a foot-dragger that has abdicated leadership on a question of transcendent importance for the future.
"We simply don't have a vision and a policy and a plan," said Scott Hajost of the Environmental Defense Fund, who is attending the Nairobi talks and who was formerly involved in the issue as a lawyer for both the Environmental Protection Agency and the State Department.
"The President has abdicated his responsibility because he is unwilling to propose anything that might be unpopular," said Senator Al Gore, Democrat of Tennessee, who has taken on global warming as a cause. "We are increasingly isolated" on the issue, said the Senator, who also accused the Administration of "scandalous obstinacy" and President Bush of "stonewalling the world."
Environmentalists and many scientists have long contended that there is no time to waste in bringing greenhouse gas emissions under control. Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide have risen to more than 350 parts per million, up from 280 before the Industrial Revolution and from 315 three decades ago. The present concentration is substantially higher than at any time in the last 160,000 years. Some climatologists argue for early action on the ground that as far as modern humans are concerned, this is unexplored climatic territory.
 
'You Have to Start Somewhere'
 They also say climatic change might not occur gradually but suddenly, as rising temperatures trip certain triggers that shift the climate system to a new state. Moreover, some scientists contend, the longer action is delayed, the greater the climatic impact will be and the more painful and expensive it will be to deal with.
The Europeans see their proposed targets as "a first, modest step" toward an eventual reversal of the buildup of carbon dioxide, said Bert Metz, an official at the Dutch embassy in Washington who is involved in the Nairobi talks. The Netherlands, as current president of the European Community, is speaking for the community in the talks. "You have to start somewhere," Mr. Metz said. "If you don't do anything, carbon dioxide will be 15 to 20 percent above 1990 levels" by 2000.
"Apparently, for political reasons, the time is not right" for the United States to adopt stronger measures, Mr. Metz said, adding that "we still hope that the U.S. will come around."
Mr. Reilly, the E.P.A. chief, is one of several current and former officials who believe that economic forces and state and local pollution laws in the United States could bring about enough energy efficiencies in the years just ahead to stabilize the country's carbon dioxide emissions even if no further Federal actions are taken.
"In my opinion, the climate policies of Europe and the United States will eventually converge," Mr. Reilly said, with "Europe relying on centralized, top-down directives and energy taxes, and the U.S. benefitting from decentralized, bottom-up decisions of electric utilities, their ratepayers and consumers to install more energy-efficient lighting and other technologies."
 
Plan-and-Review Concept
 How the negotiations in Nairobi will turn out is anybody's guess. But it is widely believed that the United States could end up signing a treaty that sets broad, general goals for stabilizing greenhouse gases, possibly in the form of some sort of pledge subject to periodic review. The Europeans and Japan might then join in a separate protocol, excluding the United States, that sets specific targets for controlling carbon dioxide.
The Nairobi round of talks is the third of at least five such rounds, but the first in which it appears that the negotiators may get down to brass tacks. The first, at Chantilly, Va., last February, was given over largely to organizational matters and heated argument. The second, in Geneva in June, brought a blizzard of concrete proposals that have since been winnowed and consolidated as a basis for whatever takes place in the next few days.
In two major developments at Geneva, the Japanese introduced the concept of pledge and review as a possible basis for an agreement, and the other industrialized countries appeared to view with more sympathy the United States's argument that all greenhouse gases, not just carbon dioxide, should be considered in devising remedies. Japan has since said that despite its advancement of pledge and review, it still favors specific commitments.
While the industrialized countries are the primary emitters of greenhouse gases now, developing countries are expected to account for a rising share in the future. The developing countries and China are proposing in the negotiations that the industrialized countries contribute to a fund that would be used to ease the poorer nations through a transition to more energy-efficient technologies. These would generate less greenhouse gas. The status of the Soviet Union in the situation, given its political and economic upheavals, is unclear.
The Europeans say their studies show that carbon dioxide emissions could be stabilized at an acceptable cost to their economies. Studies in the United States vary widely in their assessment of the economic impact. An inter-agency Government analysis published last year by the Department of Energy found that significant action to reduce carbon dioxide would reduce the gross national product by at least 1 percent. It found also that such action would have a negative impact on the economy comparable to that of the oil price shocks of the 1970's. Some subsequent studies have placed the reduction in G.N.P. lower, at less than half a percent.
Mr. Reilly says he doubts that many economic studies have taken into consideration the energy efficiencies that he and others believe are coming as a result of market forces and state and local actions. Such efficiencies, if developed, would ease the economic impact.
Earlier this year, a special panel of the National Academy of Sciences found that the average global temperature was likely to rise by 2 to 9 degrees Fahrenheit in the next century if emissions of greenhouse gases continue unabated. This, the panel said, "poses a potential threat sufficient to merit prompt responses." The costs of not taking action, it said, could be substantial and could lower the standard of living in the United States. For developing countries, it said, the impact would probably be worse.
The measured responses recommended by the panel, including a number of actions aimed at improving energy efficiency, were calculated to reduce United States greenhouse emissions by from 10 to 40 percent if all were in effect now, at "very low" net cost to the economy. Stronger actions, it said, are not now justified because the magnitude of the threat is still too uncertain.
 
Assumptions on Carbon Dioxide
 The panel declined to recommend targets and timetables for reducing carbon dioxide on the ground that they would become obsolete as scientists learn more about the threat. Once written into law, some Administration officials say, such targets would be difficult to change.
Environmentalists chided the Administration for opposing some actions recommended by the academy, including especially higher miles-per-gallon standards for automobiles. But Administration officials argued -- and the staff director of the academy study said they could be right -- that actions already taken will, over time, produce the effects the academy's recommends.
That calculation, however, assumes that the relative power of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases as heat-trappers remains what scientists have been saying it is. But although no details are yet available, new findings by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change may show that carbon dioxide is relatively more powerful than has been thought. This would tend to undercut the United States position. The I.P.C.C., established by the United Nations, provides scientific advice for the treaty negotiations.
In any case, the academy report and the calculations about the effect of recent United States actions all were seized upon by Administration officials, especially John H. Sununu, the President's Chief of Staff, as support for their case. Mr. Sununu is by all accounts the most influential Administration official on climate change.
The Administration's negotiating position in Nairobi is, in essence, that a deadline of the year 2000 for stabilizing carbon dioxide emissions is artificial, with no solid basis in either science or economics.
"You know you've got a long-term problem,," said Robert A. Reinstein, a deputy assistant Secretary of State who is the chief United States negotiator. "You don't know what benefits you can expect from these short-term actions."
"Do you do these things in a way that corresponds to an investment cycle, so that you retire equipment when you would retire it anyway and replace it with new equipment with climate benefits?" he asked. "Or do you prematurely retire it to meet an artificial target by 2000, which is not a scientifically determined target?" The United States view, he said, is that "it's really premature" to be talking about short-term targets and timetables like those proposed by the Europeans.
Mr. Reinstein has been accused by Senator Gore of misleading Congress late in July, when he said in written testimony that the European countries had "diminished their insistence" on targets and timetables at the June meeting in Geneva.
Mr. Reinstein said that he was "not trying to say they had changed position," but was instead "describing the atmospherics."
But Senator Gore said the language was "misleading, and in a way intended to buttress the Administration's decision to dig in its heels and stop progress."

GRAPHIC: As talks on a global warming treaty get down to business, the Bush Administration argues that actions already taken will hold the United States's total contribution of heat-trapping atmospheric gases to 1987 levels in the year 2000. But U.S. emissions of carbon dioxide, the chief heat-trapper, are expected to increase.
Chart: "Taking a Stand On a Global Question"
America the Beautiful -- Rate of carbon dioxide increase would slow under a U.S. plan to plant a billion trees a year, according to an unofficial Federal study. Trees absorb carbon dioxide.
The Clean Air Act -- 1990 amendments are expected to slow the increase by by 16 million metric tons in 2000.
Saving Energy -- Further slowing, by 36 million tons, should result from new energy-efficiency measures. While carbon dioxide emissions continue to rise, though less rapidly, U.S. outpourings of other heat-trapping gases are expected to drop. The most important of these are chlorofluorocarbons, which are being phased out under an international treaty. Citing study findings, the Administration resists further measures until the magnitude of the global warming threat becomes clearer.

Potency
Carbon dioxide is the most abundant man-made "greenhouse" gas. But others trap more heat per molecule. Over 100 years, for example, one ton of methane can cause 21 times ase much warming as one ton of carbon dioxide.

HEADLINE: Bank Profits: Weakest 2d Quarter Since '87

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 10

 BODY:
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation today reported the weakest second-quarter earnings for the nation's banking industry since 1987, but it said that the overwhelming majority of banks remained profitable.
In his final report on the quarterly condition of banks, the F.D.I.C.'s chairman, L. William Seidman, characterized the industry as "bumping along the bottom." 
 "Since this is my final appearance in this role, I would have loved to have come and told you that all of the problems in the banking industry were behind us," Mr. Seidman, who will retire in mid-October, said at a news briefing. Instead, he said, the industry "doesn't look like it's getting worse, but it doesn't look like it's getting a whole lot better."
In the 1991 second quarter, earnings of the nation's 12,150 commercial banks dropped 12 percent below a year ago to $4.6 billion. It was the lowest second-quarter result since 1987, when the banking industry reported a loss. The April-June quarter was also 7.8 percent below the industry's earnings in the 1991 first quarter.
 
88% Are Profitable
 At the same time, more than 88 percent of all commercial banks were profitable in the second quarter, and more than half of them -- 54.3 percent -- reported higher earnings than a year ago. Mr. Seidman predicted that year-end earnings should reach $18 billion to $19 billion, a modest rise from 1990.
Despite these bright notes, Mr. Seidman ticked off a series of troubling statistics. He said the number of banks on the F.D.I.C.'s "problem" list had grown to 1,072, with assets of $445 billion, from 1,046, with assets of $409 billion, at the end of last year. The credit crunch continues, he said, as industry loans outstanding have shrunk by $14 billion, and few new loans are being made. And he said that bank reserves against future losses had shrunk to 65 percent of problem loans from 87 percent in 1989, leaving the industry increasingly vulnerable.
In addition, Mr. Seidman repeated his estimate that the fund that insures commercial bank depositors, which grew to about $4.5 billion in the first six months of the year, would dwindle to "one, two or three billion" by the end of the year, because more banks are expected to fail and the F.D.I.C. will have to step in to protect depositors.
This is slightly more optimistic than a recent General Accounting Office estimate that said the fund would "likely be insolvent" by the end of the year. But, in questioning, Mr. Seidman saw any differences between the two estimates as debatable -- and somewhat meaningless.
"Clearly the fund will be in need of recapitalization," Mr. Seidman said. "Whether it's actually down to insolvency or not, it will be below levels at which we can operate effectively."
He took pains, however, to say that the agency had no plans to increase insurance premiums levied on banks and that he opposed such efforts. "I think the banking industry is at or near the maximum premiums that they can pay long run and be competitive," he said.
In statistics issued with Mr. Seidman's presentation, the F.D.I.C. noted that for the first time the bank insurance fund had borrowed from the Federal Financing Bank, which borrows from the Treasury and lends to Government agencies. The $2.9 billion loan, used to resolve failed banks, which had been expected, was the first use of taxpayers' dollars in the banking crisis.
Mr. Seidman said the most severe bank problems still appeared to be in New England, with Washington, D.C., still plagued with large problem loans. And he said that the situation in Southern California, where there are fears of overbuilding, is "not clear." Larger banks continued to be more profitable than smaller banks, although Mr. Seidman said that he was closely watching at least "four or five" major banks to see whether they might cause large losses to the insurance fund.
The economic downturn has created severe problems for the nation's savings banks, hybrid institutions that are part savings and loan and part commercial bank and are primarily in the Northeast. Nearly one-third of the 456 savings banks lost money -- some $506 million -- in the quarter, 85 percent more than a year ago.
Bert Ely, a banking industry analyst who attended Mr. Seidman's briefing, said that numbers showed "a contracting banking industry that is struggling to survive and eventually to prosper." Mr. Ely said he was heartened by statistics from the F.D.I.C. showing that banks had become better capitalized, that "past due" problem loans were tapering off and that pretax earnings at many banks were rising.
"A lot of people who look at the banking problems are quick to see another savings-and-loan situation," Mr. Ely said. "But banks have a lot more resiliency, and there are some good signs."
In a separate matter, the F.D.I.C. proposed that mortgages under $100,000 no longer require a certified or licensed appraisal. Currently all home mortgages under $50,000 are exempt from the requirement for a certified appraisal. But, with little evidence of loss from mortgages under $100,000, the F.D.I.C. proposed lifting the limit. The proposed change was presented at an F.D.I.C. board meeting and will be open for comment for 60 days before final approval.

HEADLINE: Polish Premier, in U.S., Says Austerity Works

BYLINE: By DAVID BINDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 10

 BODY:
Facing parliamentary elections in 47 days, Prime Minister Jan Krzysztof Bielecki of Poland made a campaign stop here today.
His schedule, including speeches and calls on businessmen, members of Congress and international bankers, culminates Wednesday in a meeting with President Bush. An Administration official said that the Polish elections on Oct. 27 will in effect be a referendum on Mr. Bielecki. 
 The 4O-year-old former entrepreneur was appointed nine months ago by President Lech Walesa to head a Government of experts. He embarked immediately on a crash program to introduce free-market policies.
Mr. Bielecki's austerity program stirred resistance among workers and rising opposition in Parliament, which took office in 1989 under a formula that accorded the Communist Party 65 percent of the seats.
Last month, Mr. Bielecki sought and was denied powers to make more budget cuts without parliamentary approval. He then offered to resign, but in a vote of confidence the Parliament refused to accept the resignation.
In a speech today, Mr. Bielecki boasted of "miraculous success" in the initial phase of economic stabilization in Poland. But he acknowledged that in his Government's efforts to transform economic structures inherited from the Communists, he had paid insufficient attention to the weakness of Poland's banking system and of its managerial capacities.
"We underestimated two mammoth problems," he said in an address to the Atlantic Council. "We thought we had a banking system and we had nothing of the kind, and we thought enterprise managers would respond to market signals when in fact a lifetime spent in communism meant they were incapable of recognizing market signals, let alone responding to them"
Mr. Bielecki said his Government was using Western banking expertise to help privatize Polish state-owned banks and that "massive programs" were required to train an adequate number of Poles in Western management techniques.
"When I take these two lessons from Poland and apply them to the Soviet Union then I am not optimistic," he said, noting that the Communist economic system had been in place for 70 years there, compared with 45 years in Poland.
He said he did not consider Poland's two years of post-Communist experience to be a model for the republics of the Soviet Union except for the lesson of the Polish Solidarity movement "that peaceful transition is possible."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Mixed as Traders Await Reports on Inflation

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar was mixed against leading foreign currencies yesterday in a slow session as most traders and analysts awaited the inflation reports due later in the week.
Many traders said the Federal Reserve would refrain from an expected cut in interest rates at least until tomorrow's release of the producer-price report for August. 
 That report, combined with the August Consumer Price Index, which is due Friday, will provide the latest indication of inflationary trends, said Jim Burtle, manager of foreign exchange service for the Pennsylvania-based WEFA Group.
If the reports show inflation remains low, they will increase the chances that the Fed will cut interest rates to stimulate the economy through more borrowing, he said. Lower interest rates would tend to hurt the dollar's value by making dollar-denominated investments worth less.
Curtis Perkins, a trader at Chemical New York Capital Markets Group, said the sleepy market was jolted after reports that three Iraqi soldiers killed a Kuwaiti security guard in a border clash.
Mr. Perkins said the dollar had risen briefly on the news as some traders sought a safe haven for their investments, but the dollar failed to sustain the gains.
The dollar held steady against the German mark, closing at 1.6935 marks in New York trading, the same as late Monday. In European trading, the dollar held at 1.6945 German marks, unchanged from Monday's level.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.60 yen, to 134.75 yen. Later in London the dollar was quoted at 134.80 yen. In New York, the dollar closed at 134.75 yen, up from 134.625 yen in late Monday trading.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.7298, from $1.6945 late Monday. In New York, sterling cost $1.7295, less expensive than Monday's closing of $1.7325.
Other late New York dollar quotes, compared with Monday's prices, included: 1.4805 Swiss francs, down from 1.4855; 5.7510 French francs, down from 5.7605; 1,267.50 Italian lire, up from 1,266.50, and 1.13995 Canadian dollars, up from 1.13985.

HEADLINE: SOVIET TURMOIL;
Baker Eases Terms for Aid to Soviets

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Sept. 10

 BODY:
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d softened Washington's conditions for economic aid to the Soviet Union today by dropping its insistence on seeing a free-market program in operation before assistance is extended.
The Bush Administration had demanded that the Soviet Union not only produce a plan for a market economy but also begin to carry it out before the United States and six other major industrialized democracies would consider any substantial increase in economic assistance. 
 Now Washington appears to be saying that the central Government in Moscow and the republics must simply commit themselves to a specific reform plan.
 
First Visit Since the Coup
 Mr. Baker made his remarks on his flight to Moscow for the first visit to the Soviet Union by a senior Administration official since the failed coup last month. The Bush Administration has been under increasing pressure to offer more aid to the Soviet Union now that the Communist Party and hard-liners in the Soviet leadership have been swept aside and the balance of power has shifted into the hands of reform-minded republic leaders.
Asked if he was offering anything tangible in the way of economic assistance, Mr. Baker told reporters, "We will make it clear that if they are prepared to commit to taking the actions that are required, we will join with others in assisting the transformation."
Mr. Baker quickly added: "But if you are asking me am I coming over here and saying, 'If you do X we will have X millions of dollars,' that is not how it is going to work. What needs to be done is to make sure that they understand what we think is required and if they can take those steps, we will be there -- not take the steps first, but commit to taking the steps."
It is apparent from Mr. Baker's remarks that the Administration now feels that it has a greater incentive to be more forthcoming on aid now that the pro-Western reformers have triumphed and that politically it cannot afford to be quite so rigid as before in setting conditions for economic aid.
Both the Democrats and key American allies, particularly Germany and France, have been pushing for more aggressive Western economic help. Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of Germany, who is also visiting Moscow, said today of helping the Soviet Union and emerging new democracies in Eastern Europe, "We will be judged by whether we just give them applause or really effectively help them."
Mr. Baker is expected to press Soviet and republic officials to take up the West's offer for associate membership in the International Monetary Fund, something Moscow still has not acted upon, so that they will be able to take advantage of the fund's expertise.
Mr. Baker said the main purpose of this trip beyond discussing economic reform was to try to determine the nature of the new political arrangement being worked out between the Kremlin and the Soviet republics. His itinerary clearly reflects the changing relationship.
Mr. Baker will travel for the first time to St. Petersburg, the former Leningrad, and to all three Baltic republics, as well as to the Soviet Central Asian republic of Kazakhstan. In addition to meetings with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, he will hold talks with President Boris Yeltsin of the Russian republic; the new K.G.B. chief, Vadim Bakatin; Mayor Anatoly A. Sobchak of St. Petersburg, Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev of the Russian republic and Eduard A. Shevardnadze, the former Soviet Foreign Minister.
 
Political and Economic Changes
 "We will be making the point that there are certain political and economic arrangements that will make it easier for us and for others to assist in the transformation that is taking place," Mr. Baker said.
In the past, meetings with Mr. Gorbachev were always the centerpiece of Mr. Baker's visits; now they will be simply one among many. Indeed, when Mr. Baker was asked what future the United States saw for continued cooperation between Washington and the Kremlin in general, he said:
"Much will depend on the extent to which the center is changed. I said that they had effected a transition. These meetings will give us a better sense of the direction of some of these changes. They would still like to work cooperatively with us on a number of foreign policy issues, but obviously we will also be working with republic foreign ministers and republic leaders."

HEADLINE: Yields on C.D.'s and Funds Continue to Drop at Banks

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH M. FOWLER

 BODY:
Yields on certificates of deposit and money market accounts continued to decline for the week ended yesterday, aacording to The Bank Rate Monitor, the North Palm Beach, Fla., publication that focuses on interest rates.
Robert K. Heady, publisher, said he expected rates to fall further. 
 "The decline is consistent with downward movement on all savings rates including Treasuries," he said. "Banks, like everyone else, are waiting for the Federal Reserve to ease credit further. When that happens, we will see savings rates fall at an even faster clip for several weeks."
At the Treasury Department's weekly bill auction on Monday the three-month bill was sold at an averaage discount rate of 5.29, compared with 5.34 percent at the previous auction, while the six-month bill averaged 5.30 compared with 5.39 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Mr. Heady noted that the National Westminster Bank was one bank that had bucked the trend. and raised its three-month certificate of deposit yields by 53 basis points, to 5.34 percent.
The two biggest changes were made by the Bank of Tokyo, which reduced the rate on its six-month certificate of deposit to 4.65 percent, and Connecticut Bank and Trust, which reduced its rate by 16 basis points, to 4.59 percent, on its money market account.
Among the commercial banks in New York, the average yield of money market account and six-month certificate was down 2 basis points, to 5.30 percent for certificates of deposit, and 1 basis point on money market accounts, taking them down to down 4.87 percent. Three-month certificates held firm at 5.16 percent.
For depositors at savings institutions, yields were cut on most short-maturity C.D.'s and money market accounts. Money market accounts slipped on average by 1 basis point, to 5.41 percent, while a three-month certificate fell 2 basis points, to 5.55 percent. The six-month certificate came down 4 basis points, to 5.79.
By comparison, 20 large banks outside the New York market cut 2 basis points from the yield on their six-month certificates of deposit to 5.36 percent, while their money market accounts were unchanged at 5.12.

HEADLINE: Main South Korean Opposition Parties Merge

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Sept. 10

 BODY:
The two main opposition political parties announced a merger today, aiming to form a unified force to try to defeat President Roh Tae Woo's governing party in national elections.
The new party is a product of the New Democratic Party, led by the top opposition figure Kim Dae Jung, and the small Democratic Party, led by Lee Ki Taek. 
 It includes support from dissidents and workers and is less conservative than the governing Democratic Liberal Party, which itself was the product of a surprise party unification more than a year ago. While Mr. Roh's party has prevailed in recent local elections, its popularity in public opinion polls is low.
Mr. Kim, known as South Korea's most famous dissident throughout the 1980's, is preparing for a renewed attempt at the presidency. With the merger, which created South Korea's first unified opposition party in more than 20 years, "we now can expect to defeat the ruling party in upcoming elections, bringing a peaceful transfer of power," Mr. Kim said at a news conference.
 
Elections Expected Next Year
 The new party, called the Democratic Party, will be functioning well in advance of the parliamentary and presidential elections expected next year. Leadership is split equally between the two components.
Under the merger, the new party will control 80 seats in the 298-member Parliament. Officials said it would continue to expand by absorbing other opposition groups.
Mr. Roh, whose single five-year term ends in early 1993, cannot seek re-election. His party, formed from a merger of three conservative parties in 1990, swept most seats in local elections held earlier this year. The divided opposition was blamed for the outcome. But the governing party's popularity has been declining after a series of scandals and rising inflation and land speculation. Recent polls indicate an all-time low in support, less than 15 percent.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Seoul Dissident's Role at U.N.
 A South Korean diplomat said yesterday that Kim Dae Jung would join President Roh in New York next week, when South and North Korea formally join the United Nations.
Since the end of the Korean War, the North and South have held observer status at the United Nations. But earlier this year, Mr. Roh announced that South Korea would apply for separate membership after it became clear that the North's traditional allies, the Soviet Union and China, would not move to block the application.
North Korea later announced that it, too, would enter the United Nations, although it still maintains that the two Koreas should hold a single Korean seat.

HEADLINE: Ashidowa-teri Journal;
Venezuela Befriends Tribe, but What's Venezuela?

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ASHIDOWA-TERI, Venezuela

 BODY:
Two degrees north of the Equator, an American anthropologist stood in a circular Yanomami lodge here recently and asked a hunter what he thought of Venezuela's new Upper Orinoco-Casiquiare Biosphere Reserve.
A mystified look crossed the young man's brow, already distorted by designs in ocher paint. He consulted a friend dressed only in feathers, then demanded, in Yanomami, "What's Venezuela?" 
 With the 500th anniversary of the arrival of Columbus approaching, Venezuela has begun an unusual effort to cushion one of the final collisions between the modern world and Stone Age America.
To the applause of anthropologists and the dismay of miners and missionaries, President Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela signed a decree this summer that reserves a stretch of Amazon forest the size of Maine as a permanent homeland for the country's 14,000 Yanomami Indians.
 
A Ban on Economic Activity
 The tribe, which straddles the remote border region of Venezuela and Brazil, is considered to be the hemisphere's last major tribe untouched by modern civilization.
"There will be no economic activity -- no mining, no farming, and no colonization," Mr. Perez said in an interview in Caracas. Encompassing the headwaters of the Orinoco River, the new 32,038-square-mile reserve is bounded on the east by the Brazilian border and on the west by the Casiquiare River.
"The primary use will be to preserve and to learn the traditional ways of the Indians. There will be no religious proselytizing. Existing missions will be subject to controls."
Mr. Perez's action stands in sharp contrast to Brazil, where defenders of the Indians have unsuccessfully struggled for 20 years to set up a slightly larger reserve for Brazil's 9,000 Yanomami.
Venezuela's move has left anthropologists euphoric.
"It's fantastic," said Jason W. Clay, director of research of Cultural Survival, a private Indian rights group based in Cambridge, Mass. "If we can just get the Brazilians to follow suit, we will have a reserve which would allow the Yanomami to survive into the next millennium."
The other day a Venezuelan Air Force helicopter swept over the Yanomami's homeland -- a primeval expanse of dull green forest, broken by gray granite escarpments, winding chocolate-colored streams and blazing yellow palo de arco trees.
"This is one of the last great areas of the Amazon basin that is still pristine," said a passenger, Napoleon A. Chagnon, an anthropology professor from the University of California at Santa Barbara. The author of a best-selling college textbook, "Yanomamo: The Fierce People," he founded a new group in July to raise funds for the new reserve, American Friends of the Venezuelan Indian.
Thundering over the remote headwaters of the Siapa River, the helicopter pilots spotted several openings in the thick forest -- banana gardens and circular, palm thatch lodges of the Yanomami.
After the helicopter descended in a cloud of dust on one garden, a group of 20 excited Yanomami men and boys emerged from the forest. One explained that they had never received non-Yanomami visitors at Ashidowa-teri.
With their clothing largely limited to feather earplugs, body paint and monkey hair armbands, the men curiously touched the expedition members' foreign attire. Peppering visitors with questions, several were startled to discover that there are people in the world who do not speak Yanomami.
 
Household Implements on View
 Moving single file through gardens of plantains and cotton, the party hiked toward the shapono, or circular common house.
"We hope to get basic information on plants used by the Yanomami," Brian M. Boom, a botanist from the New York Botanical Garden, said about the expedition. "For example, there is a toxic Andean nightshade in the gardens here. What is it doing with a people who were supposedly isolated for thousands of years?"
Ducking through a low opening in the shapono wall, the party of scientists and doctors entered an open area of earth beaten hard by bare feet. The women and girls stayed in the shade, tending wood cooking fires or watching from perches in vine hammocks.
Strung from lodgepoles were household implements -- bark quivers for arrowheads, braces of seven-foot-long arrows, dried bones from hunting expeditions, tightly woven baskets, bunches of tobacco leaves and of anato nuts, which provide red pigment for face paint.
A five-day walk from the headwaters of the Orinoco River, Ashidowa-teri is beyond the reach of missionaries who operate three missions for the Yanomami.
The missionaries believe in easing the Indians' adjustment to the outside world through bilingual education, conversion to Roman Catholicism, establishment of craft cooperatives and provision of modern medicine.
Charles Brewer-Carias, a Venezuelan naturalist who organized the expedition, asserted that mission work leaves the Indians disoriented, with one foot in each culture.
As an example, he said the missions' recent distribution of shotguns for hunting game had an unintended effect on a tribal group marked by a long history of internal warfare. Over the last year, the Venezuelan said, "mission Yanomami" had shot to death 21 "wild Yanomami."

HEADLINE: Credit Move Set in Florida

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: TALLAHASSEE, Fla., Sept. 10

 BODY:
Florida banks and businesses are preparing to raise credit card interest rates on Oct. 1 when a new state law take effect, abolishing an 18 percent limit on interest rates.
The Burdine's, Bloomingdale's and Maas Brothers-Jordan Marsh retail chains intend to raise the rates on their cards to 21.6 percent. Saks Fifth Avenue and Lord & Taylor said they would follow suit. 
 Some stores are not making immediate changes. Mervyn's, Neiman Marcus and Sears, Roebuck & Company said they would keep rates at 18 percent.
The Florida legislature eliminated limits in the spring after Florida banks threatened to move their credit card operations out of the state.
Many states do not have such restrictions, and 80 percent of credit cards now held by Florida residents are issued by out- of-state banks that charge an average of 19.8 percent.

Saatchi Effort On Refugees

 BODY:
A unit of Saatchi & Saatchi P.L.C., London, has accepted an assignment to persuade Vietnamese "boat people" in Southeast Asian refugee camps to return to the country that they fled.
The European Commission, the executive body for the 12- nation European Community, plans to pay about $600,000 to Saatchi & Saatchi Strategy, the advertising and communications company's government consultancy division. 
 The unit will produce materials about new economic benefits and employment opportunities in Vietnam, said Endymion Wilkinson, the head of the commission's Southeast Asian division.
Leaflets and posters from the effort will begin to be distributed in the refugee camps within weeks, he added.
About 130,000 Vietnamese refugees are in camps in Hong Kong and six nations in Southeast Asia. While many wish to emigrate to Europe or the United States, the majority will not be allowed to do so, Mr. Wilkinson said.
The Saatchi campaign is part of a $12 million program, sponsored by the commission, most of which is being spent in three provinces in Vietnam.
Saatchi executives could not be reached for comment.

HEADLINE: Salomon Executive Has an Agenda for Cleaning Up the Desk

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
A month after Salomon Brothers was shaken by scandal, profits at the firm's core government-bond trading business have fallen by about 20 percent, the newly appointed head of the firm's trading desk, Eric R. Rosenfeld, said in an interview yesterday.
Since margins in the government-bond business are narrow, a firm's profitability is vitally dependent on trading volume, said Mr. Rosenfeld, a former Harvard professor who gave up academia in 1984 for a new world on Wall Street. And after scarcely three weeks on his new job, Mr. Rosenfeld said: "Volume is down, so profitability is down, but not astronomically. It's not gangbusters. But it's not hopeless." 
 Salomon's admission on Aug. 9 that it exceeded bidding limits established by the Treasury Department at four separate securities auctions since December 1990 has sent a number of clients to other primary dealers.
Whether the business will return depends in large part on what is uncovered in a wide-ranging investigations of Salomon's activities by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department.
Much of the business has been lost over the last two weeks, Mr. Rosenfeld suggested.
In the early hours following the onset of the Soviet putsch on Aug. 19, when financial markets around the world were racked with uncertainty, Salomon did "substantial" business, particularly in Tokyo. "Then it slacked off," Mr. Rosenfeld said.
Mr. Rosenfeld has had more pressing concerns than the drop in his department's revenues. These have included overseeing the installation of a computerized bidding system; the carrying out of internal-compliance guidelines outlined in Congressional testimony on Sept. 3 by Salomon's new chairman, Warren E. Buffett, and learning the ins and outs of what for him is a totally new business.
"I am doing a lot to make sure that all the systems are in place," he said. "There are some trading decisions that have to be made, but there is less of that. But I hope that once we have shored up those systems we can get back to business."
 
Career in Arbitrage
 Until he was appointed to the government-bond job, Mr. Rosenfeld, who is 38 years old, had spent his entire career at Salomon on the firm's arbitrage desk, where he devised and put into effect trading strategies involving derivative products like over-the-counter Treasury options and warrants on Treasury securities.
A graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he received an undergraduate degree in economics and a doctorate in finance, Mr. Rosenfeld was lured to Salomon's arbitrage desk in 1984 from the Harvard Business School, where he spent five years as an assistant professor.
"I was grading final exams in June, and I got a call from a guy who was working on the hedge-management desk," Mr. Rosenfeld recalled. "He wanted recommendations of students for a job in the arbitrage group. It sounded pretty good, and I said I can give you the best recommendation I can ever think of. He said, 'Who's that?' I said, 'It's myself.' "
 
Foray Into Software
 While still at M.I.T., Mr. Rosenfeld showed that he had talents beyond academia. One day in 1978, he stepped into a computer store in Cambridge, Mass., and met another computer buff, Mitchell D. Kapor.
"I was unemployed and between a master's and a doctorate in psychology. He was at the Sloan School," remembered Mr. Kapor, who later went on to co-found the Lotus Development Corporation and is now chairman of ON Technology, a Cambridge-based technology concern. "We hit it off."
Along the way, the two developed a statistical analysis program that could be used on Apple II computers, a model they both owned.
"We sort of packed the thing together and marketed it via mail order and through computer stores," Mr. Kapor said. "It made both of us a bunch of money. Mine was the seed money for Lotus."
When Mr. Rosenfeld was first interviewed by Salomon's research department, he said he was left cold. "I figured, ugh, this is what I've been doing, there is no way I want this job," he said.
But late in the afternoon the interview, Mr. Rosenfeld met John W. Meriwether, the Salomon vice chairman who was forced out last month as a result of his role in the bidding scandal. Mr. Meriwether didn't talk about a research job. He talked about trading.
It "really sounded like a whole new ball game," Mr. Rosenfeld said. "The research people were talking about what they had been doing and were trying to assess what my skills were. But it was the trading job was the one that intrigued me the most."
 
Rapid Rise
 Mr. Rosenfeld's rise has been rapid. Named a vice president in 1986 and a director two years later, he became a managing director in 1989.
The Treasury bills, notes and bonds that are the staples of the government desk are considerably less esoteric instruments than those Mr. Rosenfeld has been dealing with for the last seven years. But the pace on his new desk is much quicker than in arbitrage.
"This is a totally different business," he said. "On the arb desk you have more time to map out stategy."
Two members of the firm's government-bond desk, Paul W. Mozer and Thomas F. Murphy, were swept away by the scandal. Mr. Rosefeld said he was well satisfied with the core of some 15 traders and 25 salesmen that remained.
"I inherited a pretty good group," he said. "My job is to see if I can maintain it."
He has stayed in contact with Mr. Meriwether, the man who hired him, since he was forced to resign on Aug. 18.
"J.M. really loved this firm," Mr. Rosenfeld said. "This firm was everything to him. I call him up to try and cheer him up, and all he does is try and cheer us up."

HEADLINE: U.N. LEADER VOICES HOPE ON HOSTAGES

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TEHERAN, Iran, Sept. 10

 BODY:
Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar of the United Nations arrived here tonight saying that "some progress" had been made in the negotiations to free the remaining 10 Western hostages in Lebanon. Officials traveling with the Secretary General said privately that the situation was at a critical juncture.
Mr. Perez de Cuellar's emissary on the hostage negotiations, Giandomenico Picco, did not arrive here as expected with the Secretary General and was said by officials to have been dispatched on another secret mission related to the hostage negotiations. Mr. Picco has been working to negotiate the release of Arab prisoners held by Israel to be followed by the release of more Western hostages, United Nations officials said. 
 Mr. Picco was dispatched to Beirut last month when hopes were raised for a final resolution of the hostage problem with the release of two Western captives. He was present when kidnappers turned over the British journalist, John McCarthy, who was held for five years, to Syrian authorities.
 
Fate of Missing Israelis
 Since then, Mr. Picco has shuttled between New York, Jerusalem and Teheran seeking Iranian assistance and working with Israeli officials to gather enough information about seven Israeli servicemen missing in Lebanon to clear the way for Israel to release some of the nearly 400 Arab prisoners it has been holding.
Late last week in New York, an official familiar with Mr. Picco's negotiations said Israel was giving serious consideration to a prisoner release; the official said the "million dollar question" was whether Israel would go ahead even though it was not entirely satisfied with all of the information it had received about its missing soldiers.
One critical piece of missing information was the whereabouts of an Israeli aviator, Capt. Ron Arad, shot down in October 1986 and held prisoner for a time by the Shiite Muslim Amal organization in Lebanon. It is thought that Captain Arad might be the only one of the seven Israelis still alive.
Iran and its pro-Iranian forces in Lebanon have suggested that all of the remaining Western hostages could be freed if Israel responds to last month's release of Mr. McCarthy and Edward A. Tracy, who were held by the Islamic Holy War group. The Iranian Government of President Hashemi Rafsanjani is seeking to restore economic and political ties with the West as it seeks to rebuild the Iranian economy.
 
Talks With Iran's Leader
 "Things are still in motion," a United Nations official said, adding that it was possible that the first release could occur while Mr. Perez de Cuellar is in Teheran for talks with Mr. Rafsanjani.
The official, under instructions not to go beyond the Secretary General's public remarks, said the situation was at a very delicate stage. He indicated that Israeli Government officials were involved in intense diplomacy related to the release of prisoners, a step that Mr. Perez de Cuellar and a number of Western governments have been pressing Israel to consider.
Mr. Perez de Cuellar was greeted at the airport by the Iranian Foreign Minister, Ali Akbar Velayati, who told reporters that the key to progress on the hostage problem was not in Iran, an allusion to Teheran's position that Israel should release some of its prisoners to keep the talks going.
It was still possible for the negotiations to falter, United Nations officials said. They refused to go into detail about how the negotiators were dealing with Israel's demand for an accounting of its seven missing servicemen.
 
Meeting With Families
 In a gesture to the Iranians, Mr. Perez de Cuellar has agreed to meet while he is in Teheran with the families of four missing Iranians who disappeared in Lebanon in 1984. Three of the four were diplomats, and Iran has frequently demanded that the United States and Western nations cooperate in trying to determine the fate of the four men in return for Iran's efforts to win the release of Western hostages.
In the month since the current round of hostage negotiations began, Iranian officials have been frustrated by the apparent lack of public pressure on Israel by the Bush Administration to reciprocate for the release of Mr. McCarthy and Mr. Tracy.
"I can tell you they thought Washington would put some pressure on Israel to respond and they are very disenchanted," said a senior Western diplomat here who has worked closely on hostage related issues.
It is now clear that Mr. Perez de Cuellar, who has been carrying the Bush Administration's proxy in the hostage negotiations, based his own strategy from the outset on the belief that Israel would release some of its of Arab prisoners to keep the negotiations going.
For the first time in weeks, it seemed possible tonight that Israel might be choosing such a course.
One United Nations negotiator acknowledged that his pitch to pro-Iranian Lebanese militants over the past year was tailored along these lines: "We told them, 'Make us credible. Give us two hostages,' " and this would give momentum to a conclusive negotiation.
An aide to the Secretary General, asked if the Bush Administration had made any effort to press Israeli officials privately on the issue, said he preferred not to discuss the subject.
The Secretary General has spoken to Mr. Bush several times by telephone and is known to have expressed gratitude for Mr. Bush's public statements in support for his diplomatic efforts.

HEADLINE: Ames Posts Cut in Losses

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: ROCKY HILL, Conn., Sept. 10

 BODY:
Ames Department Stores Inc. said today that careful spending had helped it cut second-quarter losses despite failing to reach its sales goal.
For the quarter that ended on July 27, Ames's loss totaled $46.5 million on sales of $727.9 million. Those figures compared with a loss of $152.5 million on sales of $563.3 million in the previous year, which included a one-time charge of $73.1 million. 
 Douglas K. Ewing, a spokesman for Ames, said he could not comment on how much the sales figures differed from the second-quarter goals.
"We are making the necessary changes to position Ames for long-term success -- streamlining our organization, improving operational capabilities and upgrading merchandise assortments," Mr. Pistner said.
Ames announced a recovery plan in June, 14 months after filing for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code. The retailer, which operates 448 discount department stores in 17 Northeastern states, lost $793.5 million after declaring bankruptcy.
Stephen L. Pistner, chairman and chief executive of Ames, attributed the poor sales to the sluggish Northeastern economy. "Although comparable store sales were significantly higher than last year, total sales were below our plan," he said. "Expenses remain well controlled, in line with our plan."
Comparable-store sales, those from stores open at least a year, increased 33 percent, Ames said,

HEADLINE: NO PROGRESS SEEN IN CANADA STRIKE

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO, Sept. 10

 BODY:
The second day of a nationwide strike of Canadian federal workers disrupted millions of people today, creating a new political challenge to a seven-year-old Progressive Conservative Government that has sunk to new lows in opinion polls.
As more than half of the 155,000-member Public Service Alliance of Canada stayed out of work -- halting grain shipments, tying up air transportation and slowing border crossings -- the union and the Government refused to budge from their positions. 
 The union's 49-year-old chief, Daryl Bean, said his members would stay out until Ottawa backs down from its demand for a wage freeze this year and increases of no more than 3 percent in each of the next two years.
Gilles Loiselle, 62 years old, president of the Treasury Board, the man in charge of doling out -- and cutting back -- the expenditures that keep Ottawa running, said that with the Government's huge deficits it had no choice but to hold the line on wage costs, warning that any pay increases now would lead to job losses later.
Mr. Loiselle, one of the closest advisers to Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, served notice that the Government would have "recourse to legislation" should the strike continue and really wreak havoc.
The Government has enough votes in Parliament to do more or less what it wants, like legislate an immediate return to work in a strike.
 
Political Necessities
 But many analysts say they believe that Ottawa will try to avoid such drastic action, which could further erode its popularity, for as long as possible. Mr. Mulroney must face the electorate in the next two years.
On Monday night, Mr. Mulroney was greeted by jeering pickets in London, Ontario, and his limousine was pelted with tomatoes and placards. He had gone to address Conservative Party loyalists and tell them that he was "not going to be deterred by hooliganism."
Both sides are fighting in the public-relations arena. If the strikers do not cause serious inconvenience, they will not force the Government to improve its offer. But if they do, they risk losing public support.
As in the United States, federal workers, with their relatively good pensions and steady work, have never been able to call up much sympathy. The Toronto Sun said in an editorial today, "There are taxpayers who just don't like bureaucrats -- and think they're neither civil nor servants."
Edward Harvey, a professor at the Center for Industrial Relations at the University of Toronto, said in an interview that the union leadership had calculated that "no matter how unpopular federal workers are, they are nowhere near as unpopular as this Government itself."
The latest Gallup Poll released last week showed support for the Tories at an all-time low of 12 percent. The Government is a lightning rod for much negative sentiment, especially about the economy and the high rate of joblessness -- more than 10 percent, with 1.4 million out of work.
"It's quite a feat to provoke a strike by the entire federal civil service," The Edmonton Journal said in an editorial. "But if anyone could do it, it had to be the Government of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney."
 
Government Optimistic Anyway
 Still, Ottawa is still counting on the strike to peter out. The diversity of federal employees is one of the cards in its hand. Representing everyone from blue-collar workers to highly specialized professionals, they are recognized as a difficult group for union leaders to maintain labor discipline over.
Predictably, there were differences between Mr. Bean and Mr. Loiselle over the strike's effectiveness. Mr. Loiselle said early estimates by the Treasury showed about 50 percent of workers legally able to strike were off the job in eastern Canada.
Mr. Bean said the final tallies were showing 70,000 of a possible 110,000 Alliance members registered for picket duty.
About 45,000 workers are considered essential and are therefore ineligible to strike. They include food inspectors, air traffic controllers, prison guards, airport firefighters and those who process unemployment insurance benefits and pension checks.
Air traffic was snarled for a second day at aiports including Toronto's Pearson International, after controllers were late getting to work because of picket lines.
At many border-crossing points, traffic was slowed because of a lack of customs and excise employees.

HEADLINE: New Paramount Theater to Give Radio City a Run for Its Music

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
When Barry Manilow plays the new 5,600-seat Paramount theater this month, his engagement will open a new era in the concert business in New York City.
Until now, the only multi-use theater in Manhattan of comparable size has been Radio City Music Hall. But with the opening of the Paramount, on the site of the old Felt Forum in Madison Square Garden, the two houses will soon be engaged in fierce competition to present big-name entertainment at a time when the concert business is in recession. 
 Ron Delsener, the promoter who booked the Manilow show, said he expected "concert wars" with Radio City. "We can't wait; we're chomping at the bit," he said. "I'm buying a new suit."
John Scher, a New Jersey-based promoter who runs Metropolitan Entertainment and who has several acts booked into the Paramount this fall, says the new theater poses a serious threat to its midtown rival's concert business. "I think the Paramount will be devastating to Radio City Music Hall," he said. The Paramount, he predicted, will end up with 50 percent of the shows that would normally have played Radio City.
 
Smaller Staff, Lower Costs
 Fueling the competition is the fact that for the last decade, Radio City has produced its own concerts and excluded outside promoters, among them Mr. Delsener and Mr. Scher. The Paramount's owner, the entertainment conglomerate Paramount Communications, welcomes outside promoters. Mr. Delsener and Mr. Scher both contend that acts can make more money playing the Paramount than Radio City because the new theater, with a smaller full-time staff and a lower overhead, will be less expensive to operate. Performers could take home $10,000 or more a night by appearing there, they said.
Moreover, they said, one of the attractions of the Paramount will be its intimacy. It is an amphitheater whose last row is only 174 feet from the stage, much closer than the most distant seats at Radio City.
Scott Sanders, who runs Radio City Music Hall Productions, said he doubted those estimates. He also scoffed at Mr. Scher's and Mr. Delsener's predictions that the Paramount would hurt Radio City business. Citing the prestige of the Music Hall, he said it would be "naive" to think that performers made their decisions about where to play in New York based on money alone.
"What happens at the Paramount remains to be seen," he said. "The fact is that Radio City is a unique theater and a unique experience that can't be duplicated anywhere else. We offer full service to an artist. We provide the venue, the promoter and an in-house marketing team that is larger than all the other promoters' staffs put together. And we can provide staging. The Broadway director and choreographer Joe Layton is a permanent member of our creative staff."
The Paramount has already fired the opening salvos by luring Mr. Manilow, who for the last decade has been a top draw at Radio City. On Sept. 25, he will begin a three-night engagement of his "Showstoppers" salute to Broadway musicals. Mr. Delsener, the show's promoter, said Mr. Manilow had chosen the Paramount "because he likes to open new buildings, and there's going to be a lot of excitement about this new building."
 
Vying for Talent
 Both theaters have booked a formidable array of talent for the fall. In addition to Mr. Manilow, the Paramount has scheduled Santana, James Taylor, Patti LaBelle, Michael Bolton, the Moody Blues, the Andy Williams Christmas Show, "Sesame Street Live," the World Soccer Cup Draw, and the popular children's act, Sharon, Lois and Bram.
Mr. Scher said he had hoped to book Natalie Cole into the Paramount, too, but had been outbid by Radio City, which has also lined up Aretha Franklin, Diana Ross, the Moiseyev Dance Company, Ann-Margret and the Rockettes, Johnny Mathis and Dionne Warwick, and a return engagement by Liza Minnelli, whose two-and-a-half-week run last spring grossed over $3.8 million, setting an all-time record for Radio City.
The competition could conceivably push up already high ticket prices as the two theaters vie for big names. The top price for Ms. Cole's Nov. 1 and 2 Radio City dates is $37.50; for Ann-Margret's shows Oct. 22 to 27, it is $50, the same as Mr. Manilow's at the Paramount.
Although a mood of official optimism prevails at the Paramount, the shaky economic climate and the sharp downturn in the concert business have raised questions as to whether New York can sustain a second hall of this size. Attendance, off this year throughout the country, has been especially poor in New York. "It has been the worst season in 20 years, which is as far back as I go," Mr. Scher said.
For the first time in more than 10 years, there was no summer concert series at Pier 84 at 12th Avenue and 43d Street. Mr. Delsener had promoted concerts there from 1981 to 1988 and the following two summers Radio City Music Productions leased the space and lost over $2 million. Of its 17 scheduled concerts last summer, six were canceled.
 
'A Negative Attitude'
 Though Mr. Delsener pointed out that his concert series at Jones Beach did well this summer, he said: "Realistically, there is a negative attitude about New York at the present time. Business is off, and every time you pick up the papers there's bad news. But I think people will want to go to the Paramount because it's new. We just have to be careful of what we play there."
Mr. Scher said: "Compared to most other cities, New York is dreadfully inadequate in the number of good concert performance facilities. The city has only one multi-purpose 2,000-to-3,000-seat sitdown in the Beacon Theater and one 5,000-to-6,000 seater in Radio City. New York needs the Paramount from both a business and a public perspective. The only bit of caution I have is that the state of the concert business is more serious than just a seasonal dropoff."
The Paramount is part of a $200 million renovation of Madison Square Garden by Paramount Communications. The new theater is named, its owners say, for the movie and entertainment palace at 43d Street and Broadway that closed in 1964 after nearly four decades.
The theater, designed by the architectural firm of Ellerbe Becket, replaces the old Felt Forum, the Garden complex's smaller auditorium, which never established an identity and was never successful. "The Felt Forum was neither fish nor fowl," said Martin S. Davis, chairman of Paramount Communications. "It didn't work for sports or for any other kind of entertainment. We wanted its replacement to be something that could turn Madison Square Garden into a sports and entertainment complex."
Unlike the Felt Forum, which had no flyspace above and behind the stage, the Paramount is part of a new six-story building that will provide ample storage space and allow television specials and Broadway-style shows to be produced there. Also, the former hard-to-find entrance on Eighth Avenue has been replaced by a prominent one on Seventh Avenue.

HEADLINE: The Pop Life;
Just When You Thought Rock 'n' Roll Was Dead

BYLINE: By PETER WATROUS

 BODY:
At 12:01 A.M. on Tuesday, a pop culture explosion is expected to detonate. That is the day Guns 'n' Roses finally releases its two new albums, "Use Your Illusion I" and "Use Your Illusion II," and the advance order for the records is huge -- more than four million copies, according to Geffen Records, the band's label. Anticipating a heavy turnout of buyers, a spokesman for Geffen said, over 1,000 stores across the country will open at midnight.
In New York City, Tower Records plans to extend its normal midnight closing time until about 2 A.M. "or as long as it takes," as one store manager put it. A spokesman for Sam Goody said two of its Manhattan stores (at 1011 Third Avenue, at 60th Street, and 390 Avenue of the Americas, at Eighth Street) would stay open Monday night to sell the album "as long as people keep coming in."
"This is a major event," said Lew Garrett, a vice president of purchasing for Camelot, one of the top three record chains in the country. "We placed the largest single order for a new release in the company's history. That's based on demand all year for this project. Outside of Michael Jackson's 'Thriller,' this will probably be the biggest rock record ever."
The album's initial success represents a boon for the ailing record industry. Following the recent success of albums by Metallica and Van Halen, it also signals a resurgence of hard rock.
"People have been saying that rock-and-roll is dead," said Ed Rosenblatt, president of Geffen. "It's clearly not true. Some of the major names haven't released albums, and there haven't been records by U2 or Springsteen or Def Leppard. I think the industry has put out too many copycat bands, which has put buyers to sleep. I think the tremendous anticipation on these albums shows that the market still exists strongly, if you put something out there worthwhile."
The recession has affected not only the pop touring industry, but pop record sales as well. And one theory has it that advance orders of the Guns 'n' Roses albums are high because retail chains, which are buying on credit, see the album as a quick way to generate cash to pay off old debts.
"Business-wise it's been a tough year; we've had to really scrap for every sale," said Mr. Garrett. "We think we have the potential to sell more than we've ever sold of anything. It will provide a ray of sunshine for everyone."
Part of the pre-release excitement can be traced to a series of shrewd marketing ploys. The group has waited four years to release a new album; its last, "Appetite for Destruction," sold 14 million copies. The two "Use Your Illusion" albums were originally scheduled for a May release, but Guns 'n' Roses refused to let them be issued then because, the company said, the band was not artistically satisfied with them. The delay fueled both publicity and anticipation. Also, a single from the album, "You Could Be Mine," has been a big hit, thanks in large part to its being from the summer's biggest movie, "Terminator 2: Judgment Day."
"We just got out of the way," said Robert Smith, head of marketing at Geffen. "When the record was delayed for a few months, the situation just grew in terms of consumer and retail interest. The band began gigging in May, and the marriage of the biggest movie of the summer and the biggest rock band built up incredible demand. When 800,000 cassette singles of 'You Could Be Mine,' went out the door, without any campaign, we realized that they're bigger than we ever thought."
The record company has planned the release cleverly. Betting that teen-agers couldn't afford a double album that might have a list price near $30, they instead voted to split the release in two, with one album having 16 tracks and the other 14; the total amount of music comes out to nearly two and a half hours and the list price of each is $15.99. The first single, "Don't Cry," can be found on both albums, but in different versions. And the company plans to push singles from alternating albums.
"You can't underestimate the label," Mr. Garrett said of Geffen. "They know how to make something big."
But as much as any label tries, it is impossible to sell a dud. Guns 'n' Roses has clearly built a large constituency that is ready and waiting to buy its music.
 
Out of Africa
 The pianist and composer Randy Weston, who is performing on Friday at Alice Tully Hall as part of Lincoln Center's jazz program and on Sunday in a free concert at the band shell in Prospect Park in Brooklyn, is one of the most imposing improvisers working in jazz. One of the New York-based be-bop musicians who came to prominence in the 1950's, he learned the lessons of Duke Ellington, Thelonious Monk and Bud Powell, turning them into an amalgam of ringing chords, giant open spaces, percussive dissonances and skittering runs.
In 1961 Mr. Weston went to Africa, and his musical life changed. Since then, he has traveled through Africa extensively, living in Morocco and studying all sorts of different musical practices. Friday's show is partly a byproduct of his first trip. Mr. Weston and his orchestra will be re-creating the original music for his orchestral work and album, "Highlife," which came out in 1963.
"A lot of African countries were just getting independence," Mr. Weston said. "I wanted to do an album celebrating the events. I had spent a lot of time in Nigeria in a club owned by Bobby Benson, a drummer, and Fela and other African musicians would come and sit in and play. It was a great experience, so some of the tunes are about that scene. And I'll be doing some material off of a big band album I just recorded for Antilles.
"My interest in Africa had started even earlier, though," said Mr. Weston. "It came out of my wonderful father. When I was a very little boy he had books about Africa, and he loved Marcus Garvey. He always said to me that Africa was the beginning of civilization. He instilled Africa in me, that we had a glorious history, that we were a global people. Since then I've tried to meet my brothers and sisters around the world. And he made me take piano lessons!"
Though Mr. Weston works with larger groups, he rarely performs with a big orchestra. The show will feature the arrangements and writing of Melba Liston, one of the best arrangers to come up in the 1950's. Ms. Liston and Mr. Weston have collaborated over the years -- they've just completed a new big band project -- and they work wonderfully together.
"I love working with a big band because you get all those extra colors and sounds," said Mr. Weston. "And Melba is so so skillful she knows what I'm going to do before I do it. She can take my compositions and get the sounds that the pieces call for. I'm ceally thankful to her, and the incredible musicians who are playing this music."

HEADLINE: THE COUNCIL PRIMARIES;
Apathy May Give New York Council an Old Look

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
New York City is about to hold its most important City Council primary in memory, but standing outside a supermarket in Flushing, Queens, the other day, Armando Correa said he had other, more pressing things on his mind.
"I don't think about it," he said of tomorrow's primary. "I got my son, my wife and my work, that's what I think about. I'm going to die anyway like everybody else. So what's the point?" 
 Mr. Correa is not alone. On the eve of the primary, political analysts and election officials are predicting the lowest voter turnout in years, perhaps below 25 percent. This campaign for a more powerful, expanded City Council has been widely heralded as a historic opportunity to open politics to minority groups and independent candidates. But to talk to experts, and to potential voters, is to see few signs that all the hoopla and good intentions will be able to break through a deepening disaffection for politics and politicians.
Advocates of the new system say that this apathy threatens to undermine the promise of these Council elections. Low turnouts traditionally benefit incumbents and others who can draw on the resources of well-organized political groups.
"The collective city doesn't care about these elections," said Gene Russianoff, director of the New York Public Interest Research Group, who lobbied for changes on the Council. "There is a saying: The worst thing that can happen to reformers is that they get what they want."
According to Mr. Russianoff and other political experts, a pervasive disaffection with politics is being compounded by a host of more specific problems, from the Council's poor reputation to a dearth of compelling issues. Then there are the logistics: Voters are being asked to choose from often long lists of candidates running in 51 new districts whose boundaries slash through traditional neighborhoods, in a primary held on the wrong day of the week and on the wrong year in the election cycle.
"Even the people who always vote, the Jewish ladies in senior citizens centers and the black women churchgoers, who walk through snowstorms to vote, are being caught unawares this year," said Norman Adler, a political consultant working to elect a slate of incumbent Council members and their allies. "When people get very confused about something in politics, rather than sorting it out they tend to stay home."
The confusion is so deep that many candidates, running in large fields with little money, are all but despairing of getting their names known, let alone their views, to all but a small fraction of the most sophisticated voters.
And where candidates try to beat the odds through sophisticated vote pulling -- identifying potential supporters and getting them to the polls -- they are finding that most of the voters they call are undecided, and don't know who the candidates are.
In 1985, 35 percent of the eligible voters cast ballots in Council primaries, according to the Board of Elections. Four years later, the figure for the Council rose to 40 percent, when many voters turned out for the crucial mayoral primary won by David N. Dinkins.
 
25 Percent Turnout or Less
 This year, Daniel DeFrancesco, the executive director of the Board of Elections, is predicting a 25 percent turnout, while others estimate that the turnout could drop to 15 percent or so -- an abysmal turnout by most standards, but still above the 7 percent turnout reported in school board elections.
And Mr. DeFrancesco said the turnout might be even lower but for the multiplier effect of races with eight or nine candidates. No matter how obscure, each candidate is likely to draw at least a couple of hundred relatives and friends into local voting booths.
Little of this was envisioned when the Charter Revision Commission -- formed after the United States Supreme Court found the city's Board of Estimate unconstitutional -- decided to enlarge the City Council to 51 members from 35, in order to increase the number of minority representatives.
Under pressure to change, the commission decided to hold elections for the new seats as quickly as possible -- only halfway through the four-year terms of incumbent Council members.
 
Impact of Machine Politics
 By holding the election in an off-year, when there were no other significant races -- for mayor, governor or President -- advocates of change thought they would be giving more independent and minority candidates a chance of being elected. Instead they now worry that machine politicians and powerful labor unions could shape the results of an election with very little turnout.
Still, Mr. Russianoff noted that lackluster voter interest in the City Council reflected the poor voter participation in New York; in last year's gubernatorial race the turnout was less than 30 percent across the state.
"You have to judge this election in the context of what is in this state a nearly lifeless democracy," he said. "This won't be the first or last city election with a light turnout."
In the Eighth Council District, which stretches from the upper West Side to the South Bronx, most passers-by whisked past candidates without stopping, or crumpled up campaign literature before they reached the bottom of the subway stairs.
 
Candidates Untangle Maps
 When voters buttonhole the candidates they are as likely to ask about the boundaries of the Council districts as solicit views on city tax policy.
Campaigning at 110th Street and Broadway the other day, Philip Reed, one of eight candidates, said that his biggest obstacle so far had been convincing voters that Carolyn B. Maloney, the popular incumbent Council representative, was running in a different district on the East Side, and would no longer appear on the ballot.
"In the past week more people have become aware that there is a primary coming up," he said.
Across the street, another candidate, Nelson Antonio Denis, said that without money for television and radio, candidates stood little chance of stirring the interest of voters. He blamed the current City Council for this situation.
 
Other News Than Local Politics
 "The Council's reputation is deservedly bad," he said. "It has been the antithesis of activism."
They said they both feared that a low turnout could elect a third opponent, William Del Toro, who is supported by the Democratic organization in East Harlem and may be able to pull many party loyalists.
Other reasons for the lack of interest include the deep local recession and the grim mood in the city this summer, and the distractions of major news events -- a subway crash, racial disturbances in Crown Heights and upheaval in the Soviet Union -- that have pushed local politics off the front pages.
"People are more concerned about whether they have a job or can go home safely at night than who their City Council representative is going to be," said Henry J. Stern, a former Manhattan Councilman, and president of the Citizens Union, a civic group.
 
'There Are No Great Issues'
 Then there is the notion that with buzzwords like land use, equalization rate and resource recovery, and with the city in dire financial straits, the Council has few compelling issues or dramatic conflicts to capture the imagination of the public.
"There are no great issues that divide anybody," Mr. Stern said. "The city is broke and nobody knows what to do about it."
Hubert James, a mayoral aide who is campaign director for an effort to elect a slate of "progressive" candidates, who favor raising taxes on the rich, blamed local television news for all but ignoring the Council primary.
"It is a major failure of the electronic media here," he said. "There is nobody on television talking about the election, and that is where most folks get their news. Voters don't know who their existing Council people are, and they don't know who is running."
But television news executives say that if they tried to cover 51 Council races, viewers would simply turn the channel. "The trend is to not cover particular races and personalities, and cover the broader issues," said Bret Marcus, news director of WNBC-TV. "If they care about it, they know where and how to find out about it."
 
'Nobody Is Really Honest'
 Then there are New Yorkers who would not vote no matter what.
Marty Jenkins, who owns a locksmith store on Kissena Boulevard in Flushing, belonged to a Democratic political club for 20 years, but dropped out and stopped voting, disillusioned, he said, over the lies politicians tell.
"Nobody is really honest, from the councilmen up to the President of the United States," he said. "Sometimes I feel bad that I don't vote -- but I don't want to vote for anybody who isn't giving me a clear-cut program and who I don't know if they are telling me the truth."
And Juan Ruiz, a 44-year-old nurse, said he hadn't voted for eight years. "I work and I survive," he said. "I don't think much about it. I'm tired of people."

HEADLINE: GYMNASTICS;
Soviets Triumph; Americans Place 5th

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: INDIANAPOLIS, Sept. 10

 BODY:
There might be uncertainty at home, with all the political and economic upheaval. But here at the world championships of gymnastics tonight, all was calm and orderly for the men of the Soviet Union.
For the fourth consecutive time the event has been held and the sixth in the last seven since 1979, the Soviet athletes proved themselves the best among 30 countries as they won the team competition and led 12 countries automatic qualifying for the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. 
 The United States, which competed with only five athletes because of an injury to Lance Ringnald, its most experienced gymnast, survived a few bumpy performances and finished fifth, a remarkable accomplishment and the team's highest placement since the 1983 tournament in Budapest. There, the Americans were fourth behind China, the Soviet Union and Japan.
 
Never a Major Factor
 But even with so strong and unexpected performance tonight, the United States was never a major factor in medal contention. As the Soviet athletes moved far into a lead early and were never challenged, they finished with 584.425 points and the largest margin of victory for a title at world championships, Olympics or European championships in more than 16 years.
China edged Germany for second, 577.050 to 576.125.
The points represent a total of the five best scores of each team on each of the six apparatuses -- floor exercise, pommel horse, rings, vault, parallel bars and high bar -- through two rounds of competition, compulsories and optionals. The lowest of the scores is dropped.
The Soviet Union's victory was built on the sheer power of consistency and depth of talent. Nothing demonstrated that better than the intra-team competition that left the defending all-around champion, Igor Korobchinski, out of the all-around competition on Thursday.
No more than three athletes from one country can qualify among the 36, and Korobchinski's 116.700 points left him fourth in the overall individual standings behind Vitaly Scherbo (117.175), Grigori Misutin (116.900) and Valeri Lyukin (116.825), the only Soviet performer remaining from the 1988 Olympic team.
Alexei Voropaev scored the fewest points for the Soviet team, 115.150, and he still finished 12th in the overall standings among 212 athletes from more than 50 nations.
The leading American was Scott Keswick, in 15th, with 114.375 points. Keswick, Jarrod Hanks (28th) and Chris Waller (tied for 29th) scored high enough to gain positions in the all-around competition.
 
'Ready Psychologically'
 "We were ready psychologically as well as athletically," the Soviet team coach, Leonid Arkaev, said as his six team members sat beaming at his right. "We are very happy. They showed everybody what they can do."
The silver medal for China represented an improvement from third place at the 1989 tournament in Stuttgart. The bronze for Germany was ironic in that the team represented a united Germany, and all six athletes are from what was once East Germany. In 1989, East Germany finished second, and West Germany was 10th.
The Americans tied for eigth in 1989, so they were not unexpectedly thrilled with their performance. It was particularly more satisfying in that, with Ringnald out after tearing a pectoral muscle during the compulsory round on Saturday, they were left without margin for error.
Yet even though they experienced break downs, like Keswick's inexplicable collapse at the end of his floor exercise routine, they never compounded a mistake with another.
Francis Allen, the team coach, cited a mistake by Patrick Kirksey on the pommel horse to make his point. Kirksey stopped in the middle of his routine, when his weight was too far back, interrupting momentum into his next maneuver.
"But he got back up and finished perfectly and got a 9.2," Allen noted of Kirksey's 9.250 score. "If he lacked concentration and screwed up again, he would have gotten an 8.5, and that would probably have dropped us another spot."
"No," he said, "I couldn't be more pleased. Everything we asked of these guys, they gave it to us."
The team competition also qualified athletes to compete for titles on individual events this weekend, but here, the Americans were less successful. Only Keswick became eligible for his work on the rings and the high bar.
By comparison, the Soviet team advanced two athletes, the maximum allowed, into each of the six events.

HEADLINE: U.S. MOVES TO CURB MEDICAID PAYMENTS FOR MANY STATES

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 10

 BODY:
Despite protests from Republican as well as Democratic governors, the Bush Administration today issued new rules intended to eliminate what it described as a "scam" used by states to extract $3 billion to $5 billion a year from the Federal Government for Medicaid benefits.
The move has broad political, fiscal and medical implications. Under the rules, the Federal Government will no longer match spending by states for Medicaid if the state money comes from donations or special taxes paid by hospitals and nursing homes. 
 Medicaid finances health care for 27 million low-income people, with the Federal Government and the states sharing the cost. The state share rises with a state's per capita income from 20 percent in the poorest state, Mississippi, to 50 percent in affluent states like New York and California.
 
37 States at Issue
 The Department of Health and Human Services said 37 states used such donations and taxes to obtain extra money from the Federal Government.
States still use general revenues to pay most of their Medicaid costs and say they use donations and taxes to supplement, not to supplant, state spending. But in the last two years, states have increasingly resorted to creative financing techniques for a number of reasons: Congress has imposed new burdens, expanding Medicaid to cover millions of additional women and children in low-income families, health costs are soaring and state revenues are plunging because of the recession.
The Administration contends that the practice of raising Federal money by counting donations and taxes as part of a state's Medicaid share is a major factor in the "explosion" of Federal Medicaid costs, from $41 billion last year to $52 billion this year and a projected $62 billion next year. And it contends that the increase in Medicaid costs contributes to the growth of the Federal budget deficit, which is expected to exceed $340 billion next year.
 
Effort to Delay Rules
 But in a statement issued on behalf of the National Governors' Association, Gov. John R. McKernan Jr. of Maine, a Republican, warned that hospitals might close, and that "women and children will lose eligibility" for Medicaid because of the new restrictions on states in raising money for Medicaid.
Mike Lawrence, press secretary for Gov. Jim Edgar of Illinois, a Republican, said: "This is a blatant and very unfortunate case of changing the rules in the middle of the game. It affects the ability of nearly 40 states to finance health-care programs for the poor, including many programs mandated by the Federal Government."
Governor Edgar "believes that the Federal bureaucracy has overstepped its bounds and gone way beyond what the law permits," Mr. Lawrence said.
The governors, joined by hospitals, other health-care providers and advocates for the poor, will lobby Congress to delay the new rules.
The regulations, signed Friday by Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, were approved Monday by the White House Office of Management and Budget and will be published Thursday in The Federal Register. They are scheduled to take effect, with the force of law, on Jan. 1.
A senior Administration official said: "States will all come in and sue to block these regulations. We knew that from the beginning. They don't like losing money."
 
Moves by Budget Chief
 The new rules were espoused in particular by Richard G. Darman, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, who said that states were perpetrating a scam to obtain extra money from the Federal Government at little or no cost to state treasuries. The substance of the rules on donations and special taxes was known in advance and provoked bipartisan outrage at a meeting of the National Governors' Association in Seattle last month.
Brad C. Johnson, director of the New York State office in Washington, said: "This is an example of Darman waging fiscal war against the states. Rather than seeking cooperation on comprehensive health-care reform, he, in effect, accuses us of stealing from the Federal Treasury to provide health care for the poor." New York has a tax on hospitals and stands to lose hundreds of millions of dollars in Federal Medicaid payments next year, Mr. Johnson said.
The states' financing devices work this way: States collect "voluntary donations" or taxes from hospitals, count these contributions as part of the state share of Medicaid and then get $2 or $3 of Federal matching money for each dollar paid by the hospitals.
The Office of Management and Budget says these devices will cost the Federal Government $3 billion this year and at least $5 billion next year.
 
Started Unveiling in Massachusetts
 These techniques became well known when Kathleen Betts, a 10-year veteran of the Massachusetts Department of Public Welfare, used them this spring to obtain more than $450 million of additional Federal money for the state's Medicaid program.
Dr. Sullivan was traveling today in Africa, but in a statement issued through his office here, he said: "The use of donations and provider taxes increases Federal Medicaid costs without an increase in state expenditures or services, effectively altering the matching rate. These devices are contrary to the cost-sharing partnership that is the hallmark of Medicaid."
State Medicaid officials, hospital executives and members of Congress say the new rules will severely impair the ability of the states to finance health care for poor people.
Robert H. Sweeney, president of the National Association of Children's Hospitals, said: "Both the family that depends on Medicaid for health care and the provider that cares for many low-income families should be alarmed. The Federal Government's new rules will throw state Medicaid programs into financial jeopardy."
"Even the family with private insurance should be alarmed, because crippled Medicaid programs force health-care providers to curtail their services or raise their prices to the privately insured," he said.
 
Predictions of Doom
 In a recent letter to Congress, Gov. Guy Hunt of Alabama, a Republican, contended that the new rules would "decimate the state's Medicaid program." Robert P. Casey of Pennsylvania and Wallace G. Wilkinson of Kentucky are among the many Democratic governors who have objected to the rules. Senators Christopher S. Bond and John C. Danforth of Missouri, both Republicans, have also objected.
Under the rules, the Federal Government will no longer match state Medicaid payments when the state share is derived from either donations or certain types of taxes, imposed exclusively on hospitals, nursing homes or institutions for the mentally retarded.
While the Federal Government would not recognize the cost of such "provider-specific taxes," adopted by at least 29 states, it might help states reimburse hospitals for the cost of some broad-based taxes, like a sales tax imposed on all corporations or businesses in a state.
The decision about which taxes qualify for Federal matching payments will be decided after a close examination of the facts in each case. But the Department of Health and Human Services said that "most current state programs which use taxes to increase payments to hospitals with unusually large Medicaid caseloads" will not qualify.
 
Some Taxes Are Held Acceptable
 State officials said the new rules would disrupt state Medicaid operations because they would take effect in the middle of a fiscal year.
Officials in Massachusetts, California and other states said they believed that, with minor adjustments, some of the unorthodox techniques used by states to raise money for Medicaid might pass muster under the new rules. In a preamble to the rules, the Administration said the new restrictions "will in no way preclude states from increasing their share of Medicaid expenditure from other sources."
The Federal Department of Health and Human Services first proposed the rules in February 1990. It received 79 comments from the public, "only a few" in support of the proposal, the preamble said.
A survey by the American Public Welfare Association in August identified 29 states that had programs to finance Medicaid through donations from hospitals or special taxes imposed on health-care providers. The states were expecting to get $2.3 billion in Federal matching payments for the donations and $4.4 billion in Federal matching payments for the taxes. Some states use both techniques, and some did not respond to the survey.
States with the special taxes included Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Maine, Minnesota, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Nevada, New York, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin, the survey found.
States that raise money through voluntary contributions include California, Georgia, Michighan, Missouri, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Utah, the survey reported. Florida, Maryland and Mississippi have adopted both techniques, it said.

HEADLINE: EATING WELL;
Major U.S. Survey on Food Use and Pesticides Is Drawing Fire

BYLINE: By MARIAN BURROS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 9

 BODY:
The Federal Government's most important food consumption survey, which is instrumental in setting such Government policies as the school lunch program and calculating the tolerance level for pesticide residues in food, is so flawed it is probably useless, according to a scientific panel and the General Accounting Office.
That agency, an investigative arm of Congress, faults both the Department of Agriculture, which conducts the National Food Consumption Survey once a decade, and the company that did the work, National Analysts, a marketing concern, for mishandling the 1987-88 survey, which cost $7.6 million. 
 The Agriculture Department acknowledges the flaws.
The agency's Food and Nutrition Service uses the food and nutrient data to evaluate billion-dollar assistance programs like food stamp allotments and the school breakfast and lunch programs. The Environmental Protection Agency uses it to set pesticide tolerance levels in food. The Food and Drug Administration uses it to calculate nutrient-consumption levels and determine public exposure to pesticides and toxic metals. The Government also uses it to track food trends.
The problem with the survey "really complicates any statement about dietary changes in the population," said Catherine Woteki, director of the Food and Nutrition Board at the National Academy of Sciences.
The worst problem is the survey's low response rate of 34 percent, making it questionable whether the data are representative of the population, the G.A.O. said. Such surveys also require follow-up studies of those who do not respond. National Analysts, which conducted the survey, told both the Agriculture Department and the General Accounting Office that its follow-up data had been lost, but finally acknowledged that no follow-ups were conducted, the report said.
The G.A.O. undertook the investigation at the request of Representative George E. Brown Jr., Democrat of California. It notified the Agriculture Department of the problems and the department asked the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology to review the data. The clinical research organization's report said it "does not recommend use of the data" and if the Agriculture Department chose to publish the data, it "should include a strongly worded cautionary statement concerning the potential for nonresponse bias."
Roger Runngen, a spokesman for Edward Madigan, the Secretary of Agriculture, said yesterday that the department is taking steps "to make future surveys more accurate."
Michael McCullough, chairman of the board of Booz, Allen & Hamilton, which owns National Analysts, said the company has "taken a number of steps to insure the quality and timeliness of the work. I'm professionally embarrassed by it."
Agencies that rely on the department's data have two other choices: use data collected by the Department of Health and Human Services in its Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, or Hanes, or keep using the 1977-78 survey. "Within the scientific community there has always been some question about the validity of the 77-78 survey," Dr. Woteki said.
The response rate was 62 percent in that earlier survey, "a very low response compared to other surveys at the time," Dr. Woteki said. The nonrespondents in that survey were not followed up.
The Hanes studies have a response rate of 77 percent to 86 percent and health professionals have always considered them more reliable gauges of food consumption patterns than the U.S.D.A. surveys.
The statistical differences are often serious. The 1977-78 food consumption researchers reported that women 19 to 50 years of age were consuming 41 percent of their calories from fat; the Hanes 1976-80 study found the same group consuming 36 percent from fat.
"We have a big nationwide campaign going on about reduction of fat," Dr. Woteki said. "If the 77-78 survey is not reliable, how can we assess the change?"
Some Government agencies like the E.P.A have decided to ignore the latest Agriculture Department survey. This May, the G.A.O. warned the E.P.A. of serious problems with the data. "The sample was so small for some subgroups that they may not be useful to extrapolate to the entire population," said Kevin Donohue, assistant director of the G.A.O.'s resources, community and economic development division. "The tolerance levels may not be set at levels that will protect all these subgroups," which include nursing infants and pregnant women.
Linda Fisher, Assistant Administrator in the E.P.A.'s office of pesticides and toxic substances, said the agency will to continue to use the 1977-78 data to determine consumption rates despite its flaws because the data were more reliable. "It is out of date," she said, "because eating patterns have changed. People are eating more fruits and vegetables."
But the Food and Drug Administration has decided to use the data from the new survey because "we have to work with what we have," said Jean Pennington, associate director of dietary surveillance in the agency's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. "We will look very cautiously at the intake of nutrients, heavy metals and pesticides and if the results are consistent with previous years, we will go ahead." alternative, she said, is to use the Hanes study now underway, some of which will be available in 1992.
The Department of Agriculture bases the food plans for the school lunch and breakfast programs, the Thrifty Food Plan and food stamp allotments on the survey data. The school lunches are intended to meet one-third of the Recommended Daily Allowances for various nutrients. The foods in the program are selected on the basis of what the survey says schoolchildren eat most frequently. Mr. Runngen said he did not know what the agency would do about using the data.
"What has happened with the survey is exactly why the nutrition committee has worked so hard to get the Nutrition Monitoring Act passed," said Marion Nestle, chairwoman of New York University's nutrition department, who was editor of the Surgeon General's 1988 Report on Nutrition and Health. "U.S.D.A has always fought it. We have all been aware for a really long time that it is impossible to get any trends. The Surgeon General's report tells everyone to eat less fat, but we have no idea if people are eating less fat."
Representative Brown, who asked for the inquiry, sponsored the Nutrition Monitoring Act that was passed last year by Congress. "One of my efforts," he said, "has been to establish a framework for all such surveys to make them more comprehensive and reliable."
He said there was "considerable evidence of absolute fraud in some areas of the survey" and he has turned over the findings to the Inspector General of the U.S.D.A.
He said the survey should not be conducted every 10 years, but rather should be ongoing. "I am moderately encouraged by the positive response of the U.S.D.A., because they hate to admit mistakes," he said.

HEADLINE: Upscale Down-and-Outers Try Pawning

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA

 BODY:
THE lawyer needed an engagement ring but had lost his credit by filing for bankruptcy. The advertising agency owner couldn't meet her payroll because her clients were paying their bills late. The fifth-grade teacher wanted to trim her credit card balance without her husband's knowledge.
So where did each of these upscale and respectable, though cash-poor, people turn? 
 Not to family, friends or conventional financial lenders. Instead, they used pawnshops, reaching out to an old but fast-growing and rapidly changing industry that until recently was best known for its unsavory characters (from Shylock in "The Merchant of Venice" to Rod Steiger in "The Pawnbroker") and usurious interest rates (as high as 24 percent a month, depending on the state).
"It's just very, very convenient," said the teacher, Angela Lindsey of West Deptford, N.J., who recently pawned a bracelet and a watch for $600 at Carver W. Reed, a 131-year-old pawnshop in Center City here. "The bank gives you such a runaround."
Though pawnshops are often lauded by customers for their easy and speedy transactions, the real lure has been their willingness to act as the lender of last resort for the working poor, who often find themselves abandoned by the mainstream banking world.
But they are being joined by increasing numbers of middle-class and even more affluent customers, hard hit by recession-related layoffs, bankruptcies, foreclosures and tight credit, as well as other modern money maladies, like high medical bills and costly divorce settlements.
"On any given day, you'll see as many suits and ties come in here as blue jeans and T-shirts," said Tod Gordon, the owner of Carver W. Reed.
Pawnshops profit by making loans in exchange for items that serve as collateral. Monthly interest rates, excluding storage fees and other charges, range from 2 percent in some states, like Connecticut, to 24 percent in Mississippi. If the interest is not paid on time, the collateral is forfeited to the pawnbroker, who often sells it at near-wholesale prices. On average, shops hold goods about 60 days before they are forfeited.
No precise statistics are kept on the number of people who receive loans from pawnshops, although John P. Caskey, an associate professor of economics at Swarthmore College, has estimated that one in 10 Americans use them at least once a year.
The number of pawnbrokers in the nation, however, has grown by more than half in the last five years, from 4,849 to 7,354, according to American Business Information, a research organization in Omaha.
The industry is booming most in the South and West, particularly in Florida and Texas, which have more than 2,000 pawnshops combined. "You never know what's coming through that door," said Mike O'Neill, the owner of the Happy Hocker in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. "I did a pawn on a 31-foot Chris-Craft. I lent him $10,000. He said he needed it because they were going to foreclose on his house."
Pawnshops are least numerous in the Northeast, because of state regulations that hold down the interest rates they can charge. In New York City, where state law caps the monthly rate at 3 percent, the number of pawnshops has declined to 15 today from more than 120 in World War II.
Another regional difference is that many shops in the Northeast accept only gems and jewelry, not the television sets, VCR's, personal computers and compact disk players that are commonly used as collateral elsewhere. (Tales of customers' offering items like artificial limbs, false teeth or shoes are generally apocryphal.)
"We did have somebody pawn a python named Sylvia," Mr. O'Neill said. "We had to keep it away from the jewelry area. Planes are big, too."
Pawnbrokers describe many of their customers as young and financially inexperienced. Others work in low-paying nonunion or service industry jobs. A few, of course, are chronic overspenders doomed to a life in debt.
But a sizable new segment appears to be made up of professionals or middle-class homeowners who are pawning the playthings they pursued passionately in the ostentatious 80's.
For example, the Philadelphia lawyer who needed an engagement ring pawned a gold Rolex watch for $1,600. "I don't feel any stigma," said the lawyer, who refused to discuss the transaction without a guarantee of anonymity. "I feel gouged."
Pawnshops are particularly popular with Christmas shoppers looking for bargains. "People come in for everything from skateboards to toolboxes and television sets," said Betty Payton, the executive director of the National Pawnbrokers Association in Fort Lauderdale. "A lot of the items, once they are cleaned and polished, you can't tell if they have been used."
Hoping to broaden this new customer base even further, pawnbrokers are working to change an unflattering image that has often portrayed them as cold-hearted cheats preying on the poor and the unfortunate, or as fences squinting through jewelers' loupes and providing quick cash for stolen goods, no questions asked.
The Rodeo Drive Jewelry Loans Shop in Beverly Hills, Calif., for example, receives customers by appointment only. And the Pawnbrokers Association of New York recently changed its name to the Collateral Loan Brokers Association.
"There has been a gradual image change," Ms. Payton said. "Pawnbrokers realize that more and more, people are stepping into their shops for the first time."
Some pawnshops are even becoming financial centers, cashing checks, taking payment on bills and making loans for tickets from other pawnshops. They promote their loan application process as quick and trouble free and are willing to make frequent and small loans (sometimes as little as $5). They also run ads on television and are moving away from seedier sections to more desirable areas, like suburban shopping centers.
Then there is Cash America Investments Inc. of Fort Worth, the nation's largest pawnshop operator, with 161 stores in seven states. The chain aspires to become the 7-Eleven of pawnshops, in ubiquity as well as in cleanliness and service. It even became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange in 1987.
"We do a better job of showcasing merchandise," said the company's chairman, Jack R. Daugherty. He added that many customers are attracted to pawnshops because the shops do not require checking accounts, bank cards or other conventional credit arrangements. About 26 percent of the adults in the United States, or almost 50 million people, do not use banks, according to Mediamark Research in New York.
"We're kind of like a bank on one side and a retail store on the other," Mr. Daugherty said.
Often referred to as the world's second oldest profession, pawnbroking can be traced to the Germanic Lombards who established themselves in northern Italy around A.D. 500. The shield of St. Thomas of Lombard included three purses of gold that evolved into the symbol of the three balls that adorn the entrances of many pawnshops and are often inscribed "buy, sell, trade."
The business has other exalted roots: the Medici were among the first pawnbrokers or moneylenders, as they were often called then; Isabella of Castile pawned her jewels to finance Columbus's first voyage; J. P. Morgan was a founder of the Provident Loan Society in New York, the nation's only not-for-profit pawnshop. And a New York socialite, Evalyn Walsh McLean, tried to pawn the Hope diamond to raise ransom money for the kidnapped Lindbergh baby.
Professor Caskey of Swarthmore noted that pawnshops once provided a standard means of moneylending for much of the nation. "At the turn of the century, commercial banks didn't do business with the middle class," he said. "Now I can see, to a much smaller degree, a similar trend because of deregulation."
Mr. Daugherty agreed. "There are more stores now because the business is better accepted, and it's out in the open, and it's fulfilling a need," he said. "We believe that one-third of the people in the country fit the mold of the pawnshop customer."

HEADLINE: Wine Talk

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial

 BODY:
THERE are lots of good wine buys around. So many that there is a tendency to get carried away while enumerating them. Consider what happened last week in this space. What was supposed to be an all-encompassing list of good red wines at reasonable prices had barely mentioned a few European wines when there was no more space.
Herewith then, another go at it, this one confined to our own shores and mostly California at that. The search for bargains from vines in the United States is getting tougher. The Italians, French and Spanish continue to turn out a splendid variety of excellent wines for $10 and under. 
 In California, wines in that price range are mostly made by larger wineries -- Beaulieu, Fetzer, Martini, Parducci, Rodney Strong. Smaller producers manage to keep some of their whites -- sauvignon blanc and chenin blanc -- in that range, but the bottom line for quality cabernet sauvigon is now approaching $15. The $30 bottle is quite commonplace, and the $50 and even the $75 bottle are no longer the sole province of the Bordelais. Even the egalitarian Gallo plan to develop a $60 cabernet and a $30 chardonnay from their Sonoma County vineyards.
Happily for most of us, the American vintners have not entirely forgotten their economic roots. The aforementioned Fetzers continue to produce a wide range of affordable wines, including their delicious Barrel Select cabernets. The 1987, a wine with both depth and softness, can be found in most good shops for around $10. Beaulieu Vineyard's Rutherford Cabernet is in the same price category, and the same company's low-priced Beautour continues to be one of the best bargains in good California cabernet, usually from $5 to $7.
Several prominent Napa Valley wineries buy wine in bulk, and blend and bottle it under second labels. These wines never come up to the quality of the estate-bottled wines of these wineries, but they are invariably good. Caymus Vineyard's Liberty School is a good example. Usually sold in vintages, but sometimes nonvintage, the wine sells for around $8 and is an excellent buy at that price.
Stag's Leap Wine Cellars' Hawk Crest is a similar second label line of wines. Since they go out under the imprimatur of Warren Winiarski, the man behind Stag's Leap, they are a safe bet. The Hawk Crest cabernet also sells for about $8.
A bit of tannin gives Parducci's 1987 North Coast Counties cabernet (about $9) a nice edge. Sunny St. Helena's 1988 North Coast Cabernet and Louis Martini's 1988 Sonoma cabernet, both in the same price range, are of diffent styles but both good values. The A. Rafanelli Winery 1988 unfiltered Dry Creek cabernet is a bit more expensive, $12 to $13, but well worth it.
Rodney Strong is not just the name of a northern Sonoma winery; it's the name of the chap who started the whole thing. Years ago the winery was called Sonoma Vineyards, but it has always made good wine regardless of the name. His regular 1987 cabernet, at $10, is a most worthy purchase: a good solid cabernet that has a few years ahead of it and that can hold its own in wines at twice the price.
And if it turns you on, look for the Mr. Strong's 1985 pinot noir with a Russian River Valley appellation. It's a single vineyard wine from his River East Vineyard and it, too, sells for around $10. Chambertin it's not. But it is true pinot noir in the Burgundy style at a truly reasonable price. What more is there to say?
Well, there is this: the late, great Frank Schoonmaker would roll over in his grave if he could see what is happening to grenache rose. Mr. Schoonmaker was a travel writer for The New Yorker turned wine writer, O.S.S. agent and, later, consultant to the California wine industry. He was the first to push for the use of varietal names -- the names of the grapes -- for wines made from those grapes.
One of his first successes was Almaden's rose jug wine made from the grenache grape. Grenache, a workaday grape that gave body and character to many a jug wine in its time, fell out of favor when California decided to concentrate on the so-called noble varieties, like cabernet sauvignon.
More recently, the grapes of the Rhone Valley in France have been much in vogue, the grenache among them. So our old jug wine friend grenache is back, both in its natural red state and also as a rose. History repeats itself. Try the Joseph Phelps 1990 Grenache Rose at $9 or McDowell Valley Vineyards Grenache Rose, made from old vines, at $7.50. Are they much better than the old Almaden jug version? I doubt it. No matter; they are delightful light wines that can serve as a relief from both reds and whites, depending on your mood.
White zinfandel, the darling of the singles bars, needs no introduction. It's wet, cold, fizzy and sweet, and many people love it. Red zinfandel is another matter; it is a serious wine that can reach great heights. Zinfandel may not have the elegance of the best cabernets but not every occasion calls for elegance.
Sutter Home's regular North Coast 1988 zinfandel is a relatively simple wine, soft and accessible, with no harsh tannins but with lots of flavor. For about $5 a bottle, it's hard to beat. Unless you should try the same Napa Valley winery's Amador County Reserve 1987 for about $10. Amador County, in the Sierra foothills, is zinfandel country. It produces solid, tannic wines like this one that will make anyone a zinfandel fan -- red zinfandel, that is.
For a different style, try Cain Cellars' 1989 Contra Costa County zinfandel for about $9. It doesn't have the tannin of the Amador wine but it's full of flavor and easy to drink.
At this time of year, quite a few people are looking for a decent kosher red from California. There are a few, notably the wines from Hagafen Cellars and Weinstock Cellars, but they can be pricey. The Baron Herzog Sonoma cabernet 1986 was an excellent buy for around $10.50, as was the Herzog Special Reserve Sonoma cabernet for about $15. They may have been replaced by newer vintages in some shops; no matter -- they will grace any holiday table.
 
TASTINGS
Chateau Pontet-Canet, Pauillac, 1986; about $17.
 Pontet-Canet, with its magnificent site next to Mouton-Rothschild, its great chai and immense underground cellars, should be one of the important properties in Pauillac. After a long mediocre period, it may be on the way to becoming just that. The estate was owned for many years by the Cruse family, which used it more as a brand name than as a place to make a chateau wine. Back when French trains went slow enough to need dining cars, nonvintage Pontet-Canet was a popular railroad wine. In fact, chateau bottling was not instituted at Pontet-Canet until 1972. The Cruses sold the property in 1975 or, at least, it was taken over by a son-in-law, Guy A. Tesseron, a Cognac merchant who already owned Chateau Lafon-Rochet, a mile or so to the north in St.-Estephe. Pontet-Canet is now run by Mr. Tesseron's son, Alfred, who lives there and who has undertaken a thorough upgrading of the estate. The 1986 has all the richness one expects from a good Pauillac. The color is deep ruby and the bouquet is classic black currant. It may not yet show the breed of more famous Pauillac properties, but at this price it is an exceptional buy.

HEADLINE: THE THOMAS HEARINGS;
Excerpts From Senate Session on the Thomas Nomination

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 10

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the transcript of today's opening session of Senate Judiciary Committee hearings on the nomination of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court with questioning by Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., the committee chairman; Senator Strom Thurmond and Senator Edward M. Kennedy:
 
Opening Remarks By Judge Thomas
 Mr. Chairman, Senator Thurmond, members of the committee, I am humbled and honored to have been nominated by President Bush to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. I would like to thank the committee, especially you, Chairman Biden, for your extraordinary fairness throughout this process, and I would like to thank each of you and so many of your colleagues here in the Senate for taking the time to visit with me. 
 There are not enough words to express my deep gratitude and appreciation to Senator Danforth, who gave me my first job out of Yale Law School. I have never forgotten the terms of his offer to me: more work for less pay than anyone in the country could offer. Believe me, he delivered on his promise, especially the less pay.
I appreciate his wise counsel and his example over the years, and his tireless efforts on my behalf during the confirmation process.
And I would like to thank Senators Bond, Nunn, Fowler, Warner, and Robb, for taking the time to introduce me today.
Much has been written about my family and me over the past 10 weeks. Through all that has happened throughout our lives and through all adversity, we have grown closer and our love for each other has grown stronger and deeper. I hope these hearings will help to show more clearly who this person Clarence Thomas is and what really makes me tick.
My earliest memories, as alluded to earlier, are those of Pin Point, Ga., a life far removed in space and time from this room, this day and this moment. As kids, we caught minnows in the creeks, fiddler crabs in the marshes, we played with pluffers, and skipped shells across the water. It was a world so vastly different from all this.
 
Shared Kitchen and Bathroom
 In 1955, my brother and I went to live with my mother in Savannah. We lived in one room in a tenement. We shared a kitchen with other tenants and we had a common bathroom in the backyard which was unworkable and unusable. It was hard, but it was all we had and all there was.
Our mother only earned $20 every two weeks as a maid, not enough to take care of us. So she arranged for us to live with our grandparents later, in 1955. Imagine, if you will, two little boys with all their belongings in two grocery bags. Our grandparents were two great and wonderful people who loved us dearly. I wish they were sitting here today. Sitting here so they could see that all their efforts, their hard work were not in vain, and so that they could see that hard work and strong values can make for a better life.
I am grateful that my mother and my sister could be here. Unfortunately, my brother could not be.
I attended segregated parochial schools and later attended a seminary near Savannah. The nuns gave us hope and belief in ourselves when society didn't. They reinforced the importance of religious beliefs in our personal lives. Sister Mary Virgilius, my eighth-grade teacher, and the other nuns were unyielding in their expectations that we use all of our talents no matter what the rest of the world said or did.
After high school, I left Savannah and attended Immaculate Conception Seminary, then Holy Cross College. I attended Yale Law School. Yale had opened its doors, its heart, its conscience to recruit and admit minority students. I benefitted from this effort.
My career is as been delineated today. I was an Assistant Attorney General in the State of Missouri. I was an attorney in the corporate law department of Monsanto Company. I joined Senator Danforth's staff here in the Senate, was an Assistant Secretary in the Department of Education, Chairman of E.E.O.C., and since 1990 a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
 
Standing on Others' Shoulders
 But for the efforts of so many others who have gone before me, I would not be here today. It would be unimaginable. Only by standing on their shoulders could I be here. At each turn in my life, each obstacle confronted, each fork in the road someone came along to help.
I remember, for example, in 1974 after I completed law school I had no money, no place to live. Mrs. Margaret Bush Wilson, who would later become chairperson of the N.A.A.C.P., allowed me to live at her house. She provided me not only with room and board, but advice, counsel and guidance.
As I left her house that summer, I asked her, "How much do I owe you?" Her response was, "Just along the way help someone who is in your position." I have tried to live by my promise to her to do just that, to help others.
So many others gave their lives, their blood, their talents. But for them I would not be here. Justice Marshall, whose seat I have been nominated to fill, is one of those who had the courage and the intellect. He is one of the great architects of the legal battles to open doors that seemed so hopelessly and permanently sealed and to knock down barriers that seemed so insurmountable to those of us in the Pin Point, Georgias of the world.
The civil rights movement, Reverend Martin Luther King and the S.C.L.C., Roy Wilkins and the N.A.A.C.P., Whitney Young and the Urban League, Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks and Dorothy Height, they changed society and made it reach out and affirmatively help. I have benefited greatly from their efforts. But for them there would have been no road to travel.
My grandparents always said there would be more opportunities for us. I can still hear my grandfather, "Y'all goin' have mo' of a chance then me," and he was right. He felt that if others sacrificed and created opportunities for us we had an obligation to work hard, to be decent citizens, to be fair and good people, and he was right.
You see, Mr. Chairman, my grandparents grew up and lived their lives in an era of blatant segregation and overt discrimination. Their sense of fairness was molded in a crucible of unfairness. I watched as my grandfather was called "boy." I watched as my grandmother suffered the indignity of being denied the use of a bathroom. But through it all they remained fair, decent, good people. Fair in spite of the terrible contradictions in our country.
 
The Values of My Youth
 They were hardworking, productive people who always gave back to others. They gave produce from the farm, fuel oil from the fuel oil truck. They bought groceries for those who were without, and they never lost sight of the promise of a better tomorrow. I follow in their footsteps and I have always tried to give back.
Over the years I have grown and matured. I have learned to listen carefully, carefully to other points of views and to others, to think through problems recognizing that there are no easy answers to difficult problems, to think deeply about those who will be affected by the decisions that I make and the decisions made by others. But I have always carried in my heart the world, the life, the people, the values of my youth, the values of my grandparents and my neighbors, the values of people who believed so very deeply in this country in spite of all the contradictions.
It is my hope that when these hearings are completed that this committee will conclude that I am an honest, decent, fair person. I believe that the obligations and responsibilities of a judge, in essence, involve just such basic values. A judge must be fair and impartial. A judge must not bring to his job, to the court, the baggage of preconceived notions, of ideology, and certainly not an agenda, and the judge must get the decision right. Because when all is said and done, the little guy, the average person, the people of Pin Point, the real people of America will be affected not only by what we as judges do, but by the way we do our jobs.
If confirmed by the Senate I pledge that I will preserve and protect our Constitution and carry with me the values of my heritage: fairness, integrity, open-mindedness, honesty, and hard work.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 
Questions By Senator Biden
 Q. Judge, as Senator Danforth said, he hopes we have read your speeches. I assure you I have read all of your speeches, and I have read them in their entirety. And, as I indicated in my opening statement, what I want to talk about a little bit is one of the things you mention repeatedly in your speeches so that I can be better informed by what you mean by it.
Whether you are speaking in the speech you delivered on the occasion of Martin Luther King's birthday, a national holiday and whether it should be one, to a conservative audience, making the point that he should be looked to with more reverence or whether or not it was your speech to the Pacific Institute or whether or not it is the Harvard Journal, whatever it is you repeatedly invoke the phrase "natural rights" or "natural law."
And, as I said at the outset, here is good natural law, if you will, and bad natural law in terms of informing the Constitution, and there is a whole new school of thought in America that would like very much to use natural law to lower the protections for individuals in the zone of personal privacy, and I will speak to those later, and who want to heighten the protection for businesses and corporations.
Now, one of those people is a Professor Mesito, a fine first-class scholar at Harvard University. Another is Mr. Epstein, a professor at the University of Chicago. And, in the speech you gave in 1987 to the Pacific Research Institute you said, and I quote: "I find attractive the arguments of scholars such as Stephen Mesito who defend an activist Supreme Court that would" -- not could, would -- "strike down laws restricting property rights."
My question is a very simple one, Judge. What exactly do you find attractive about the arguments of Professor Mesito and other scholars like him?
A. Senator, again, it has been quite some time since I have read Professor Mesito and others. That was, I believe, 1987 or 1988. My interest in the whole area was as a political philosophy. My interest was in reassessing and demonstrating a sense that we understood what our founding fathers were thinking when they used phrases such as "All men are created equal," and what that meant for our form of Government.
I found Mesito interesting and his arguments interesting, as I remembered. Again, it has been quite some time. But I don't believe that in my writings I have indicated that we should have an activist Supreme Court or that we should have any form of activism on the Supreme Court. Again, I found his arguments interesting, and I was not talking particularly of natural law, Mr. Chairman, in the context of adjudication.
Q. I am not quite sure I understand your answer, Judge. You indicated that you find the arguments -- not interesting -- attractive, and you explicitly say one of the things you find attractive -- I am quoting from you: "I find attractive the arguments of scholars such as Steven Mesito who defend an activist Supreme Court that would strike down laws resisting property rights." . . .
A. Well, let me clarify something. I think it is important, Mr. Chairman. As I indicated, I believe, or attempted to allude to in my confirmation to the Court of Appeals, I don't see a role for the use of natural law in constitutional adjudication. My interest in exploring natural law and natural rights was purely in the context of political theory. I was interested in that. There were debates that I had with individuals, and I pursued that on a part-time basis. I was an agency chairman.
 
Theorizing vs. Adjudication
 Q. Well, judge, in preparing for these hearings, some suggested that might be your answer. So I went back through some of your writings and speeches to see if I misread them. And, quite frankly, I find it hard to square your speeches, which I will discuss with you in a minute, with what you are telling me today.
Just let me read some of your quotes. In a speech before the Federalist Society at the University of Virginia, in a variation of that speech that you published in the Harvard Journal of Law and Policy, you praised the first Justice Harlan's opinion in Plessy v. Ferguson, and you said, "Implicit reliance on political first principles was implicit rather than explicit, as is generally appropriate for the Court's opinions. He gives us a foundation for interpreting not only cases involving race, but the entire Constitution in the scheme of protecting rights." You went on to say, "Harlan's opinion provides one of our best examples of natural law and higher law jurisprudence."
Then you say, "The higher law background of the American Government, whether explicitly appealed to or not, provides the only firm basis for a just and wise constitutional decision."
Judge, what I would like to know is, I find it hard to understand how you can say what you are now saying, that you were only talking about the philosophy in a general philosophic sense, and not how it informed or impacted upon constitutional interpretation.
A. Well, let me attempt to clarify. That, in fact, though, was my approach. I was interested in the political theory standpoint. I was not interested in constitutional adjudication. I was not at the time adjudicating cases. But with respect to the background, I think that we can both agree that the founders of our country, or at least some of the drafters of our Constitution and our Declaration, believed in natural rights. And my point was simply that in understanding overall our constitutional government, that it was important that we understood how they believed -- or what they believed in natural law or natural rights.
 
Restricting Property Rights
 Q. . . . You also said in that speech out at the Pacific Research Institute, you said, "I am far from being a scholar on Thomas Jefferson, but two of his statements suffice as a basis for restoring our original founding belief and reliance on natural law, and natural law, when applied to America, means not medieval stultification but the liberation of commerce."
You speak many times -- I won't bore you with them, but I have pages and pages of quotes where you talk about natural law not in the context of your grandfather, not in the context of race, not in the context of equality, but you talk about it in the context of commerce, just like it is talked in the context, that context, by Mesito and by Epstein and others in their various books, a new fervent area of scholarship that basically says, Hey, look, we, the modern-day court, has not taken enough time to protect people's property, the property rights of corporations, the property rights of individuals, the property rights of businesses.
And so what we have to do is we have to elevate the way we have treated protecting property. We have to elevate that to make it harder for governments to interfere with the ability of -- in the case of Epstein the ability to have zoning laws, the ability to have pollution laws, the ability to have laws that protect the public welfare.
Then you say in another place in one of your speeches, you say, Well, look, I think that property rights should be given -- let me find the exact quote -- "should be given the exact same protection as," you say, "economic rights are as protected as much as any other rights," in a speech to the American Bar Association."
Now, Judge, understand my confusion. Economic rights now are not protected as much as any other rights. They are not protected that way now. They are given -- if they pass a rational basis test, in effect, it is all right to restrict property. When you start to restrict things that have to do with privacy and thought process, then you have to have a much stricter test. And so you quote Mesito. You talk about the liberation of commerce and natural law, whatever you want to call it, natural law or not. And then you say economic rights -- and, by the way, you made that speech to the A.B.A. the day after you made the speech where you praised Mesito.
 Can you tell me, can you enlighten me on how this was just some sort of philosophic musing?
A. Well, that is exactly what it was. I was interested in exactly what I have said I was interested in. And I think I have indicated in my confirmation to the Court of Appeals that I did not see a role for the application of natural rights to constitutional adjudication, and I stand by that.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
Right to Abortion
 Q. Now, Judge, in your view, does the Liberty Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protect the right of women to decide for themselves in certain instances whether or not to terminate pregnancy?
A. Senator, first of all, let me look at that in the context other than with natural law principles.
Q. Let's forget about natural law for a minute.
A. My view is that there is a right to privacy in the Fourteenth Amendment.
Q. Well, Judge, does that right to privacy in the Liberty Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protect the right of a woman to decide for herself in certain instances whether or not to terminate a pregnancy?
A. Senator, I think that the Supreme Court has made clear that the issue of marital privacy is protected, that the State cannot infringe on that without a compelling interest, and the Supreme Court, of course, in the case of Roe v. Wade has found an interest in the woman's right to -- as a fundamental interest a woman's right to terminate a pregnancy. I do not think that at this time that I could maintain my impartiality as a member of the judiciary and comment on that specific case.
Q. . . . Now, let me ask you this: Where does the decision lie? Does it lie with the Court? For example, you quote, with admiration, Mr. Lehrman's article. Mr. Lehrman's article was on natural law and -- I forget the exact title here. Let me find it. "Natural Law and the Right to Life." And you say when you are speaking at a gathering that you think that that is a superb application of natural law. You say, "It is a splendid example of applying natural law." Now, what did you mean by that?
 A. Well, let me go back to, I guess, my first comment to you when we were discussing natural law -- I think that is important -- and then come back to the question of the due process analysis.
 The speech that I was giving there was before the Heritage Foundation. Again, as I indicated earlier, my interest was civil rights and slavery. What I was attempting to do in the beginning of that speech was to make clear to a conservative audience that blacks who were Republicans and the issues that affected blacks were being addressed and being dealt with by conservatives in what I considered a less-than-acceptable manner.
The second point that ----
Q. In what sense? In that they were not -- --
A. That they were not --
Q. ---- invoking natural law.
A. No. The second point that I wanted to make to them was that they had, based on what I thought was an appropriate approach, they had an obligation just as conservatives to be more open and more aggressive on civil rights enforcement. What I thought would be the best way to approach that would be using the underlying concept of our Constitution that we were all created equal.
I felt that conservatives would be skeptical about the notion of natural law. I was using that as the underlying approach. I felt that they would be conservative and that they would not -- or be skeptical about that concept. I was speaking in the Lou Lehrman Auditorium of the Heritage Foundation. I thought that if I demonstrated that one of their own accepted at least the concept of natural rights, that they would be more apt to accept that concept as an underlying principle for being more aggressive on civil rights. My whole interest was civil rights enforcement.

Questions By Senator Kennedy
 Q. Let me move to another subject area, and this is referring to an article about you in the Atlantic Monthly in 1987. You said that hiring disparities could be due to cultural differences between men and women. This is the article "A Question of Fairness," by Juan Williams.
That article states that you said that it could be that women are generally unprepared to do certain kinds of work by their own choice, it could be that women choose to have babies instead of going to medical school. Do you still think that that explains the underrepresentation of women in so many jobs in our economy today?
A. I think, and I think it is important to state this unequivocally, and I have said this unequivocally in speech after speech. There is discrimination. There is sex discrimination in our society. My only point in discussing statistics is that I don't think any of us can say that we have all the answers as to why there are statistical disparities. For example, if I sit here and I were to look at the statistics in this city, say with the example of number of blacks, I couldn't -- and compare the number of blacks that are on that side of the table, for example. I cannot automatically conclude that that is a result of discrimination. There could be other reasons that should be explored that aren't necessarily discriminatory reasons.
I am not justifying discrimination, nor would I shy away from it. But when we use statistics I think that we need to be careful with those disparities.
Q. . . . Let me just move on to your comments about Thomas Sowell, an author whose work you respect and many -- whose ideas you have stated that you agree with. Mr. Sowell wrote a book called the "Civil Rights Rhetoric: A Reality." You reviewed that book for the Lincoln Review in 1988 as part of a review of the works of Thomas Sowell, and in particular you praised Mr. Sowell's discussion, Chapter 5 of his book entitled "A Special Case of Women," and you called it a much needed antidote to cliches about women's earnings and professional status.
 Mr. Sowell explains that women are paid 59 percent of what men receive for the same work by saying that women are typically not educated as often in such highly paid fields as mathematics, science and engineering, nor attracted to physically taxing and well-paid fields, such as construction work, lumberjacking and coal mining, and the like.
As a matter of fact, there were no women employed in the coal mine industry in 1973. In 1980, after the Federal Government had begun an effort to enforce antidiscrimination laws, that 3300 women are working in coal mines.
Does that surprise you at all?
A. If there is discrimination, it doesn't surprise me. There were lots of places I think in our society. You know, I used to when I can remember in my own classrooms looking around and realizing that 7 or 8 of the top 10 students in my classroom in grammar school were the smartest students and wondering at that age, if 8 of the 10 of them are the brightest, then why aren't there women doctors and why aren't there women lawyers.
But the point that I was making with respect to Professor Sowell again is a statistical one. There is a difference between the problem that, say, a 16-year-old or 18- year-old minority kid, female, in this city or in Savannah or across the country, who has dropped out of high school, there is a difference between the problems of that child or that student than there is for someone who has a Ph.D. or someone who has a college degree.
 
Questions By Senator Hatch
 Q. When you are talking about natural law, you are talking about equality?
A. That all men are created equal, that is basic law.
Q. That is right, and you are talking that from the Declaration of Independence.
A. That is right.
Q. And you are saying that is why we needed the Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.
A. That was the most apparent and grossest contradiction in our society, that you had declaration declaring all of us to be equal, and yet the coexistence with that of slavery.
Q. . . . What I interpret you to be saying -- and maybe I am wrong, and you correct me if I am wrong -- is that when it comes to natural law and the Constitution, the Constitution takes preeminence.
A. The Constitution is our law, it is the law of our land. The natural law philosophy is a political theory, my interest was political theory, it was not constitutional law.
Q. So, when you become a Justice on the United States Supreme Court, and I believe you will, you intend to uphold the Constitution of the United States, is that correct?
A. With every fiber in my body.
Q. Above anything else?
A. My job is to uphold the Constitution of the United States, not personal philosophy or political theories. . . . I do not think the role of the Court is to have an agenda to say, for example, that you believe the Court should change the face of the earth.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q. Have you made up your mind, Judge Thomas, on how you will vote when abortion issues are before the Court as a Justice on the Court?
A. Senator, there is a lesson that I think we all learn when we become judges, and I think it happens to you after you have had your first case: that you walk in sometimes, even after you have read the briefs and you think you might have an answer. And you go to oral argument, and after oral arguments you think you might have an answer. . . .
And after you sit down and you attempt to write the opinion, you thought you had an answer, and you change your mind.
I think it is inappropriate for any judge who is worth his or her salt to prejudge any issue or to sit on a case in which he or she has such strong views that he or she cannot be impartial. And to think that as a judge that you are infallible I think totally undermines the process. You have to sit. You have to listen. You have to hear the arguments. You have to allow the adversarial process to think. You have to be open. And you have to be willing to work through the problem.
I don't sit on any issues, on any cases that I have prejudged. I think that it would totally undermine and compromise my capacity as a judge.

HEADLINE: Steeped in Past, Faith in Future For a Soviet Sect

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif., Sept. 8

 BODY:
Leonid Kalenyuk, a former coal miner from the Ukraine, finds in the current turmoil of the Soviet Union a confirmation of the apocalyptic prophecies that he says drove him from his country to join a community of Soviet immigrants here.
"This coup attempt was a warning to believers that they must leave while they can," said Mr. Kalenyuk, who is one of tens of thousands of Pentecostal Christians who have flooded into the United States from the Soviet Union over the past three years. 
 In growing numbers, the Pentecostal believers have gravitated to Sacramento, bringing with them the look and feel of rural Russia, as well as the stern traditions of their persecuted faith.
Mingling recently in the leafy courtyard of their biggest church, with its congregation of 1,500, the immigrants talked of prophecies of a brief period of freedom in the Soviet Union followed by a return to the repression of the past.
"The time of the prophecies has come, but it will be very brief, very brief," said Mr. Kalenyuk who, typically, arrived as part of an extended family. "We left as soon as we could because we know that when the time ends, the Soviet Union will become even worse than before."
 
A Prophet Came
 Viktor Konovalov, another former miner, told of a prophet who came to him in Soviet Kazakhstan 30 years ago and foretold a great exodus from the country. When tanks filled the streets of Moscow three weeks ago, he said, Pentecostals here gathered to pray for the man they call the instrument of these prophecies, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
Another immigrant, Grigory Krasnodensky, said: "We believe these events are God's will. The time of the Apocalypse that has been predicted has not yet come. But we believe that freedom will not last long in the Soviet Union, and that when the Apocalypse comes it will affect the whole world."
He said fellow believers in the Ukraine had sent word that the moment news of the coup attempt reached their village, neighbors had turned on them, saying: "Well, you see, your time has run out. You'll never leave now and you'll get what's coming to you."
Pavel Mishin, another recent arrival, said the prophecies were based on the Apocalyptic warnings of the Bible in the Book of Revelation, in which believers are urged to flee Babylon before it is consumed by plagues and fire.
Mr. Mishin said his father, who is with him here, had spent 18 years in labor camps for his religious practices in a country that until recently banned services in unregistered churches and forbade proselytizing and the religious schooling of children.
Pentecostal Christianity is a conservative evangelical denomination that stresses the gifts of the Holy Spirit, including prophecy and speaking in tongues. It was introduced into the Soviet Union from the United States in the 1920's, and its Soviet adherents soon became one of the most persecuted religious groups.
Kent Hill, executive director of the Institute on Religion and Democracy in Washington, said estimates of the religion's membership in the Soviet Union range from 200,000 to 600,000.
Until 1988, fewer than 150 had been permitted to leave, said Serge Duss, who worked for several years with Soviet refugees for World Relief, a Christian aid program. Among these were two families who became known as the Siberian Seven and took refuge in the basement of the United States Embassy in Moscow for five years until they received permission to leave the country in 1983.
Mr. Hill noted that the new, more permissive era in the Soviet Union had removed much of the rationale for admitting Pentecostals to the United States as refugees in imminent danger of persecution and that America's open door for them could be affected.
"The vast majority are not experiencing problems with freedom of religion," he said. "But everything indicates that isolated individuals are endangered or even murdered."
 
Why Sacramento?
 The first Pentecostals may have been attracted to Sacramento by the presence of a small number of Soviet Christian immigrants and by Paul Demetrus, a 75-year-old Pentecostal priest who said he has been broadcasting religious programs into the Soviet Union for the past 36 years.
Those first families sent word to others, and somehow it was this seed community in Sacramento, rather than others in upstate New York, Massachusetts, Oregon, Washington and Illinois, that took deepest root.
"We heard people saying: 'Go to Sacramento. There's a good life there,' " said Mr. Krasnodensky, who was a refrigeration mechanic in the Ukraine. "We didn't know anything about America. We didn't know about its climate or its geography. When they said to us that Sacramento is a good city with a good church, well, why not go there?"
As a result, the number of Pentecostals here has risen to as many as 5,000 of the 30,000 who have entered this country.
It has been impossible for the city, already struggling with growing unemployment, to digest this huge and sudden influx. Few of the immigrants speak English well, and most have been unable to find work and are on welfare, said Nadia Lokteff, who offers social services through the local branch of World Relief.
Wherever they settle around Sacramento, the Pentecostal immigrants re-establish the family or village groups of their homeland. The apartment buildings where they cluster are filled with the smells of cabbage and dill and the shouts of Russian-speaking children.
 
Hearts Still in Old World
 The church building, which the Pentecostals rent for Sunday afternoon services, is the heart of their community, providing its identity and cohesion. Its grounds take on an Old World look as men with shirts buttoned to the neck chat on benches and women with head scarves keep a careful eye on little girls with large bows in their hair.
More than 550 children attend Sunday classes at the church, and few have adopted the ways of their new homeland.
On one recent Sunday, two young immigrants who had met just three months ago were being married: Mikhail Nedoshkolsky, from the Donbass mining region of the Ukraine, and Nadezhda Kovalchuk, who arrived in the United States with the entire congregation of about 100 people from her village in Soviet Central Asia.
For the pastor who married them, Pyotr Tyukayenko, their union was a symbol of the urgent need to preserve the demanding culture that they had brought with them against the American way of life.
"You newlyweds will hear a great deal about family planning; that is a sin," the pastor said. "We already have our own program, God's program, and anyone who strays from that is criminally mistaken."
At the wedding feast that followed, with its loud music and loud declamation of poems, the atmosphere was heartily Russian. But the big plastic bottles of soft drinks and the extra-large American candy bars hinted at the temptations of American bounty.
As the bride and groom sat smiling out at them, few people at the feast seemed prepared to offer prophecies about their futures in America.
Mr. Konovalov, one of the first settlers here, told of his two-year struggle to transform himself from a Kazakhstan coal miner into an American businessman at the age of 50.
"First I took English as a second language, then keyboarding, formatting and computer information science," Mr. Konovalov said in Russian. "Then I took Business 8, Business 20, Business 60 and in the summer I took Accounting 1A and this semester I'm taking English 57."
He said he had no idea how he would be able use all this newfound knowledge in an economy that has offered few jobs to the Pentecostal immigrants. With a shrug, he said, "Maybe I'll sell Pepsi-Cola in Russia."

HEADLINE: Colleges, Seeking More Money, Try to Broaden Restricted Scholarships

BYLINE: By WILLIAM CELIS 3d

 BODY:
Colleges offer scholarships for academic superiority, for athletic prowess and, of course, for financial need. Then there are the types of scholarships awarded to people like Matthew J. Clinton.
Mr. Clinton, an 18-year-old freshman at Iowa State University, won his $1,000 scholarship this year partly because he is majoring in agriculture and his home is south of U.S. 30 in Iowa, a geographic restriction built into his scholarship by its donor. 
 "It was kind of weird, I thought," Mr. Clinton said. "But I didn't say anything."
 
A Scholarship for Murphys
 There are many other, even more peculiar stipulations in the awarding of scholarships that push financial aid officers to their wits' end. An Arizona State University scholarship was once reserved for students with one blue eye and one brown eye, until it was eliminated in a house-cleaning of unusual scholarships. But descendants of the Hugenots can still receive a $1,000 scholarship at Duke University. And at Harvard University, students with the last name Murphy are eligible for a scholarship.
"I must admit I consciously avoid looking at how many Murphys we have," said James S. Miller, director of financial aid at Harvard and Radcliffe. "Whenever someone mentions Murphy, our office blanches."
Even earning an average grade can be reason enough for a scholarship. The University of Oklahoma, for example, awards $1,000 scholarships to students who are deemed average -- a grade-point rating of about 2.0. "It's kind of embarrassing," said Charlotte Gay, a university spokeswoman. "We don't tell them they are getting this scholarship because they are average."
 
Loosening the Restrictions
 Many of these scholarships were established by alumni in the late 19th century or early 20th century and more recently by professional organizations and trade groups. They carry so many restrictions that they have become increasingly difficult to award. And many colleges and universities have sought to eliminate some of the more unusual scholarships, or at least to loosen the restrictions.
At the University of California at Berkeley, for example, a donor left a scholarship for a Jewish orphan interested in pursuing a career in aerospace sciences. But the university had such a difficult time awarding the scholarship that it petitioned the courts to change the donor's will to allow the university to broaden the pool of students eligible for the award.
"We don't have many of these kinds of scholarships left, thank heavens," said Patricia Stewart Harris, director of student financial services at the University of Texas at Austin. In recent years the university has been purging odd scholarships because "they are very difficult to administer," she said.
Thanks to Ms. Harris, gone from the roll of Texas scholarships is an award for students who finished first, second or third in spelling bees at Austin High School. Now the scholarship just goes to students from the high school who need financial help, regardless of their ability to spell.
 
A Very Limited Group
 Sometimes the scholarships carry so many stipulations that they restrict themselves out of existence. At Duke University, a scholarship for daughters of Episcopal naval chaplains who served in the Pacific in World War II disappeared from the scholarship roll in 1981 after 10 years of existence because there were no applicants.
At Iowa State, officials estimate that they recaptured $80,000 to $100,000 from unconventional scholarships for use in the school's general scholarship fund, a strategy used by other institutions. In general, the purging of such scholarships has not resulted in significant sums of additional, unrestricted scholarship money, several university financial aid officials said. But with tighter Federal student aid regulations and higher tuitions at many institutions, every bit of unrestricted scholarship money helps.
"In the last decade, most institutions have worked very diligently to address these scholarships," said Dallas Martin, president of the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators. "We have advised most schools to get broader-based criteria for their scholarships. Most donors seem to be amenable to that, but there still are a few out there."
Ryan Watje, for one, is grateful. Mr. Watje won the International Boar Semen Scholarship this year, a $500 award to study pig farming at Modesto Junior College in California.
"I didn't know there was a scholarship for swine management," said Mr. Watje, who grew up on a farm in Salinas, Calif., and has been raising pigs since he was 9. "My mom found out about it and told me about it."
 
Help for Overachievers
 At Marquette University there is scholarship money for Roman Catholic high school students from Arkansas and a one-year, $2,100 scholarship for a senior nursing school student who "was not expected to succeed but overcame great obstacles."
Paul McInerny, a Marquette spokesman, said the obstacles cited in the nursing school scholarship may be either academic or economic. "One could be a potential washout in any number of ways," he said, adding that recipients of this award are not told they were expected to fail.
Many of these scholarships rarely put much weight on academic prowess. "There are an awful lot of 'B' students," Mr. Martin said. "We can't all be Rhodes scholars."
Or poor, worthy women, for that matter. The University of Oklahoma administers a scholarship designated for such women. "Deciding who's worthy and who's not is not an easy task," said Mary Mowdy, assistant director of financial aid, who also oversees a scholarship for single Osage Indian men from Caddo County in west-central Oklahoma. Finding people to fill these scholarships, she adds, sometimes "gets pretty wild and crazy."
Karen Fooks, director of financial aid at the University of Florida, can attest to that. Despite a successful push to broaden restrictions of unconventional scholarships -- the one for "a poor boy who works in the dining hall" has been expanded to a student who works in food services -- she still must contend with an exotic scholarship every now and then.
This year, for example, two students at the university are recipients of a scholarship for the study of macrophytes, or marine plants large enough to be visible to the naked eye.
"I wouldn't know a student who is studying that if they walked through the door," Ms. Fooks said, with a hint of exasperation. "I don't even know what a macrophyte is."

HEADLINE: U.S. Posts Surplus on Trade Again

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 10

 BODY:
Record foreign sales and payments by allies in the Persian Gulf war helped the United States post its first back-to-back trade surpluses since 1982 in the first two quarters of the year, the Commerce Department said today.
The nation's surplus of trade with the rest of the world in goods, services and tourism was $2.97 billion in the April-June quarter, the department said, down from $10.5 billion in the first quarter but still in the black. 
 Not since the first and second quarters of 1982 has the country had two consecutive three-month periods when it recorded a surplus in its current account.
 
Expected to Worsen
 The current account is the country's most significant trade measure because it includes not simply trade in merchandise but also services and investment flows between nations.
Analysts cautioned that the balance would worsen later in the year because the foreign cash would dry up and consumer demand for imported products would revive as the economy strengthened.
"We view this as the best it's going to get, and it likely will deteriorate fairly sharply in the third and fourth quarters," said Chris Varvares, an economist with the St. Louis-based forecaster Laurence Meyer & Associates.
War-related cash payments to the Treasury from foreign governments in the Middle East and elsewhere had the biggest impact on trade, although they were far lower in the second quarter than the first.
The deficit for all of 1990 was $92.1 billion. This year's deficit is expected to be less than half that, thanks to stronger exports and the war contributions -- $41 billion in the first 10 months of the current fiscal year, which began last Oct. 1.
 
Recession Hurt Imports
 Another factor in the surplus is that the recession also suppressed Americans' appetites for foreign-made goods like Japanese cars and televisions, further aid to the trade balance.
Foreign sales were a record $104.11 billion between April and June, up from $100.9 billion in the first quarter. As a result, the merchandise trade deficit shrank to $15.62 billion, from $18.39 billion in the first three months of 1991.
The trade deficit with the rest of the world shot to record levels during the booming 1980's, causing billions of dollars to be sent overeas to pay for imported goods. The money came back in the form of foreign investment, which also had the effect of transforming the country into the world's largest debtor.

HEADLINE: With Tearful Nod to a Tired Aide, Dinkins Puts Off a Trip to Africa

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
What was planned as a triumphal pilgrimage to his roots has turned into disappointment for Mayor David N. Dinkins. He announced yesterday that he would postpone his scheduled trip to South Africa because his chief aide had been too busy with turmoil in New York to raise the needed money.
His eyes welling with tears, Mr. Dinkins paused repeatedly at a City Hall news conference to compose himself as he praised the aide, Deputy Mayor Bill Lynch, for his efforts to calm the recent racial tension in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. That tireless work, the Mayor said, left Mr. Lynch unable to raise the $400,000 to $500,000 in private contributions needed for the trip in time for the planned departure on Monday.
"We intend to go," Mr. Dinkins said. "We just can't go now."
 
Difficult Moment
 The scene in the Blue Room was an excruciating political moment for the Mayor. That he was forced to defer yet another of his dreams as the city's first black mayor crystallized just how alone he sometimes is, and how dependent on Mr. Lynch. It also echoed the organizational and fiscal problems that have plagued his administration, even as his plans for going had drawn criticism from some New Yorkers who said he had enough problems in his own backyard. 
 The Mayor defended his goal of taking a delegation of several dozen city officials and business people with him on a charter flight, saying it would foster economic ties with struggling South African blacks. He also defended his effort to raise the money from private individuals and corporations, an effort that some civic groups had questioned. He repeatedly said that his first duty was to run the city, and that he would not have had Mr. Lynch spend more time arranging the trip and less time dealing with Crown Heights.
But underscoring the Mayor's distress was a more personal concern: his apparent realization that his longtime alter ego, Mr. Lynch, had been overworked to the point of exhaustion, and not for the first time.
"I get a little emotional when I talk about Bill Lynch," the Mayor said. "He works like hell."
Mr. Lynch, who routinely works 15-hour days and has diabetes, underwent laser surgery last week for recurring vision problems. He has told friends that the condition could lead to blindness if he does not take better care of himself. Some of them had urged him not to make the trip.
"With the particular problem I have, that is always a problem," Mr. Lynch acknowledged yesterday. "I'm not stupid. I've just got to get my weight under control and my diet back in place, and I assume that with the pressures of the last few weeks, things just got out of kilter. It has had an effect on my focus, that's for sure."
Other mayoral aides said Mr. Dinkins would be very reluctant to make the trip without Mr. Lynch, but Mr. Lynch said that that was not an issue.
Mr. Lynch is officially the Deputy Mayor for Intergovernmental Affairs, but he has actually functioned as Mr. Dinkins's deputy-for-almost-everything since 1986, when Mr. Dinkins was the Manhattan Borough President. In that job and the ones that followed, first as a top mayoral campaign aide and now as Deputy Mayor, the most persistent plaint about Mr. Lynch has been that he tries to do too much.
Other mayoral aides said that the emotion the Mayor expressed at his news conference yesterday was a testament to his singular bond with Mr. Lynch. "It's symbiosis with a capital 's,' said the Mayor's press secretary, Leland T. Jones.
 
Large Contingent Planned
 The collapse of the trip was also a testament to Mr. Lynch's and the Mayor's grand ambitions for it. Both men acknowledged that they could have originally planned a quick trip with only a handful of aides. But they said they wanted to make it more than a ceremonial visit, so they had planned to take a large delegation of people who could advise South African blacks. In addition to business representatives and the Mayor's wife, Joyce Dinkins, those invited included the president of the Board of Education, the Chancellor of the City University of New York, the city's Finance Commissioner and members of the clergy.
To cover the most ground as quickly as possible, the group had planned to take a charter flight, although commercial flights would have cost less. To avoid repeated refueling stops that a smaller plane would require, they had planned to charter a Lockheed L10-11, which seats about 300 people. Mr. Lynch said the cost of the trip primarily reflected the fixed cost of the plane and not the number of people who would have gone.
Last night, Mr. Dinkins spoke by telephone to Nelson Mandela, the president of the African National Congress. Mr. Mandela was to have been the Mayor's host in South Africa. Recounting the conversation, a spokeswoman for the Mayor, Ruby Ryles, said Mr. Dinkins had expressed regret at the postponement and had pledged to make the trip as soon as possible. Mr. Mandela, who was Mr. Dinkins's guest at Gracie Mansion last year, assured him that the return invitation was open-ended, Ms. Ryles said. The Mayor had also planned to stop for a papal audience at the Vatican on the way and to meet with Nigerian officials on his return trip.
The Mayor said he hoped black New Yorkers would understand why he could not make this trip now, and he rejected comparisons with his 48-hour trip to Israel during the Persian Gulf war. That trip angered some blacks, who questioned why he had not gone to Africa first. The trip to Israel, he said, was financed completely by the Jewish Community Ruling Council of New York, a civic group.
Mr. Lynch said that since word of the current fund-raising difficulties began to circulate last week, more contributors had expressed interest. But he said that by yesterday only about $200,000 had been committed, forcing him to tell the Mayor that he would simply have to wait. Mr. Dinkins said he had never considered advancing the money for the trip out of city funds in the hope that the money could be replaced later with private donations.
But the Mayor defended as perfectly proper the administration's private fund raising and said it would continue. The vehicle for such fund raising has been the New York City Business Assistance Corporation, a nonprofit, city-run entity that raised money for the tickertape parade for veterans of the Persian Gulf war in June and for Mr. Dinkins's "Urban Summit" of big city mayors last year. Many corporations made contributions to the parade.
 
Donors Not Identified
 The City Charter bars officials from taking gifts from parties that do business with the city. The city's Conflicts of Interest Board ruled that soliciting money for the meeting of big-city mayors did not pose a conflict. But the administration did not seek a ruling for the South Africa trip, and while pledging to make the names of donors public eventually, it had not done so. Some private citizens who planned to make the trip had said that they would pay their own way.
Gene Russianoff, a senior lawyer with the New York Public Interest Research Group, said he sympathized with the Mayor. "He's damned if he uses public funds and open to criticism if he raises private funds," he said. Mr. Russianoff said the Mayor should try to raise money for the trip from foundations or nonprofit groups and set up a citizens committee to make the solicitations instead of having city officials do it directly.
Among those looking forward to the trip there was keen disappointment, but also understanding.
"I'm disappointed, but I'm not terribly surprised," said the Rev. Herbert Daughtry, pastor of the House of the Lord Pentecostal Church in Brooklyn. "Whenever people would ask me about the trip, I'd say, 'I hope we'll be able to leave.' But I always felt there was a possibility it would not come off. The situation in New York is just so troubled. From day to day you just never know what's going to happen."

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about Mayor David N. Dinkins's postponement of his trip to South Africa misidentified the group that financed his trip to Israel during the Persian Gulf war. It was the American-Israel Friendship League. The Jewish Community Relations Council of New York only extended the invitation.

HEADLINE: THE THOMAS HEARINGS;
THOMAS DECLINES REQUESTS BY PANEL FOR ABORTION VIEW

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 10

 BODY:
Judge Clarence Thomas, President Bush's choice to succeed Thurgood Marshall on the Supreme Court, said today that he believed Americans had a constitutional right to privacy. But he declined to tell the Senate Judiciary Committee whether he believed that the Constitution provided for a right to an abortion.
Judge Thomas's remarks came in the committee's first day of hearings on his nomination to the High Court. In their opening statements and initial questioning, several Senators indicated that they intended to challenge the judge on a series of comments and writings that opponents have assailed as demonstrating a hard-edged conservative outlook. [Excerpts from the hearings, page A22.] 
 Many opponents of Judge Thomas's nomination are concerned that he will join the increasingly conservative faction on the Court that has signaled its willingness to permit sharp restrictions on abortion.
 
Childhood Poverty Recalled
 Judge Thomas, who sits on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, began his testimony with an opening statement that dwelt on his childhood of extreme poverty in Georgia and how his grandfather and a group of Roman Catholic nuns instilled in him a sense that hard work would create opportunities for him.
"My grandparents grew up and lived their lives in an era of blatant segregation and overt discrimination," he said. His mother, who made only $10 a week as a maid, was forced to send him and his brother to live with their grandfather, each carrying everything they owned in shopping bags. Judge Thomas choked up and seemed close to tears when he recalled how his grandfather was humiliated and called "boy" in front of him.
 
Inherent Human Rights
 But after that statement Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., a Delaware Democrat who is the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, moved quickly to change the focus of the hearings away from what the committee members said was the judge's affecting story.
Senator Biden engaged Judge Thomas in a sharp colloquy about statements the judge had made, one of which suggested that he favored banning abortion as a violation of natural law, the philosophical tenet that there are inherent human rights that transcend written law.
It was in response to Senator Biden's question that Judge Thomas said that a right of privacy could be found in the 14th Amendment to the Constitution.
He seemed to endorse the Supreme Court's 1965 opinion in Griswold v. Connecticut, a ruling that struck down a state law banning the use of contraceptives by married couples. In 1987, criticism of the Griswold ruling by Robert H. Bork, then a Federal appellate judge and a nominee to the Supreme Court, was a strong element in the Senate's rejection of his nomination.
But Judge Thomas said he would not comment directly on Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court opinion that established a woman's right to abortion based on a constitutional right to privacy.
"I do not think that at this time that I could maintain my impartiality as a member of the judiciary and comment on that specific case," he told Senator Biden.
The Roe v. Wade ruling has been widely assailed by conservatives, and the Republican Party platform calls for the appointment of judges who would favor overturning the ruling. In recent years, as President Ronald Reagan and then Mr. Bush have named more members of the Court, the Justices have shown a willingness to trim back the protections of abortion rights provided under Roe v. Wade.
But later in the hearing, under questioning from Senator Orrin G. Hatch, a Utah Republican who is an ardent supporter of Judge Thomas, the nominee said he would have no private agenda on the issue of abortion if he joined the Supreme Court.
He said that as a Federal appellate court judge for nearly two years, he has found that sometimes he thinks he has reached a decision after reading the record of a case only to find his mind can be changed after oral arguments, or even when he sits down to write an opinion.
"No judge worth his or her salt will prejudge a case," he said. "You have to sit to listen, to hear the arguments and allow the adversarial process to go forward. I don't sit on any cases I have prejudged."
In taking such a position, Judge Thomas emulated the approach taken last year by Mr. Bush's first Supreme Court nominee, David H. Souter, who also was a Federal appeals court judge at the time. Judge Souter resolutely refused to even hint at his approach to the issue of abortion, and went on to an easy confirmation.
 
Higher Standard of Specificity
 Judge Thomas's White House strategists have said the committee and the Senate as a whole will not be able to hold him to a higher standard of specificity than they did with Judge Souter.
But some committee members suggested today they would be more demanding of Judge Thomas and would not tolerate a similar response. The mood on the committee, especially among Democrats, seemed more contentious than the White House had anticipated.
Senator Patrick J. Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, complained today about the responses of Judge Souter and others.
"Let me make this clear, Judge Thomas, in recent years we have danced around the question of where nominees stand on a woman's fundamental right to abortion," he said. "This is one of the burning social issues of our time."
The Senator added: "It is the single issue about which this committee and the American people most urgently wish to know the nominee's views, and yet the Senate and the nation have been frustrated by polite, respectful stonewalling."
Under questioning, Judge Thomas dismissed as insignificant a statement he made in 1987 that opponents have said demonstrates he is opposed to abortion. In a speech that year Judge Thomas briefly but pointedly praised an article that cast abortion as immoral and a violation of natural law.
Today, however, he described his praise of the article by Lewis Lehrman, a New York businessman and patron of conservative causes, as "a throwaway line." By praising the article before an audience of conservatives, he said, he thought he could persuade them that natural law was an admirable concept that should be used to press civil rights enforcement more vigorously.
 
'Aggressive on Civil Rights'
 "I felt they would be skeptical about the concept of natural law," he said of his conservative audience. "I was speaking in the Lew Lehrman Auditorium of the Heritage Foundation, and I thought if I demonstrated that one of their own accepted at least the concept of natural rights they would be more apt to accept that concept as an underlying principle for being more aggressive on civil rights."
He also stressed several times that his interest in natural law was only as a political philosophy, not as a basis for deciding constitutional issues.
In responding to Senator Biden's question, Judge Thomas also made a point to mention his grandfather and mother several times. Part of the White House strategy in the hearings is for Judge Thomas to talk as much as possible about his rise from poverty.
Even so, Mr. Biden said he had difficult understanding Judge Thomas's explanation. Later in the hearings, under questioning from Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, Judge Thomas explicitly repudiated the Lehrman article.
"I do not agree with the article," he said. "I did not endorse it and I do not now endorse it."
The judge was also questioned closely about having told a conservative audience in 1987 that he found "attractive" the idea of an activist Supreme Court that would strike down laws restricting property rights. Such a notion has been pressed by a small group of free-market scholars as an extension of natural law and natural rights.
Judge Thomas said it had been a long time since he made those remarks, and he described his interest in such an exotic theory as part of his interest in natural rights "from a political theory standpoint and as a part-time political theorist. I was not a law professor." He said they had nothing to do with his views about how judges should make decisions.
Once again, under subsequent questioning from Senator Hatch, Judge Thomas explicitly repudiated the significance of his earlier remarks and said that as a justice he would not use those theories to be part of an activist Court to protect economic rights, as those scholars had suggested.
 
Alone at the Witness Table
 Judge Thomas spoke while sitting alone at a green-baize covered table in the Senate Caucus Room, an ornate chamber that has been used over the years for special hearings, including the Watergate hearings in 1973 and the Bork hearings in 1987. He fingered a pack of mints as he responded, and did not refer to notes.
Sitting behind Judge Thomas were his mother, Leola Williams; his sister, Emma Mae Martin; his wife, Virginia Lamp, and his son, Jamal, from a previous marriage. Senator Biden joked that the 17-year-old Jamal looked so much like his father that he could take his place at the witness table and few would notice the difference.
Judge Thomas, who was born in Georgia, worked in Missouri and now lives in Virginia, was introduced to the committee by the six Senators from those states. Of the Democrats in that group, Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia was effusive in his praise and in endorsing Judge Thomas. The junior Senator from Georgia, Wyche Fowler Jr., also praised Judge Thomas but stopped short of an endorsement. Another Democrat, Senator Charles S. Robb of Virginia, explicitly withheld any judgment on whether Judge Thomas should be confirmed.
The warmest praise came from Senator John C. Danforth, a Missouri Republican who is the judge's principal patron in the Senate. Senator Danforth said that in Judge Thomas's eight-year tenure at the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission he made the agency one of the most respected in the Federal Government.
Later in the hearings the judge is expected to face critical questioning about his tenure as head of the commission, especially from Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, an Ohio Democrat who was the only committee member to vote against his confirmation as an appellate court judge.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Adweek Plans Overhaul as a Sign It Is Alive and Well

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
AMID rising speculation about its fate, Adweek is about to get a new look. The nation's second-largest advertising-trade publication, intent on persuading readers and advertisers that it will be sticking around, will include in its ambitious overhaul new and expanded columns and features.
The changes, effective with the issues of Adweek's six regional editions due out on Monday, come as advertising and media executives have been watching the weekly with the morbid curiosity typically devoted to an agency that is losing its largest clients. 
 Adweek has suffered from a severe slump in ad pages this year and rising competition from Advertising Age and Inside Media. This has provoked talk that Adweek has been put up for sale by its owner, the BPI Communications subsidiary of Affiliated Publications Inc., or that one or both of Adweek's sibling publications, Adweek's Marketing Week and Mediaweek, will be closed.
The changes are meant to signal that such talk is untrue, John Babcock Jr., president of BPI's publications group, said in an interview yesterday at Adweek's office in Manhattan. "We're fully behind A/S/M," Mr. Babcock said, referring to Adweek's immediate parent, A/S/M Communications, acquired last year by BPI, which also publishes American Film, Billboard and The Hollywood Reporter.
"We're going to take over the No. 1 position," he added. "I can't tell you when, but we'll do it."
The editorial revamping reflects that "Adweek has grown up" in the 12 years since a group of regional publications merged to form Adweek, said Craig Reiss, who was named A/S/M's editor in chief in April. "No longer is it trying to claw its way into the market."
Mr. Reiss provided a preview of the redesign, which was created by Adweek's design consultant, WBMG Inc. Adweek's giant red front-page logo is unchanged, but inside there will be a fresher, more contemporary layout reminiscent of Business Week's; more variety in the appearance of news pages, and more space for features like Barbara Lippert's "Adweek Critique."
"I thought it was very exciting," said James R. Guthrie, executive vice president of marketing development at the Magazine Publishers of America in New York. It conveys "more urgency," he added, "more of a 'pick-me-up' feeling." Mr. Guthrie was among a small group of media executives who were given an advance look at the changes recently.
Asked if his association would advertise in the new Adweek, Mr. Guthrie answered yes. "Ad Age does very important, comprehensive and responsible coverage," he said, while Adweek's niche is "a kind of hotter journalism."
The Ad Age battle with Adweek has waxed and waned for a decade. In the booming mid-80's -- when Mr. Reiss was New York bureau chief of Ad Age and this columnist was deputy bureau chief -- industry executives characterized Adweek as a "hot book," a Pepsi-Cola of ad-trade publications, to Ad Age's "Bible of the industry" position, a Coca-Cola image.
But while the recession has taken the fizz from both publications' ad results, Adweek has been hit harder. According to figures compiled by the Media Industry Newsletter, Ad Age's ad pages fell 19.1 percent in the first six months of this year, to 1,054.7, while Adweek's fell 39.5 percent, to 392.5.
Also, ad pages for Adweek's Marketing Week, aimed at marketing executives at agencies and consumer-product companies, dropped 39.4 percent, to 378.8. Mediaweek, introduced in January to reach media decision-makers at agencies, carried 229.4 ad pages; Inside Media, a biweekly aimed at a similar audience, carried 292.8 pages, up 2.8 percent.
At Ad Age, "We intend to do what we've been doing all along," said Edward R. Erhardt, associate publisher and advertising director in New York, "to further distance ourselves from the rest of the ad-trade press."
At Inside Media, "Business looks good in a tough year; knock wood," said the publisher, Ellen Flahive-McIntyre, who also once worked for Ad Age.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Advances Overseas But Eases in U.S. Trading

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose abroad but ended lower in American trading yesterday, weakened by recurrent expectations of cuts in domestic interest rates.
The United States currency's underlying trend has been weaker, because of trader expectations that the Federal Reserve will ease lending rates to stimulate the economy. Such a move would reduce the dollar's value worldwide, and foreign investors would seek currencies that offer higher yields. 
 Late in the New York session, a series of trades sent the dollar skidding against the German mark after the United States currency had risen overseas. The trades came after the dollar exceeded 170 marks, a level many traders consider too high under economic conditions, said Stephen Flanagan, vice president of Mitsubishi Bank Ltd.
In New York, the dollar fell to 1.6875 German marks, down from 1.6935 late Tuesday. In late European trading, the dollar closed at 1.6965 German marks, up from 1.6945.
Mr. Flanagan said dealers were selling dollars in advance of the August producer price report, scheduled for release today, and the August retail sales figures, due out tomorrow. Both reports are expected to offer fresh insight on the economy's health and inflationary trends.
"I think a very weak retail sales report would give strength to the argument that the Fed plans to go ahead and cut rates," said Earl Johnson, a vice president at Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.02 yen, to a closing 134.77 yen. Later, the dollar was quoted at 135.35 yen in London. At closing in New York, the dollar closed at 134.65 yen, down from 134.75 late Tuesday.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.7255, from $1.7298 late Tuesday. In New York, sterling cost $1.7345, more expensive than $1.7295 late Tuesday.
Other late New York dollar quotes, compared with Tuesday's prices, included: 1.4775 Swiss francs, down from 1.4805; 5.7405 French francs, down from 5.7610; 1,263.00 Italian lire, down from 1,267.50, and 1.13725 Canadian dollars, down from 1.13995.

HEADLINE: American Airlines Reins In Growth

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
Robert L. Crandall, chairman and president of American Airlines and long a prophet of growth, said yesterday that the nation's largest airline would substantially cut its capital spending over the next several years, including purchases of some new airplanes, because of uncertain profits.
"Unfortunately, while the growth has been helpful, profits simply aren't what they need to be," Mr. Crandall told a gathering of airline stock analysts at a meeting in New York. "As a consequence, although we think we have positioned ourselves very well for the future, we've decided to reduce our capital spending substantially during the next couple of years until we see a correction of some of the things which are preventing us from earning satisfactory returns." 
 Already, he said, the airline has found $500 million in cuts from its five-year growth plan and the amount of the cuts will grow when decisions are made to postpone or abandon some aircraft orders.
American, a subsidiary of the AMR Corporation, had planned to spend $21 billion over the next five years, with $14.9 billion allotted to buy airplanes.
The shift in strategy could have an impact on consumers, because American may begin to concentrate on maximizing its return on its existing routes rather than using promotional fares to open up new markets. Mr. Crandall emphasized the need for carriers to stop eroding their fare structures.
It could also give weaker carriers like Continental, which is seeking to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code, a little more breathing room as American tones down its competitive drive.
Mr. Crandall blamed weak carriers like Midway, America West and Continental for eroding fares and making it difficult for the industry to get a decent return.
"Much -- indeed most -- of our problems can be attributed to managements who seem to believe their mission in life is to put every living human being on an airplane at any price and who have failed to do their economic homework on subjects such as price elasticity," he said. "This get-em-on-the-plane-mentality is exacerbated by the fact that more than 25 percent of our industry's capacity is being operated by bankrupt and near-bankrupt carriers."
The Persian Gulf crisis also rattled the airline industry, doubling fuel prices while traffic plunged because of terrorism. American, for example, had a net loss of $185.3 million in the first six months of this year, compared with a profit of $109.9 million in the first half of 1990. Still, revenues were up slightly, to $5.96 billion, from $5.66 billion a year earlier.
American's slowdown in growth will not be felt significantly for a few years. The airline still plans to take delivery of 84 new planes this year, raising its total fleet to 618 planes. In 1992 Mr. Crandall said, it plans to add another 82 new jets and retire only 22 airplanes, thereby increasing its capacity by 16 percent.
 
'Prudent and Positive Move'
 Analysts and investors generally seemed to approve of reining in the fast-paced style set by Mr. Crandall in the last five years.
"I think its a prudent and positive move on the part of American's management," said Julius Maldutis, an airline analyst at Salomon Brothers.
AMR's shares jumped $3.125 to close at $59 in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
For American, there is the risk that other carriers like United Airlines and Delta Air Lines may continue their own expansion drives in the face of American's cutbacks and thus take the intitiative away from American in some important markets.
Larry Nagin, the vice president of corporate affairs at United, said the airline would have no comment on Mr. Crandall's speech. United and American have been locked in a fierce competitive battle over their hub at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago. United still dominates the Chicago hub, but American has been growing rapidly.
United has taken a conservative approach to expansion. It is taking delivery of far fewer airplanes this year and next year than American.
 
No Changes at Delta
 Neil Monroe, manager of public relations for Delta, said that Delta was also following a conservative growth plan and that it planned no changes.
Mr. Crandall is moving to slow down growth at a time when American has emerged as a very powerful airline, having surpassed United as the largest domestic carrier.
On the international front, American bought the London routes from Trans World Airlines and began to operate them in July. So far, American's planes have been unusually full, flying with about 85 percent of their seats occupied last month.
American also bought the Latin American routes from the defunct Eastern Airlines, and it expects to have 181 weekly flights to Central and South America. Mr. Crandall said the routes were becoming increasingly profitable.
 
Much Lower Pay Scales
 As the airline grew, most of its new employees were hired at much lower pay scales than before, thereby reducing the carrier's labor costs substantially. The lower pay scales went into effect in 1983 when American had 42,500 workers, just before it began its expansion drive.
Of its current 92,800 workers, more than half are on the lower pay scale. American has also built up its hubs in Dallas-Fort Worth, Chicago and Raleigh-Durham, N.C., and has established a strong nationwide route network to compete with United.

HEADLINE: Tenneco Plans Asset Sales And Cuts Dividend in Half

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Sept. 11

 BODY:
Staggered by deepening troubles at its J. I. Case farm- and construction-equipment unit, Tenneco Inc. said today that it planned to sell assets valued at $1.05 billion and that it would report a substantial loss for the second half of the year.
The company also said it would slash its yearly dividend in half, to $1.60 a share, saving $200 million a year. The actions provided a hint of additional cutbacks and asset sales that Wall Street analysts hope to see from Tenneco's designated leader, Michael H. Walsh. 
 After the announcements, Tenneco's shares fell $2.125, to $40.50. With 2.3 million shares traded, it was the fourth-most-active Big Board issue.
Mr. Walsh, who cut bureaucracy and recovered lost market share as chief executive of the Union Pacific Railroad, announced the plan to analysts in New York today even though he will not take the reins as chief executive until January.
At the meeting, he pledged to do "whatever is necessary" to improve Tenneco's financial results, said analysts who attended. "He's starting off pretty aggressively," said David N. Fleischer of Prudential Securities in New York.
Mr. Walsh had been expected to take the president's position, which was vacant, on Oct. 1, but the appointment was rushed ahead to Tuesday so he could speak for the company today. Last month, Mr. Walsh, 49 years old, was also named to succeed James L. Ketelsen, 60, who will retire in May after 14 years as chairman and cheif executive. At that time, Mr. Walsh will also assume the chairmanship.
Case, one of Tenneco's six unrelated businesses, has been Mr. Ketelsen's albatross. The unit lost money in 5 of the last 10 years, generating a loss of $209 million during the period, and could lose $1 billion this year, analysts said.
 
Corporate Dinosaurs
 One of few remaining conglomerates in an era of narrowly focused corporate operations, Tenneco also has operations in natural-gas transmission, shipbuilding, automotive products, packaging and chemicals. Formed in 1943 as the Tennessee Gas and Transmission Company, Tenneco sold its oil and gas production operations and reserves for $7.3 billion to 10 separate bidders in 1988.
Conglomerates have faded because executives are hard pressed to stay on top of fast-changing conditions in unrelated industries, global competition has stiffened and Wall Street rarely gives full market value to conglomerate assets, said Walter D. Scott, a management professor at the Kellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern University.
As Tenneco's biggest unit, Case contributed 37 percent of corporate sales last year, which amounted to $14.5 billion. A money-maker the previous two years, Case saw its troubles return in the first half of the year, losing $270 million. Analysts said operating losses for the year will probably exceed $500 million. Also, write-offs suggested by Mr. Walsh could amount to another $500 million in losses.
Mr. Ketelsen, applauded in many circles for his aggressive programs to promote women to top management and as an advocate of corporate fitness programs, had in recent years defended the diversification as a bulwark against falling earnings during recession. Tenneco lost $13 million in the first half of this year.
Mr. Ketelsen introduced Mr. Walsh to the analysts today, then let him do the talking about the steeper loss, asset sales and cost-cutting.
 
Selling 'Non-Core' Assets
 In a statement from Tenneco's headquarters in Houston, Mr. Ketelsen and Mr. Walsh said the company would sell what they described as "non-core" assets valued at $500 million by the end of year.
The auction is to include a plant under construction since May in La Porte, Tex., that is designed to produce at least 12,500 barrels a day of an essential component for cleaner-burning gasoline. Refiners could face a shortage of that component, methyl tertiary butyl ether, under tougher Federal antipollution laws effective next year.
Other businesses on the block include a lubrication unit owned by Case, certain timberlands, three short-line railroads that are linked to packaging plants and Tenneco's gold mining operations. The company plans to sell another $550 million of assets by the end of the year that it did not identify.
Executives said Tenneco would move quickly to reduce yearly costs across the corporation by at least $250 million and that capital spending for 1992 would be pared by at least $250 million, a cut of about 25 percent from the earlier budget for next year.
In spite of the loss, J. I. Case is expected to generate a positive cash flow for the year. Production cuts and deep price cuts have reduced the division's bulging inventories, analysts said. Production will be crimped further to assure Case's long-term competitive position, the company said.
"What we're seeing is an accelerated timetable for events that had a high probability of occurring" at Tenneco, said Eli S. Lustgarten, machinery analyst at Paine Webber. "They have a lot of pain to go through."

HEADLINE: SOVIET TURMOIL;
Soviet Move Could Heighten Pressure for Change in Cuba

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, Sept. 11

 BODY:
The Soviet decision to withdraw its troops from Cuba and end its economic subsidy of the Cuban economy constitutes a powerful shock to the morale of the island's Communist establishment and may intensify pressures for radical change, experts in Cuban affairs said today.
Since the tensest period of Soviet-American cold war jostling over Cuba in the 1960's, Soviet forces have played only a symbolic role in the defense of the island. The Cuban armed forces are estimated to include 180,500 men and woman on active duty and 130,000 reserves out of a total population of more than 10 million. 
 But experts say the Cuban military has continued to rely heavily on Moscow for everything from training and technical support to intelligence and weaponry.
"The people in the general staff command of the Cuban military, most of whom are trained in the Soviet Union, are left wondering, 'What kind of impact is this going to have on us?' " said Christopher Barton, an expert on the Cuban military at the Center for National Security Law at the University of Virginia. "Some of them who have seen what is happening elsewhere in the world will probably begin to say, 'When are we going to start making changes in our society?' "
 
Economic Support Declines
 The direct economic impact of the withdrawal is difficult to gauge, for it is unclear whether the Soviet Union pays Cuba for garrisoning its troops there. But the Soviet force provides jobs to Cubans, either directly or through off-base establishments that cater to the Soviet soldiers.
But an end to subsidized Soviet purchases of Cuban commodities undoubtedly would have dire consequences for the Cuban economy.
"Already the Soviets have cut their subsidized payments from about 40 cents a pound to 25 cents a pound" for Cuban sugar, said Carmelo Mesa-Lago, a professor of economics at the University of Pittsburgh, The current world market price is 9.4 cents a pound.
"An end to subsidies would be like losing 5 percent of the gross social product overnight," Mr. Mesa-Lago said. "It would create incredible problems that would be extremely difficult to surmount."
Cuba has already been hard hit in recent months by a sharp decline in Soviet economic support. For three decades, Soviet governments have supplied more than three-quarters of all of Cuba's imports, including the bulk of its oil. Cuban exports of sugar, tobacco, nickel and citrus to the Soviet Union have never come close to balancing the flow of Soviet goods in the other direction.
In recent weeks, as the list of stringently rationed goods has swollen, new limits have been placed on the consumption of everyday items like tobacco, gasoline, vegetable oil and cooking fuels.
But even as the changing international environment has made life dramatically more difficult for his country, President Fidel Castro has vowed to resist moves to a market economy and political pluralism that could help reinsert Cuba in the world economy.
"The screw will become tighter and tighter now, and something is going to give sooner rather than later," Mr. Barton said. Using the exclamation with which Mr. Castro caps many of his speeches, he added, "You just can't eat the phrase 'Socialism or Death.' "
In a bid to avoid an economic collapse brought on by an oil shortage, Havana has reportedly been paying the Soviet Union in hard currency for the help of about 1,000 technicians building two nuclear power reactors near Cienfuegos, on the southern coast of the island. Experts said it was unclear if the work of these technicians would be affected by changes in the two countries' relations.
Experts said it was also unclear whether the Soviet decision to withdraw its troops would affect a major Soviet-run intelligence center at Lourdes, southwest of Havana. The listening post has been used to monitor air traffic, submarine movements and a variety of electronic communications in the southern United States.
"The next key question will be what interest the Soviets have in maintaining a facility like that in the new context of Soviet-American relations," a United States official said.
But analysts of Cuban affairs said that the Soviet announcement would further complicate the Cuban leadership's management of its growing economic and political crisis.

HEADLINE: CONSUMER RATES;
Money-Fund Yields Show Mixed Changes in Week

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH M. FOWLER

 BODY:
Yields of tax-free money market funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report rose in the week ended yesterday, while yields of taxable funds were mixed.
The average seven-day compound yield of tax-exempt funds was 4.20 percent in the week, while the simple yield was 4.12 percent. Both yields were up 1 basis point, or hundredth of a point, from the week before. 
 The average 30-day compound yield of tax-free funds was 4.15 percent, up from 4.11 percent the previous week, and the average 30-day simple yield was 4.07 percent, up from 4.02 percent.
 
Rise in Assets
 Total assets of the tax-exempt funds rose by $1.4 billion, to $88 billion, and the average number of days to maturity of securities held in tax-free fund portfolios was 59 days, unchanged from the week before.
"The short-term market clearly discounted at least part of any possible Federal Reserve easing of credit," said Walter S. Frank, Donoghue's chief economist, commenting on credit-market expectations of a Fed move to lower short-term interest rates. "The funds have acted as if they think it is coming. If the Fed does not ease, we would expect a slight reversal of the downtrend. However, we do believe the odds slightly favor a move toward further easing."
Mr. Frank said the highest-yielding tax-exempt fund among those with assets greater than $100 million was Calvert Tax Free Reserves, with a seven-day compound yield of 5.02 percent.
In the case of funds investing in individual state securities, Salomon Brothers New York Municipal Money Market fund reported the highest seven-day compound yield, 4.76 percent. In Connecticut, the Prudential Connecticut Municipal Money Market series led with a 4.55 percent seven-day compound yield, while in New Jersey, Calvert New Jersey Tax Free Reserves reported a 4.78 percent yield.
 
Taxable-Fund Results
 The average seven-day compound yield of taxable funds was unchanged from a week earlier, at 5.40 percent, and the simple seven-day yield was unchanged at 5.26 percent.
The average 30-day compound taxable yield was 5.44 percent, down from 5.48 a week earlier, while the 30-day simple yield was 5.30 percent, down from 5.34 percent the week before.
Assets of taxable funds rose by $4.3 billion, to $456 billion. Institutional buying accounted for $1.5 billion of the increase, which raised institutional holdings to $117.1 billion.
Mr. Frank said he thought that some money had moved out of the stock market in the past week into the funds. "It could be that stock market yields are not attractive to investors," he said.
The average number of days to maturitiy of securities held in taxable funds in the week was 59 days, the same as in the previous week.
The taxable fund with the best return, at 6.41 percent, was the Riverside Capital Money Management fund, distributed by the Winsbury Company of Columbus Ohio.
The average yield on bank money- market accounts in the week was 5.12 percent, unchanged from the previous week, according to The Bank Rate Monitor's national index.

HEADLINE: New Line By I.B.M. Is 'Open'

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
I.B.M. took a significiant step yesterday toward opening its product line so that it could work more closely with its competitors, announcing seven new mainframes and more than a hundred hardware add-ons and software programs.
The company also said that the powerful water-cooled mainframes that it announced a year ago would begin shipping next week. It said these mainframes had top speeds 15 percent faster than I.B.M. had been projecting. 
 Analysts gave the International Business Machines Corporation high marks for its new-found openness, which includes a version of the Unix operating system for its mainframe machines and a strategy called the Information Warehouse, which is designed to ease the process of sharing information stored in a variety of formats. This would enable a company to link together information stored in different, incompatible data bases.
Yesterday I.B.M. said the new Unix, which would initially be attractive to technical users of its machines, would be available sometime during the second half of 1992.
 
Little Short-Term Impact
 "The most interesting part of the announcement is that finally, publicly, across the board, I.B.M. has endorsed open systems and Unix," said Robert Djurdjevic, president of Annex Research, a market-research firm based in Phoenix. But he added that the shift would have little short-term impact on the company. "Clearly I.B.M. is doing a catch-up when it comes to Unix and open system," he said. "But I have to give them the benefit of the doubt because they are doing it across their product line."
Many people in the industry believe I.B.M. is counting on strong sales of its new mainframe systems to help salvage what is becoming one of its most difficult years, with profit margins at historic lows.
Mainframes continue to provide more than half I.B.M.'s profits. Last September, the company introduced a whole generation of mainframes, air-cooled and water-cooled, known as the System/390.
The machines are used by large companies like airlines, banks and insurance concerns.
Executives of I.B.M., which is based in Armonk, N.Y., said that if the economy held up, the company hoped for a generally positive second half of the year, barring surprises.
Nicholas M. Donofrio, the president of I.B.M.'s mainframe division, said analysts' optimistic projections that the company would sell as many as 400 of its top ES/9000 mainframes by the end of the year were in "the general ballpark."
I.B.M.'s stock rose $1.75 a share yesterday, to $101.375, on the New York Stock Exchange.
"This is a lousy year no matter how you slice it," said Stephen Cohen, an analyst who follows the company at the Soundview Financial Group. "I have a short-term buy on the stock on the basis that they will ship more of these systems than people are generally expecting."
 
New Storage Systems
 I.B.M. also announced new optical and magnetic mainframe storage systems and extended the reach of its Escon fiber-optic cabling system, which can now be used to link computer systems as far as 37 miles apart.
But the company is clearly playing a catch-up game with its competitors, which have rapidly turned toward open systems based on industry standards in the last five years.
"This is I.B.M.'s attempt to find a relevant role for the mainframe in a PC-dominated world," said Frank Gens, a computer industry analyst at the Technology Investment Strategy Corporation, a Framingham, Mass., consulting firm. "I.B.M. has recognized that the mainframe is risking becoming completely irrelevant to what has become the core of computing in most corporations."
At the heart of I.B.M.'s strategy is the Information Warehouse framework, a standard model for managing computer data independent of its format or its location. Yesterday, the company said it was forming an international alliance of business partners to back the standard. It said that Information Builders Inc. and Bachman Information Systems Inc. were members of the alliance and that the companies would provide products that complement I.B.M.'s systems.
Analysts warned that one risk inherent in the new strategy was that it permitted other companies to substitute their products for I.B.M.'s inside large corporate data centers.
"If you stand way back and consider this strategy, you realize that corporate data can now be stored on Tandem and Digital mainframes as easily as I.B.M.'s," Mr. Gens said.
I.B.M. also announced a high-end disk drive for its mainframe systems to be called the 3390 Model 3. Each drive will store 50 percent more information than current models in the same floor space -- up to 90 billion characters of data. And the company said its Callpath software, used by telemarketers to display records associated with incoming calls, is now available on the company's mainframe and personal computers. The program was initially available for the AS/400 minicomputers.

HEADLINE: SOVIET TURMOIL: Aid at Any Price;
From Cuba to the Kuriles, the Soviets Hint at Deals for Much Needed Help

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Sept. 11

 BODY:
By offering to remove all Soviet troops from Cuba and hinting that four Kurile islands might after all be returned to Japan, Soviet and Russian leaders have, in effect, abandoned pride and begun begging for economic aid for their collapsing economies.
At the London summit meeting when they met to hear out President Mikhail S. Gorbachev last July, leaders of the seven most powerful capitalist countries concluded that until leaders in Moscow showed that they were willing to undo the Bolshevik revolution and institute a market economy, they should go slow and be cautious. 
 Now, the Communist Party is outlawed in much of the Soviet Union, and a plan for a market economy is promised within weeks. Today, Mr. Gorbachev, sharing the sharply atrophied power of the Soviet Union equally with President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, seems ready to promise almost anything to keep what remains of the union from falling apart.
They have also succeeded in increasing pressure on the United States and other Western countries to think seriously about much bigger aid packages than they have ever thought about for the Soviet Union before -- perhaps something on the scale of the Marshall Plan, which cost the United States alone $6.8 billion dollars in 1948 and 1949, more than 2.5 percent of its gross national product at the time.
 
Discussion With Baker
 Mr. Gorbachev didn't even seem to ask for a quid pro quo today when he told Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d that the Soviet Union would withdraw its forces from Cuba, and Mr. Yeltsin told the visiting American that he was poised to begin serious discussions with Japan about the return of the four Kurile islands that Stalin seized at the very end of World War II.
Since Nikita S. Khrushchev's day, Cuba has been a thorn in the side of the United States, to remind it that it was not the only superpower, even in the Western Hemisphere. But now it is the only one in either hemisphere.
The Soviet Union still looms large, but now as a problem, much as the exhausted democracies of Western Europe did in the first years after the war. Mr. Gorbachev has in effect broken his sword and cast it down in front of President Bush and the Japanese Prime Minister, Toshiki Kaifu, and said: "Help us."
Mr. Gorbachev had already done as much with Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany in 1990, agreeing to German reunification essentially on West German terms, in exchange for more than $30 billion in German economic aid.
 
A Positive Response
 But now, Germany has no more money to give, and thus the Russian and Soviet leaders have no choice but to turn to the United States and Japan.
"If there ever was a chance to make a contribution, it's now," the German Foreign Minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, said here this morning.
Mr. Baker responded positively today to Mr. Gorbachev, and let it be known that the United States would be willing to consider economic assistance through the International Monetary Fund as soon as the Soviets, and any of their former republics, come up with "credible" and "concrete" free-market economic reform plans.
But the real political question, American officials agree privately, is whether the Administration -- or the American body politic -- is ready to give the kind of assistance this country will probably need.
 
Strains in Germany
 The Marshall Plan was spurred on by the Soviet menace to Europe, a threat that has disappeared today. In its first year, it was 16 percent of the federal budget, but it is hard to conceive of that much, in an age of huge budget deficits and domestic spending needs, going to the Soviet Union now. Economic reform plans suggested by Soviet and American academic experts have proposed that the amounts be shared by the United States, the European Community countries, and Japan.
Even in Germany, which had reunification to gain, Chancellor Kohl has found the political and economic strains of raising gasoline and sales taxes to pay for the rebuilding of eastern Germany extremely painful.
So now, he turns out his pockets and tries to work on the United States -- and Japan, which may even have the money the Soviet Union needs.
Mr. Kaifu made clear during Mr. Gorbachev's visit to Japan earlier this year that the Soviet Union couldn't expect any money until it gave back the Kurile Islands. It remains to be seen how much money he will be willing to come up with if the Soviets do so.
 
An Urgent Aid Request
 With the winter fast approaching, and the harvest mostly still lying around in the fields waiting for the rains to rot it because the infrastructure of agricultural machinery and transport equipment has collapsed, the Soviets have already begun asking for help in feeding themselves.
Today, the European Community received an urgent aid request for 5.5 million metric tons of grain, 800,000 tons of meat, and 900,000 tons of sugar for the Soviet Union from the acting Soviet Prime Minister, Ivan Silayev.
The Executive Commission promised to examine the request, and European leaders will convene at a special summit meeting in the Hague, probably early next month, to reconsider the whole issue of Soviet aid.
With the French and the Germans already sympathetic, a British diplomat conceded here, the United Kingdom is coming under increasing pressure to drop its previous position that any large amount of aid is premature until the Soviet economic reformers get their act together.
"We have a unique chance to influence a genuinely hopeful development here," Mr. Genscher said today, before heading off to the Baltic states to view what used to be one of the most economically productive and self-sufficient regions of the Soviet Union but have now become three newly sovereign states.
Whether Mr. Gorbachev's groveling will produce a more forthcoming attitude from the United States or Japan remains to be seen. What is clear is that he has no choice -- and that they will soon be forced to ask themselves whether they do, either.

HEADLINE: Stocks End Mixed as the Down Gains 4.47

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
The stock market ended with a rally yesterday and stock prices were mixed, as investors settled down to await the next round of economic data, beginning with today's release of the Producer Price Index for August.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 4.47, to end the day at 2,987.03, while the New York Stock Exchange composite index increased by 0.21, to 211.21. 
 Volume of shares traded on the Big Board was a light 148.09 million, up from 143.4 million shares the previous day. The number of stocks declining narrowly outpaced the number of stocks that moved up.
Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks gained 0.53, to 385.09, with the American Stock Exchange composite down 1.51, to 364.68.
Over-the-counter stocks ended higher, with the composite index up 3.48, to 514.76.
The rally helped blue-chip and smaller stocks regain most of their earlier losses.
Gene J. Seagle, director of technical research for Gruntal & Company, said he thought market psychology was reacting to the ghost of past Octobers, but that the Street was forgetting that the Fed's increase of the discount rate in 0ctober 1987 was certaintly not probable at this time.
"The waiting game for Fed action and possible third-quarter earnings disappointment has the market locked in place between the 3,050 and 2,950 levels," he said. "I.B.M.'s strength plus a rate cut might well be the white knights needed to crack the Dow's ceiling. The strong transport index yesterday underscores the bullish potential."
Stocks started the day well enough, with an early round of buying by institutions. But investors still troubled by the prospect of disappointing third-quarter corporate profits found very little to move them toward taking buy positions.
Bond prices were soft after the Fed again did not act to ease interest rates, taking away any technical support for stocks. Afternoon trading turned choppy, and some analysts noted that over the last few trading sessions, few market sectors have been immune to selloffs.
 
I.B.M. Gains 1 3/4
 I.B.M. rose 1 3/4, to 101 3/8. The computer company introduced several mainframe products yesterday that adopted the "open system" approach in which they can work with machines of other companies.
Tenneco fell 2 1/8, to 40 1/2. The company said it expected a substantial loss from operations in the second half and the board adopted a cost-cutting plan that involved a 50 percent cut in the quarterly dividend beginning in the fourth quarter, sale of about $1 billion in non-core business by the end of the year, cuts in 1992 capital spending and plans to raise an additional $300 million of equity.
Citing weak domestic merchandising results, a Prudential Securities analyst, L. Wayne Hood, lowered his third-quarter earnings estimate for Sears, Roebuck, and the stock fell by 1, to 38 7/8. AMR rose by 3 1/8, to 59 yesterday, after the parent of American Airlines announced a plan to reduce capital spending by hundreds of millions in the 1992-95 period.

HEADLINE: Treasury Puts Curbs On Market

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 11

 BODY:
Responding to growing criticism over its handling of the scandal at Salomon Brothers Inc., the Treasury Department today announced new rules aimed at combating corruption in the market in which the Government borrows hundreds of billions of dollars annually.
The announcement came as the scandal continued to grow, with new disclosures by Richard C. Breeden, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, that other firms and banks may have misled Government-backed lending agencies -- including the Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae -- that raise money separately from the Treasury. 
 The scandal has forced officials and lawmakers in Washington to re-examine the way the Government finances the nation's debt and the informal manner in which the $2.3 trillion market has been regulated.
 
Bids on Paper, Placed in Boxes
 The Treasury's new measures include accelerating plans to automate a market that has relied for nearly two centuries on paper bids placed in wooden boxes by runners in the final minute before an auction of Government bills, notes or bonds closes. They would also require written verification of large winning bids from customers themselves to guarantee the bids' authenticity and prevent the kind of phony bidding that Salomon has said was executed without its customers' authorization in an effort to corner the market in Government bonds.
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said in a statement that the steps were being taken to insure the "continued integrity" of the Government securities market.
"In addition to these actions, the Treasury Department will continue to review the auction process to determine what other changes may be appropriate," Mr. Brady said.
 
More Regulation Expected
 Other Administration officials emphasized today that the Treasury was likely to make more recommendations once the magnitude of misdeeds in the securities markets became clearer. The Treasury has said it will take three months to complete its review.
The changes, announced at a hearing of the Senate Banking subcommittee on securities, are intended to stop the mounting Congressional complaints about the market in which about $117 billion worth of Government securities changes hands daily and through which the Federal Reserve conducts the economic policies that have a broad impact on interest rates for commerce and consumers.
But Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., the Michigan Democrat who heads the banking committee, and other members of the committee who have criticized the Treasury for failing to adequately regulate the market strongly suggested at the hearing today that the measures might not be enough. No one today came forward, however, with a more comprehensive proposal. Mr. Breeden, who testified at the hearing and who has been seeking more power for the S.E.C. to regulate the Government securities market, did not comment on the Treasury changes.
The changes are also aimed at deflecting accusations that the Treasury has been too close to the market's biggest players and has unfairly favored the 39 primary dealers who buy most of the bonds issued by the Government by providing them with confidential information about auctions and the nation's finances.
Treasury officials hold a regular quarterly meeting in Washington with a trade group of the primary dealers to discuss the coming auctions, the financial needs of the Federal Government and the interests of the marketplace. The dealers are asked not to share the information they are given with their companies immediately.
 
Information Will Be Public
 Critics have said, however, that the meetings still give the the industry officials an advantage in the marketplace and offer an easy opportunity to benefit from confidential information. Treasury officials have acknowledged in recent days that participants were bound only by an honor system.
To address this issue, under another of the new measures announced today, the Treasury information on financings and refundings that is normally provided in confidence at these meetings will be publicly released two days before each meeting.
Senator Riegle, said today, "The cozy relationship between the regulators and the primary dealers must be fully examined and I believe ended."
At a subcommittee hearing, he and other Democrats and Republicans closely questioned Mr. Breeden and other industry regulators, as well as Warren E. Buffett, the new chairman of Salomon. "The very informality of this marketplace raises a host of questions," Mr. Riegle said.
 
Inadequacy Is Conceded
 Jerome H. Powell, Assistant Treasury Secretary, acknowledged at the hearing that the existing regulations and their implementation had been inadequate.
"There is no question that it can be improved, and improve it we will," he said, in response to remarks by Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, who called surveillance of the market inadequate.
In his testimony today, the S.E.C. chairman, Mr. Breeden, discussed how the scandal had expanded beyond the Treasury securities market. He said his agency had discovered a "distressingly large" number of investment houses and banks that appeared to have intentionally misled other Government agencies and federally backed lenders that sell hundreds of billions of dollars in securities to raise money to help finance home purchases.
 
No Names or Motives
 He did not provide either names of investment firms or banks, or their motives, however, beyond saying that the reported infractions were intended to skirt the disclosure rules of the institutions that sell the securities.
"There are a number of primary dealers that may have purchased other types of agency securities based on some falsehoods or another," Mr. Breeden said in an appearance before the Senate banking subcommittee on securities. "I'm not about to issue a clean bill of health to anybody until we have finished our work."
Mr. Breeden said that while the widespread investigation into improprieties in Treasury auctions was only in its earliest stage, the S.E.C. had found no evidence that other investment firms had engaged in misconduct similar to that admitted by Salomon. In early August, Salomon disclosed that it had illegally purchased more than the 35 percent limit at several Treasury auctions by submitting unauthorized bids.
"We are at the point this morning where I cannot tell you that there are any other primary dealers who have to my knowledge engaged in the deliberate falsification of bids in connection with Treasury auctions or participated in the type of events and scope of events that have been announced by Salomon," he said. "That is not to say that there are not other violations of the law."
He said that Salomon's infractions "demonstrate arrogance and disregard for the law."
At today's hearing, Mr. Buffett provided more details about the bonuses that Salomon had given to executives who had earned the firm the most money. The firm disclosed yesterday that Paul W. Mozer, the managing director at the center of the scandal, received more than $11 million in bonuses in the last three years.
Mr. Buffett said that 90 executives had received bonuses of more than $1 million last year and also noted that as a member of the board's compensation committee, he had voted against a plan ultimately adopted that provided $127 million in bonuses.
Mr. Buffett said the firm's compensation system was under review to make it "more rational."

HEADLINE: Mitterrand Urges Talks on A-Arms

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Sept. 11

 BODY:
Eager to show that France is not losing influence in Europe, President Francois Mitterrand called today for an early meeting of the four countries with nuclear weapons in Europe to tackle nuclear security problems raised by developments in the Soviet Union.
He said Paris had already discussed the idea with Washington and London and would do so with Moscow "when we know which of the Soviet Union's representatives to talk to" in the light of "the collapse of decision-making powers in the former Soviet Union." 
 "The uncertainty comes from Moscow," he continued, "so it's up to Moscow to say where we stand, who is in charge, where the atomic weapons are stationed and where they will go in order to subject them to strict control."
 
Between Two Forces
 France is not the only Western power to have expressed concern about both control of the Soviet nuclear arsenal during the failed hard-line coup last month and the fate and whereabouts of Soviet nuclear weapons as the Soviet Union edges toward possible dismemberment.
But Mr. Mitterrand's move to call a four-power meeting today seemed to reflect his more immediate need to answer domestic critics of his foreign policy by undertaking an initiative in which, as one of Western Europe's two nuclear powers, France could be seen playing an important role.
The French leader also used the occasion of a 95-minute news conference to offer his vision of France's place in a post-Communist Europe in which the European Community should play a central role as part of a looser confederation comprising all European countries.
Noting that Europe was caught between forces leading toward unity and fragmentation, he said France was determined to see the community build common security and defense policies, adding that the 12-nation bloc should be ready to send a peacekeeping force to halt the civil war in Yugoslavia.
Having previously called for preservation of Yugoslavia, he also indicated that he now expected the independence declarations by Slovenia and Croatia to take full effect. "One can think in the light of the experience of the past two months that Slovenia will be independent," he said. "In my opinion, Croatia too."
While much of the news conference today was given over to foreign policy issues, however, it was above all a domestic political occasion, organized by Mr. Mitterrand so that he could respond to a fierce opposition campaign aimed at showing that after 10 years in power he has lost his political touch.
 
The Campaign Heats Up
 The campaign was stepped up after Mr. Mitterrand seemed to hesitate in his initial condemnation of the Soviet coup last month and moved slowly in throwing his weight behind the Russian republic's President, Boris N. Yeltsin, and calling for President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's return to power.
After the coup failed, Mr. Mitterrand appeared on television to dispute charges that he had wavered. In recent days, Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Yeltsin have also pointedly thanked the French leader for his support. But opposition and press criticism of his performance has continued.
[The Nobel peace laureate Elie Wiesel said Wednesday that Mr. Mitterrand had sent him to Moscow on a secret mission hours after the coup began to assure Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Yeltsin of his firm support, Reuters reported from Budapest.
Political experts said Mr. Mitterrand was particularly shaken by this latest controversy because it followed months of growing public unhappiness with his Government's economic and social policies as well as complaints of his choice of Edith Cresson as Prime Minister in May.
Today, in what was his first full-scale news conference since May 1989, Mr. Mitterrand brushed aside speculation that he might replace Mrs. Cresson with Jacques Delors, who heads the European Community's executive commission, and that he might cut short his current second seven-year term.
He also noted that he had no intention of renouncing Socialism as a result of the collapse of Communism. "I am convinced that human society needs further liberations," he said. "It is a necessary combat."

HEADLINE: SOVIET TURMOIL;
SOVIET TRADE PACT SENT TO CONGRESS

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 11

 BODY:
Administration officials presented Congress with an agreement today offering more favorable trade terms with the Soviet Union, but they said the pact did not include the newly independent Baltic countries and would have little effect on American trade.
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d is to visit the Baltic countries on Saturday and is likely to announce then the Administration's position on trade relations with them, said Thomas Duesterberg, the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for international economic policy. 
 The Administration insisted until early August that the trade agreement include the Baltic states. But it changed its position when it became clear that the Soviet Union no longer had practical control over the Baltics, said Curtis Kamman, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
The trade agreement clears the way for the Administration to grant most-favored-nation trade status to the Soviet Union, which allows products to enter the United States at the lower of two sets of tariffs. Mr. Duesterberg told the committee the agreement was needed to insure the United States' long-term competitive position in the Soviet market.
 
No Quick Effect on U.S. Trade
 But in the short run the agreement is likely to have no appreciable effect on American exports to the Soviet Union, which is short of internationally traded currencies, while Soviet exports to the United States, $1.1 billion in 1990, are likely to rise by only $100 million to $400 million annually, he said. United States exports to the Soviet Union totaled $3.1 billion last year.
As the Administration discussed Soviet trade, Prime Minister Jan Krzysztof Bielecki of Poland told reporters at a breakfast briefing today that he feared the Soviet Union might descend into chaos, sending millions of refugees toward his country.
President Bush promised Mr. Bielecki later today that the United States would give Poland $25 million worth of loan guarantees for housing, The Associated Press reported.

HEADLINE: SOVIET TURMOIL;
GORBACHEV SAYS HE'S READY TO PULL TROOPS OUT OF CUBA AND END CASTRO'S SUBSIDIES

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Sept. 11

 BODY:
In an effort to remove a major obstacle to increased American economic aid to the Soviet Union, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev announced today that his country would begin discussions shortly with President Fidel Castro of Cuba about the withdrawal of the 11,000 Soviet military personnel on the island.
Mr. Gorbachev, who announced the decision after a meeting here with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, also said that in the future Soviet economic ties with Cuba would be based strictly on free trade, eliminating the effective $2-billion-a-year subsidy that Moscow has been giving Havana by bartering Soviet oil for Cuban sugar on terms that greatly overvalued the sugar. 
 For some three decades, a major goal of American foreign policy has been to remove the Soviet military presence in Cuba and to end the substantial Soviet aid to that Communist outpost, 90 miles from Key West, Fla.
 
'A Very Substantial Gesture'
 In particular, the Bush Administration, to meet the concerns of conservatives, had conditioned substantial economic aid to the Soviet Union on an end to Soviet military presence in Cuba and a cutoff on subsidies to Mr. Castro.
Asked what he thought of Mr. Gorbachev's overture, Mr. Baker said: "I would not characterize that as a small gesture. I think it is a very substantial gesture." He added later, "That will be very important with respect to public opinion in the United States."
[Cuba reacted angrily, saying the Soviet announcements "were not preceded by consultations or any previous advice, which constitutes inappropriate behavior both from the point of view of international norms and of the agreements which exist between the two countries," Reuters reported from Havana.]
 
Desperation for Foreign Aid
 Only hours after Mr. Gorbachev made his announcement, Mr. Baker was told by the Russian republic's President, Boris N. Yeltsin, that he was proposing a compromise solution to Japan for settling a dispute over four islands in the Kurile chain seized by the Soviets at the end of World War II.
Tokyo has made a return of the islands a condition for any substantial economic aid to the Soviets. While not disclosing the Yeltsin proposals, Mr. Baker described them as "very substantive."
The simultaneous overtures by Mr. Yeltsin on the disputed islands and Mr. Gorbachev on Cuba were strong evidence of a new direction for Soviet foreign policy in the wake of the abortive coup against the Gorbachev Government last month. The moves also appeared to reflect the level of Soviet desperation for foreign economic assistance and the degree to which it is ready to dispense with or moderate long-held positions in order to raise cash.
"I reaffirmed to the Secretary that we plan to transfer our relations with Cuba to a plane of mutually beneficial trade and economic ties and we will remove the other elements of that relationship -- elements that were born of a different time in a different era," Mr. Gorbachev said. "In that context I told the Secretary that we will soon begin discussions with the Cuban leadership about the withdrawal of a Soviet training brigade, which was stationed in Cuba some time ago and is still there."
The reference to a "training brigade" appears to have been Mr. Gorbachev's euphemism for the entire Soviet garrison in Cuba, because when he was asked how many men would be involved in the withdrawal he said 11,000, which exceeds the highest State Department estimate for total Soviet personnel in Cuba. Also, a senior Administration official said that Mr. Gorbachev had made clear in his discussions with Mr. Baker that the Soviets would pull out all their forces.
The senior Administration official said the Soviet leader had also left Mr. Baker with the clear impression that in addition to withdrawing all of their military personnel from Cuba -- intelligence officers, advisers and a rifle brigade -- the Soviets intend to phase out their arms sales to Cuba.
Mr. Gorbachev's initiatives, if fully carried out, would be a milestone in the 30-year military relationship between the Soviet Union and Cuba -- a relationship that almost led to a nuclear war during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis and has been a source of tension in Soviet-American relations ever since. It also raises questions about a Soviet-Cuban treaty of friendship and economic cooperation.
Mr. Gorbachev disclosed the policy changes on Cuba during a joint news conference with Mr. Baker, after their talks in the Kremlin. It was the first time that the Soviet leader has appeared with Mr. Baker after a meeting in the Kremlin.
According to the State Department, Soviet military personnel on Cuba fall into three categories: roughly 3,000 attached to the huge intelligence listening post the Soviets have built in Lourdes, to monitor electronic communications in the United States; a rifle brigade of about 3,000 men assigned to protect the other Soviet military personnel in Cuba, and roughly 3,500 Soviet military advisers working with the Cuban armed forces.
 
Credits, Aid and Hidden Subsidies
 In 1990, the State Department says, Moscow gave Cuba about $500 million in trade credits and $800 million more in technical and development aid, including two nuclear power stations the Soviets are building on the island, and $2.2 billion in hidden subsidies through the oil-for-sugar barter.
The new relationship with Cuba will be worked out in the "immediate future," Mr. Gorbachev said, and should not take "many months" to begin.
The more desperate the Soviets become, and the more they meet Washington's conditions for aid, the greater the pressure on the Administration to increase its economic aid to the Soviet Union beyond just humanitarian food and medical aid or technical advice.
The senior Administration official briefing reporters on Mr. Baker's talks with Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Yeltsin, which each lasted some three hours, said they told him that within four to six weeks they expect to have a concrete, credible plan for transforming the Soviet economy to market principles. American officials want the plan to be worked out in cooperation with the International Monetary Fund and other international lending institutions.
 
Reform Plan Before Allied Aid
 Once that reform plan is completed, Bush Administration officials and American allies have acknowledged, it would be incumbent on them to come up with substantial economic aid. This most likely would be cash and credits for a stabilization program of the sort used in Poland, to cushion the Soviet economy while it moves to a convertible currency and free market.
Mr. Baker told reporters after his meetings that the United States was already prepared to increase humanitarian food aid and technical advice, but was still conditioning any substantial new economic assistance on the adoption of an I.M.F.-backed program.
The senior Administration official said that both leaders told Mr. Baker that they had agreed that Soviet nuclear weapons should remain under the sole control of the President of the Soviet Union, or whatever central authority the republics agree on.
He said the two Soviet leaders were also in agreement that no matter what sort of loose confederation is decided on by the republics. they should retain a single currency, if at all possible. American officials have been advising the Soviets that economic reform will be much easier if they retain a single currency, banking system and fiscal and monetary policies, although some republics are talking about printing their own money.
The same applies to aid requests. The senior official said Mr. Baker had told Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Gorbachev: "It is important that aid requests come from one source, so if we respond we will not get a competing request from another source."

Chart: "Ties That Bind Havana and Moscow"
 As the Soviet Union's only ally in the Western Hemisphere, Cuba got extensive military and economic aid in exchange for its loyal political support and services as a military proxy in Africa.
 
Economic Subsidies
 Discount oil: The Soviet Union delivers oil to Cuba at a fixed price. For years it was below the world market price; the discount was treated as a grant. In recent years Cuba has lost money on Soviet Oil purchases.
 Subsidized exports: The Soviet Union buys Cuba's main commodity exports, sugar and (before 1988) nickel, at above-market prices. The premium is treated as a grant.
 
Net benefit to Cuba:
1961-88 total: $39.6 billion
1989: $4.5 billion
 Other aid: The Soviet Union provides loans on concessionary terms and various other kinds of development aid.
 
Net benefit to Cuba:
1961-88 total: $17.6 billion
1989: $1.4 million
 History: The U.S. was once Cuba's main trading partner, but imposed an economic embargo after Fidel Castro introduced Comunism. The Soviet Union stepped in to prop up theCuban economy and is now by far Cuba's main trading partner.
 
Military Ties
 Soviet troops: Moscow will begin talks with Cuba aimed at withdrawal of 11,000 troops, apparently all the Soviet forces in Cuba. They include:
 
Combat troops: 3,000
Signal inteligence: 3,000
Military adivsers: 3,500
 The remainder includes civilians in military-related roles.
 History: Soviet combat troops have been present in Cuba since 1962, but first came to Western, public attention in 1979. Missiles fired by Soviet troops shot down a U.S. U-2 spy plan in 1962 at the height of the Cuban missile crisis.

HEADLINE: Masur Reaches for the High Notes

BYLINE: By ALLAN KOZINN

 BODY:
Orchestras like to think of their histories in terms of eras, each era defined not so much by occurrences in the outside world as by the tenures of their music directors. For the New York Philharmonic, the Zubin Mehta era came to an end last May, and with last night's performance -- the opening concert of its 150th season, and the orchestra's 11,738th concert all told -- the Kurt Masur era began.
As gala concerts go, the Philharmonic opted for a dignified approach rather than a glitzy one. On the other hand, it did its best to see that the event received the attention that the start of a new era deserves. Above the Lincoln Center plaza facing Broadway flew one huge banner with a bright red M, announcing Mr. Masur's ascent to the Philharmonic podium, and another celebrating the orchestra itself as "107 Great Musicians, OneBrilliant Instrument." 
 Inside Avery Fisher Hall, Philharmonic workers in silver sashes pointed the way. And because the performance was to be beamed across the country as part of the "Live From Lincoln Center" series of telecasts on PBS, the stage was brightly lighted, and eight cameras were located at strategic points in the hall. Most, though not all, of the hall's 2,738 seats were filled, but the Philharmonic was counting the concert as virtually sold out. But those on hand gave Mr. Masur a standing ovation when he first walked onstage, and another lasting about five minutes at the end.
For the occasion, Mr. Masur led a program that was part American and part Viennese, with two Minimalist fanfares by John Adams and Aaron Copland's folksy "Old American Songs" before the intermission, and the mammoth Bruckner Seventh Symphony after it. The concert, a benefit for the orchestra's pension fund, was followed by a party for Mr. Masur, the orchestra and about 950 guests under an enormous white tent in Damrosch Park, with Peter Duchin's orchestra playing dance music by the likes of George Gershwin and Cole Porter. Mr. Masur, who had changed out of his white tie and tails into a dark suit, arrived at the party with his wife at about 10:55 P.M., to applause from the already seated crowd.
 
A Tribute From Leipzig
 Earlier in the day, after the final rehearsal, Mr. Masur's family and a few hundred representatives of the Philharmonic and Lincoln Center were on hand when a delegation the other ensemble Mr. Masur directs , the Gewandhaus Orchestra of Leipzig, surprised the conductor with the autograph score of an unpublished Canon in B minor by Mendelssohn. The work was composed in 1844, when Mendelssohn was director of the Gewandhaus Orchestra.
"Now you are starting to make me nervous," Mr. Masur said. But for a conductor caught without a prepared speech, he seemed surprisingly poised.
"We are starting not with some compromises," he said, "but with open-minded people who want to reach the highest level we can."
 
Looking Beyond the Honeymoon
 It has been many years since a Philharmonic opening night was the focus of so much anticipation, hope and, to a degree, mystery. The last time was probably on Sept. 14, 1978, when Zubin Mehta took up the baton. Like a newly elected president, an orchestra's music director can look forward to at least a brief honeymoon period, during which he and the orchestra find their common ground and persuade the audience that their explorations together will be worth following.
Mr. Masur seems fully aware of that the honeymoon may be temporary, and he has shown every intention of making the most of his first American post. He comes to the Philharmonic at a potentially perilous time. He is facing a recession that has been felt at box offices all over the United States, and an increasingly urgent need to find new audiences in a country where classical music is not a majority concern. The orchestra's future is bound up in the way he addresses these problems once the jubilation of his opening night fades and he takes up the day-to-day running of the orchestra.
Mr. Masur has already taken some steps to address the audience question. He has expressed interest in taking an active hand in the orchestra's Young People's Concerts, and he is conducting three of them this season. And the pair of Adams works that opened last night's program was perhaps a response to those who have complained of the orchestra's hidebound programming.
If Mr. Masur feels the scrutiny he is under, one did not notice it when watching the closeups that the "Live From Lincoln Center" crew was sending to the mobile studio parked on West 65th Street. During both the final rehearsal and the performance, he looked thoroughly at ease and happily wrapped in Bruckner's rich textures. And to hear some of the players tell it, Mr. Masur comes to his new directorship with a confidence and assurance that they find inspiring.
 
A Conductor Who 'Keeps Growing'
 "Every time we've seen the guy, there has been more and more depth and drive in his music-making," said Philip Myers, the orchestra's principal French hornist. "I liked him when he first conducted us, 10 years ago, and with some conductors you don't see much of a change over 10 years. But his interpretation keeps growing.
"Also, he is the kind of director who can make a decision in five seconds. He knows exactly what he wants."
He has, for example, reseated some of the players in a way that helps them hear one another better. The basses have been moved onto 30-inch risers across the back of the stage. The violas, once nestled between the violins and cellos, have switched places with the cellos and are taking the outside edge.
Thomas Stacy, the Philharmonic's principal English hornist, also cited Mr. Masur's assurance when asked what qualities he found in the conductor's work. But he said there was another characteristic he admired equally.
"What I've found working with him," Mr. Stacy said, "is a wonderful balance of orchestral experience and preparation in rehearsal, and the all-important spontaneity in performance that can lead to concert magic."
 
Idealism vs. Inertia
 Many in the musical world have also been impressed by Mr. Masur's campaign to learn about New York City's musical life in the 17 months since he was appointed to succeed Mr. Mehta. He has attended a surprising range of concerts and recitals. He has brought in German acousticians to examine the persistent sonic problems of Avery Fisher Hall, and at last night's concert, some of the sound baffles they prescribed could be seen at the sides of the stage. And in his interviews, he has left the impression that he is coming to the job with a kind of idealism that may overcome the inertia of contemporary American musical life.
Mr. Masur has started this week's rehearsals with pep talks about the importance of working together. But the musicians, when asked their impressions of the week's rehearsals, inevitably brushed past the lectures and the seating changes, and returned to Mr. Masur's musicianship.
"His sense of characterization is so rich," said Joseph Robinson, the principal oboist. "Without naming any names, we have worked with conductors who are traffic cops, or who seem like they are putting together a puzzle. But our experience with Masur has been that he shapes the music in ways that enliven it. From his first meetings with us, he has emphasized partnership. He said that if it isn't a happy collaboration, he'll tear up his contract."
Mr. Stacy, for one, said he does not think that will happen.
"I think the players have been intrigued with his musicianship and depth of knowledge," he said. "It gives us a feeling of confidence that is important and can lead to a 10-year honeymoon."

HEADLINE: Hollywood Called Hypocritical by Actor Who Died of AIDS

BYLINE: By BERNARD WEINRAUB, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Sept. 11

 BODY:
The publication of an anguished indictment of the film industry as indifferent and hypocritical toward people with AIDS, written by the actor Brad Davis, who died of the disease on Sunday, has touched a raw nerve in a community that prides itself on openness and tolerance.
Mr. Davis, who starred in "Midnight Express" and other films and plays, wrote his thoughts about Hollywood and AIDS as he drafted a proposal for a book to discuss the six years in which he carried the HIV virus. Mr. Davis kept his illness a secret from everyone but his wife, Susan Bluestein, a casting director, and a handful of friends, largely out of fear that it would shatter his career if Hollywood knew about it. 
 Portions of Mr. Davis's reflections were published in The Los Angeles Times today, after his wife got in touch with the paper. Ms. Bluestein, who could not be reached for comment today, was quoted in the paper as saying that Mr. Davis wanted to have his story told. What emerges is a bleak portrait of an actor desperate to hide his condition and "remain anonymous at all costs."
 
'One More Pariah in Hollywood'
 "I make my money in an industry that professes to care very much about the fight against AIDS -- that gives umpteen benefits and charity affairs with proceeds going to research and care," wrote Mr. Davis, who began work on his proposal in the last months of his illness. "But in actual fact, if an actor is even rumored to have HIV he gets no support on an individual basis. He does not work."
Mr. Davis expressed the fear that "somehow the gossip mill would get hold of me and that would be that: I'd be one more pariah in Hollywood who would never get a job."
Ironically, Mr. Davis's reflections have been made public at a moment when the movie industry is, essentially, celebrating its own contribution and commitment to AIDS. On Sunday, virtually the entire movie establishment is planning to show up at the Universal Amphitheater in Universal City to honor, among others, Bette Midler, the actress, and Sidney Sheinberg, president of MCA, for their involvement with the AIDS issue. Recently, the leading players in the industry appeared at a highly publicized fund-raising event given by a show business lawyer, Alan Hergott, for the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force. At the time, Mr. Hergott called it a "breakthrough."
But Mr. Davis's comments are, some Hollywood film makers say, a reflection of the industry's ambivalence and confusion, even fear, about dealing with AIDS and, for that matter, with homosexuality.
 
'It's Too Close'
 "AIDS is a pariah disease, it's too close to many people in this town, it's too frightening," said Bruce Davison, the award-winning actor who appeared in "Longtime Companion," one of the few films about AIDS. "It's easier, for example, to make films about Vietnam when it's not the 60's or 70's. Someday, when they find a cure for the disease they'll make a movie about AIDS. It'll have a certain nobility then."
Mr. Davison said Mr. Davis's concerns about working were valid. "It's the same as Rock Hudson," he said. "I remember going to the doctor's office to get a physical and there was Rock Hudson. He was trembling. He was frightened. Now I know that he was terrified that he'd be found out and he wouldn't have a job."
Mr. Davis, in his notes, indicated uncertainty about how he contracted AIDS. "I was a total drug addict -- an alcoholic and I.V. drug user -- a user of just about any kind of drug I could get," he wrote. "And I was sexually very promiscuous. I've never known any addicts who weren't."
Certainly, the bleak subject of AIDS is considered financially risky, especially in the aftermath of the summer flop "Dying Young," with Julia Roberts, which dealt with a young man dying of cancer. (On the other hand, "Love Story" and "Terms of Endearment," in which major characters died young, proved to be financially successful.)
 
Economic Distress Cited
 "Look, the economy is depressed, people are struggling financially, it's a hard time in the industry," said Craig Zadan, producer of "Footloose" and other films, who is planning to co-produce with Oliver Stone a film about Harvey Milk, the gay San Francisco politician who was assassinated. "People want to escape. It's not a good time to come in with a film about death."
Mike Medavoy, chairman of Tri-Star Pictures, said: "There's always a pause when you make a film about someone dying. You're afraid to be maudlin or false. It's just a very difficult subject to do well. Even films like 'Love Story' and 'Terms of Endearment' had a very hard time getting made."
But others say dealing with AIDS is especially delicate and complex in an industry where there are numerous gay actors and directors who are not only silent about their sexuality but who also try to hide it. "Hollywood is scared to put money on AIDS films because it's a stigmatized disease and a lot of people here are in the closet who just don't want to be associated with the subject," said Zelda Rubinstein, the actress from "Poltergeist" who was an an early supporter of AIDS education and support. "It frightens a lot of people here."
Several people in the industry agreed that Mr. Davis was right to worry about working. "There's so much competition, there're fewer and fewer projects, if you have any excuse to hire one person over another, you do it," said Mr. Zadan. "I don't think it's an issue of prejudice. All of these decisions are subjective. The slightest thing can influence you."
 
TV More Flexible
 Mr. Medavoy observed: "An actor's health is not a a question that I would consider, unless he had a serious heart condition and we had insurance problems. If a director wants to hire an actor, and he's a good actor, I'm not going to ask what his health is."
Even film executives acknowledge that television has been somewhat more flexible and open about AIDS and gay people than the film industry. Several prime-time series, including "L.A. Law," "Doctor, Doctor" and "Thirtysomething," have included gay characters, and there have been some moving television dramas about AIDS, including "An Early Frost" and "Our Sons." "Longtime Companion" will be shown on PBS on Sept. 29.
A leader in Hollywood efforts to combat AIDS, Helen Gorman Kushnick, who is Jay Leno's manager and who lost a 3-year-old son to AIDS because of a tainted blood transfusion, said: "If everybody takes the position that Brad Davis did -- and believe me, I'm not judging him -- then people with AIDS will remain a minority. If people choose to speak out, they become the majority. People have got to speak out. I've had breast cancer. And I've had nothing but support. I didn't keep it a secret. And NBC just hired me to be executive producer of the 'Tonight' show next year."

HEADLINE: DESIGN NOTEBOOK;
The How-To's Versus the Too-Muches

BYLINE: By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN

 BODY:
ENOUGH of yard sales, Bain de Soleil and apple wood. September is the time when editors of design magazines show their stuff. For readers craving tchotchkes and advice, there is nothing more intoxicating than the first sighting of the season's shelter magazines in the mailbox.
Imagine what Mars might look like if a well-heeled Martian managed to commandeer the current crop. But the Martian might also get a migraine. These are deeply confusing times for readers of home design magazines. 
 For every photograph of Karl Lagerfeld's villa in Monte Carlo, with its Louis XV sofa upholstered in the same red damask that covers the walls (HG), there is an equal and opposite message.
In the current issue of Home magazine, the actress Melanie Mayron sums up the 90's ideal. "You can put your feet up on the table," she said of her 1,140-square-foot home, "and if you spill something, it's no big deal."
The tension between fantasy and reality, all the more acute in light of the economy, is making itself felt in a gradual drift toward "how-to" articles.
In House Beautiful, Louis Oliver Gropp, the magazine's new editor-in-chief, explained that attitude in describing the magazine's new pared-down lower-case logo. "The 80's are over," he wrote, "along with the clutter and too-muchness."
Those seeking too-muchness need not despair. In its September issue, Architectural Digest gives readers the low-down on antique European barometers and an 8,000-square-foot mansion on Lake Michigan.
But perhaps the most talked-about feature is "Country Spirit on the Coast: A Sun-Washed Setting for Folk Art in California," an airy house for an unnamed client in which a brass fish is suspended from the ceiling.
The client, it has been reported, is none other than Paige Rense, the editor-in-chief of the magazine. Mrs. Rense herself won't confirm this. "It is the policy of the magazine not to reveal the owners of anonymous houses," she said.
It appears that if it is her house, Mrs. Rense is actually a real person. The magazine quotes the anonymous owner as saying, "I didn't want to live in a 'Statement.' " She is described as "a woman who has always shunned sham originality."
Traditionally, House Beautiful favored a more homey, milk-fed decorating approach. Although it is too soon to tell what the "new" House Beautiful will bring, the redesigned September issue seems more stylish and upscale. It includes a story on a rambling John Saladino house with a 22-foot-high entrance hall, a report on the Milan furniture fair and an interview with Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown.
The most compelling comment on design circa 1991 is actually found in an article on food. David Bouley of the TriBeCa restaurant Bouley observes that people "are not interested in food as architecture or design, the way they were in the 80's; they want simplicity and taste" (Taste! What a concept!).
Martha Stewart Living, the bimonthly Time Inc. publication, looks like it is stepping into the how-to role abdicated by the home design magazines, wearing Manolo Blahnik shoes, of course.
It's no accident that the magazine is the only one that features a person, rather than an interior, on the cover (the ubiquitous Ms. Stewart, of course). Martin S. Walker, president of Periodical Studies Service, a New York magazine consulting firm, calls it "the first vanity publication Time Inc. has ever published."
This is the magazine many people will hate to love. Its raison d'etre is the elegantly presented how-to story. In contrast to the first issue, which featured an article on croquet and numerous pictures of Ms. Stewart dressed in white, this issue seems down to earth. Deep-sea fishing has replaced croquet.
There is a story on kitchen knives and, in the domestically blissful spirit of 1950's women's magazines, an iron-on transfer for a keepsake pillow. There also seem to be fewer Stewart relations about.
Egoiste, the Chanel men's fragrance, made its American debut at the Metropolitan Home show house, the focus of a self-congratulatory fest in the magazine's September issue.
An admirable AIDS benefit, the show house was also notable, readers are told, for transforming the magazine's staff into heroes, heroes, heroes.
A number of the rooms, especially a study by the designer Jed Johnson and the architect Alan Wanzenberg, seemed a touchstone of the 90's. The idea of creating a glinty, bumpy wall surface by allowing brass mesh and staples to poke through green plaster is just the sort of humble extravagance people seem to be yearning for.
Next month, in the October renovation issue, Dorothy Kalins, the magazine's editor in chief, writes that she has realized her readers want help solving practical problems. But in the meantime they can order a show house video by dialing an 800 number.
The September issue of HG contains a nod to practicality in an article on 39 solutions to the problem of where to put the television set. The ideas included a TV in an ivy-covered designer potting shed and another in sandbags. It's the thought that counts. The report also contained one of the month's more memorable quotes, by the architect Robert A. M. Stern: "Who needs television when you have architecture?"
Perhaps the quote of the month is to be found in Elle Decor, in an article on walls. "I have an easy solution to any wall problem," Paloma Picasso said. "I can always find a Picasso to hang on it."
But let's face it: It is the Palomas of the world who make curling up with design magazines a delicious spectator sport. Which is why this reader's month was made by The World of Interiors. She longed for a ride in the London penthouse elevator containing a half-bottle of champagne, jelly beans and a condom.

HEADLINE: Philanthropists Aid Brooklyn Museum

 BODY:
The art collectors and philanthropists Iris and B. Gerald Cantor have made a challenge grant of $1 million over three years to the Brooklyn Museum, the museum announced yesterday. The grant, to help the museum with its operating expenses at a time when its support from New York City has been reduced because of the city's financial problems, is to be matched by $3 million in private contributions.
"Throughout the past several months the Brooklyn Museum has struggled to maintain its high professional standards as the city has steadily whittled away its support," Mrs. Cantor, who is a member of the museum's board, said in a statement. "That a cultural institution of its stature should have had to close to the public for a week and temporarily lay off its entire staff, as it did in late August, is appalling and untenable." 
 Robert T. Buck, the museum's director, said the grant "assured the stabilization of the museum during the city's financial crisis."
"It has given the Brooklyn Museum the means by which to find other monies to tide us over during this terrible period," Mr. Buck said.
But Robert S. Rubin, the chairman of the museum's board, said the gift was not "a substitute for the loss of 38.6 percent in city support." Rather, he said, it was "one-time-only emergency funding for a specific problem and in no way absolves the City of New York of its responsibility to the Brooklyn Museum."
In April the museum opened a new third-floor auditorium that was finished with a $3.5 million gift from the Cantors, who have made previous gifts to the Brooklyn and Metropolitan Museums. The 460-seat auditorium, designed by Arata Isozaki and James Stewart Polshek, is named for the Cantors.

HEADLINE: Teachers Return, Many Without Contracts

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE FERRY, N.J., Sept. 11

 BODY:
After a decade of general harmony between teachers and local school boards, a record number of teachers' contracts remain unsettled at the start of the new school year across New Jersey and New York State.
In New Jersey contracts for teachers in about 140 districts -- including the striking teachers who picketed here today -- remain unsettled out of 256 that expired last June, about twice the usual rate, according to Edward Gallagher, director of communications for the New Jersey Education Association, the state's largest teachers' union. 
 In New York State, of 450 contracts up for renewal for this academic year, 259 are still unsettled, said Robert Rice, deputy director of communications for the New York State United Teachers, who called that an all-time high. At this time last year, he said, 226 contracts were unresolved.
Officials say negotiations have dragged on for a variety of reasons: Albany and Trenton cut out millions of dollars in aid and then delayed telling districts exactly how much they would be getting, taxpayers are increasingly hostile to school spending and towns are uncertain about how long and how deeply the recession will hurt them.
 
Slower and Tougher
 "When the pie is smaller, the bargaining gets more difficult on both sides," said Mr. Rice.
While negotiations have been slower and tougher across the two states, they have broken down completely here in Little Ferry, a working-class town of about 10,000 just north of the Meadowlands Sports Complex. Settlements were reached today in two other strikes in towns in southern New Jersey, Cinnaminson and Willingboro.
Union and school board officials in New Jersey and New York do not think there will be many strikes this year, in part because of the harmony of recent years. But next year, when money is likely to be just as tight, they say, they may not be so lucky.
In Connecticut, all contracts have been resolved. Under a state law enacted after a teachers' strike in Bridgeport in 1978, school boards and teachers who cannot reach a settlement must submit their offers to an arbitrator in time for a binding decision by the end of April.
In New York City, teachers and Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez are negotiating on a contract to replace the one that expires at the end of this month.
In all three states, teachers' contracts signed this year have begun to reverse the 1980's pattern of annual wage increases of 8 or 9 percent. In Connecticut, increases in teachers' pay averaged about 6.5 percent for 1991-92 contracts, down from 7.5 to 8 percent for the 1990-91 year, said Clifford Silvers, director of affiliate services of the Connecticut Education Association, a teachers union.
Across New York State, new increases have ranged from 5 to 7 percent this year, compared with the increases of 7 to 9 percent common in the 1980's, said Louis Grumet, executive director of the New York State School Boards Association.
In New Jersey's schools, increases in contracts reached before the current school year began averaged 9.08 percent. New contracts reached between January and June provided average increases of 8.22 percent for the current school year and 8.18 for 1992-93, said Joseph Flannery, a spokesman for the New Jersey School Boards Association.
"We're seeing isolated instances below 8 percent and some below 7," Mr. Flannery said.
Unions officials say teachers are sensitive to the tighter economic times and are not being intransigent in this fall's bargaining.
"Our teachers live in these towns, too," said Mr. Gallagher of the New Jersey Education Association. "The numbers are flattening out. Teachers are taking less because less is available. They're taking the best deals they can get. But our local people don't feel any obligation to bear the brunt of all the jiggering around with state aid figures at the state level."
 
Being Reasonable?
 "This money is less plentiful this year," said Mr. Rice, the union leader in New York. "I believe we're being reasonable, but in addition to holding the line on salaries, a lot of districts are asking teachers to pay larger and larger amounts of their health insurance premiums."
Of Little Ferry's 54 teachers, 46 struck its two elementary schools, Memorial and Washington, last Friday, complaining that school board negotiators had cut their initial two-year wage offer of 8.8 percent and 8.5 percent three times since last March. The board's latest offer is for a four-year contract, with annual increases of 7, 6.5, 6 and 5.5 percent.
Elaine Shields, president of the local teachers union, said: "We're trying to come down, but they keep going lower. There's no middle ground. How are we every going to catch this mouse?"
Ms. Shields declined to discuss the union's latest proposal, other than to say it was lower than the 8.8 percent it was willing to take last spring.
 
'Economic Calamity'
 The superintendent, Stacy J. Holmes, said the board had reduced its offer because "we've had a continuing economic calamity going on here."
First, he said, the district lost $300,000 in state school aid. Then, just before the school year ended, local voters rejected the school budget for the 10th time in 13 years. After the defeat, the town council cut $700,000 from the $7 million budget.
On Wednesday, a state judge, Kevin M. O'Halloran, ordered the striking teachers fined 1 percent of their gross annual pay for each day the strike lasts beyond today.
Like Little Ferry, scores of towns across New Jersey are struggling with loss of expected state aid for this year and the prospect of further decreases for years to come. In addition, in two years they will be required to take over from the state the payment of millions in teachers' pension contributions. Officials fear this will mean more trouble at the bargaining table -- and perhaps more strikes, despite laws prohibiting them in both states, including New York City.

HEADLINE: Failed Trip Shows Dinkins's Weak Spots

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
The sudden collapse of Mayor David N. Dinkins's trip to South Africa has painfully exposed two of his most acute vulnerabilities: his overreliance on one overworked aide, Deputy Mayor Bill Lynch, and his propensity to reach for the grandest gesture, even when times seem to demand the simplest.
Mr. Dinkins said he postponed the trip because Mr. Lynch had been too busy putting out fires in New York to raise the half-million dollars needed. A charter flight was to have taken the Mayor and several dozen city officials and business executives on a journey that had assumed the proportions of a royal tour. 
 But that disappointment epitomized something much bigger: With a government of a quarter-million workers, and his own top staff of five deputy mayors, Mr. Dinkins still has a hard time getting things done.
"It's a comment both on how tough times are, and on the way he dreams and doesn't plan things," said one of the Mayor's oldest political allies, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "I think it is a reflection that they don't have a designated chain of command and responsibility, but they expect Bill Lynch to be superhuman at the expense of his own health. Why the trip had to be planned in a way that made it so expensive and hard to pull off, I don't understand."
At the heart of matter is the Mayor's failure, nearly 21 months after taking office, to delegate power unequivocally to his staff. Instead, he has fostered a system in which Mr. Lynch, nominally in charge of politics, is his First Deputy in many other fields. First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel has the full powers of his title in other areas, with the rest of the staff left in some shifting and ill-defined terrain in between.
"It's gotten better, but it's still there," another deputy mayor said yesterday, speaking on condition on anonymity. "In periods of stress it comes out more."
That would be problematic enough if the Mayor had small aspirations, or faced easy tasks. But he plunges into ambitious projects that would daunt the best-oiled machine, from his plan to hire thousands of police officers to the South African trip.
By his own admission, Mr. Lynch also has great difficulty delegating responsibility, and he held the planning
 
A Citizens Committee
 for the trip close to himself because its goal was dear to him.
But Mr. Lynch, who has diabetes and serious vision problems, was so consumed trying to quell the recent racial violence in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, that he let fund raising for the trip slide, winning commitments for only about $200,000. On Tuesday, Mr. Dinkins was moved to public tears as he reflected on his aide's efforts and the toll they have taken on his health.
Yesterday, Mr. Lynch said he intended to set up a citizens committee to raise funds for the charter flight from foundations, corporations and individuals, which he said would pay special attention to any potential conflicts of interest involving donors who might do business with the city.
 
More Modest Missions
 Asked why he had not done that originally, Mr. Lynch said, "I think the time collapsed on me" and that he had dropped the ball. That was diplomatic, but the truth is more complex. Mr. Dinkins relies utterly on Mr. Lynch's counsel but has also seems to have taken him for granted, and the ball was the Mayor's to drop.
Every mayor adopts his own style, and Mr. Dinkins has struggled to find one that suits him. By turns, he has underestimated his real powers, repeatedly stressing how little he can do amid a fiscal crunch, and has clung fiercely to his ceremonial and symbolic importance, repeatedly making televised speeches with the flags and foofaraw of a Presidential event.
In both respects, the Mayor has been burdened by the insistent skepticism and soaring hopes that greeted his election as the city's first black mayor. He defended his ambitions for taking city finance, health, welfare, housing and other officials with him to South Africa as a way to lend expertise and foster economic ties to the struggling black majority there.
Other mayors have made more modest missions abroad and provoked little comment. Mr. Dinkins acknowledged that he could have made a quick trip with a handful of aides but that it would have left no more than a shadow. He plans much more: a mission of succor to struggling brethren and an effort to forge business links that he called an investment that would yield dividends "to every New Yorker" in a post-apartheid world.
 
A Snappy Immediacy
 "This is about making lasting relationships that will be helpful to this city with a very important country economically and strategically," Mr. Lynch said.
But that is an argument whose merits would have been debated by some if Mr. Dinkins could have pulled the trip off, and he could not, though his aides now say they hope to reschedule it for November.
The paradox is that Mr. Dinkins is seldom more effective than in small moments of personal contact. Lately, he has also grown noticeably more comfortable in the trenches of the mayoralty, buoyed by his visits, at all hours of the day and night, to the scenes of civic disasters, from the recent subway crash to Crown Heights. After such trips, he speaks with a snappiness and immediacy that has eluded him in the past.
Yesterday, the Mayor took pains to praise all his deputies, stressing that Mr. Steisel was the "guy in charge" and defending his diffuse organizational chart. But in doing so, he had an air of trying to persuade himself, too.
"People can complain about the service cuts and what not," he said. "But it is a situation that we face, and I think that we're handling it as well or better than anybody else could."

HEADLINE: Decline Follows a 2-Decade Boom in Lower Manhattan

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
After one of the most sweeping urban revivals in the nation in the 1970's and 80's, the southern tip of Manhattan has sunk into an economic morass that has many business executives worried and has prompted a fresh round of study at City Hall.
The area, roughly a square mile of densely packed real estate below Chambers Street, underwent radical change that began with the completion of the World Trade Center in 1972. It quickly became an example of how to mix housing with commercial buildings, and of how to open up a neglected waterfront for recreational use.
 
Towering Glass Structures
 The mammoth development of the 1980's replaced old concrete and brick office buildings -- most of them built before 1930 -- with towering glass structures that dominate an area that was and remains the world's most powerful center for finance. They housed offices, restaurants and nightlife and attracted a much more diverse variety of people to the area than the Wall Street workers who had made it their exclusive domain. 
 "Lower Manhattan is the economic engine which drives our city," Mayor David N. Dinkins said yesterday during a news conference with several corporate executives where he announced plans to study changes in the area, find ways to reinvigorate it and map out its long-term development.
The area, he said, is facing "very real, very difficult problems." Among the many questions are how to attract more residents, how to create greater access to undeveloped parts of the waterfront and what to do with obsolete office buildings.
 
The Initial Phases
 Commercial construction in lower Manhattan boomed in the 80's, when 20 million square feet of space was built, equivalent to that in most small cities. Apartments, restaurants and nightlife, virtually nonexistent before, sprung to life along the area's waterfront with the initial phases of Battery Park City and the completion of the South Street Seaport.
The development of the South Street Seaport, as well as the later renovation of the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, brought a surge of tourists to the area.
But now, while tourism shows no sign of slowing down, almost every other economic signal suggests that the resurgence has stopped, if only for the time being.
Office vacancies, which had dwindled to under 3 percent in 1981, rose steadily through the last decade and now exceed 20 percent. Housing construction at Battery Park City and elsewhere in the area is at a standstill. And many lower Manhattan businesses, from large brokerage firms to restaurants and small printing shops, have either gone out of business or are still suffering from the fallout of the 1987 stock-market crash and subsequent cuts in the securities industry.
In announcing the study yesterday, Mr. Dinkins said he had instructed the Department of Planning to prepare a comprehensive plan for the area, the first since 1966. He said the plan would be completed over the next year.
He also said that he had created a nonprofit advisory and research group, known as the "Lower Manhattan Project." The group will be financed by several large corporations, including the Olympia and York Companies U.S.A., the American Express Company, the Chase Manhattan Bank and the J. P. Morgan Company.
"Downtown employers and owners are painfully aware of the recession," said John Zuccotti, president of Olympia and York and chairman of the advisory group, which has obtained a commitment of $350,000 a year in corporate funds, and is looking for more. "We don't intend to sit back waiting for a recovery."
 
Time for an Update
 To be sure, the initiative announced yesterday amounts to little more than a study, and without the beginnings of an economic upturn no one expects immediate results. But if history repeats itself, or even comes close, the officials said, now is the time to update a plan for the area.
The last comprehensive plan for lower Manhattan set zoning guidelines, provided traffic and pedestrian studies and coordinated development plans for the South Street Seaport, World Trade Center and Battery Park City.
Although no huge commercial projects are now on the drawing board, the officials said yesterday that the city's plan needs to be updated if lower Manhattan is to continue to attract more housing and if tourism is to continue to grow. The city and private industry also need to plan for communications technology that will keep Wall Street competitive with other financial centers around the world.
 
A Long Evolution
 "Unlike plans for other eras, the thrust now is to manage and nurture what has happened," said Con Howe, the former executive director of the Department of City Planning, who has been appointed director of the advisory group.
Some of the questions to be addressed by the planners relate to the long evolution of lower Manhattan as a business center, and how to encourage the proper use of outmoded real estate.
Before the 1980's, the last surge of development came during the Wall Street boom of the 1920's. After the 1929 stock-market crash, developers avoided the area for more than three decades. During the postwar boom years, the flight of New York's middle class to the suburbs made midtown office locations, within walking distance of Penn Station and Grand Central Terminal, more attractive.
Because of the age of many of the lower Manhattan buildings, their wiring, low ceilings, small elevators and other limitations disqualified them for use by computer-driven corporations.
 
17 Apartment Complexes
 An alternative that has been discussed for years -- and will be studied by the planners -- is to renovate some of the old office space into housing. Real-estate executives have been lobbying City Hall to create incentives with tax abatements.
But the housing market in lower Manhattan, as elsewhere in the city, remains in a trough. At Battery Park City, the developers of the Cove Club, the latest of 17 apartment complexes completed since 1983, sold 57 of their 163 condominiums at auction in May, receiving only 75 percent of their asking prices. Seventy-eight of the condominiums remain unsold.
Other questions before the planners relate to undeveloped waterfront that is largely inaccessible to the public. Old industrial piers jut out into the East River below the South Street Seaport, and could be demolished or used to support restaurants or other recreational centers.
Mr. Howe said a priority of his group is to plan an esplanade that would run from the Seaport to Battery Park, which would then connect to the esplanade at Battery Park City.
Other recommendations to be considered include improvements in public transportation, the officials said yesterday. One option is to develop a new bus terminal in the Wall Street area, and provide express bus service from one or more midtown locations that would appeal to suburban commuters.

HEADLINE: BALTIMORE MAYOR LEADING IN POLLS

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BALTIMORE, Sept. 11

 BODY:
After a quiet, even lackluster primary campaign, Baltimore Democrats will go to the polls on Thursday to nominate a candidate for mayor, with the incumbent, Kurt L. Schmoke, the overwhelming favorite among the eight contenders.
Republicans will also choose a mayoral nominee, picking from six names on their ballot. 
 But Mr. Schmoke, the first black ever elected Mayor of Baltimore and the first political outsider to hold that job in almost two decades, has little to fear politically in the fall from any Republican, assuming he wins the required primary plurality on Thursday. Democrats outnumber Republicans almost 10 to 1 in this old port city, which is heavily blue collar and predominantly black.
Further, while Mr. Schmoke won office as an outsider in 1987, refusing to cut deals with the city's entrenched political clubs and arguing that the old politics had left the city broke and burdened with some of the worst urban ills in the country, he has since created his own powerful political organization.
 
Rising Star Is Sidetracked
 The city is still deeply troubled by crime, drugs, dilapidated housing, joblessness, a weak school system and a chronic shortage of money. Those problems have proven so intractable and so all-consuming in a time of national economic recession that Mr. Schmoke, who took office amid speculation that he would soon be one of the nation's most influential black politicians, has all but slipped off the national political scope.
His major moment in the national spotlight came when, to the surprise and concern of many of admirers, he suggested that one way to solve the nation's drug problem might be to legalize some drugs and concentrate on rehabilitation, not incarceration.
Nevertheless, if political experts and polls here are to be believed, Mr. Schmoke has persuaded a majority of voters that he is the candidate best suited to eventually solve the problems of the nation's 12th largest city. Most polls have given him a lead of better than 20 points over his nearest rival.
"I feel good about this election," Mr. Schmoke, who is 41 years old, said this afternoon as he campaigned in a blue-collar neighborhood in eastern Baltimore. "I think people understand that what I've been doing is laying a foundation for the city to move forward in the future. Some people say I'm not very flashy and that this has been a dull campaign. Well, protecting a city's bond rating may not be politically sexy, but it will pay off in the end."
 
Two Old Rivals Return
 Of the seven Democrats Mr. Schmoke faces on Thursday, only two are given even a long-shot chance to beat him. They are Clarence (Du) Burns, 72, a product of the political clubs and church organizations in the city's black wards, and William A. Swisher, 58, a former city prosecutor who came up through the clubs in the city's white, blue collar wards.
Mr. Schmoke, a local high school football star who became a Rhodes Scholar and a lawyer before entering politics, beat both men in earlier election contests with a coalition of blacks and liberal whites.
Mr. Schmoke predicted today that the coalition would hold for him on Thursday. But Mr. Burns predicted otherwise.
"No way it will hold again," he said at his campaign headquarters. "Four years ago I was down by more than 20 points, just like today, and in the last few hours I closed to within four points or so. There were a lot of people holding back then, and it's the same now, and they're my people, people who know I know how to make a city move."
Mr. Swisher, in between making calls to prospective voters, said all the candidates agreed that crime, drugs and schools were major campaign issues. "But they've been talked about so much, without results, that people are turned off," he said. "Voters want somebody who can get action. Schmoke hasn't been able to do that."

HEADLINE: SOVIET TURMOIL: GORBACHEV SAYS HE'S READY TO PULL TROOPS OUT OF CUBA AND END CASTRO'S SUBSIDIES;
Collision With Congress

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 11

 BODY:
The Bush Administration said today that it hoped that a Soviet military withdrawal from Cuba would lead to the downfall of Fidel Castro, but collided with Congress over how Washington should now press to achieve that central goal of American policy in the Western Hemisphere.
Clearly, word that the Soviet Union will soon open discussions to withdraw its military from Cuba produced a moment for the Bush Administration to savor. The President's own impatience with the Soviets was obvious. 
 "I wish they'd hurry up," he told reporters in the Oval Office in his only public comment on the development.
Speaking to reporters in Ashland, Ohio, where he was delivering a speech, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said, "The Soviet withdrawal is an indication that Fidel Castro, who has kept himself in power all these years by brute force, that his own days may be numbered."
But the Administration seemed unclear about how to go about accelerating that process.
Members of Congress immediately began floating proposals to toughen economic sanctions against Havana, make direct economic aid to the Soviet Union contingent on an end to all of Moscow's ties to Cuba, including economic ones, and stall the granting of favorable tariff treatment for the Soviet Union.
The White House tried to fend off those proposals, each of which conflicted with policy goals of its own.
Speaking with reporters outside the White House after a meeting with Mr. Bush, two Republican lawmakers, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas and Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, said the Soviet announcement, while welcome, did not go far enough. They insisted that all economic aid from Moscow to Cuba should be ended.
"We can't let this freedom tide wash over the world and not drown Fidel Castro," Senator Gramm said.
Representative Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey, agreed, saying: "It cannot be justified to provide financial assistance to the Soviet Union while they continue to squander their own resources in Cuba."
But the White House insisted that it was not linking Soviet aid to Cuba with American aid to Moscow.
"Our position has been and continues to be to oppose that sort of thing," an Administration official said, adding, "Besides, what's the hurry? It's going to happen in Cuba without our help."

HEADLINE: One Aquino's Painful Stand on Bases

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANILA, Sept. 12

 BODY:
Among the Philippine senators prepared to vote to shut down the largest American military base in Asia, none makes quite the same sacrifice as Senator Agapito Aquino, brother-in-law of President Corazon C. Aquino and younger brother of her slain husband, Benigno S. Aquino Jr.
Since he announced his opposition last month to a new 10-year American lease for the Subic Bay Naval Station, Senator Aquino says his relationship with the President -- a woman he describes affectionately as his "surrogate mother" -- has grown decidedly cool. 
 "I feel she is hurt by what I have done," Senator Aquino said as he sipped coffee today in the lounge just outside the Senate chamber where the debate over the future of the American base began Wednesday. "Our relationship now is civil, only civil."
But at the risk of family harmony, "I feel we must make this historic decision," he said, adding: "The time has come for the Philippines to put an end to the spirit of dependence on the United States. We need to cut the apron strings with America, even though we are scared to do it."
 
Petition Drive Considered
 Mrs. Aquino, in the middle of what she insists is the final year of her presidency, has staked her political credibility on ratification of the treaty, and the decision by her brother-in-law to vote against the pact came as an acute embarrassment.
Her chief aide, Franklin Drilon, said today that if the Senate rejected the treaty, the Aquino administration would consider staging a petition drive to collect the millions of signatures necessary to hold a national referendum on the issue.
It remains unclear whether a referendum on the bases could overturn a Senate rejection of the treaty. Under the Philippine Constitution, the Senate has the exclusive right to ratify or reject treaties.
Mr. Aquino is one of 12 members of the 23-member Senate who have announced their opposition to the base agreement, which would allow the United States to operate at Subic until the year 2001. A vote on the pact is expected sometime before Monday, when the current treaty expires.
Although Mr. Aquino is obviously closer to the President than any of his 11 anti-base colleagues -- he lived in the home of his brother and Mrs. Aquino for a time in the 1950's and describes himself as "like her eldest son" -- other Senators have longstanding ties to the President. Indeed, only two members of the Philippine Senate were elected without Mrs. Aquino's endorsement.
 
'Difficult for All of Us'
 "It's very hard to go against the President you respect and you love," said the 52-year-old lawmaker. "It has been difficult for us all."
Even though opinion polls show overwhelming public support for the treaty, the Senate appears ready to reject the treaty for reasons of national sovereignty and national pride.
Some of the senators say they do not oppose the idea of an American base on Philippine soil so much as they object to what is often described on the Senate floor as the insultingly small compensation package offered by the Bush Administration: $203 million a year, less than a quarter of the original request by Mrs. Aquino's negotiating team.
Senator Aquino's objection is one of strict nationalism, however. He says it is time for the Philippines, while retaining the friendship of the United States, to issue its "declaration of independence" from foreign paternalism.
Mr. Aquino said the nation would somehow deal with the economic consequences of an American withdrawal: the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars injected into the Philippine economy each year from Subic.
"The job dislocation weighs heavily on us," he said, but added: "We also worried about the more than three million other Filipinos who are unemployed across the nation at this time."
Benigno Aquino, a leader of opposition to President Ferdinand E. Marcos, was gunned down at Manila's international airport as he returned from exile in 1983, setting in motion a chain of events leading to the election of his widow as the nation's leader and the downfall of Mr. Marcos when he tried to steal the election.
Senator Aquino said he beleved that his elder brother would have supported the removal of American troops from the Philippines. "I think my brother shared the belief that the bases should go," he said.

HEADLINE: Hostage Issue: Test for Iran's President

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TEHERAN, Iran, Sept. 12

 BODY:
Western diplomats here said today that a full solution to the hostage crisis in Lebanon, which now seems possible, will strengthen President Hashemi Rafsanjani against hard-liners.
Mr. Rafsanjani is trying to restore capitalism in Iran and attract foreign investment after years of revolutionary confiscations and a destructive war with Iraq. 
 The climactic hostage negotiations now being directed by the United Nations Secretary General, Javier Perez de Cuellar, come at a time of severe testing for the so-called pragmatic group of revolutionary clerics led by Mr. Rafsanjani. They have been trying to consolidate their power ever since the death in 1989 of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Iranian leader.
The economy here after the Iran-Iraq war remains depressed and contorted by artificial controls. The Government's economic reform program is tearing away subsidies and sending food and other basic prices soaring. The birth rate is adding a million Iranians every six months to the population of 57 million. By one estimate, the Government would have to add 500,000 jobs this year and achieve a growth rate of 4.5 percent, considered an impossible goal, just to stand still.
 
Farms and Factories Sag
 Most of the country's $12 billion in annual oil revenues is paying for imported food and other commodities once produced by Iranian industry and agriculture, both of which are moribund after years of centralized mismanagement during the war.
The first postwar development plan calls for $120 billion in spending over five years to rebuild oil, energy and other important sectors. But the plan is staggering under the weight of demands from the swelling population and restrictions during the five years on foreign borrowing, which cannot exceed $28 billion, a fraction of the needed cash.
The Western businessmen who have flocked here in the last two years have found Iran quick to order but slow to pay. Islamic codes on such fundamentals as arbitration of disputes have caused many companies to balk.
But in the short term, the new momentum on the hostage front in Lebanon gives Mr. Rafsanjani an important victory over his still formidable opposition, Western envoys said.
 
Crucial Election Campaign
 Mr. Rafsanjani and his supporters are in the midst of a crucial parliamentary election campaign against the hard-liners, who have held a rough majority since their election in early 1988 during the final days of uncompromising militancy in the Iran-Iraq war.
This Parliament attacks Western aid and influence as "domination," and rejects all but limited Western financing for badly needed projects. It still bristles at any talk of re-establishing relations with the United States. Political fences with Britain were mended last year while Parliament was in recess.
Key hard-liners include militants who helped direct the takeover of the United States Embassy here in 1979 and revolutionary judges who ordered thousands of executions after the overthrow of the Shah.
But Mr. Rafsanjani's policy of bringing the hostage crisis to an end may be on its way to vindication against the hard-liners in the 270-seat Parliament, where many argued that Israel and the United States would fail to respond to Iranian "good will" gestures like the release last month of the hostages John McCarthy and Edward A. Tracy.
The date for the election has not been set, but Iranian officials said it could come as early as February.
"The Parliament still has the means and the power to obstruct his policies," said a Western Ambassador who is among the longest-serving foreign diplomats here. "And if Rafsanjani succeeds to establish a reliable majority in his favor, it will be much easier to pursue his goals."
Until that happens, said one businessman who stayed here through the revolutionary decade, "the situation is still not secure for people to bring their money back into the country."
An attempt this year to persuade Iran's wealthy expatriates to return and invest has so far failed to produce results, according to a wide variety of Iranian and Western officials.
Part of their fear is that Mr. Rafsanjani will somehow fail and Iran will tumble back into the abyss of xenophobic isolation that characterizes the radical style. Therefore, most analysts here agree, to succeed politically Mr. Rafsanjani and the pragmatic mullahs must succeed economically.
"Rafsanjani could be killed at any time, which is in the tradition of Iranian politics, and then what?" asked a Western Ambassador whose government has been at the forefront of supporting Mr. Rafsanjani's policies.
 
'It Will Take Years'
 What is also clear, this and other Western ambassadors interviewed said, is that Mr. Rafsanjani does not have unlimited time to correct the severe dislocations that were built into Iran's once-robust economy by a decade of revolutionary excess.
The Ambassador said that "even after the election, it will still take years" to rebuild industries and attract the kind of investment that will put Iran back on a stable footing.
All of the political handicapping thus far suggests that Mr. Rafsanjani will be able to defeat the so-called radical majority. Still working in partnership with the country's new spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the President has defeated several attempts by hard-liners to exploit economic discontent to undermine his Government.
And in a potent political warning shot last fall, Mr. Rafsanjani demonstrated his tactical shrewdness against the hard-liners when he got a number of them removed from the powerful Consultative Assembly of Experts by forcing candidates to take a written test on Islamic law.
Not surprisingly, several hard-liners failed and were ejected from the panel.

HEADLINE: U.S. Reluctant to Move To Hasten Castro's Fall

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 12

 BODY:
Although the Bush Administration believes that Moscow's plan to withdraw its military from Cuba may weaken Fidel Castro, it is reluctant to move to hasten his fall because it does not want to make Cuba a sour point in Soviet-American relations or risk antagonizing Washington's Latin American allies, Administration officials said today.
On its face, the Administration's hesitation to make any major policy changes after President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's announcement about Cuba on Wednesday seems odd against the backdrop of history. 
 It has been a virtual obsession of United States policy to oust President Castro and to end the Soviet military presence in the Caribbean, which brought the superpowers to the brink of nuclear war during the Cuban missile crisis in 1962 and provided an ideological linchpin for Ronald Reagan's campaign against Communism in the Western Hemisphere.
Administration officials argued today that there is little the United States can do to interfere in Cuban politics, especially in light of its spectacular failures in Cuba in the past. They said that any attempt to intervene would risk inflaming anti-Washington sentiment in Latin America, where the Bush Administration had to work for months to repair the political damage from the invasion of Panama in 1989.
 
Risks for Bush
 But Mr. Gorbachev's announcement on Wednesday underscored the limits of an American policy that one official acknowledged was "long on declarations and short on actions." And inaction by Washington in the face of a prospective Soviet military withdrawal could pose political risks for Mr. Bush.
Mr. Bush has had the luxury of watching Communism crumble in this hemisphere, without undertaking the kind of overt and covert anti-Communist acts on which Mr. Reagan's Latin American policy stumbled and ultimately foundered.
But Mr. Bush has sometimes been faulted for not moving forcefully in response to world events. Some Administration officials fear inaction on Cuba could alienate Florida's substantial Cuban-American vote in an election year and draw criticism from conservatives as their attention wavers from the Soviet Union.
Administration officials and some outside specialists argue that the decline in the Soviet military threat and the fall of other Marxist governments in Latin America in recent years has reduced the significance of Cuba. Moreover, they said, it is the Cuban military and Soviet economic aid, not the Kremlin's uniformed presence, that keep Mr. Castro in power in this post-cold-war environment.
The Administration officials rejected proposals to link American economic aid and trade benefits for the Soviet Union to a halt in Soviet aid to Cuba. They argued that Moscow would be forced relatively soon to curtail its subsidies to the Cuban economy in any case, and that President Bush does not want to sour Soviet-American relations by attaching such conditions.
"There's this nagging sense that an important moment has come," said Susan Kaufman Purcell, a specialist on Latin America who is vice president of the Americas Society in New York. "Part of me thinks there is something that we should be doing other than let it fall by its own weight. But I can't think what it is."
Some officials are pressing the White House and other agencies at least to step up rhetorical attacks on the Cuban Government and continue their calls for the Soviet Union to cut off all military and economic aid to Cuba.
"The Administration has not really focused on this but we are going to have to start because of what the Soviets announced," one official said.
"There's going to be a lot of interest among conservatives on Cuba and it could become a political problem again," he added. "The trouble is, no one inside or outside the Administration has had a coherent approach outside of saying, 'You have to support human rights, you've got to stop supporting guerrilla movements, you've got to have elections.' "
 
Real Value of Subsidies
 Administration officials said they still believed that only Mr. Castro's death could bring down his Government, unless the eventual withdrawal of Soviet subsidies causes such economic chaos that the military or a popular uprising unseats Cuba's 64-year-old leader.
Wayne Smith, the former head of the American interests section in Cuba and a critic of American policy on Cuba, said the United States has consistently overestimated the value of the Soviet subsidies, which largely take the form of Soviet oil traded for Cuban sugar.
Ms. Purcell said: "It would be different if Cuba's dictatorship were kept in place basically by Soviet troops, but that is not the situation. Cuba's dictatorship has for a while been kept in place mainly by Cuban troops. This is the most highly militarized regime in the hemisphere."

HEADLINE: North Korea Tries to Block Any Effects of Failed Soviet Coup

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 12

 BODY:
Citing the dangers of a cholera epidemic in South Korea, North Korea canceled a meeting with officials from Seoul last month. Then last weekend, the North Koreans tried to confine presumably diseased delegates from the South to their hotel rooms in Pyongyang.
Cholera, of course, is hardly seen as the problem. What is feared by one of the world's last Stalinist redoubts, it seems, is contamination by the breakup of the old Soviet empire and the final dissolution of its once dependable alliance with Moscow. 
 Since the failure of the hard-line coup against President Mikhail S. Gorbachev last month, North Korea has acknowledged that a "vortex of fast-changing history" is under way. But the Government also declared proudly that no sign of even the "slightest political instability or vacillation" was visible in the country.
"The invincible might of our own style of socialism is being highly demonstrated," Pak Sung Chul, the Vice President, told a rally last weekend, the North Korean press agency said. He called on everyone to unite once more around the 79-year-old self-proclaimed Great Leader, Kim Il Sung.
 
North Is 'Basically Stable'
 Americans, Japanese and South Korean specialists agree that there is no sign of any instability in North Korea, despite the tumultuous recent events in the Soviet Union. No one has ever found any evidence of any dissident movement in North Korea, for instance.
"They're definitely in a state of shock because of the changes around the world," said Rhee Sang Woo, professor of political science at Sogang University in Seoul. "But the political situation in North Korea is basically stable. Nothing there is going to change."
Speculation about the future of Mr. Kim has long focused on his son and anointed successor, Kim Jong Il, known as the Dear Leader. Some in the West say there might be instability once the transfer actually occurs. But again there is no sign that a transition has been affected by recent events.
Japanese diplomats, the only ones from the democratic countries to engage in high-level talks with North Korea recently, say the Pyongyang Government seems to be digging in. The Japanese attempt to improve relations with North Korea thus appears to have reached a stalemate.
 
Push for Nuclear Inspections
 "At first it seemed like they wanted to move ahead," said a Japanese diplomat who met with the North Koreans last week in Beijing. "But now it seems like they are losing some interest in normalizing relations with us."
North and South Korea have remained in a state of war since the end of the Korean War nearly 40 years ago, with more than a million troops facing each other and the West increasingly frightened by evidence that North Korea is proceeding with a program to produce nuclear weapons.
Japanese diplomats are pushing North Korea to agree to a regime of inspections and safeguards for their nuclear sites. They also have held discussion on North Korea's demands for reparations from Japan's colonization of the peninsula until the end of World War II.
North Korea has said it will sign an agreement to accept the safeguards. But Japanese say there is little sign that Pyongyang intends to follow through. Instead, North Korea continues to demand simultaneous inspection of nuclear weapons in the American military presence in the South.
[In Vienna, North Korea said it would not sign an agreement to allow international inspection of its nuclear installations because it still faced a threat from American nuclear weapons in South Korea.
["The question of signing a nuclear safeguards agreement cannot be solved as long as the nuclear threat to our country by the United States persists," a North Korean spokesman told journalists at a meeting of the board of governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
[At the meeting, the governors empowered the agency's Director General, Hans Blix, to sign a nuclear safeguards agreement negotiated earlier this year between the United Nations agency and Pyongyang.]
 
U.N. Membership
 For at least two years, North Korea has in fact been buffeted by adverse developments.
Well before this summer, Mr. Gorbachev moved steadily to improve ties with South Korea, ending the special relationship with Pyongyang that has also served as an economic lifeline.

HEADLINE: Inquiry on Texas Crash Focuses on the Airplane

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Sept. 12

 BODY:
Federal investigators today focused on the possibility that a mechanical or structural failure caused a Continental Express commuter plane to burst into flame in midair on Wednesday, killing all 14 people on board.
Agents of both the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms were at the site of the crash about 75 miles southwest of here today in an effort to determine whether foul play was involved. 
 But Rolando Moss, a spokesman for the Houston field office of the F.B.I., said this afternoon, "We have found no evidence that would lead us to believe that some kind of incendiary device or bomb caused the crash."
The aircraft, a Brazilian-made Embraer 120 Brasilia, crashed into a cornfield shortly after 10 A.M. Wednesday while on a regularly scheduled flight between Laredo, Tex., and Houston.
Airline and Federal officials said that just before it went down, the aircraft was flying at an altitude of 11,800 feet in clear, calm weather and that the pilot had reported no difficulties to air-traffic controllers.
A senior Federal official at the scene of the crash said this afternoon that investigators were focusing their attention on the aircraft's left wing and its engine, which tore off the wing and landed 75 to 100 yards from the rest of the wreckage. The plane's left wing came down with other major parts of the wreckage and was folded under the right wing, which investigators said was highly unusual.
The official, who asked not to be identified, said that evidence collected on the ground had confirmed reports by witnesses that the plane had caught fire while in the air.
Investigators were still trying to establish the cause of the loud bang heard by those witnesses. The senior official said that after an initial inspection, investigators had concluded that the housing of the left engine showed no evidence of an explosion or of the kind of massive engine failure that would have sent pieces of machinery piercing through the housing.
Officials said that the bodies of all the passengers were found either in the forward or aft sections of the plane and that they were not wearing seat belts. They said this suggested that the passengers might have been trying to move away from a fire on the wing or in the center of the aircraft.
The plane apparently fell in a flat spin after it caught fire in a descent, which would have taken a minute or more, allowing passengers time to move from their seats, investigators said.
 
Diamonds Are Recovered
 Investigators said tonight that they had recovered from the wreckage about $500,000 worth of diamonds that was in the luggage of one passenger. They said that they had looked for the gems after a business associate of the passenger called to inform them that the diamonds were on the plane. The diamonds have been turned over to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for safekeeping. The passenger was not identified.
The Embraer 120 has a history of incidents in which pilots have lost control of the propeller's pitch, the angle at which it bites into the air. A defect believed to be the source of the problem was discovered on an Embraer 120 that crashed April 5 near Brunswick, Ga., killing 23 people, including former Senator John Tower of Texas.
The plane that crashed on Wednesday had been inspected under a Federal directive issued after the Georgia crash and no defects were discovered in it, airline officials said.
A team of investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board arrived at the scene of Wednesday's crash this morning and removed both the voice and data flight recorders from the severely burnt wreckage of the fuselage. The recorders, which take down conversations in the cockpit and various data on the aircraft's movements, including speed and altitude, were sent to an board's laboratory in Washington for analysis.
The names of 11 passengers and three crew members killed were released today by Continental Express, a subsidiary of Continental Airlines. The Associated Press reported that among the 11 passengers was Guillermina Valdes, a noted scholar of the sociology and economy of the United States-Mexican border who was director of the Ciudad Juarez branch of the Collegio della Frontera Norte, a research institute.
Federal law enforcement officials were called into the investigation of the crash on Wednesday because of numerous reports by witnesses that a loud sound like that of an explosion had preceded the aircraft's fiery descent, Mr. Moss of the F.B.I. said.
Their attention was heightened when they were informed by the Drug Enforcement Administration that an informer in on-going Federal drug investigations was supposed to be on the plane, officials of several agencies said. But Bill Ruzzamenti, chief spokesman at drug agency's headquarters in Washington, said, "We have absolutely no information at all to indicate that foul play was in any way directed towards our people."

HEADLINE: Soviet Pullback From Cuba: A Red Letter Day in Miami

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, Sept. 12

 BODY:
On the streets of Little Havana and over the airwaves of this city's Spanish-language radio stations, there was jubilation and more than a bit of gloating today, as the news that the Soviet Union plans to withdraw its troops from Cuba was passed from mouth to mouth and analyzed on talk shows.
"This is the best news that Cuban exiles have received in 32 years," said Tomas Regalado, news director at Radio Mambi, a popular Spanish-language station. "There is a tremendous sense of euphoria and the feeling that we have begun a new era in the Cuban drama. People see this as the beginning of the end of the Castro regime." 
 "He'll be gone by February," Juan Gonzalez, an exultant 61-year-old stevedore, forecast this morning as he stood with a knot of fellow Cuban refugees at a fruit stand on Calle Ocho, in the heart of Little Havana.'
Others, however, were more skeptical, made wary by three decades of constant predictions that the end of Communism in Cuba was imminent. Over the years, the more than one million Cuban-Americans, most of whom live in the Miami area, have learned to discount the rumors that Mr. Castro is afflicted with an incurable disease, that a military plot to overthrow him is afoot, or that he plans to step down and ask for asylum in Mexico or Spain.
 
Is This Time Different
 "I have been hearing that Castro is going to fall ever since I arrived in this country nearly 19 years ago," Juan Suquet, a retired physician, scoffed as he sipped coffee in the Casa Sierra diner. "I'll believe it when I see him stretched out horizontally, but not before."
Still, the prevailing opinion seems to be that this time things are different. The failure of last month's coup attempt in the Soviet Union and the end of 70 years of Communism have been followed by a series of events that have undercut Mr. Castro's ties to his former patrons.
"This is the first time ever that the majority of Cuban exiles really believe it when they say 'Christmas Eve in Havana,' " Mr. Regalado said. "It's something people say every year, but now they have reason to believe it."
Just last week, for example, the Cuban American National Foundation, one of the most militant of exile groups, said it has been granted permission to open a Moscow office. The organization helped pay for Boris Yeltsin's visit to the United States in 1989, and its members have cheered as officials close to Mikhail S. Gorbachev suggest that future aid to Cuba be tied to free elections there.
 
Stronghold No Longer?
 "Fidel Castro's stronghold is no longer his stronghold," said Carlos Arboleya, a banker and foundation supporter who last week raised the issue of a Soviet withdrawal with Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Yeltsin on the "Town Meeting" broadcast on ABC. "We are now in a position to lobby in Moscow as we do in Washington, on a par with Castro, or maybe even stronger."
Some older people have already begun planning their return, dreaming of reclaiming houses they left behind 30 or more years ago and seeing friends and relatives left behind. "I can live in Havana on my Social Security and come back here to visit any time I want," explained Jose Faz, who is 75.
Younger Cuban-Americans, especially those born and educated here, seemed less interested in the news from Moscow, however. Some said they see the possible end of the Castro regime as an opportunity to return and to make their fortune, or they look forward to participating in the reconstruction of the country. But few seemed as enthusiastic as their elders about returning.
"My life is here, and I like it," said Jose Galera, 25, assistant operations manager at a tire dealership. "I can't say I have a lot of loyalty to Cuba, because I've never been there or seen it. I'm curious, because my father was in anti-Castro groups, and my roots are there, but it's not like I'm dying to go back and stay."
 
Castro as a House Guest?
 "I'm staying here, but I'll do anything I can to help bring about Castro's fall," Teresita Avila, the 30-year-old owner of the Casa Sierra diner, said. "If he needs asylum somewhere, he can even come to Miami and stay in my house. I'm willing to make that sacrifice."
"Hush, child, don't you dare say a thing like that," said her mother, a seamstress who helps out at the diner. "He better not show his face here. He wouldn't last a half an hour."
The Soviet decision -- and the accompanying announcement that economic relations with Cuba will be put on a more realistic footing -- immediately intensified the longstanding debate here about the propriety of sending aid in any form to relatives in Cuba. Trade experts estimate that family visits, money and packages sent from Miami created revenues of more than $225 million last year.
As Cuba's credit and trade with the outside world dry up, that lifeline has become increasingly important to the Cuban economy. But those who oppose Castro argue that commerce, permitted for humanitarian reasons despite the trade embargo, should be cut off to hasten the collapse of communism.
"My children, mother and brothers are still in Cuba," said Hector Calzada Duran, 52, a florist who arrived here in 1980 with the Mariel flotilla. "I love them, but I love my country more. I don't want to see any food, clothing or medicine whatsoever going to Cuba. A breach has been opened, and we have to push Fidel Castro through it, for the good of our children."
But Agustin Tamargo, a newspaper columnist and radio commentator, said that to suspend such shipments "would be an act of inhumanity."
And one young woman, who did not want to give her name, said that when "I send a package of medicine to my mother, I'm not helping Fidel, I'm helping my mother. The people over there are already suffering enough.

HEADLINE: School Bells Ring, Nervously

 BODY:
New York City schools reopened this week, welcoming nearly a million children in a mixed atmosphere of uncertainty and optimism. The city's faltering economy has forced cutbacks at a time when promising reforms like school-based management were just starting to take hold. But even though conditions in many schools will be far from idyllic, officials have made admirable efforts to shield students from the worst consequences of the budget cuts.
The opening of school is always marked by promise. It's a new start in a new grade. But in some schools there weren't enough supplies. And 128 teaching vacancies remain, mostly in hard-to-fill subjects like speech therapy. As with other city services, education has suffered; the schools have been forced to cut $430 million from a nearly $7 billion budget. 
 Such austerity recalls the fiscal crisis in 1975, which resulted in layoffs of 14,000 teachers and hundreds of guidance counselors, school health workers and other support personnel.
The present crisis tested the ability of administrators to devise creative solutions. Schools Chancellor Joseph Fernandez has reduced central administrative positions and stressed more collaborative efforts among teachers, parents and the business community. Even so, the cutbacks will mean larger class sizes in some schools, fewer after-school programs and guidance counselors and higher prices for school lunches.
But Mr. Fernandez, the Board of Education and the teachers' and supervisors' unions deserve credit for supporting early retirement plans, thereby avoiding more drastic layoffs that would have seriously disrupted classrooms. Nearly 4,200 teachers and 700 principals and supervisors chose to retire early. About 2,000 new teachers have been hired. While the system has lost experienced professionals, it has also gained new talent that might be more receptive to reform.
Now the system will need all its talent and energy to sustain and improve upon several modest triumphs last year: an increase in reading and math scores, an improvement in elementary school attendance and an increase in the number of high school graduates.
It is difficult to predict how schools will be affected by the city's troubles. But the best way to spare the children is to focus remaining resources on classroom services -- as Mr. Fernandez has wisely done.

HEADLINE: Cuba III

 BODY:
Fidel Castro was not the only person rattled by Mikhail Gorbachev's announcement that Soviet military forces are to be withdrawn from Cuba. Ever since Cuba I, the disastrous 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion, and Cuba II, the horrifying 1962 missile crisis, Cuba has been viewed by Washington as an offshore threat and by Moscow as a strategic toehold in the Western Hemisphere.
But now hard-liners still worried about the last traces of cold war are robbed of yet another verity. If there's ever to be a Cuba III, it's likely to be a strictly homegrown affair in which Cubans decide among themselves the future of their society. 
 Nikita Khrushchev's reckless deployment of nuclear weapons in Cuba brought a shocked world to the nuclear brink in 1962. Disaster was avoided when he removed the missiles and President Kennedy agreed to a compromise that permitted a limited Soviet military presence in Cuba. But for years afterward, angry arguments persisted over the size, equipment and purposes of what Moscow still calls a "training brigade."
Shielded by the Soviet Union's power, Mr. Castro turned Cuba into an arsenal and training camp for hemisphere revolutionaries. He armed a dozen insurgencies and sent his own army to fight wars in Africa.
Washington responded by tightening Cuba's economic blockade and moving against radical regimes in Nicaragua and Grenada and an elected left-wing Government in Chile. "No more Cubas" became a rallying cry that swayed Presidents and Congress.
What proved a fantasy was the belief that Cuba was responsible for every indigenous revolution and that Mr. Castro's doctrines were the true menace. It was the Moscow connection that gave Havana its clout. Soviet subsidies were essential to keep the Cuban economy afloat; the global reach of Communism inspired Latin guerrillas.
Now the Soviet gods have failed Fidel Castro. Without billions in subsidies, Cuban Socialism is bankrupt. And when the last Soviet "adviser" sails home, Cuba will have lost its status as a Soviet outpost lying, in the timeworn right-wing alarum, just 90 miles from Florida. The final humiliation is that Havana was neither consulted nor forewarned about Mr. Gorbachev's statement to Secretary of State James Baker.
Thus Fidel Castro has been shrunk to his actual size, an eccentric autocrat clinging to a crumbling ideology. In 1961, Senator J. William Fulbright argued vainly against what proved to be the Bay of Pigs fiasco. He said in a memorandum to President Kennedy that revolutionary unrest in Latin America predated Mr. Castro and, in the absence of political and economic reforms, would outlive him.
"The Castro regime is a thorn in the flesh," Mr. Fulbright said, "but it is not a dagger in the heart." Fidel Castro lingers on in power, yet with this latest transformation of Soviet policy even the thorn has lost its sting.

HEADLINE: A New C.I.A., Without Gates

BYLINE: By Flora Lewis; Flora Lewis is Senior Columnist of The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
No matter how the K.G.B. is disassembled, Moscow will retain an active military and political espionage service. And the U.S. still needs an effective, comprehensive intelligence service. But the K.G.B. and C.I.A. have largely kept each other in business as justification for much of their activities. As Communism and the Soviet state structure crumble and as secrets of Eastern European spy networks are disclosed, it has become increasingly evident that none brought their own side that much advantage.
So the U.S. should think carefully before stumbling on with the C.I.A. as it exists. There is an opportunity for a fundamental review of what the C.I.A. can and cannot do well, what it should and should not do. 
 The Congress is preparing the wrong questions for President Bush's nominee to head the agency, Robert Gates. Whatever his role in the Iran-contra debacle, an especially flamboyant but not atypical clandestine caper, Mr. Gates is steeped in the traditional C.I.A. approach.
Weirdly, he is credited for being right in insisting that Mikhail Gorbachev's attempt at reform would not change the Soviet Union and that the U.S. should not take it seriously. True, Mr. Gorbachev failed in his original intention of strengthening the Soviet Union and its Communist Party. But Mr. Gates failed to see the implications of Mr. Gorbachev's policies. He's old school -- hardly a qualification to meet new needs.
He is not alone. An argument is building that the end of the cold war means the C.I.A. should be reinforced and expanded because there is a diffusion of threats to the U.S. without there being a No. 1 enemy. Recognizing the importance of economic challenge, advocates want a big effort to collect economic secrets from allies and friends as well as potential foes.
This is what Stansfield Turner, the former Director of Central Intelligence, says in the current issue of Foreign Affairs. Even Admiral Turner, who tried to clean things up at Langley, Va., clings to the idea that secrecy is the best way to collect and assess information, which, as he rightly says, brings power.
He calls for a "symbiotic relationship" between U.S. intelligence and business, and a willingness, throughout the Government at least, to provide a "cover" for spies. "All agencies should be instructed that human spying is a Presidentially and Congressionally authorized activity and they should have a role in it," he writes. Shades of the K.G.B.!
In the search for new missions, do spooks think they can beat out America's competitors when what is needed is energetic, persistent marketing, long-term investment planning and labor-management cooperation on steady, first-quality production?
Mr. Turner grants major C.I.A. failures: not understanding signs of the invasion of Kuwait, the unpopularity of the Shah and the rise of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the electoral defeat of the Sandinistas in Nicaragua and, above all, the decay of the Soviet economy. These are good examples of things that went wrong, not to speak of the harm done to U.S. interests in justifying protection of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega for a long time. But alert reporters, diplomats and travelers could and did notice the relevant facts in the cases he cites.
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan has proposed eliminating the agency, separating technical from political intelligence and putting the latter under the State Department. There are two drawbacks to this approach. One is that when responsibility for policy and critical information are combined, established policy tends to force production of the information that supports its case. The second is that diversity is suppressed.
Rather, the C.I.A. should be retained as a technical and analytical service, drastically limiting reliance on secrecy except in such obvious matters as trying to infiltrate terrorist groups, and with a better sense of real U.S. interests in the world. The former deputy director, Bobby Inman, is a professional who would understand this. The directorship is not a job for a swashbuckler like the late, disastrous William Casey or Robert Gates.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
The Third Side

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
When the slaughter begins again in China, the West will be horrified and indignant. After all, we are not made of stone.
Of course, this time we will not actually see much of the murders by Communist troops. Beijing's rulers have learned one lesson from their warm-up at Tiananmen Square -- blind the cameras. 
 When three members of the House of Representatives recently placed a few white silk flowers on the ground at the square, a gesture that honored the dead and graced America, the guards rushed to do battle against the cameras.
Still, we will get word about the new slaughter and we will certainly be seriously annoyed. But it will have happened because the third side was silent or passive.
In every political prison, whether it is a single jail or a whole nation, there are three sides. The dictatorship and its police, judges and wardens are one side and the prisoners are the second. The third is the outside world -- when it fights for the prisoners, keeps their names alive, uses the pressures of political, economic and public opinion power against their captors.
Over decades, as Soviet anti-Communist democrats fought and were jailed, as they were released and continued the fight, as changes took place in the Soviet Union, much of the rest of the world watched day by day and spoke out. In all free countries were people of influence and voice who struggled to push Soviet Communists toward the individual freedoms that led to a nation's freedom.
Whatever future Soviet citizens now decide for themselves and at whatever price, the fact is that the anti-Communist revolution was victorious without great bloodshed. Every Soviet democrat and every Soviet Communist knows that one important reason was that the third side was worldwide.
But where is the third side now for China -- for all the Chinese students and workers who still rot in the Chinese gulag, for all their friends and families living in silence and shadow, for all Chinese who despise the Communists and, yes, for all Chinese who say let us be as we are, because they have never known anything but oppression, all their lives?
Absent -- but why? The reasons are in our political and intellectual "leadership" and, I believe, in racism.
Americans have the whole world banging on their brains but pay attention when their elected leaders, particularly the President, speak up for a cause, in decency's name. President Bush's message about this last Communist anchor is oh, let's go ahead and do business with them, and everything will be all right -- trust me, "I know China."
A saddening number of academics and journalists argue against the mildest of sanctions, raising tariffs to push Beijing -- not to give up Communism, Heavens no, but just to let some democrats out of prison and allow them to breathe.
Too many Americans do not seem able to see Asians as real -- certainly not as real as other people who suffer, Europeans if the Americans are white, Africans if they are black.
Beijing hears that tolling bell in the Soviet Union. The old men or their successors will either have to fall back step by step to freedom, knowing the result will be a relatively peaceful end to Communism, or fight the people with tanks.
If the third side remains silent, Beijing will fight. Why not? The Chinese Communists have silenced the U.S. for whatever most peculiar combination of personal and political reasons govern Mr. Bush on China, silenced America even after Tiananmen, through the gulag and slave labor, through genocide in Tibet and now through secret Chinese missile sales to Syria, known to Washington. Most peculiar.
Americans, public and private, can lessen the likelihood of slaughter in China, as they did in the Soviet Union -- by putting economic and political prices on repression. It is too late for guarantees against massacre, but it is the only chance.
With Mr. Bush showing his Chinese expertise by doing nothing, hope rests on Congress. Friends of freedom, please write loving notes to the representatives who spoke their minds to the Communists and then placed the white flowers -- Nancy Pelosi of California and Ben Jones of Georgia, Democrats, and John Miller of Washington, Republican. They were America's third side at Tiananmen Square.

HEADLINE: THE SOVIET TRANSITION;
Gorbachev Asks A Huge Increase In Food Relief

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 12

 BODY:
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union sent urgent letters to the European Community and the head of the Group of Seven industrial democracies today seeking food aid on a scale dwarfing previous Western commitments.
In a letter to Jacques Delors, the president of the European Community, Mr. Gorbachev said the Soviet Union needed $6 billion to $7.3 billion worth of free food for the coming winter, said Ella Krucoff, a spokeswoman here for the community. 
 A spokeswoman for Prime Minister John Major of Britain said that he had received a similar letter but declined to discuss its contents. Mr. Major is the current chairman of the Group of Seven, which also includes the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Italy and Canada.
 
Concern Over Unrest
 The requests underlined increasing Soviet and Western concerns about the adequacy of Soviet food supplies this winter and the possibility that shortages could lead to a breakdown of civil order there.
In another indication of the Soviet Union's potential problems in feeding itself this winter, the Agriculture Department announced today that this year's Soviet grain harvest was likely to be about 20 percent smaller than last year's. The estimate was near the optimistic end of predictions by agriculture experts for a 20 to 30 percent drop.
Soviet officials have been estimating a drop of 23 to 28 percent, said Carol G. Brookins, a Washington agriculture consultant who was in Moscow last week.
Today's letters from Mr. Gorbachev were similar to a letter that Frans Andriessen, the European Community's Commissioner for External Relations and Trade Policy, received on Wednesday from Ivan S. Silayev, the head of Soviet economic planning.
Mr. Gorbachev's letter today asked the European Community for specific quantities of food in 17 categories. These included 5.5 million metric tons of grain, 900,000 metric tons of meat, 900,000 metric tons of sugar, 350,000 metric tons of butter, 300,000 metric tons of flour and 300,000 metric tons of vegetable fat.
Ms. Krucoff said that the European Community had no immediate reaction to the request and that a senior Soviet official would visit Brussels on Sept. 18 and 19 to explain the reasons for it.
Mr. Delors told the European Parliament on Wednesday that the European Community should send $2 billion worth of food to the Soviet Union immediately. In an appeal directed at Washington, Tokyo and Ottawa, he also said that all of the Group of Seven countries should send food.
The European Community is shipping $300 million worth of free food and $600 million worth of food sold with subsidized loans. The community agreed in January to send this assistance and is now preparing another $1.4 billion program including both food and technical assistance.
 
Problem of Distribution
 American officials have said that the distribution of food is just as important as total supply, and the first of two high-level Agriculture Department delegations is in the Soviet Union now to study both problems. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Board chairman, are to travel to Moscow on Tuesday for consultations on the economic problems.
Last year's bumper harvest of 235 million metric tons of grain was not enough to avoid local shortages because of transportation problems, and a smaller harvest this year may worsen local shortages, Agriculture Secretary Edward R. Madigan said last week.
The United States shipped $1 billion of grain in the first half of this year under a program of Federal guarantees for banks that lend money to the Soviet Union for purchases of American agricultural products. President Bush authorized another $1.5 billion worth of loan guarantees on June 11, of which the first $600 million has been committed and most of the food shipped.
The President made another $315 million of the guarantees available on Aug. 26 in response to an urgent Soviet request, but Soviet authorities have had trouble finding banks willing to make the new loans. The guarantees only cover 98 percent of the principal and the first 4.5 percentage points of interest on the guaranteed portion of the principal.
The Soviet Union used $94.4 million of these guarantees on Monday, mostly to buy corn, the Agriculture Department said. The purchase used the remainder of a $694.4 million line of credit set up before last month's attempted coup.
Private experts say that while no decision has been reached, the Agriculture Department seems likely to offer direct loans, financed by the United States Government, to the Soviet Union.
Bankers have become particularly reluctant lately to lend to the Soviet Union because its republics have said they would divide the responsibility for repaying the country's debt but have been unable to agree on how to do so.
The efficiency of food distribution has been drastically reduced this year by the reluctance of Soviet farmers to sell to the state. By Aug. 20 the Soviet Government had bought only 25 million metric tons of grain, down from 40.1 million metric tons on the same date last year, Ms. Brookins said.

CORRECTION-DATE: September 14, 1991, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article yesterday about Soviet request for at least $6 billion in foreign food aid misstated terms of the request. A European Community spokesman in Brussels announced yesterday that the Soviet request included an offer to pay for part of the food, beginning in 1994; it would not all be a donation.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Owners Say They'll Review Draft

BYLINE: By CLAIRE SMITH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BALTIMORE, Sept. 12

 BODY:
Major league baseball owners have decided to review the ways in which baseball conducts its annual June draft of high school and college athletes, introducing the possibility of securing more leverage in negotiations and changing the relationship between amateurs and professionals.
Emerging from a joint session of American and National League owners on the final day of quarterly meetings, Commissioner Fay Vincent said major league baseball had agreed to review the rules governing the amateur draft. 
 One of the concerns, Vincent said, is for a team having a draft choice who doesn't sign "and whether that team should be permitted to retain that right for a period of time."
 
The Yankee Case
 Although Vincent said the issue was not new, it was a prime concern of one team this season. The Yankees, fearing the loss of the nation's top draft pick, Brien Taylor, signed the high school star to a $1.55 million contract just before the pitcher was to begin courses at a junior college.
If Taylor had attended one class, the Yankees would not have been able to sign him until next spring. If Taylor had not signed by next June, he would have been eligible to re-enter the draft.
Robert Nederlander, managing partner of the Yankees, said Taylor's name had not come up in initial discussions on the draft. But immediately after the signing last month, owners from both leagues were highly critical of the amount of money paid to Taylor.
 
Union Weighs In
 Donald Fehr, executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Association, said that he could not yet comment on any changes without knowing details. But he pointed out that any change that would affect major leaguers or potential major leaguers is an issue the owners would have to take up with the union.
In another area involving amateurs, Steve Greenberg, the deputy commissioner, said: "Part of what we're exploring is working more closely with the N.C.A.A. to establish jointly a procedure which would further the objectives of the N.C.A.A. and the clubs in terms of how the draft is managed as opposed to the current system.
"It really puts us at loggerheads with the N.C.A.A. in terms of discouraging certain athletes from going to college and playing college ball."
On that point, Fehr said that the union would welcome such an overture. "We are also interested in doing whatever we can to encourage college pursuits rather than discourage it the way the game does now," he said by telephone from New York.
 
Mariners' Troubles
 In other developments, Jeff Smulyan, owner of the financially troubled Seattle Mariners and a string of radio stations, including WFAN in New York, said recession-related worries in the latter field were not motivating him to seek relief in baseball.
"When your core industry is going through a recession, it certainly lessens your fervor to pour more money down the drain," Smulyan said. "But I think that frankly if the broadcasting industry had tripled in the last year I wouldn't view this situation any differently."
Vincent said that no one in baseball could make any predictions about the franchise's future until it is seen what Smulyan and the city's civic and corporate leaders produce. They are making a 45-day effort to find a way for Seattle to equal at least 90 percent of what American League teams average in revenues.
In other business, the owners voted to expand CBS-TV's control over the final two days of the regular season. The network already had the power to choose any games it wished to broadcast nationally. The owners have now voted to have local broadcasts yield rights to CBS on those two days.

The Faces of Death: A Multi-Media Meditation

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH

 BODY:
Death is one of art's great underlying themes. But in recent years, it has come to the surface with particular frequency; its daunting profile probably looms larger than it has at any other point since the postwar era, when existentialism seemed the only logical reponse to a Europe that lay in ruins.
This is understandable. On one hand, the re-emergence of the figure, first in painting in the early 1980's, then in sculpture and installation art, has opened the floodgate to such overtly grand subjects as history, sexuality, the body and memory, as well as death. On the other hand, the hard facts of contemporary existence -- from political strife, economic instability and urban violence to the AIDS epidemic -- often seem more intractable than ever before. They have turned artists working in all styles, not just figurative ones, toward darker subjects. 
 Against this backdrop, the New Museum of Contemporary Art in SoHo has mounted "The Interrupted Life," a multi-media rumination on death that alternates between the profound and the superficial, the multi-cultural and the fashionably slick, thanks, in part, to an exhibition design by Massimo Vignelli. With dark gray walls and a preponderance of photographs of the dead creating a nearly sepulchral mood, this show can make you confront your own mortality at certain points; at others, it can leave you feeling emotionally manipulated and a bit numb. Death brings out some artists' strengths; for others, it is simply a monumental facade to hide behind.
The show has been organized by France Morin, the museum's chief curator, and it has some nice curatorial touches. For example, it robustly mixes its various media, which include photography, sculpture, video and installation, rather than ghetto izing videotapes in a separate area. This creates a sometimes infernal amount of noise when contemplative silence would be more welcome, but it also gives every kind of art a piece of center stage.
More important, in true New Museum style, the show evinces a particularly effective juxtapositioning of the little known with the famous among its 40 artists. It includes an impressive new installation by the well-known French Conceptualist Christian Boltanski, whose recent efforts have seemed to be in a bit of a holding pattern. A long narrow space lined on two sides all the way to the museum's high ceilings, with shelves of neatly folded children's clothes, this work creates a much-needed pool of silence in the show and suggests an enormous closet where one might grieve among the belongings of the dead. Present, too, are the requisite works by the cool-handed Andy Warhol, whose frequent evocations of death were based, like most of his art, on newspaper photographs. Here he is represented by a small electric chair painting and a four-image treatment of the widowed Jacqueline Kennedy.
But there is also a moving photo collage by a Chilean artist named Eugenio Dittmore, who has shown very little in this country, and an installation by Mona Hatoum, a London-based artist who has made, out of heating elements, a kind of electric chair whose red lines suggest a circulatory system pulsating in the dark. And beyond the unknown there is the unexpected. Among the inclusions that take the show beyond the strict confines of the art world are two drawings by the French writer Antonin Artaud; a batch of photographs of open caskets by the chronicler of Harlem, James van der Zee, and four vitrines of 19th-century post-mortem photographs of children and babies.
In this manner, the exhibition highlights not just art about death, or works like Genevieve Cadieux's enormous photographs of partly closed eyes that may or may not be about death. It also seeks to emphasize some of the social rituals, attitudes and scientific practices that accompany death. In fact, the more "The Interrupted Life" moves away from the artistic and toward the documentary, the stronger it becomes.
As with the 19th-century post-mortem photographs, some of the most revealing moments are found in photographs that trace the journey of the body after death, images whose quality as art is almost beside the point.
Jeffrey Silverthorne's "Morgue Works, the Woman Who Died in Her Sleep," from 1972-74, shows a beautiful young woman whose lifelike pose is belied by her crudely stitched autopsy incision. Yet this Y-shaped line, crossing her breasts and traveling down her torso, also suggests a kind of low-cut dress. Similarly breathtaking in ways that have nothing to do with art are images by Hans Danuser and Bastienne Schmidt, which show the second life the dead can have as medical cadavers. Meanwhile, Jolie Stahl's straightforward photographs record prisoners of New York City jails at work for 50 cents an hour, burying wood coffins in the city's potter's field.
In several instances, however, artists seem to simply exploit the macabre and freakish, turning death into a handy readymade. Among the worst offenders in this regard are Orshi Drozdik and the team of Gwen Akin and Allan Ludwig, whose large, gloomy photographs feature, respectively, a child's head and a sliced-off face in big jars of Formaldehyde.
These images also underscore that perhaps a bit too much of the work in this show centers on the already dead. The inclusion that especially counters this imbalance is Frederick Wiseman's 1989 film "Near Death," which is being screened continually on a large-screen television near the show's center. A documentary about the intensive-care unit at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston, it relentlessly gropes through the complex thicket of decisions, procedures and emotions that confront patients and their doctors, nurses and family members as death approaches. In this work, death itself, alternately terrifying and mundane, welcome and heartbreaking, is more real than at any other point in this exhibition.

 	 	 		. . .	 	"The Interrupted Life" remains at the New Museum of Contemporary Art, 583 Broadway, near Prince Street, through Dec. 29.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Urgent Remedies For the Soviet Ills

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
WHERE big money is at stake, politics dominates economics. And when runaway inflation breaks loose, when productive systems break down, when economies split apart and wealth disappears, the sickness lies in the body politic.
Soviet inflation is now galloping. Wholesale prices are 100 percent higher than a year ago, according to official data. The consumer price index is meaningless, since the prices people really pay are in the black market, where the ruble's rate has now fallen to 60 to the dollar from 25 at the start of the year. The ruble's official commercial exchange rate is still, laughably, 1.8 for a dollar. 
 Distrust of government translates into fear and loathing of its currency. Recently, a taxi driver in Moscow refused to be paid and tipped in rubles, exploding into expletives.
The main macroeconomic cause of Soviet inflation and the sinking ruble is the Government's inability to control the budget deficit. That problem was gravely worsened this year by raising subsidies in a vain effort to keep real incomes from falling and by the failure of the governments of the 15 republics to make payments to the central authorities. Central Government revenues from the republics have fallen more than 50 percent.
Before the failed coup against President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet Ministry of Finance projected a budget deficit of 140 billion rubles this year, or 13 percent of national output. That would be five times as much as the originally planned deficit of 26.7 billion rubles. Now, the deficit is likely to exceed the 200 billion rubles foreseen by the most pessimistic analysts and to top 20 percent of national output. In its struggle to keep the disordered economy functioning, however badly, the Government will be driven to speed up the money-printing presses, sending the ruble toward perdition.
How can the ruble be rescued? In the judgment of some economists, it is too late: The ruble must be replaced by a trustworthy new currency.
One who takes this position is Adolphe J. Warner, chairman of Global Asset Management Associates Inc., who served as an adviser to Gen. Lucius Clay in the United States Military Government in Germany after World War II and helped run the operation by which the collapsing Reichsmark was abandoned and replaced by the Deutsche mark, on June 18, 1948.
Repeating that act would be more difficult in the Soviet Union today. Mr. Warner warns that it would be impractical -- and politically unfair, given today's gross maldistribution of monetary assets -- to try to fix an exchange rate at which all holders of rubles could exchange them for new money.
This maldistribution stems from supply distortions due to the black market, aggravated by the corruption of Soviet bureaucrats, politicians and gangsters. In Mr. Warner's view, a new currency should be distributed on a per-capita basis to each individual, allowing for extra allowances for retirees, to Government agencies on the basis of budget projections and to private enterprises based on payrolls or other special factors.
For a new currency to achieve popular trust and credibility at home and abroad, fundamental economic and political reforms are crucial. These must include eliminating the enormous budget deficit, redefining budgetary and taxing powers of the central Government and the republics, establishing private property rights, creating an independent central bank and overhauling the banking system.
Obviously, all this cannot be done overnight. But, with the ruble falling and the entire Soviet economy in imminent danger of collapse, it must start as soon as possible with outside help to ease the process.
A serious obstacle to overhauling the old Soviet system, however, has been created by the drive in many republics toward independence with their own currencies. Even if the old Union of Soviet Socialist Republics disintegrates or gives way to a new and much looser confederation of sovereign states, monetary union will be essential to the economic viability of the separate republics.
Here, too, early post-World War II experience may provide a solution: the European Payments Union, established under American leadership in 1950, cut through a tangle of bilateral payments arrangements between war-ravaged countries.
Member countries trading together could offset their debits and credits, settling their net payments position with the union partly in gold and partly in credit. The technical agent for running the payments union was the Bank for International Settlements; the managing board of the union was an agency of the Paris-based Organization for European Economic Cooperation.
This arrangement brought the senior European financial officials and central bankers into working contacts; it laid the basis for European revival and the Common Market, and it could serve as a model for a monetarily stable and economically interdependent Union of Sovereign Republics. In the Soviet Union as in postwar Europe, when the old politics breeds life-threatening economic disease, new politics can provide a remedy.

Yields Lowered On Two Issues

 BODY:
An indication of the downtrend in interest rates came yesterday with municipal bond repricings involving North Dakota and Santa Fe, N.M., issues.
Smith Barney repriced North Dakota Housing Finance Agency single-family mortgage revenue bonds, lowering yields five basis points for maturities from 1996 to 2001. A basis point is one-hundredth of 1 percent. 
 It kept the price on some long-term bonds, with the 2010 maturity remaining at par, with a 7.25 percent yield; the 2014 maturity, subject to early call, was priced to yield 6.625 percent and the longest 2024 maturity remaining at par, to yield 7.30 percent. The serial bonds totaled $25 million.
A. G. Edwards & Sons said it had repriced part of the $32.37 million issue of Santa Fe, N.M., gross receipts tax refunding and improvement revenue bonds, lowering yields 5 basis points for the 2002 maturity and 10 basis points for the 2003 maturity. At the same time, it said it had raised the yield for the nearby 1992 maturity by 5 basis points.
Interest rates will range from 4.75 percent for the 1992 maturity to 6.40 percent for the year 2003.

Dollar Off in Most Trading; Prices for Gold Are Mixed

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell yesterday in another round of technical trading amid expectations that a new report showing moderate inflation will encourage the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates.
Gold prices rose in Europe but fell in New York. At the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery was quoted at $344.30 an ounce, off $1.10. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid of $344.05, off $1.10. 
 Jay Tucker, a currency trader at the First Boston Corporation, said the drop in the dollar came amid speculative trading in advance of the August retail sales report, scheduled for release today. Market analysts said the report could show the progress of the economy's recovery.
Traders began selling dollars late on Wednesday in New York and the trend continued in Europe, dealers said. Expectations of lower interest rates have depressed the dollar in recent sessions. A cut in interest rates would reduce the dollar's value to foreign investors.
The dollar also lost ground after the release of the Labor Department's producer price report for August, which showed a moderate rise of two-tenths of 1 percent.
The rise in producer prices "gave more incentive to sell dollars because it made the easing of the discount rate scenario a little more true," Mr. Tucker said.
Although the rise in producer prices was moderate, investors should not assume that the Consumer Price Index for August, to be released today, will show a similar trend, said Curtis Perkins, a currency trader at Chemical Bank.
The consumer price report will provide the latest indication of inflationary trends. Many analysts believe the Fed will be more inclined to lower interest rates if inflation remains low or moderate.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.7335, from $1.7255 late on Wednesday. In New York, sterling cost $1.7325, less expensive than $1.7345 late on Wednesday.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 134.45 Japanese yen, down from 134.77 yen on Wednesday. Later, in London, it fell to 134.05 yen. In New York, the dollar closed at 134.08 yen, down from 134.65 late on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims Drop Slightly

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 12

 BODY:
The number of Americans applying for unemployment insurance benefits for the first time fell slightly in the final week in August, the Labor Department said today, but economists do not foresee any large improvement soon.
"The recovery is progressing but slowly," said Cynthia Latta, senior financial economist for DRI/McGraw Hill in Lexington, Mass. "It still has a ball and a chain on its foot," 
 New applications for unemployment insurance benefits fell to 420,000 in the week that ended Aug. 31, a decrease of 1,000 from the week before, the department said. The number has averaged 423,000 for the last four weeks.
"The numbers are not indicative of strong labor markets," said Peter Greenbaum, an economist at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. Weak labor markets translate into depressed personal incomes and a drop in consumer demand.
The benefits report said the number of people receiving benefits under regular state programs rose to 3,286,000 in the week that ended Aug. 24, the latest period for which the figure was available. That was a increase of 8,000 from the previous week's seasonally adjusted revised level of 3,278,000.

HEADLINE: Producer Price Report Is Encouraging on Inflation

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 12

 BODY:
In a heartening report on inflation, prices at the producer level rose two-tenths of 1 percent in August, a modest increase caused mainly by higher oil prices that have since subsided, Labor Department figures showed today.
The report, which was somewhat better than expected, touched off a rally in the market for fixed-income securities as investors and traders viewed it as increasing the chances of a new and prompt easing of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve.
"The economy would benefit from additional monetary stimulation, and there's very little chance of stirring up inflation by doing so," asserted Ron Schreibman, vice president of the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors. The trade group's members closely follow the Producer Price Index since it reflects transactions with their suppliers.
 
Expectations of the Fed
 The Federal Reserve generally seeks to avoid appearing to respond to any particular piece of economic news but analysts said today that the next, long-anticipated round of rate cuts could come at any time. On Friday morning the Government is to publish its comprehensive report on retail sales during August and on inflation at the consumer level. Both are expected to reflect sluggish economic conditions.
"This prepares the way some more for the Fed to ease," said Samuel D. Kahan, chief financial economist for Fuji Securities in Chicago. Comparing a cut in short-term rates to an apple fully ripened on a tree, he said, "Today, tomorrow, we know it's going to fall."
The most recent Fed easing came in early August on the heels of weak employment data.
The two-tenths of 1 percent rise in the index for finished goods followed modest declines for June and July, but analysts noted that prices would have been unchanged if energy prices are excluded. They added that political uncertainty in the Soviet Union, the world's biggest oil producer, was a chief factor for a 4.6 percent jump in gasoline, which had dropped 5.5 percent in July.
 
Oil Prices Letting Up
 Recently, oil prices have eased and economists said they did not expect overall energy prices -- up 1.8 percent last month -- to prove an obstacle to further reductions in inflation.
The so-called core rate of inflation, which eliminates food as well as energy, also rose two-tenths of 1 percent in August. This was the same pace as in July and in May, with June unchanged. The Labor Department revised downward today the pace of inflation it reported earlier for April and May.
Of further encouragement to analysts was the fact that the producer price indexes for goods at the intermediate and crude stages of production were also held in check. Intermediate goods rose four-tenths of 1 percent over all, but just one-tenth without energy; crude goods were unchanged over all, but 1.1 percent lower without energy.
A dress or suit of clothes would be an example of a finished good, an item that will not undergo further processing and is ready for sale to the final user, either an individual consumer or a business. In this case, a bolt of cloth would be the intermediate good and the raw cotton or wool the crude good.
 
'Inflation Is Under Control'
 "These figures conclusively demonstrate that inflation is under control," said Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, noting that core inflation at the producer level has remained at about 2.5 percent since February.
The 1.8 percent jump in finished energy prices last month, which included a decline in residential natural gas, was significantly offset by a four-tenths of 1 percent decline in consumer foods. Beef and veal fell 4.7 percent, and prices also fell for fish, fresh and processed fruits and vegetables, soft drinks and pork.
But passenger cars and tobacco prices both advanced 1.1 percent as did women's apparel, household appliances, prescription drugs, glassware and textbooks. Automobile prices fell four-tenths of 1 percent before seasonal adjustment.
 
Prices for Manufacturers
 Among intermediate goods, materials for nondurable manufacturing, like paint and chemicals, rose three-tenths of 1 percent, the first increase for this category since November, the report showed. Materials for durable manufacturing, like copper and brass mill shapes, fell seven-tenths of 1 percent following a one-tenth of 1 percent decline in July.
Finished capital equipment rose one-tenth of 1 percent for the second straight month, as increases for cars, civilian aircraft, agricultural machinery and construction machiner more than offset lower prices for computers, oilfield machinery and trucks.
For the first eight months of the year, prices of finished goods have fallen at an annual rate of 1.1 percent, the report also showed. Since August 1990 there has been a 2 percent advance.

HEADLINE: Goals for Military Research Ignite Debate

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 12

 BODY:
A leader of the intelligence community in both the Carter and Reagan Administrations and a high-ranking economist in the Reagan Administration clashed today over whether the Government should do more to strengthen the nation's technology base to enhance both national security and economic competitiveness.
Bobby R. Inman, a retired admiral who was both Deputy Director of Central Intelligence and Director of the National Security Agency, urged Congress to broaden the mandates of the National Security Council and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency of the Pentagon. Mr. Inman argued that "if we don't make changes, the Department of Defense is going to pay much more to access needed technologies." 
 But Prof. Murray Weidenbaum, an economist at Washington University in St. Louis who served as President Ronald Reagan's first chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in 1981, contended that "using the military budget to support civilian technology will politicize the process."
"Once you open this door," Professor Weidenbaum said, "there's no limit to the expansion of the Government's role in this important sector of the economy."
 
Report Urges Collaboration
 The debate took place at a hearing on Capitol Hill as the Joint Economic Committee of Congress received a report from the Carnegie Commission on Science, Technology and Government. The commission was created by the Carnegie Corporation to strengthen the relationship between government, science and technology. Mr. Inman headed the commission's task force on science, technolgy and economic performance, which prepared the report.
The report urged that Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or Darpa, which provided seed money for military technologies including semiconductors and avionics, be transformed into the National Advanced Research Projects Agency, or Narpa. The new agency would support not only military technologies but also "long range, high risk" technologies of commercial value that had a Government customer, although not necessarily the military.
This recommendation was supported by Prof. Lewis Branscomb of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, a member of the commission who was chief scientist at the International Business Machines Corporation and formerly director of the National Bureau of Standards. He urged "a rationale that puts defense needs first in Darpa's budget, but viewed those needs in terms of a national technology base, not a defense industry 'ghetto.' "
The report also recommended that the National Security Council expand its role to include economic as well as national security factors. "This approach is based on the view that economic performance is critically important to national security and that technological vitality is of central important to the economy," the report said. It also urged broader powers for the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.
In explaining the premise for the recommendations, the report said: "In the future, both economic and military security will depend on commercially driven technology, and the Government must work deliberately to advance civilian as well as military capacity in order to create a true national technology base. Separate enclaves serve neither the commercial economy nor national security."

HEADLINE: Dow Rises 20.80 on Strong Economic Data

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stock prices got a solid lift yesterday from a better-than-expected report on inflation, with the Dow Jones industrial average again bobbing above the 3,000 level. The Government reported that producer prices rose two-tenths of 1 percent in August, sending the Dow up 20.80 points, to 3,007.83.
"Yesterday's market was not a sweeping euphoria, but it was a good day on Wall Street across the board," said Hugh A. Johnson, a senior vice at the First Albany Corporation. 
 The Big Board's volume was a moderate 160.4 million shares, up from 148.1 million the previous day. Advancing issues outpaced declining ones by 950 to 604.
 
Broader Gauges Rise
 The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks was up 2.25, to 387.34, and the New York Exchange composite index gained 1.21, to 212.42.
Trading in smaller stocks listed on the over-the-counter exchange was active, with the Nasdaq composite index rising 6.37, to 521.13. On the American Stock Exchange, the composite index rose 1.54, to 366.22.
Mr. Johnson said the main reason the market got off to a good start was the producer price report. It was moderately below expectations of three-tenths of 1 percent, while jobless claims for the week ending on Aug. 31 declined 1,000, to 420,000. Both reports were good news, and together they indicated that the recovery was continuing, although at a somewhat anemic pace without putting upward pressure on prices.
"The combination of continued slow recovery and low inflation implies for the investor that the Fed will respond by lowering short-term interest rates," Mr. Johnson said. He added that a Fed move, coupled with the rising bond prices that would result, would support stock prices.
 
Mortgage Agencies Higher
 As a result, interest-sensitive stocks performed well, like the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Association, or Freddie Mac, which rose 4 3/8, to 95 3/4, and the Federal National Mortgage Association, known as Fannie Mae, which gained 2 5/8, to 61 1/8.
Stocks were up across the market. The Producer Price Index figures released in the morning helped stocks early on, but they gave back some of the earlier advances as trading continued into the afternoon. Investors then settled down to await the next reports, on consumer prices and retail sales, which are to be released today.
After the market closed yesterday, Polaroid said it would use most of $400 million remaining from the settlement of its patent-infringment suit against Eastman Kodak to repurchase preferred stock in an investment firm that rescued Polaroid from a takeover attempt in 1989.
B. Alex Henderson, an analyst at Prudential Securities, said the transaction would have a positive impact of 48 cents a share annually on Polaroid's earnings. He said he expected the stock to open higher today. It slipped 1/4 yesterday, to 24 7/8.
 
Unisys Down to $4.875
 Unisys stock closed down 1/2, to 4 7/8, after The Wall Street Journal reported that the company was seeking $400 million from its bankers. William J. Milton Jr., an analyst with Brown Brothers Harriman, noted that the company appeared to have a short-term cash squeeze. "But the company has enough resources and enough potential cash infusion to cover itself," he said.
U.S. Healthcare rose 3 5/8, to 27 1/4, as the insurer announced plans to buy back up to five million common shares and said that New Jersey's insurance commission had approved the company's request for a premium rate increase.
Sears rose by 1 3/8, to 40 1/4, as the retailer's mortgage securities unit filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a shelf offering of up to $2 billion in mortgage-pass through securities.
On the Amex, Forest Laboratories tumbled 4 3/8, to 30, as Swedish regulators asked patients to stop using the drug Micturin, whose American rights are owned by Forest. The drug, which is used to treat urinary incontinence, is pending regulatory approval in the United States. Analysts said some investors had expected sales of Micturin in this country to substantially increase the company's earnings.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From President Bush's News Session on Israeli Loan Guarantees

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 12

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Bush's news conference today, as recorded by The Associated Press:
 
OPENING STATEMENT
 Since the end of the gulf war, we've worked extremely hard to take advantage of what we believe are new and exciting possibilities for peace in the Middle East. Secretary of State Baker has traveled to the region about a half a dozen times, and will go again in a few days. As a result of these efforts, we're on the brink of an historic breakthrough. We've come a long, long way. And we're close to being able to convene a peace conference that, in turn, would launch direct peace negotiations between Israel and the Arab states, something the state of Israel has sought since its inception. 
 A few days ago, I asked Congress to defer consideration for 120 days of Israel's request for $10 billion in additional U.S. loan guarantees meant to help Israel absorb its many new immigrants. I did so in the interests of peace. I did so because we must avoid a contentious debate that would raise a host of controversial issues, issues so sensitive that a debate now could well destroy our ability to bring one or more of the parties to the peace table.
A good deal of confusion surrounds this request for deferral, confusion that I'd like to try to clear up. Let me begin by making clear what my request for delay is not about. It's not about the strength of my or this country's support for immigration to Israel. Both as Vice President and President, I've tried my hardest to do everything possible to liberate Jews living in Ethiopia and the Soviet Union, so that they could immigrate to Israel.
Today in no small part due to American efforts, hundreds of thousands of people are now living in Israel, able at last to live free of fear, free to practice their faith. Nor should our request for delay be viewed as an indication that there exists any question in my mind about the need for a strong and secure Israel. For more than 40 years the United States has been Israel's closest friend in the world. And this remains the case and will as long as I am President of the United States. This is a friendship backed up with real support.
 
Longing for Peace
 Just months ago, American men and women in uniform risked their lives to defend Israelis in the face of Iraqi Scud missiles, and indeed, Desert Storm, while winning a war against aggression, also achieved the defeat of Israel's most dangerous adversary. And during the current fiscal year alone, and despite our own economic problems, the United States provided Israel with more than $4 billion in economic and military aid, nearly $1,000 for every Israeli man, woman, and child, as well as with $400 million in loan guarantees to facilitate immigrant absorption.
My request that Congress delay consideration of the Israeli request for $10 billion in new loan guarantees to support immigrant absorption is about peace. For the first time in history, the vision of Israelis sitting with their Arab neighbors to talk peace is a real prospect. Nothing should be done that might interfere with this prospect. And if necessary, I will use my veto power to prevent that from happening.
Peace is what these new immigrants to Israel and, indeed, all Israelis long for. Their chance for a decent job, a decent life depends on it. It is our goal to support the welfare of the new immigrants and to have peace, not to choose one humanitarian goal at the expense of the other.
Let me end with just one final point. The Constitution charges the President with the conduct of the nation's foreign policy. And during Desert Shield and then Desert Storm, I came before the American people, as President, asking for the latitude to do what was right and necessary. A good many sincere members of Congress, of both parties, disagreed at the time. And now again there is an attempt by some in the Congress to prevent the President from taking steps central to the nation's security. But too much is at stake for domestic politics to take precedence over peace. This I know is something the bulk of the American people understand.
And I'm asking the Congress to postpone this question for 120 days. This postponement is not meant to prejudice in any way what we would do come January. And I'm asking the American people to support me in this request. Quite simply, a 120-day delay is not too much for a President to ask for with so much in the balance. We must give peace a chance, we must give peace every chance.
 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 
Hostage Releases
 Q. Mr. President, Israel yesterday released 51 Arab prisoners, and the Shiite Moslem kidnappers say that they support a comprehensive settlement of the hostage ordeal. What's your reading of this situation? And is there anything that the United States can do to facilitate the process?
A. Not directly. I was very pleased, though, at the release of those prisoners. We have been in touch with the Secretary General, with Mr. Picco of his office, also, who is doing a very good job. And again, we're back where we were a month ago, "How optimistic is the President, how optimistic is the Congress about the release of these prisoners?" And once again I'm going to resist quantifying my optimism, but I think this recent development is bound to be viewed, properly, as very, very favorable.
Q. Do you believe that the release of a hostage is imminent?
A. I can't -- I don't want to put terms on it. I mean, I know that there was a feeling a month ago -- I remember it very well -- that hostage release is imminent, and sure enough, thank heavens, a release did take place. But I just am going to resist, Terry, if you'll permit me not to go into how optimistic or moderately optimistic or whatever that I am.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
Israeli Loan Guarantees
 Q. . . . on the question of the Israeli loan guarantees, even many of your Republican supporters on the Hill say that Israel should have had this money a long time ago and they don't support the 120-delay that you're asking for. Is there any kind of compromise, is there any kind of middle ground? You sound very tough today on wanting to hold to that 120 days.
A. I just sound principled. I'm convinced that this debate would be counterproductive to peace and I owe it to the members of Congress to say it as forcefully as I can. I've worn out the telephone in there and one ear and I'm going to move over to the other ear and keep on it, because this is -- peace is vital here and we've worked too hard to have that request of my mine denied. And I think the American people will support me. They know we support Israel. I've just detailed some of what we've done. So there should be no question about that. I am giving the Congress -- and I did it with the leaders today, having an opportunity here, thank you, to do it here to give my best judgment. And I'm up against some powerful political forces, but I owe to the American people to tell them how strongly I feel about deferral.
Q. Are those powerful political forces ungrateful for what you've done so far in a peace process and why doesn't the peace argument sell with them?
A. I think it will sell, but it's taking a little time. And we're up against very strong and effective, sometimes, groups that go up to the Hill. I heard today there were something like a thousand lobbyists on the Hill working the other side of the question. We've got one lonely little guy down here doing it.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
Whose Precondition?
 Q. Mr. President, you said that a contentious debate now could actually keep some parties away from the peace table, yet the Israelis claim that those Arabs who have indicated a willingness to participate in the peace process have not made the settlement issue a precondition. They say that's your precondition. As one columnist said this week, it's your obsession. Is that fair?
A. Well, I would simply say that I read some charges coming out of a source in Israel that we'd made a deal with the Arabs that we would fight this. That's not true. That is factually incorrect, simply not true. No, it is my judgment, and Jim's, and everybody else's working this problem, and has been for months, that this is the approach we ought to take. Because we don't want a contentious debate on settlements or anything else over there at this juncture. We want to get these parties to the table.
And I don't think it's asking too much to have a 120-day delay. I think Congress should listen carefully to what I'm asking for, and I hope that they will go along with this.
 
Foreign Intervention
 Q. Mr. President, you talked about powerful political forces at work. It sounds like you're feeling the heat from the Israeli lobby. Do you think that there's unfair foreign intervention in the U.S. political process here?
A. No. I don't think -- I think everybody ought to fight for what they believe in. That's exactly what I'm beginning to do right here. We've laid back down. We've been lying in the weeds, saying let's not get all this debate -- these debate subjects going. The best thing for peace is to move -- to move the process forward is to just have this deferral. But I'm going to fight for what I believe, and it may be popular politically but probably it's not. But that's not the question here, that's not the question, is whether it's good 1992 politics. What's important here is that we give this process a chance. And I don't care if I get one vote, I'm going to stand for what I believe here, and I believe the American people will be with me, if we put it on this question of principle. And nobody has better -- been a better friend to Israel than the United States, and no one will continue to be a better friend than the United States.
But here, we are simply asking for a 120-day deferral and that's what motivates me, it isn't anything to do with lobbies or politics or anything else. . . .
 
Debate's Damage
 Q. Mr. President, just how much damage is being caused by this showdown?
A. I don't think there's any damage. Lawsie, we'll be debating something else tomorrow. But I think this one's very important, and that's why I want to be sure that our position is out there. I'm not only half in jest about what's happening up there on the Hill. Listen, there's a tremendous effort going on, and we have had a low profile on this. And I wake up now and see that we better get out message out, loud and clear.
Q. But does this strain itself threaten the peace process?
A. No, it has nothing to do with the peace process, in my view. I mean, if what would happen -- the result was what would strain it, not the ----
Q. Isn't there a loss of trust, there? I mean, do the Israelis trust you as much as they did?
A. Well, you'd have to ask the Israelis that. I can't tell you about that. All I'm doing is expressing the foreign policy of the United States of America. And we're going to say what we think is best; if they agree, fine. They've got to worry about their priorities. But I think many people there want to see this peace process go forward. The polling numbers in Israel are overwhelming in support of the peace process. And so, what I'm trying to say is listen, to the degree America's judgment and leadership matters, listen to what we say, how strongly we feel about this. And I think the people there will respond. I think the American people will respond.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
Commitment to Israel
 Q. Have you made a commitment to the Israelis and to their supporters in the Congress that if they agree to the delay that they will -- that you will then support the loan ----
A. Absolutely not. That would undermine everything. I have proposed that the question be considered in 120 days without any objection on our part and that in principle the concept of absorption aid, a principle that we backed up by $400 million this year, will still be a valid principle. But to agree to something of that nature would be just the same, if I feel it is detrimental to the peace process as presented now, that kind of agreement would be equally detrimental to the peace process.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
Israel's Interest
 Q. Israel wants this peace conference as much as you do and yet it's Israel that submitted this request to you. Have they put you in a difficult position and does this say something about their less than genuine interest?
A. Well you can't judge by statements from one or another in the Cabinet in Israel. You have got to look at the whole picture. And there have been some disquieting statements by one rather flamboyant minister that I am sorry I didn't get asked about because I have just been aching to answer the question. But we are not -- I am not going to answer anymore -- but I am just simply saying we are not judging it on a statement here or there. I take the Prime Minister at his word when he says that they feel it's in their interest to have a peace conference and it has not been an easy decision for him, but he has taken that decision and to his credit he reaffirmed their interest in the peace process just less than 48 hours ago.
So those are the statements that we ought to look at and in that one, why I was quite reassured. But again. . . . we are the United States of America. We have got our policy. We should say clearly what our policy is and I want this peace process to happen.
I want the Israelis to do that which they wanted all along, have a chance to sit down one on one with historic adversaries and I want the Arabs to have a chance to get this question settled once and for all, and I really believe the whole world wants that, and it is my best judgment that an rancorous debate now is literally minuscule in importance compared to the objective of peace and that's -- we ought to set it back 120 days only, who is going to get hurt? What possibly could work against -- against that reasonable request from an administration that's brought this thing from square one right up to a peak that nobody really believed we could achieve, getting these countries together, and the work that's gone into it.
I just don't want to risk it by us taking some stand in the United States Congress against a request by the President in order to satisfy some other interest.
We've got to keep our sights on the broad picture of peace in the Middle East, and I would say that includes world peace. They're so closely interlocked when you look at the complex relationships in the Middle East and how they spill over into Europe and to Asia, into the Soviet Union still. So we're talking about a major chance now for one more tremendous step towards peace. We've seen the evolution of the Soviet Union, we've seen the defeat of aggression over there in Iraq, we've seen democracy on the move in our hemisphere. And here is a last place that really needs this peace process to go forward.

HEADLINE: THE THOMAS HEARINGS;
Excerpts From Senate's Hearing on the Thomas Nomination

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 12

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the transcript of today's session of Senate Judiciary Committee hearings on the nomination of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court, with questioning by Senators Herb Kohl, Joseph R. Biden Jr., Strom Thurmond, Orrin G. Hatch, Howard M. Metzenbaum and Dennis DeConcini.
 
QUESTIONS BY SENATOR KOHL
 Q. Judge Thomas, I would like to ask you why you want this job.
. . . It is an opportunity to serve, to give back. That has been something that has been important to me. And I believe Senator, that I can make a contribution, that I can bring something different to the Court, that I can walk in the shoes of the people who are affected by what the Court does. 
 You know, on my current court, I have occasion to look out the window that faces C Street, and there are converted buses that bring in the criminal defendants to our criminal justice system, busload after busload. And you look out, and you say to yourself, and I say to myself almost every day, But for the grace of God there go I.
So you feel that you have the same fate, or could have, as those individuals. So I can walk in their shoes, and I can bring something different to the Court. And I think it is a tremendous responsibility, and it is a humbling responsibility; and it is one that, if confirmed, I will carry out to the best of my ability.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
Criticism of Congress
 Q. You said that "Congress was a coalition of elites which failed to be a deliberative body that legislates for the common good or the public interest," and you said that "Congress was no longer primarily a deliberative or even a law-making body." Is that how you feel?
A. Today?
Q. Today. [Laughter.] Here, sitting before 14 of us who are going to vote.
A. I can't, Senator, remember the total context of that, but I think I said that and I think I said it in the context of saying that Congress was at its best when it was legislating on great moral issues. Now, I could be wrong. I think I have turned over 138 speeches, and I can't remember the details of all of them, but I did say and I do remember saying that Congress was at its best when it was deliberating the great moral issues of our time, such as, for example, our involvement in the Persian Gulf conflict.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
Judging the Nominee
 Q. I think that we and the American people, Judge Thomas, should be given the full opportunity to judge you on the whole range of your life experiences, which does include the things that you have said and written and done, just like it does for the rest of us.
When I ran for office, I wasn't able to say don't consider this or don't consider that. The voters wouldn't allow that. And they consider everything I have done, everything I have said. And I think that that is the way the process should work in a democracy. And to the extent that you think I am exaggerating, I would be interested in your response, and then I am finished.
A. Senator, I think that if this were an oversight hearing and I could go back and discuss all the policies and tell you that, yes, it is relevant to me going back and running my agency, running the agency that I have been asked to run or permitted to run.
When one becomes a judge, the role changes, the roles change. That is why it is different. You are no longer involved in those battles. You are no longer running an agency. You are no longer making policy. You are a judge. It is hard to explain, perhaps, but you strive -- rather than looking for policy positions, you strive for impartiality. You begin to strip down from those policy positions. You begin to walk away from that constant development of new policies. You have to rule on cases as an impartial judge. And I think that is the important message that I am trying to send to you; that, yes, my whole record is relevant, but remember that that was as a policy maker not as a judge.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
QUESTIONS BY SENATOR BIDEN
 Now, am I correct in presuming that you believe that the right of privacy and the right to make decisions about procreation extend to single individuals as well as married couples, the right of privacy?
A. The privacy, the kind of intimate privacy that we are talking about, I think ----
Q. The right about specifically procreation.
A. Yes, procreation that we are talking about, I think the Court extended in Eisenstadt v. Baird to nonmarried individuals.
Q. Well, that is a very skillful answer, Judge. Judge Souter -- and I was not fully prepared when he gave me the answer. I am now. Judge Souter waltzed away from that by pointing out it was an equal protection case. So that I want to know from you, do single individuals, not married couples alone, have a right of privacy residing in the 14th Amendment liberty clause?
A. Senator, the courts have never decided that, and I don't know of a case that has decided that explicit point. Eisenstadt was, of course, decided as an equal protection case and ----
Q. Not alone, but go on.
A. ---- My answer to you is I cannot sit here and decide that. I don't know ----
Q. Judge, why can't you? That case is an old case. I know of no challenge before the Court on the use of contraceptives by an individual. I can see no reasonable prospect there is going to be any challenge. And, Judge, are you telling me that may come before you? Is that the argument you are going to give me?
A. Well, I am saying that I think that for a judge to sit here without the benefit of arguments and briefs, et cetera, and without the benefit of precedent, I don't think anyone could decide that.
Q. Well, Judge, I think that is the most unartful dodge that I have heard.
Judge, I think the decision in Eisenstadt and so do, I think, most scholars think it stands for a much broader principle beyond equal protection. Let me read to you from Eisenstadt the majority opinion. "The marital couple is not an independent entity with a mind and a heart of its own, but an association of two individuals, each with a separate intellectual and emotional makeup. If the right of privacy means anything, it is the right of the individual, married or single" -- I will stop here. The same point you make about civil rights, individuals.
Back to the quote. "If the right of privacy means anything, it is the right of the individual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted government intrusions into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget child." Many Supreme Court cases since then have been decided using the ruling in 1972 that I have referred to, using this basic principle.
Now, for the time being, let's put aside equal protection again, Judge, and focus on the more sweeping question of the right of privacy. And I ask you again: Do you think that single people have a right to privacy anchored in the Liberty Clause of the 14th Amendment?
A. I think my answer to that, Senator, is similar to my previous answer, and it is this: that the Court has found such a right of privacy to exist in Eisenstadt v. Baird, and I do not have a quarrel with that decision.
Q. So you don't quarrel with the quote I just read to you?
A. I don't quarrel with the decision in Eisenstadt v. Baird.
Q. That is not the question I am asking you, Judge. Do you quarrel with the quote that I read you from the majority opinion?
A. I don't quarrel with the quote, but ----
Q. Do you agree with the quote? Let me ask you that way.
A. Well, let me ----
Q. This is getting more like a debate than it is getting information.
A. The important point that I am trying to make, Senator, is that the case was decided on an equal protection basis.
Q. I understand that.
A. I do not quarrel with the value that you are discussing. I do not quarrel with the result in the case.
Q. Judge, I am not looking for your values because I know you are not going to impose them on us. I am not looking for your judgment on the case as to whether it was equal protection. I am asking you whether the principle that I read to you, which had, in fact, been pointed to and relied upon in other cases, is a constitutional principle with which you agree; which is that single people have the same right of privacy -- not equal protection, privacy -- as married people on the issue of procreation.
Senator Thurmond. The gentleman can finish his answer.
A. I think that the Court has so found, and I agree with that.
Q. Now, you said that the privacy of right of married couples is fundamental, and as I understand it now, you told me -- correct me if I am wrong -- that the privacy right of an individual on procreation is fundamental. Is that right?
A. I think that is consistent with what I said and I think consistent with what the Court held in Eisenstadt v. Baird.
Q. All right. Just so we don't have any problem here, I think your friends think you are getting in trouble and they would like for me to stop. So what I will do is I will stop now.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q. Judge Thomas, you said in your opening statement that you benefited greatly from the efforts of certain civil rights leaders. You further said that but for them, there would be no road to travel. Could you generally describe how you benefited by the efforts of certain civil rights leaders?
A. Senator, I speak with caution. I guess I have spent so much time on my own biography that it may be a matter of concern. But let me just make this point.
There were any number of friends of mine whom I considered when I grew up to be much, much more talented. There were individuals who had enormous ability to remember, individuals who had tremendous capacity with numbers, and you wonder whether or not they would have gone on and become physicists or writers or business persons, what have you.
But somehow, with the impediments -- impediments that said you couldn't go to a library, that you could not go to certain schools, that you could not walk across certain parks, go into certain neighborhoods, impediments that said that you could be picked up and put on the chain gang for just standing on the corner -- somehow with all those impediments, any number of them were prevented from moving on. Relatives, friends -- my grandfather is a perfect example. Enormously talented man.
Unless someone removed those impediments, unless there was a civil rights movement, not all the talent in the world would get me here or get me actually even out of my neighborhood in Savannah.

QUESTIONS BY SENATOR HATCH
 Q. Now, when a Senator asks you, as the nominee, do you believe the Constitution protects the woman's right to choose to terminate her pregnancy, I personally believe the nominee is being asked to decide the principle underlying issue in those type of cases, or certainly in a number of cases that are expected to come before the Court, and probably in the immediate future.
Now, it is irrelevant, in my opinion, and I think in most fair observers' opinion, that if the Senator adds, "Oh, but don't tell me how you're going to decide a particular case," once you give the answer to the first question, you now, does the Constitution protect a woman's right to choose to terminate her pregnancy, if you give the answer to that question, whichever answer that may be, you are well on your way to deciding most of the particular cases in the progeny of cases since Roe v. Wade.
Now, let's not kid ourselves, we all know that and it is in my view inappropriate to keep this up. Thus far, you have been asked almost or a little bit more than 70 questions on abortion. Now, I don't know why you are being singled out, because Justice Souter was asked 36 questions on abortion, and that was way too many, since he hadn't decided how he was going to go, either.
Now, as I heard your testimony the day before, you said that you are basically undecided on that issue, if I understood you correctly, and that you are reserving your judgment until the time when you can listen to all the facts and all of the issues and all of the case law and all of the other materials pertaining to that particular issue. Am I wrong in stating it that way?
A. Senator, I indicated that I think it is important that I retain an open mind and that I don't have an opinion on that important case.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
QUESTIONS BY SENATOR METZENBAUM
 I would just make a comment before getting into another line of inquiry. My colleague from Utah wants to know why you are being treated differently than Judge Souter with respect to the question of a woman's right to choose. I think it is pretty obvious that----
Senator Hatch. Not just Judge Souter; all of the prior justices.
Q. ---- Well, all of them. You have written very extensively and have spoken out quite extensively in this area, and I think it warrants that inquiry. Beyond that, I think there is a greater sense of alarm as to the direction in which the Court seems to be moving, and I think to fail to inquire of you in that area would be irresponsible on our part.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
On Age Discrimination
 In reviewing your record, I was shocked to come across a 1985 statement you made in an interview with the ABA Banking Journal, a banking industry trade publication. In that article, you suggested that discrimination against the elderly could be justifiable.
You are quoted as saying that, "The age discrimination issue is as complicated an economic issue as any we confront in the equal opportunity area." You continued on, "I am of the opinion that there are many technical violations of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act that, for practical or economic reasons, make sense. Older workers cost employers more than younger workers. Employee benefits are linked to longevity and salary. In an economic downturn or when technology calls for staffing changes, employers tend to eliminate the most experienced and costly part of their work force."
Judge Thomas, at that time, you were the chief Federal official in charge of enforcing the law against age discrimination. Yet here you were characterizing age discrimination as an economic issue, and then stating that many violations of the age discrimination law make sense.
. . . How could you, as a law enforcement official, make a public statement which could easily be interpreted by employers as condoning violations of that law?
A. . . . Let me say this: I have never condoned violations of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. In fact, just the opposite. The Act itself has made some very difficult decisions.

 	 	 		. . .	 	I think, Senator, if you would look at the whole article, the point that I was trying to make in the article -- and I haven't had a chance to review the entire article -- is that we were actually upgrading enforcement; that, indeed, this is one area that was technically very complex, that, indeed, employers were at a greater risk.
Later in the article, for example -- and I just had a chance to skim it here -- I say, "Under Thomas, the E.E.O.C. has changed to a system that investigates all cases that fail conciliation." Well, that is actually a misstatement, but it says, "About 85 to 90 percent of cases probably will go on to court,' Thomas said." That is an increase in enforcement, and that is something that we did over time.
The article also refers to, I believe here, the automation programs that I was beginning at that time so that we could better enforce the law.
I have not in any place condoned a violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. These efforts on the part of employers may make sense to them. But if they are wrong, they are wrong. If they violate the act, they violate the act.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
QUESTIONS BY SENATOR DECONCINI
 Would you extend the prohibition of English-only policies in other areas, such as education, voting, to public service and that sort of thing?
A. Senator, again, I don't know the answer to that. I would be concerned that there is discrimination, and I think to the extent that it does amount to discrimination, I think as a matter of policy, that we should eliminate it. Again, I cannot predict how the court cases ----
Q. I am not asking for a court case. I just wonder how your feelings are about prohibiting English- only in the area of education. You know, do you think there is a benefit of bilingual education programs? I am not talking about a substitute one, I am talking about a bilingual one, or voting or citizens who can't understand always the English language and may feel that reading a long referendum doesn't give them the same access. What are your feelings on that, or do you have any?
A. Well, we were sensitive to that at E.E.O.C. I think we went so far as to even include our brochures in Chinese, because of the significant population in San Francisco, I believe. I think it is important that this country, as I have said before, be accessible to everyone. I don't think that the language barrier should prevent people or the erection of a language barrier should prevent individuals from enjoying all the benefits of this country. That is my sensitivity to the issue.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Declines Overseas But Ends Higher in U.S.

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell overseas but ended higher in United States trading yesterday despite news of falling interest rates in the United States.
"The market has been so bearish and so anticipatory of the dollar's decline based on lower interest rates that when it happened it was sort of a fait accompli," said Robert Ryan, corporate foreign exchange manager at Bank of New York. 
 But the appetite for dollars still appeared weak and the currency was likely to continue its slump, he said.
Jerry Egan, a currency trader at the Bank of Boston, said the market's movements yesterday were not surprising and were very technically oriented.
"I think we may have seen the low, but I wouldn't want to stake a whole lot on it," he said.
The dollar ended slightly lower in European trading after the Federal Reserve in Washington cut the discount rate, the loan fee to commercial banks, by a half percentage point, to 5 percent, an 18-year low.
Lower United States interest rates are meant to stimulate lending and make the economy grow. But they also make dollar-based securities less attractive to international investors, tending to weaken the dollar's value.
But traders said the foreign exchange market had for the last two weeks anticipated the rate cuts, so the initial impact of the news wore off and helped the dollar rebound later in the United States.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.7320, from $1.7335 late Thursday. In New York, sterling cost $1.7295, cheaper than $1.7325 late Thursday.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 134.45 Japanese yen, from 134.77 yen at Thursday's close. Later, in London, it was quoted at 133.90 yen. In New York, the dollar closed at 134.15 yen, up from 134.08 Thursday.
Other late New York dollar quotes, compared with Thursday's prices, included: 1.6850 German marks, up from 1.6845; 1.4800 Swiss francs, up from 1.4765; 5.7550 French francs, up from 5.7400; 1,266.00 Italian lire, up from 1263.50, and 1.13575 Canadian dollars, down from 1.13725.
In the precious metals market, gold prices eased abroad but rose slightly in the United States. At the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery was quoted at $344.40 a troy ounce, up 10 cents. At the Republic National Bank of New York, gold was quoted at $344.20, up 15 cents from Thursday.
Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $344.25 a troy ounce, from $346.25 bid late Thursday. In Zurich, it fell to a closing bid of $344.25, down from $346.05 bid late Thursday.
Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.97 to close at a bid $344.44.

HEADLINE: Consumer Prices Rise By Only 0.2%

BYLINE: By Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 13

 BODY:
Consumer prices rose a modest two-tenths of 1 percent for the third month in a row in August, the Labor Department said today in a report seen as confirmation that inflation is still not a significant threat to the economy.
The August increase in the Consumer Price Index was slightly below the three-tenths of 1 percent rise expected by economists. The so-called core rate of inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose four-tenths of 1 percent in August, slightly higher than expected, after identical four-tenths of 1 percent gains in June and July. 
 Medical costs and clothing were among the consumer expenses that rose last month, while food and energy prices fell.
Soon after the release of the report, which showed consumer inflation so far this year running at a 2.7 percent annual rate, the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark discount rate in an effort to stimulate the economy, and a number of banks began cutting their prime rate.
In the past, the Fed has hesitated to cut rates for fear of stoking inflation, which last year hit 6.1 percent at the consumer level. But as price increases have moderated this year, the central bank has eased credit steadily.
"It looks like a reasonably good report," said Cynthia Latta, senior financial economist at DRI/McGraw Hill. "I think the easing of inflation is under way."
Most analysts discounted the larger-than-expected rise in the closely watched core rate, saying it was mostly attributable to seasonal price increases.
"The four-tenths core rate is at that level mainly because of some seasonal increases in apparel and education, so we don't see that as a sustainable situation," said Carol Stone, senior economist at Nomura Securities International Inc.
On Thursday, the Labor Department said wholesale prices rose a slim two-tenths of 1 percent last month after two months of declines.
Over all, the Consumer Price Index stood at 136.6 in August, meaning that a basket of goods and services that cost an average of $100 in 1982-84 cost $136.60 last month.
Among the largest increases last month were clothing and maintenance costs, which jumped 1.2 percent, their largest gain since February.
Medical costs, led by prescription drug prices, continued their upward spiral, rising eight-tenths of 1 percent in August and 8.4 percent over the past 12 months.
Energy prices fell two-tenths of 1 percent in August because of lower prices for electricity and natural gas. Petroleum prices rose, however, with gasoline up five-tenths of 1 percent and home fuel costs up 1.1 percent.
Food prices fell three-tenths of 1 percent in August after a six-tenths of 1 percent decline in July, led by a decline in fresh fruits and vegetables, the department said.
New automobile prices rose two-tenths of 1 percent in August, while used car prices eased two-tenths of 1 percent. Air fares rose nine-tenths of 1 percent in August after a three-tenths of 1 percent dip in July.
Services, which account for more than half of the Consumer Price Index, rose three-tenths of 1 percent last month after a four-tenths of 1 percent rise in July. Entertainment costs rose four-tenths of 1 percent in August and July.

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 13

 BODY:
Retail sales tumbled seven-tenths of 1 percent in August, the biggest decline since January, when the Persian Gulf war kept many shoppers at home, the Commerce Department estimated today.
The results, considerably worse than most analysts had expected, were poorest for the automotive and housing-related sectors but also extended into general merchandise and clothing. The biggest gain, 1 percent, was at gasoline stations, but this was partly a result of a presumably short-lived increases in oil prices. 
 Combined with weak money-supply growth and this week's second report of subdued inflation -- the Government reported today that consumer prices rose a modest two-tenths of 1 percent in August -- the sales decline prompted a new round of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.
The fear is that the economic recovery is stalling out despite some solid advances in the manufacturing sector. Industrial output, for example, is expected to post a gain of five-tenths of 1 percent or more when the August figures are reported Tuesday.
 
Importance of Consumers
 But consumers account for two-thirds of economic activity, half of this by buying goods and services in retail establishments.
"If ever there was a number to ease monetary policy on, it was this one," said Kenneth T. Mayland, economist for Society National Bank in Cleveland, referring to today's report of poor sales.
The decline, about twice as large as anticipated, followed a five-tenths of 1 percent advance in July and continued a pattern of alternate ups and downs extending back to March.
Automotive dealers suffered a 2.7 percent sales drop last month to account for the main part of the overall decline. Excluding the automotive sector, retail sales fell two-tenths of 1 percent.
"Cars have gotten expensive," said Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover. It now takes 26 weeks of average-family income to buy the average new car, up from 17 weeks in 1972, he noted.
Mr. Kellner and other economists said consumers were pulling back generally because of eroding job prospects, wavering confidence, high debt and rising tax burdens. And the presumed spur from lower interest rates, they added, is being offset to a considerable degree by diminished purchasing power of those of who receive interest income.
"Consumers' propensity to spend for discretionary items is often governed by his or her supplemental income from either interest or dividends," stated Albert Sindlinger, the veteran Pennsylvania pollster. "The cash registers of retailers correlate with the rise or decline of this gift money for spending."
The other categories of durable goods also posted declines last month -- 3.1 percent for stores selling furniture, home furnishings and equipment and 2.6 percent for merchants selling building materials, hardware, garden supplies and mobile homes.
 
Durable Goods Fall
 Over all, sales of durables fell 2.2 percent after being unchanged in July.
Among nondurables -- goods expected to last less than three years -- sales edged up one-tenth of 1 percent, far less than July's eight-tenths of 1 percent advance.
Stores selling general merchandise, including department stores, had a seven-tenths of 1 percent decline and sales at food stores eased three-tenths of 1 percent. But in addition to the 1 percent rise at gasoline service stations there were gains of eight-tenths of 1 percent for restaurants and bars and five-tenths of 1 percent at drug and proprietary stores. Sales at apparel stores showed a negligible one-tenth of 1 percent decline in sharp contrast to a 1.6 percent July surge.
Total retail sales were $152.26 billion last month -- $99.25 billion non-durables and $53.01 billion durables -- eight-tenths of 1 percent above the August 1990 level, the department's report showed.
The figures are adjusted for seasonal, holiday and trading-day differences but not for inflation. Since consumer prices rose 3.8 percent over the latest 12 months, the volume of goods moving across retail counters fell about 3 percent over the year.

HEADLINE: Intel Stock Falls on Weak Outlook

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 13

 BODY:
The Intel Corporation's shares plummeted more than $6 today after the semiconductor company said that its third-quarter earnings and revenues would not reach its or Wall Street's expectations.
Intel, which makes most of the microprocessor chips that serve as the brains of I.B.M.-compatible personal computers, attributed the shortfall to weakness in its commodity-chip and computer-making businesses. Andrew S. Grove, the president and chief executive, said seasonal weakness, a sluggish economy and rapid transition in the computer industry had weakened demand. 
 Mr. Grove said sales had slowed of the personal computers Intel makes, which are resold by other computer companies under their own brand names. He added that demand remained strong for its leading microprocessors, the 80386 and 80486.
But with the recent entry of Advanced Micro Devices Inc., which sells a 386 clone, Intel now faces competition on its best-selling basic chip.
 
Price Cuts Prove Troubling
 Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., has tried to dismiss the the importance of the competition, but analysts said today that it had caused the giant to lower prices, which has in turn lowered its profit margins and earnings.
The company "finds it more comfortable to blame commodity chip prices," said Drew Peck of the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation in New York. But in fact, the company has lowered prices dramatically on the 486 in response to Advanced Micro, as well as on its math co-processors, he added. This has lowered the company's earnings, Mr. Peck said.
Intel's shares fell $6.75, or 13.5 percent, to $43, in over-the-counter trading, where it was the most heavily traded issue, with 9.8 million shares.
Mr. Peck said Intel's news rattled the financial community because "there had been a widely held hope that as long as Intel was O.K., then maybe the semiconductor business wasn't doing as bad as we thought it was." He added, "Now there isn't any question that there is a problem that extends beyond a seasonal slowdown."
Intel said favorable nonrecurring items stemming from the settlement of a tax dispute would probably keep its third-quarter earnings above the 83 cents a share it reported in the 1990 quarter, but below analysts' estimates of $1 a share. The company had predicted that earnings would be $1 to a $1.02 a share. Intel's operating income is expected to decline from $231 million, or $1.10 a share, in the second quarter of this year.
"When we announced second-quarter earnings in July, we noted that the third-quarter outlook was uncertain, and that has proved to be the case," Mr. Grove said. "August was slower than expected, and September isn't showing any great upsurge."
He said demand had fallen for Intel's Eprom chips, those that can be programmed by users, and its microcontrollers, chips used in automobiles and for other non-computing applications.
According to Securities and Exchange Commission reports, Gordon E. Moore, Intel's chairman and co-founder, sold 100,000 common shares on Aug. 13 at $50 each. An Intel spokeswoman said today that the earnings' projections were recent developments and were unrelated to Mr. Moore's stock sale. Intel policy requires officers to suspend stock trading until public disclosure of any material information, she said.
But today, analysts tended to divide sharply over Intel's report, and those who supported the company before largely did so today.
"The stock got hammered today, but I consider that an overreaction," said Daniel L. Klesken, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Research Inc. in San Francisco. "I've maintained a 'strong buy' " on the stock, he said.

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 13

 BODY:
The first 1992 models to reach showrooms failed to improve demand in the flagging United States auto industry, as sales of domestically built cars and light trucks declined 15.3 percent in early September. Analysts predict that auto makers will increase sales incentives on new vehicles if sales do not improve in coming weeks.
Sales of cars alone dropped 23 percent from the levels of a year earlier. On a seasonally adjusted basis, cars sold at an annual rate of 5.4 million, compared with 7.1 million in the period last year. Analysts had predicted the annual rate would be higher, and said the sales figures showed weak consumer demand. Sales of light trucks fell 1.1 percent. 
 "It seems to indicate the rebound that people were expecting might not occur until much later," said Michael Bowyer, an analyst with Duff & Phelps in Chicago. "It will be difficult for the economy over all to generate a sustained recovery without participation by the auto makers," he added.
 
Rate Cut May Help
 Mr. Bowyer said the Federal Reserve's cut in short-term rates today and the subsequent cut in the prime rate by banks might help sales to some extent. But he added, "I don't think you're going to see really improved car sales until consumers think the recession is over."
The early September figures showed an unusually sharp drop for two reasons, analysts said. Sales to car-rental companies and other fleet buyers were weak in the recent 10-day period compared with a year earlier. Also, sales incentives were richer last year, when auto makers rushed to clear large dealer inventories after the Kuwait invasion. By comparison, current inventories on dealer lots are near a 20-year low.
Even after considering those factors, however, "there is no denying that real, underlying demand is exceptionally weak," said Tom Webb, chief economist for the National Automobile Dealers Association.
Ronald A. Glantz, an analyst with Dean Witter Securities in San Francisco, said he expected sales to pick up soon, given the number of redesigned models on showroom floors, particularly from the General Motors Corporation, the largest auto maker. Also, the plants that produce fleet cars are working overtime, he said. "I have to believe that those sales are going to show up soon," he said.
G.M. reported a drop in car sales of 24.8 percent for the 10-day period, to 53,162. G.M. models that managed sales increases included its Geo Prizm, Buick Park Avenue and Oldsmobile Ninety Eight. G.M.'s light-truck sales fell 6.8 percent, to 31,312.
 
Ford Down 25.4%
 The Ford Motor Company sold 27,464 cars, a decline of 25.4 percent. The No. 2 auto maker posted sales of 25,104 light trucks, a drop of 8.9 percent. The only sales increase in its light-truck lineup was for its Explorer four-wheel-drive vehicle.
Chrysler's car sales, based on estimates by Ward's Automotive Reports, declined 35.6 percent in the period, to 10,300. Light-truck sales, however, were estimated to have increased by 29.4 percent, to 16,500. Chrysler reports sales only at the end of each month.
Among the Japanese auto makers, the Honda Motor Company reported that sales remained steady at 10,231 United States-built cars, while the Toyota Motor Corporation's car sales rose 3.7 percent. Honda makes cars in Marysville, Ohio, and Toyota operates plants in Fremont, Calif., and Georgetown, Ky.
Over all, G.M., Ford and Chrysler lost market share in early September, as their portion of sales of North American-built cars fell to 83.7 percent, from 87.5 percent a year ago. The Japanese "transplants" picked up almost 4 points of market share, growing to 16.3 percent of the domestic market for cars, compared with 12.5 percent a year earlier.

HEADLINE: U.S. Is Said to Weigh Shift In Lease on Philippine Base

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANILA, Sept. 13

 BODY:
The United States would consider modifications of a lease agreement for the Subic Bay Naval Station in the central Philippines to prevent an immediate shutdown of the huge American installation, Western diplomats said today.
The diplomats said the Bush Administration, in what appears to be a major shift in its bargaining position, is willing to consider a three-year phased withdrawal from Subic instead of the 10-year base treaty that is now under debate -- and facing rejection -- in the Philippine Senate. 
 "It's fair to say that we would consider any proposal presented by the Filipinos short of an out-and-out rejection of the treaty," an American diplomat said today. "Subic is a very valuable facility to the United States."
The largest American military base in Southeast Asia, Subic Bay is a major repair and supply installation for the United States Seventh Fleet and is home to more than 7,000 American troops and civilian workers.
While its strategic importance has been questioned because of the end of the cold war, American officials say Subic remains a critical, and in many ways irreplaceable, component of military planning in the Pacific.
 
Earlier Stand by Bush
 They say Subic's functions could be duplicated elsewhere in the region, but at a cost of several billion dollars. "And you can't replicate those functions in any one place," a diplomat said.
Earlier this week, President Bush and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney suggested that the United States would abandon Subic before agreeing to any modification of the treaty. "We've made our best offer," the President said in Washington.
Most of the 23 members of the Philippine Senate, which must ratify treaties, have already announced their opposition to the decade-long base agreement negotiated this summer. Under the pact, the United States would pay $203 million a year in rent for the base.
Several senators oppose the treaty on the ground of national sovereignty, saying it is time to end nearly a century of American military presence on Philippine soil. Others oppose the specific terms of the agreement, especially what they regard as an insultingly low amount of money offered.
The vote on the new base agreement is expected on or before Monday, when the treaty expires. As the Philippine Senate moves closer to a final decision, members are being confronted with a series of alternatives designed to make it possible for American troops to remain, at least for the time being.
One set of proposals would put off the United States withdrawal for three years, a period in which American negotiators could seek a new, long-range treaty.
Another proposal, sponsored by President Corazon C. Aquino, would put the base issue to voters in a referendum in which they might overrule the expected Senate rejection. Opinion polls suggest that Filipinos overwhelmingly support an American presence at Subic, since the base contributes hundreds of millions of dollars a year to a fragile economy.
Western diplomats say the United States would be willing to discuss these alternative proposals with Manila.
The diplomats here said today that they were closely watching the actions of leaders of the coup-prone Philippine military, who have called for ratification of the 10-year treaty.
The Philippine military is dependent on weapons and other assistance from the United States, and Philippine reporters and politicians have wondered aloud in recent days whether the country's civilian Government might be under a coup threat if the treaty was rejected.

HEADLINE: FEDERAL RESERVE TRIMS LOAN COSTS TO SPUR ECONOMY

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 13

 BODY:
Faced with a raft of new evidence that the economy is still weak, the Federal Reserve today drove down the interest rates it controls to their lowest points since the 1970's.
Across the country, large banks responded immediately by reducing their prime rate, the benchmark for many mortgages and other consumer and commercial loans. 
 The Federal Reserve cut the discount rate, the rate it charges banks for loans, to 5 percent from 5 1/2 percent, and acted to lower the Federal funds rate, which banks charge one another for loans, to 5 1/4 percent from 5 1/2 percent.
 
Push for Consumption
 Economic policy makers hope that lower rates will lead consumers to borrow and spend more and give the economy the jolt it needs to move cleanly out of recession. New data released today showed a sharp drop in retail sales and only a modest rise in prices in August. [Page 35.]
The Federal Reserve's actions had been so widely anticipated in the financial markets in light of recent economic data that stock prices fell, apparently reflecting the adage that traders buy on rumor and sell on fact. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 2,985.69, down 22.14 points, or seven-tenths of 1 percent. Bond prices were off slightly. [Page 38.]
 
Action May Not Be Enough
 Many economists said the steps taken today might prove insufficient to stimulate an economy that is having trouble getting past the recession that began in mid-1990. In general, the recession was not nearly so deep as the one in the early 1980's. But the economy barely grew in the year before this latest recession began, and even if, as most economists now believe, the recession is over, the economy is virtually at a standstill.
"I sense a growing anxiety about the strength of this economic recovery," said Norman Robertson, chief economist of Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. "In many ways, the recovery is indistinguishable from the recession."
Someone familiar with the thinking on the Federal Reserve Board said the central bank acted today in large part because of figures that came out on Thursday showing that the nation's money supply by the most common measurement fell last week. Growth in money this year is now below the Federal Reserve's target range.
In addition, the data on retail sales reinforced the economic weakness recorded in other recent statistics like those on employment, automobile production and housing construction.
And the policy makers apparently felt that the modest rise in consumer prices indicated that inflation was under control. The main argument against reducing rates is that doing so might lead to worse inflation.
 
Timing the Fed's Action
 Another reason the Fed may have moved today is that the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, is going to Moscow next week to discuss economic reform with Soviet leaders, and the discount rate would not have been reduced in his absence.
The Bush Administration, which has been pressing for lower rates to make the economy stronger as the Presidential election year approaches, expressed pleasure. "It's good news," said Marlin Fitzwater, President Bush's spokesman. "I don't think there's any doubt we're coming out of the recession."
Most Democrats were less upbeat. Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan, chairman of the Banking Committee, said that the Federal Reserve's decision was long overdue and that "its strategy of small, slow steps has not worked."
The Federal Reserve Board met early this morning and announced shortly after 9 A.M. that it had voted, 4 to 0, to cut the discount rate to 5 percent, the lowest rate since February 1973. One Federal Reserve governor, Edward W. Kelley Jr., did not vote because he was out of the country, and two seats on the seven-seat board are vacant.
 
Large Purchases of Securities
 Later in the morning, the Federal Reserve bought large quantities of Government securities to indicate that it wanted to reduce the Federal funds rate to 5 1/4 percent, the lowest since 1977.
No sooner had the discount rate cut been announced than the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company in New York, the nation's fourth-largest bank, announced that it was reducing its prime rate to 8 percent from 8 1/2 percent. Other banks quickly followed suit. This means that interest rates may fall soon on mortgages, auto loans and other consumer borrowing, even though they have been slow to do so up to now.
The spread between the rates the Federal Reserve controls and the prime rate is unusually large, as it has been for a few years. This shows that banks are reluctant to lend money and are wary about taking risks in light of the many bad loans made in the 1980's.
 
Spread Between the Rates
 In the spring of 1987, the last time the prime rate was as low as 8 percent, the Federal funds rate was 6 1/4 percent and the discount rate 5 1/2 percent. In 1973, when the discount rate was last at 5 percent, the prime rate was 6 percent.
This was the third time this year the discount rate has been cut and the sixth time the Federal funds rate has been reduced. The Federal Reserve has been steadily driving rates down since 1989, when the Federal funds rate was nearly 10 percent and the discount rate 7 percent. The prime rate reached 11 1/2 percent in early 1989.
The Federal Reserve Board issued this official statement this morning: "Action was taken in light of weakness in the money and credit aggregates, the improving inflation environment and concerns about the ongoing strength of the economic expansion. The reduction, in part, realigns the discount rate with market interest rates."
 
Concern About Money Supply
 Mr. Greenspan has told Congress that he is extremely concerned about the slow growth in money supply. The only way the money supply will rise is if banks lend more money.
The Federal Reserve's target for growth in M-2, which is primarily cash, checking, savings and money market accounts and small certificates of deposit and is the most common gauge of the money supply, is 2.5 percent to 6.5 percent for the year. Growth is running below that range now. Last week, M-2 fell by $9.7 billion.
Michael J. Boskin, chairman of President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, said he was especially pleased by the Federal Reserve's action today because it indicated a desire to move the money supply into the middle of the target range.
Some economists believe the Federal Reserve is placing too much emphasis on M-2. For example, Albert M. Wojnilower, a senior economist at First Boston Corporation in New York, said that it was an unreliable figure and that he was disappointed the central bank cited it in its official statement about the rate cut.
 
Embarrassing to the Fed
 But other economists said the inability of Mr. Greenspan and his colleagues to keep the money supply within such a large range was embarrassing.
What worries some experts is that the Federal Reserve may not be able to reinvigorate the economy singlehanded, and there are no other arrows in the quiver.
An expected budget deficit of well over $300 billion next year means that Federal taxes are not likely to be cut or spending increased, normal steps when the economy is weak. State and local governments, which must operate on balanced budgets, are doing exactly the opposite, raising taxes and cutting spending, a drag on the recovery.
"The open question is whether what happened today is too little, too late," said Robert H. Chandross, chief economist at Lloyds Bank in New York. "We just don't know the answer yet."

HEADLINE: Dow Off 22.14 on Signs of Weak Economy

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Despite a cut in the discount rate by the Federal Reserve, stocks closed lower yesterday, with the Dow Jones industrial average down 22.14, to 2,985.69. For the week, the Dow lost 25.94 points.
The rate cut by the Fed came after statistics were released showing that the rise in the Consumer Price Index in August was less than had been expected and that retail sales had dropped last month. 
 "It was an orderly decline -- there wasn't any tremendous selling conviction," said Eugene Peroni, chief technical analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott. "Many investors are sidelined right now and waiting to see how corporate earnings hold up."
The New York Stock Exhange composite index was down 1.84, to 210.58. Volume on the Big Board was 168 million shares.
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks was down 3.75, to 383.59. Over-the-counter trading was brisk, with the Nasdaq composite down 4.42, to 516.71.
Blue-chip stocks fell in the morning but had regained some of their losses by afternoon. The realization that the cut in the discount rate is a sign of an economy that is still weak caused many investors to refrain from buying, analysts said.
Peter G. Grennan, senior vice president and head of stock index futures trading at Shearson Lehman, said the market had factored in the rate cut before it came.
"Investors are more concerned with corporate earnings than rates, and in the long term this will be bullish for stocks," he said. "Between now and Thanksgiving investors may want to buy into stocks that are pulling back in price. Strategically, you want to buy groups and stocks that may do well in 1992, and ignore short-term gyrations."
There was action in the securities of Dow Chemical, which announced on Thursday that it would make payments on its outstanding contigent value rights on Sept. 30. Dow issued the rights in December 1989 as a deferred payment when its pharmaceutical unit merged with 67 percent of Marion Laboratories. The value rights stock rose 4 7/8, to 11, while Dow Chemical rose 1/8, to 51 5/8.
Shares of the combined company, Marion Merrell Dow, plunged 8 1/4, to 29 3/4, after the decision to redeem the rights dashed speculation that Dow Chemical would buy the remainder of Marion Merrell, traders noted. Marion Merrell shares were among the most actively traded yesterday.
Largely as a result of the Dow value rights stock, analysts said, the American Stock Exchange was the only composite index that was up, rising 1.12, to 367.34.
Technology stocks were weak, led by Intel, a computer manufacturer, which said it expected third-quarter earnings to drop below analysts' estimates of about $1 a share because of weak demand and soft prices for chips and systems. Intel shares were down 6 3/4, to 43. Other computer companies seemed affected by Intel's news and by anxiety about third-quarter earnings: I.B.M. was down 1 1/8, to 102 7/8; Apple Computer was down 2, to 48 5/8, and Compaq Computer fell 1/2, to 33 7/8.

HEADLINE: THE SOVIET TRANSITION;
Accord Seen as Unlikely to End Afghan War

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 13

 BODY:
The agreement to end American and Soviet military support for combatants in Afghanistan's civil war could hasten the fall of the nation's Soviet-backed Government, but it is unlikely to end the war itself, Government and private experts on the conflict said today.
For Washington and Moscow, those experts said, the long-anticipated agreement to wind up their proxy guerrilla conflict is but a footnote to the cold war. Although the Afghan war was said to be the Central Intelligence Agency's single largest operation, Congress had signaled the White House that this fiscal year was the last in which the war would be financed, officials said today. 
 Congress made modest cuts last year in the C.I.A. Afghan program, which cost $260 million a year at its peak, said one official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The Soviet Union had poured hundreds of millions of dollars in arms into Afghanistan since its military left the country in 1989, but its shipments, too, had declined in recent months.
Regardless, those experts said that the war would drag on, either with other sponsors or as an internal feud among the fundamentalist Muslim groups who are fighting the central Government with American help.
Some 1.5 million people have died and 5 million more have become refugees in the 12-year conflict.
 
Other Aid Likely to Continue
 Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, China and Iran all have aided the Muslim rebels and are likely to continue to do so, several experts said in interviews today.
The central Government, installed by the Soviets when they intervened in 1979 and currently led by President Najibullah, has relied on Moscow for military support. But it also has large stockpiles of weapons and may appeal to other friendly nations, like India and North Korea, for new assistance.
"I think that India is Najibullah's last best hope," Representative Charles Wilson, a Texas Democrat who has been an ardent supporter of the C.I.A.'s Afghan operations, said in a telephone interview today.
"The best thing that can happen is that he will leave," Mr. Wilson said. "The worst, which is possible, is that he will become just another warlord" in a country whose rural areas are already carved into tribal fiefdoms.
Mr. Najibullah's economic and political fortunes have declined in recent months, and it is unclear how long he can survive without Soviet aid, which is set to end on Dec. 31.
Representative Wilson and an American intelligence official who spoke on condition of anonymity predicted today that he would be overthrown or would flee by year's end.
Other more cautious experts noted that United States analysts also predicted Mr. Najibullah's quick downfall in February 1989, when the last Soviet soldier left Afghanistan after 10 years of military occuption. Instead, both Mr. Najibullah and his military proved more popular and more resilient than many outsiders had believed.

HEADLINE: Fund Denies Salomon Tie In Scandal

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD

 BODY:
The Tiger Management Company, in its first public comments on the firm's business with Salomon Brothers, said yesterday that it had no knowledge that Salomon had used its name fraudulently in a Treasury auction until months later. It added that it had engaged in no wrongdoing.
Tiger's role has been under scrutiny because Salomon said in a statement to Congress that it had submitted a $2 billion bid for Tiger at the May auction of two-year notes, although Tiger had authorized a bid of only $1.5 billion. 
 In denying its involvement in any illegal activities, the investment fund provided numerous new details about its relationship with Salomon and with Paul W. Mozer, the former head of Salomon's Government securities desk, who is at the center of numerous investigations.
The Salomon scandal has put an uncomfortable spotlight on Tiger, a hedge fund headed by Julian H. Robertson Jr. Since its founding in 1980 by Mr. Robertson and a partner, Tiger has quietly built itself into an influential force in the market.
Following Mr. Robertson's style of making quick and decisive investment decisions based on fundamental analysis of each security, Tiger has won respect on Wall Street, developing close relationships with some of the biggest investment houses, particularly Morgan Stanley & Company. Tiger was one of two large investors that purchased more than $1 billion of securities through Salomon in the May auction. The Government is investigating whether Salomon colluded with other investors to squeeze the market.
Salomon purchased for itself and its largest customers, Tiger and the Quantum Fund, a financial vehicle run by George Soros, $10.6 billion of the $12.25 billion auction.
In its statement, Tiger said its purchases through Salomon involved no improper activities, and that it had not engaged in any collusion or effort to corner the market. "The evidence shows that in connection with its trading of two-year notes, Tiger at all times adhered to the letter and spirit of every applicable law and regulation," the statement said.
The firm also said that it had begun cooperating early and voluntarily with the Justice Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Attorney in Manhattan, the Treasury Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Executives with the firm have provided testimony and documents for the investigations.
 
Discrepancy Noted
 In testimony before Congress, Richard C. Breeden, chairman of the S.E.C., said that in July or August, a customer told investigators examining the May auction that there was a discrepancy between the amount listed on the bid sheets submitted to the Government and the amount of notes they had purchased. Tiger's name was not mentioned, but it was the only large customer whose name was used without authorization to buy securities in the May auction.
Tiger said it had decided to invest in Treasury notes after receiving investment advice from Lehrman Bell Mueller Cannon Inc., an economic consulting firm. In May, the fund purchased $800 million in two-year notes that had been auctioned in April in the secondary market through Morgan Stanley.
After the purchase, on May 16, Morgan Stanley told Tiger that it would not be able to finance a Tiger position in the two-year notes in excess of $2 billion for what were described as internal accounting reasons.
As a result of the decision, Tiger turned to Salomon as the largest primary dealer in the country and also because a trader at Tiger knew a Salomon trader, the firm said.
In a telephone conference on May 16, Salomon told Tiger that it was better to buy Treasury securities at auction than in the secondary market, in part because of what was described as greater liquidity in the auction market.
As a result of the conversation, a dinner meeting was set for May 20, two days before the auction. That meeting has been the subject of Government scrutiny because of concern that Mr. Mozer improperly provided proprietary information to the fund, or persuaded it to collude with Salomon.
At the dinner meeting, held with Mr. Mozer, another Salomon executive and two Tiger traders at Le Refuge restaurant in Manhattan, Tiger was performing what it described as its own due diligence before investing in the auction. "At that meeting, Salomon Brothers did not identify any of its customers, did not represent that Tiger would receive a special -- as opposed to general -- repurchase interest rate," the statement said.
While not promising such a rate, Mr. Mozer discussed the likelihood that the special rate would be available in related trading subsequent to the auction, a Tiger executive said.
Shortly before the auction on May 22, Tiger telephoned the Government trading desk at Salomon Brothers and placed an order for $1.5 billion of securities. Mr. Mozer subsequently placed an order for $2 billion, and purchased the additional $500 million from Tiger at the auction price. Tiger apparently did not know of the transaction, according to Salomon, because its confirmation slip showed only the $1.5 billion purchase.
Also, Mr. Mozer telephoned Tiger after the auction and told its representatives that the fund had been awarded $1.5 billion in notes in competitive bidding. Tiger then sold the $800 million in two-year notes it held with Morgan Stanley.
On May 30, before the settlement date for the securities and after consulting with Lehrman Bell, Tiger sold its position in two-year notes to Salomon, eliminating the need for financing of the position from the firm.

HEADLINE: THE SOVIET TRANSITION;
U.S. AND SOVIETS TO END ARMS SALES TO AFGHAN RIVALS

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Sept. 13

 BODY:
In yet another move to settle longstanding regional disputes, the United States and the Soviet Union agreed today to stop all arms sales to combatants in Afghanistan to help pave the way for free elections and a final settlement of the Afghan civil war.
After a meeting this morning to tie up the details, the Soviet Foreign Minister, Boris D. Pankin, and Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d read a joint statement declaring their intention to cease all weapons deliveries -- and to encourage all other countries to cease theirs -- by Jan. 1, 1992. In the interim, they agreed not to step up current arms shipments to their respective Afghan allies. 
 And in another sign of the times, Mr. Baker visited K.G.B. headquarters and was told by the new K.G.B. chief that it was time for the two countries to curb their spying on each other.
 
New Arms Cut Discussed
 Mr. Baker also met with Gen. Vladimir Lobov, chief of the General Staff of the Soviet armed forces, and won his agreement to an American proposal to discuss cutting both sides' arsenals of short-range nuclear weapons, the official Tass news agency reported.
The United States and the Soviet Union have been negotiating the agreement to "discontinue weapons deliveries to all Afghan sides" for more than two years. It follows Moscow's announcement last week that it was recognizing the independence of the Baltic states, and its announcements Tuesday that it would pull its military forces out of Cuba and explore a settlement of the long-festering dispute with Japan over four Kurile islands, seized by Moscow from Japan at the end of World War II.
The common denominator of each of these regional issues is that they were major irritants to either Soviet-American or Soviet-Japanese relations, and that as long as they remained so they would be political obstacles to any large-scale economic aid from either Washington or Tokyo to Moscow.
Soviet officials, as they returned today from Tokyo after progress on the Kuriles, said they would like a good-will gesture of up to $15 billion in economic aid from Japan, according to Tass.
What the Soviets are now doing, American officials said, is the foreign policy equivalent of a liquidation sale, jettisoning or moderating long-held foreign policy positions to clear away every political excuse the West might have not to grant Moscow economic assistance. This only became possible as a result of the August revolution, which swept most hard-liners out of the Soviet leadership and dissolved the Communist Party. American officials, uncertain as to how long the central Government under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will last, have been eager to exploit the Soviet desperation as best, and as quickly, as they can.
"Two weeks ago we had some very contentious items -- I call them old agenda items -- on our agenda with the Soviet Union," Mr. Baker said, with Mr. Pankin standing by his side. "One of those was independence for the Baltic states. That is off the agenda. The Baltic states have their independence. Cuba. A very, very difficult issue, a thorny issue in U.S.-Soviet relations for a long, long time. You heard what President Gorbachev said on that issue. That old agenda item is disappearing from the agenda."
"Afghanistan," continued Mr. Baker, "an issue where the Soviet Union and the United States have been directly in confrontation and at loggerheads for quite some time. This agreement this morning -- something we have sought to work out for the last two years -- has now been worked out, at least in terms of a willingness on the part of both of us to say that no more military supplies are going to be shipped in there after the first of January. This removes three of the most contentious and 'old agenda' items that have impeded and obstructed progress in this relationship, and I just have to tell you we are delighted to see these old agenda items being removed."
The Soviet-American understanding on Afghanistan does not settle the long Afghan civil war. What it does do is disengage the superpowers from that conflict, which might help promote a resolution.
The Soviet Union intervened in Afghanistan in December 1979 to replace an Afghan Government whose loyalty to Moscow was growing shaky. In 1988, in Geneva talks sponsored by the United Nations, the Soviets pressed the United States to agree to a cutoff in all arms supplies by Washington, and by its allies Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, to the anti-Soviet Muslim rebels seeking to oust Moscow's Afghan ally, President Najibullah. This would be in return for a Soviet pullout. Washington refused. The Soviets pulled out anyway, but continued to send arms to support the Najibullah Government.
Since then, the two superpowers, each of which has grown a bit disenchanted with their Afghan allies, have been trying to work out an agreement for a simultaneous arms cutoff, as well as an arrangement for the installation of a transitional government to conduct free elections.
Agreement on these latter issues always foundered on the refusal of Mr. Najibullah to step aside early in the transitional process to assure the rebels that elections would be free and fair. The Muslim rebels have refused to take part in such a transition as long as Mr. Najibullah remains in power.
 
Uncertainty About Combatants
 Neither foreign minister was prepared to say for sure that the rebels or Mr. Najibullah would now be prepared to bridge their differences, or that Saudi Arabia and Pakistan would be certain to join the arms cutoff.
What Mr. Baker and Mr. Pankin essentially agreed upon today was to end their own arms sales, for the United States to encourage its allies to end theirs as well, and to turn over the whole question of a settlement of the Afghan conflict to the United Nations.
In a joint commentary on their joint statement, the Soviets and Americans declared: "It is also expected that other countries involved in the Afghan conflict should follow the U.S.S.R. and the United States in limiting their assistance to Afghanistan to humanitarian assistance only. We expect that our joint steps will facilitate launching an intra-Afghan negotiating process and should lead to a pause followed by a complete cessation of hostilities."
The joint statement said the two sides "reaffirm the need for a political settlement in Afghanistan that insures an independent and non-aligned Afghanistan," adding: "To this end, they pledge to support a democratic and free electoral process that is not subject to manipulation or interference by anyone. They request the United Nations, with the support of the concerned governments, including those of Islamic countries, to work with the Afghans to convene a credible and impartial transition mechanism."
 
Mideast Conference Discussed
 Mr. Baker and Mr. Pankin also said that they had discussed the proposed Middle East peace conference, but that they were not yet in a position to agree on the wording or timing for issuing invitations to that conference, which is tentatively scheduled for October. The main holdup is that Israel and the Palestinians have not agreed upon which Palestinians may attend.
In addition, American officials say, the issue of Israel's request for $10 billion in housing loan guarantees could also threaten the talks if Israel and its backers in the United States Congress do not postpone the request until after the conference convenes.
A senior Administration official said Washington's Arab allies had told President Bush that it could jeopardize Arab participation in the conference if the United States were to grant Israel $10 billion in housing loan guarantees now without a firm promise from Israel that none of this money would be spent in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
 
Settlement Freeze Sought
 In addition, the official said, because of its own opposition to Israeli settlement activity and its now-total lack of faith in previous Israeli promises not to spend American funds in the occupied territories, the Bush Administration will also want to insure at a mimimum that there is a freeze on new Israeli settlements in return for any American loan guarantees.
A potentially contentious debate on this issue of freezing settlements lies behind the Administration's desire to postpone the Israeli request and its anxiety that if it is not postponed it could block the peace conference, by alienating either Israel or the Arabs.
After his meeting with Mr. Pankin, Mr. Baker visited the office of the new chairman of the K.G.B., Vadim V. Bakatin, who told his American guest that it was time for both the K.G.B. and the Central Intelligence Agency to reduce their spying on each other's country.
"I think that on a mutual basis we will do that," Mr. Bakatin told Mr. Baker. "In the K.G.B., there is a principle question: Who is our adversary? And now the K.G.B. has lost that adversary. So we have to work a lot in order to acquire a new image where we do not have any enemies at all."
 
'A Fantastic Visit'
 Mr. Bakatin and Mr. Baker both appeared to revel in the idea that a member of the American Cabinet was stopping in for a chat with the Soviet spymaster.
"Your visit is a fantastic visit," Mr. Bakatin said to Mr. Baker.
"Well, you know, Mr. Bakatin," Mr. Baker responded, "I don't think anything could symbolize the changes going on in the Soviet Union today any better than the fact that the Secretary of State of the United States of America is meeting here in K.G.B. headquarters."
Mr. Bakatin, who took over the K.G.B. office after its previous occupant, Vladimir A. Kryuchkov, was implicated in the failed coup, responded, "The K.G.B. has changed, or I'm not fit for the post."
As the reporters left the room, Mr. Bakatin gestured at the Soviet security men escorting them out and told the Secretary of State, as if to reassure him, "These are new soldiers since the coup."

HEADLINE: THE THOMAS HEARINGS;
Thomas to Win High Court Seat, Senators Predict

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 13

 BODY:
Judge Clarence Thomas ended a week of sometimes contentious questioning before the Senate Judiciary Committee today amid a growing sense among committee members that his confirmation to the Supreme Court seems inevitable.
The subtle but unmistakable movement in favor of his prospects was evident both in the tone of questions posed to him during the hearings and in comments by individual senators outside the Senate Caucus Room. 
 "If the Senate of the United States were to vote today, he would be confirmed," Senator Howell Heflin, Democrat of Alabama, said in an interview.
 
Sensing the Inevitable?
 The questioning of Judge Thomas by Democrats today was suddenly less spirited than it had been, as if committee members had come to realize that he was not going to provide any new or salient issues that could be used against him and that the contest was all but over. [Excerpts, page 6.]
Although his stolid performance confounded and exasperated many committee members, they seemed reluctant to go over the same ground again on abortion and other issues lest they seem to be badgering the nominee.
The behavior of Senator Heflin, whose vote would be crucial to confirmation, showed how momentum was gathering in Judge Thomas's favor.
Earlier in the week, Mr. Heflin suggested he was greatly troubled that Judge Thomas might be tailoring his responses and repudiating his extensive record of speeches and writings to win confirmation. Such a "confirmation conversion," he warned, could raise serious questions about Judge Thomas's integrity.
But in his questions today, Senator Heflin brought Judge Thomas back to comfortable territory, inviting him to talk about how he overcame a childhood of crushing poverty in coastal Georgia and left a Roman Catholic seminary after encountering virulent racial discrimination there. At one point, Mr. Heflin praised Judge Thomas for his sensitivity to the nation's racial problems and history and said, "I think that ought to be brought out in fairness to all parties concerned."
Senator Paul Simon, an Illinois Democrat who said he was still undecided on the nomination, seemed to address Judge Thomas today as if his joining the Supreme Court were a foregone conclusion and this was a last opportunity to offer some advice.
In an interview outside the hearing room, Mr. Simon said many panel members thought Judge Thomas's responses inconsistent and troubling. Nonetheless, he said, "the probability is that he will be approved."
 
Wide Margin Predicted
 Senate staff members said that a close vote was possible in the committee, 8 of whose 14 members are Democrats, but that he would be approved and probably be confirmed by a wide margin in the Senate itself.
Ralph Neas, executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, a coalition of advocacy groups that has opposed the nomination, insisted this evening that "there is still a good chance this nominee can be defeated." He said in an interview that Judge Thomas's "repudiation of past statements and stonewalling on many issues has caused significant concern among members of the committee."
The committee did not complete its questioning of Judge Thomas today, and he will return Monday for what the chairman, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., a Delaware Democrat, promised would be his final day before the panel. Judge Thomas's supporters on the committee had hoped to have him finish today to heighten the appearance that he had satisfied all concerns.
Committee Republicans tried to limit their questions as part of a strategy to allow Judge Thomas to finish today.
But opponents were heartened that Judge Thomas would have to return. They said that would keep the process alive and give them a chance to persuade some senators to reject the nominee.
After Judge Thomas finishes Monday, the panel will hear from officials of the American Bar Association, which has given the nominee a mixed rating on his fitness to serve on the Supreme Court. The A.B.A.'s committee that evaluates judges split on the nomination, with 12 members saying he was "qualified" and two voting "not qualified." There were no votes for "highly qualified," the highest rating.
The panel will then hear from witnesses for and against the nominee.
In formulating a strategy for Judge Thomas, those in the Bush Administration overseeing the confirmation process said they believed the nominee could only harm his chances by engaging in open-ended debate or discussion with committee members over issues. He was strongly counseled to stay as close as possible to answers that would reveal little of his judicial or political philosophy while emphasizing his personal story of overcoming a childhood of poverty.
They reasoned that committee members could not hold Judge Thomas to a higher standard of disclosure than they did Judge David H. Souter last year. Judge Souter refused to even hint how he felt about Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that first found a constitutional right to abortion. Judge Thomas, a 43-year-old member of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, was as resolute as Judge Souter in resisting pleas to divulge his views on abortion.
Senator Biden complained today that Judge Thomas was setting a standard for resisting the committee's questions that was worse than what he called "the Souter standard."
After Democrats persisted in trying to learn Judge Thomas's views on abortion, committee Republicans counterattacked, charging that Democrats were badgering him. Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, even suggested to reporters that Judge Thomas might be facing stiffer questioning because he was black and Judge Souter was white.
Senator Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat who seemed visibly displeased with Judge Thomas's refusal to respond to many of his questions, said he had not yet decided how to vote.
Senator Dennis DeConcini, Democrat of Arizona, said in a C-SPAN television interview that he thought Judge Thomas's performance before the panel was "very positive for me and very positive for the confirmation."
Focusing on how Judge Thomas was admitted to Yale Law School in 1971, Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, engaged Judge Thomas in a sharp colloquy today about his views on affirmative action.
Judge Thomas, an outspoken opponent of most racial preference programs and quotas during his career, was admitted to Yale under a program that considered minority applicants in a pool separate from white applicants, with the goal of having minority members make up 10 percent of the class.
His opponents say he opposes for others the very kinds of preference schemes that have benefited him.
In earlier responses this week, Judge Thomas suggested that the Yale program was merely what conservatives like to call "outreach" efforts, that is, making a special effort to find minority candidates but not giving them any preferential treatment in applying admissions standards. Yet Yale officials have explicitly said that theirs was a preference program.
Senator Specter compared Judge Thomas's admission to Yale to efforts to give black youths a preference, thus creating role models to act as a remedy against future discrimination. Judge Thomas has criticized such an approach.
Judge Thomas replied that he favored affirmative action plans that took into account how an individual might have overcome economic disadvantages. Beneficiaries of such programs, he said, could be white.

HEADLINE: Passenger Safety and Power Featured in 1992 Vehicles

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 13

 BODY:
The 1992 model cars and trucks, which officially go on sale Sept. 26, are more powerful and offer more consumer conveniences than ever before; they are also more technically advanced, particularly in passenger safety.
As usual, the new vehicles are also more expensive than the 1991 models, but rebates are being offered on most of them to help them sell, and many dealers are willing to discount the retail price. 
 The choice of makes and models available has been quite broad for several years. But the number of vehicle types, body styles and models still continues to expand. The new small station wagons offered by the Mitsubishi and Chrysler Corporations are examples; they seem to be hybrids of stations wagons and mini-vans.
Nevertheless, the softer economy is claiming some victims. For the first time in many years the number of vehicle nameplates will drop in 1992 because of the exit of the slow-selling Peugeot and Sterling brands from the United States market. Sales of Porsche, Alfa Romeo and Yugo cars have dropped precipitously.
The American automotive industry, which opposed air-bag regulations for years before surrendering in the late 1980's, is now engaged in a bragging contest among auto makers about which company has produced the greatest number of air-bag-equipped vehicles.
The Ford Motor Company says it has about 1.7 million air-bag-equipped cars on the road; Chrysler claims about 1.8 million. A few car models, the Ford Taurus for example, offer passenger-side air bags as an option; the Acura Legend LS is among the models that include them as standard equipment.
 
More Cars Have Anti-Lock Brakes
 Brian O'Neill, president of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, an insurance industry trade group in Arlington, Va., said he foresees "virtually all passenger vehicles and light trucks with air bags for passengers as well as drivers by the 1996 model year."
Anti-lock brakes, which prevent wheels from locking and vehicles from skidding during hard braking on slippery roads, are standard on nearly all luxury models and many more modest cars. They will be standard equipment for 1992 on two-thirds of all brands made by the General Motors Corporation and on all but two of its Chevrolet models.
G.M., the nation's No. 1 auto maker, is introducing a batch of 1992 car and light-truck models either with restyled exteriors or completely redesigned mechanical specifications. In the opinion of many automobile experts, the most important of the lot are the new Cadillac Eldorado coupe and Seville sedan, to which G.M. hopes that even its non-Cadillac customers will aspire. G.M.'s Oldsmobile Achieva, formerly called Calais, Buick Skylark and Pontiac Grand Am compact cars now have more aerodynamic styling. Anti-lock brakes will be standard on all three cars.
The Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable, aimed at the huge market for midsize family sedans and wagons, probably are Ford's most important new offerings. Little has changed mechanically in these cars, and the exterior styling has been altered only slightly in order to retain their look, which so many customers have said they like. The vehicles' interior, however, has been restyled with a new dashboard and different upholstery. Earlier in the year the No. 2 auto maker introduced the aerodynamically restyled Ford Crown Victoria and Mercury Marquis, full-size sedans meant for older customers who prefer more room. Chrysler, which brought out its restyled mini-van earlier this year, has little new for the fall except higher prices. Exceptions are the Eagle Summit and Plymouth Colt Vista small station wagons, which are renamed versions of the Mitsubishi LRV sport wagons.
Chrysler's redesigned four-door utility vehicle, the Jeep Grand Cherokee, will appear in early 1993 and three redesigned midsize models will make their debuts by the following summer.
 
Toyota to Challenge Honda's Accord
 Mitsubishi's new, smaller multipurpose sport wagons are the five-passenger LRV and the seven-passenger Expo. The LRV and Expo are taller than vehicles of comparable length and can be arranged in various seating and cargo configurations.
With the introduction of the redesigned Camry, the Toyota Motor Corporation of Japan has adopted the ambitious goal of displacing the Honda Motor Company's Accord as the No. 1 selling car in the United States. The Camry, now built in Georgetown, Ky., has been enlarged to midsize from compact, placing it in direct competition with Ford Taurus, Chevy Lumina and other midsize cars; the new Camry will feature a more powerful four-cylinder engine; a six-cylinder engine is optional.
The new Honda Civic subcompact and new Honda Prelude sports coupe, both of which are redesigned mechanically and stylistically, have been shown in Frankfurt and Tokyo, but will not be shown in the United States until early October. They are said to be larger and more powerful than their predecessors, but the new Honda Civic also has been made significantly more fuel efficient as a result of Honda's sophisticated engine technology.
Several expensive new luxury car models, among them the S Class by Mercedes-Benz and the Audi 100, are arriving. The price of the new Audi has not been announced, but it is believed it will sell for about $30,000. The most expensive Mercedes, which has not been officially priced, may top $100,000. In the never-ending quest to find unusual features to pamper owners, Audi, a division of Volkswagen A.G. of Germany, is introducing a switch on its 100 sedan that tilts the right rearview mirror downward slightly when the transmission is in reverse so the driver can better see the curb during parallel parking.
 
 
 
CHRYSLER OFFERS CUSTOM CHILD SEAT
 The Chrysler Corporation is trying to lure customers to its mini-vans with newly designed child seats that are integrated into the middle passenger bench and sell as a $200 option for a set of two.
Appropriate for children who weigh 20 to 40 pounds and far less trouble to adjust than the portable variety, Chrysler's child seats will also be offered in its new midsize models next year and the price of the option will be $100 a seat.
Chrysler said about 25 percent of its mini-van customers are ordering the child-seat option; the child seat is also proving popular with rental-car companies that buy the vehicle.

HEADLINE: ON HORSE RACING;
The Woodward's Added Race: Win, Place and a Two-Horse Sideshow

BYLINE: By Joseph Durso

 BODY:
Take a star 3-year-old race horse like Strike the Gold, four months after he won the Kentucky Derby, and run him against the best older horses in the land, and see if he can cut it. Whatever happens, said his trainer, Nick Zito, "You can't duck the big boys."
But Strike the Gold will run only one race tomorrow at Belmont Park when he challenges six older handicap horses in the Woodward Stakes. At least two of the other horses on the track, two of the big boys, will be running two races at the same time, the Woodward and one other. 
 D. Wayne Lukas calls it "the race within the race." It is primarily a private race between two of the seven horses in the Woodward. And it illustrates the crazy economics of sports: Both horses could lose the $500,000 Woodward and its first prize of $300,000, and still win $750,000 as the winner of "the race within the race."
Or, if one of them should win the Woodward, he would collect two prizes, bring home a $1 million paycheck and also take some long strides toward the Eclipse Award for Horse of the Year. Not a bad day at the races.
All this is possible because "the race within the race" is the race for bonus points in the American Championship Racing Series. It is a kind of tournament of 10 races from February through September, each with a purse of $500,000 to $1 million, with points awarded on the basis of the finish. Then, after the 10th and last race in the series, the Woodward, the horse with the most points gets the $750,000 bonus.
As luck would have it, two horses are tied with 40 points apiece. They are Farma Way, trained by Lukas, and Festin, trained by Ron McAnally. They are a pair of senior stars from the West Coast, and they have been the most persistent starters in the series and the most consistent winners. Farma Way, a 4-year-old colt who has already earned more than $2 million, will be starting for the eighth time in the 10 races. He has won twice and run second twice. Festin, 5 years old and starting for the seventh time, also has a pair of firsts and seconds.
So, their race within the race in the Woodward is the tie breaker in the series.
Now, that's what you'd call a subplot. But the question is: How much of a subplot did the series supply in its inaugural season? Does the public know or care who's got the most points? Does any trainer enter his horse in too many of the 10 races, trying for the $8.25 million in purses and bonuses?
After all, Jolie's Halo, another of the regulars, hasn't won a race since March and even suffered from pulmonary bleeding after a suicidal speed duel with Farma Way in the Nassau Handicap in June. Farma Way hasn't won a race since May, and Festin hasn't won one since June.
In fact, tomorrow's favorite at 8 to 5 is In Excess, an Irish-bred 4-year-old colt who has skipped the series since running fourth in the Santa Anita Handicap in March. But he shrewdly took the high road to success by winning New York's handicap triple, the Metropolitan, the Suburban and the Whitney. Now, he is three for three, rested and a prime candidate for Horse of the Year.
"I planned on racing him sparingly," his trainer, Bruce Jackson, said yesterday in the Belmont trustees' room during the draw for post position. "I wanted to be running a fresh horse late in the season."
To which Lukas replied by telephone from his barn at Del Mar in California: "In Excess has avoided the championship series."
To which Happy Alter, the trainer of Jolie's Halo, replied: "You can't dance every dance."
"There are three key elements you need for a horse to dominate this series," Lukas said. "First, he must be an excellent shipper to travel around the country to different tracks every month. Next, he must be very sound to handle a grueling schedule. Third, he must be a horse that holds his weight and takes the punishment."
Did the series work, as conceived by Barry Weisbord, the horse owner and breeder?
It groped for effect. But it did focus attention within the horse world. It created a story line for senior horses, and did it on national TV. It helped fill the dramatic lull between the Triple Crown races in the spring and the Breeders' Cup championships in the fall. It provided a revolving stage for stars like Unbridled, Summer Squall, Marquetry and Best Pal. It brought marquee horses to Arkansas in April and to New Hampshire in July, and it brought Farma Way and Festin to New York in September for their "race within the race."
"But even with two horses head to head," Wayne Lukas said, getting back to basics, "there will be no special strategy in trying to race just against Festin. You still have to try to beat them all."

HEADLINE: Plane Workers Did Not Attach Portion of Tail

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EAGLE LAKE, Tex., Sept. 13

 BODY:
The night before a Continental Express Commuter plane crashed here on Wednesday, killing all 14 people aboard, workers at the airline's Houston hangar failed to screw on a part of the tail that is now missing from the wreckage, Federal investigators said today.
The investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board said they confirmed their finding by examining the wreckage and by looking at maintenance records that showed mechanics unscrewed part of the plane's tail wing, replaced some of the wing, but failed to refit 43 screws that hold the part in place. 
 The part in question is a flexible section of the tail wing that prevents ice from building up. It forms the leading edge of the tail wing.
 
Torn Free in Flight
 Investigators said it appeared that the piece might have torn free in flight, which would have caused the plane to pitch down, possibly stressing other parts of the aircraft beyond the limits at which the plane could fly safely.
James Kolstad, the chairman of the safety board, said that as part of a routine maintenance operation the screws were removed from the top of the wing's left side and the top and bottom of the right side. The right side of the assembly was replaced, but the left side was not changed.
"The plane went back into service without the screws on top of the left-hand side," he said.
Mr. Kolstad also said today that information from the plane's recording devices suggested that the plane had come apart piece by piece in just a few seconds, while its engines operated normally. The pilots apparently had no indication of trouble until that moment, he said.
This afternoon, the safety board's investigators boarded a chartered helicopter and searched from the air without success for the crucial missing part of the plane.
The bulk of the tail wing was found about 200 yards from where the fuselage and main wings landed in a charred heap. By examining this part of the tail wing, investigators concluded that the missing piece had not been properly screwed on.
A separate team of investigators examined the plane's maintenance records at Continental's hangar in Houston. This team will also interview people who worked on the plane, a Brazilian-made Embraer 120 Brasilia, an official said.
 
No Firm Conclusions
 No firm conclusions have been reached at this stage, the investigators emphasized. But the fact that they are looking into maintenance problems poses troubling prospects for Continental Airlines, the bankrupt parent company of Continental Express.
Art Kent, a Continental spokesman, said tonight that further investigation is needed to determine the cause of the crash. "We want to find out what happened more than anyone," he said. "We want to stress that safety is our No. 1 priority."
Mr. Kolstad said a tape recording of noises from the cockpit showed no conversation by the pilots about the accident. But other noises were recorded, he said.
"All of a sudden there was a loud noise, followed a few seconds later by an even louder noise. That was followed by a series of warning horns and messages," he said, referring to the alarms in the plane's cockpit. "Then there was a loud whooshing noise, followed by the end of the tape."
 
Sharp Downward Pitch
 A separate device that tracks the airplane's motions showed that the nose suddenly pitched sharply downward as the plane dropped suddenly. During this time the plane's engines were operating normally, he said.
Mr. Kolstad refused to speculate about what had happened in these crucial seconds.
It seems possible that the plane's rear tail wing, the horizontal stabilizer, was the first part to break, perhaps when its leading edge tore away.
That rupture, making the first noise heard on the tapes, could have caused the plane to drop suddenly, putting immense stress on the forward wings.
The left wing appears to have folded completely under the plane, which might have been the second loud noise heard on the tape.
That damage, in turn, could have broken fuel lines and started the fire aboard the plane before it crashed.
So far, investigators have devoted most of their attention to the tail. But they have not yet been able to fully examine the left wing, because it is still lying on the ground underneath the right wing. It appears that the plane belly-flopped in a cornfield with the left wing tucked underneath the right one.
David Messing, a spokesman for Continental, said the company's EMB-120's are maintained at several locations, with the main work done at the Houston Intercontinental Airport, where Continental Express has a separate hangar for maintaining its fleet of 101 planes, including 34 Brasilias.
There are 85 employees, including mechanics, inspectors and supervisors, at the hangar, which can accommodate two Brasilias at a time and can handle all routine and nonroutine work on the planes, he said.
Employment at the hangar has been stable, with no recent layoffs during the economic downturn, he said.

HEADLINE: Natural Gas As Auto Fuel Gets a Push In New York

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Everyone has agreed for years that it would be good for New York City's air if cars and trucks were converted to run on natural gas, and cheaper for drivers. But who wants a car that uses a fuel that's hard to get? And who wants to sell fuel for cars hardly anybody drives?
Now there are signs that this self-reinforcing obstacle is ending. 
 On Wednesday, an Ohio company, Metropane Inc., opened a garage in Staten Island that can convert hundreds of vehicles a month from gasoline to natural gas. Gas industry executives say it is the first substantial bet by a private company that a market will develop.
"We just created the chicken," B. Vincent Rodriguez, the chief executive of Metropane, said after cutting the ribbon on a converted warehouse. "Or maybe it's the egg."
The other side of the equation is coming, too. In the next few months, nearly 20 filling stations offering natural gas will open in New York City.
All over the country, people who are striving to create a natural-gas vehicle industry face the same roadblocks, but some think that they will be cleared first in places like New York, which have persistent air pollution problems.
The conversion effort is focusing on fleets of trucks and buses or city-owned cars. But the Staten Island shop will handle just plain anybody's car, taking a day or so to switch them over. Mr. Rodriguez's shop, overlooking the oil storage tanks of Bayonne, N.J., will begin with three employees and about $150,000 in equipment and tools. He is focusing on fleet business, too; so far there are prospects but no contracts, he said.
The new fueling stations are also aimed at fleets, but some of them will be open to the public. The Brooklyn Union Gas Company, which already has fueling stations in Greenpoint and Canarsie in Brooklyn and Flushing, Queens, will announce soon that it will open six more stations this year, and seven more within 18 months, in Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island. And the Consolidated Edison Company, which sells gas in Manhattan, the Bronx and Westchester, will open a fueling station at a company-owned site in midtown Manhattan by December, said a spokesman.
Utility Oficials see the stations and the shop going hand in hand. Robert B. Catell, president of Brooklyn Union Gas, called Metropane's opening "extremely encouraging."
"This is the first commercial establishment on the East Coast to be completely dedicated to the conversion and maintenance of natural gas vehicles," he said.
Daniel Walden, a spokesman for Con Ed, said "the availability of a fueling facility is really a critical turning point in this whole movement."
"We're not going to have a market," he said, "until there are facilities where people can get fuel conveniently and economically."
Making the stations and the shop economical depends on high volume, which is one reason for the emphasis on fleet conversion. The compressors, pumps that squeeze the fuel into vehicle tanks at pressures up to 3,000 pounds per square inch, cost service stations up to $250,000 apiece.
Brooklyn Union Gas has helped New York City convert almost 150 vehicles. It has also converted two private buses and tried to win over fleet owners.
The utility plans to ask the Public Service Commission, which regulates it, for permission to charge its existing residential, commercial and industrial customers for the cost of building stations for vehicle use, on the theory that the clean air benefits everyone.
Con Edison is also encouraging natural gas, if somewhat less aggressively. Mr. Walden said that the Manhattan station would be used by United Parcel Service trucks, city-owned vehicles, and by Con Ed's own fleet, which includes everything from meter-readers' cars to a truck-mounted crane.
 
Clean Air Act Is Incentive
 Another incentive for conversion is the new, more stringent standards in the Clean Air Act passed last year, which makes the use of some other fuel by many cars seem inevitable.
Brooklyn Union's stations are open to corporate and municipal customers. For now, all the customers are likely to be fleet vehicles, but William V. Federici, a spokesman for Brooklyn Union Gas, said that if a private car owner showed up at a station, "I don't think we could turn you away."
Converting a vehicle at Metropane would cost between $2,500 and $3,500, a sum Mr. Rodriguez said would be recovered through lower operating costs within two years.
While natural gas prices fluctuate, Brooklyn Union's stations now charge about 93 cents for enough gas to take a vehicle as far as a gallon of gasoline would -- a savings of about 30 percent.
Natural gas pumps are turning up in other cities, notably Los Angeles, which has the nation's worst air, and Denver, where carbon monoxide from gasoline and diesel engines is a major problem.
Progress in New York has been slow but measurable. Brooklyn Union Gas, by helping to pay to convert 50 Parks Department vehicles, mostly Bronco jeeps, has turned that agency into an enthusiastic supporter. The utility is negotiating with the Fire Department on conversion of passenger and communications vehicles.
 
United Parcel Tests Vans
 United Parcel Service reports good results from a test with 10 delivery vans based in Canarsie, which were converted in September 1989. The trucks travel an average of 28 to 32 miles a day and are fitted with tanks that will fuel them for 90 miles, said a U.P.S. spokesman, Harry M. Winters. In Manhattan, range will be even less of a problem; many trucks there are driven fewer than 10 miles a day.
U.P.S. will convert more when Con Ed opens for business in Manhattan, but may eventually use an engine designed for natural gas, rather than converted from gasoline use, Mr. Winters said.
All three major domestic car manufacturers have announced plans to build "dedicated" natural gas light utility vehicles, meaning that they will run on natural gas alone. But Metropane believes that the market will still be in conversions, because the variety of cars and trucks built for natural gas will always be limited.
And if the auto makers get serious, said Mr. Rodriguez, they may simply build standard gasoline vehicles minus the fuel tank and fuel injector, and send them to a subcontractor like Metropane for finishing.
Metropane has grand plans. The company has drafted a proposal to convert 4,000 of New York City's 24,000 municipal vehicles to natural gas. Metropane would pay for the conversions, in exchange for the right to sell the city the natural gas to run the vehicles at a price equivalent to what the city would have paid for gasoline. Since natural gas is nearly 50 percent cheaper than gasoline, Metropane would earn back its investment and make a profit, said Gene Rodriguez, who is Vincent's brother and also a Metropane executive. Metropane would also build 50 more refueling stations in New York City, at a total cost of about $30 million. The city would own the refueling stations, and after 4 years, could buy the natural gas at market cost, he said.
In the meantime, Vincent Rodriguez said, he is confident of attracting his first customer soon.

HEADLINE: After the Voting;
The Votes Are In, but There's Still Room for Doubt in a Quarter of the Races

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

 BODY:
The results of 9 of the 38 City Council primaries held on Thursday were so close that their final outcomes probably will remain in doubt until Sept. 25, after absentee ballots are tabulated and votes are meticulously recounted.
Even then, several elections may be challenged in court, raising the possibility that judges may order new races in districts where there is evidence of impropriety or fraud. 
 That would provide a fittingly chaotic conclusion to the decade-long process of restructuring the city's government, which began with a legal challenge to the constitutionality of the Board of Estimate.
Some candidates in close races wasted little time making claims about voting irregularities perpetrated by their opponents. Several said they were certain to challenge the results in court.
 
Acting as if They Won
 "There are many irregularities that took place," said Adam Clayton Powell 4th, who trailed William Del Toro by 27 votes in the Eighth District in Upper Manhattan. "We have plenty of witnesses, plenty of evidence. It's a fight, but we're confident we're going to win."
Like many of the second-place finishers in tight races, Mr. Powell waged psychological warfare by assuming the stance of the victor. He spent yesterday afternoon traveling East Harlem in his campaign car, thanking voters through a rooftop loudspeaker.
While recounts and court challenges are unlikely to drastically alter the ethnic or ideological composition of the Council, they could determine which newcomers become power brokers at City Hall and whether two longtime incumbents survive.
In the Second District on Manhattan's Lower East Side, Miriam Friedlander, an 18-year veteran of the Council, was trailing Antonio Pagan by 121 votes. In the 44th District in Brooklyn, Noach Dear, a nine-year veteran, was losing to Robert J. Miller by 16 votes.
 
Splitting Small Baskets of Votes
 The combination of an unusual Thursday election, the absence of a top-of-the-ticket race, a confusing array of newly drawn districts and a recession-driven malaise contributed to extremely low turnout. None of the races generated a turnout of more than 26 percent and nine districts had turnouts of 15 percent or less.
Large fields of opportunistic candidates found themselves splitting small baskets of votes. As a result, nine races were decided by a total of 669 votes. The closest race was in the 31st District in Queens, where unofficial results showed Juanita E. Watkins defeating Malcolm A. Smith by 15 votes.
Naomi R. Bernstein, a spokeswoman for the Board of Elections, said that the nine races with margins of fewer than 170 votes were too close to call.
"I don't ever remember an election that had this many close races," said the Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone.
 
9-Tenths of 1 Percent
 Although the expansion of the Council to 51 seats from 35 was intended to make city politics more democratic, some of the results suggest that the city's brand of democracy was hardly participatory.
Five Democratic candidates won primaries with fewer than 2,000 votes. One of them, Howard Weiss, won the 10-candidate race in the 19th District in Queens with 1,346 votes, or 17 percent of the ballots cast.
Of the 143,943 people who live in the 19th District, according to the 1990 census, 81 percent are of voting age. Of those, 68,965, or 59 percent of the voting age population, are registered voters. Of those, 37,151, or 54 percent of the registered voters, are enrolled Democrats. Of those, 8,100, or 22 percent of the enrolled Democrats, went to the polls. And of those, 1,346, or 17 percent of the voters, cast ballots for Mr. Weiss.
Thus, Mr. Weiss won the Democratic primary, which is tantamount to election in his Democratic district, by capturing the votes of nine-tenths of 1 percent of his district's residents.
 
Leveling the Playing Field
 "It's certainly something that can remind us that every vote counts," said Representative Thomas J. Manton, who also serves as the Queens County Democratic leader. "It's the one who gets out the votes who wins, and in our plurality system you don't always need a lot of votes to win."
At first glance, the elections seem a successful proving ground for the city's new system of public campaign financing, which was first used in 1989.
Of the 38 leaders, according to the unofficial results, 27 chose to participate in the program. In the 19 races without incumbents, 16 were won by publicly financed candidates.
"There were a couple of races where it really leveled the playing field," Mr. Vallone said.
 
Other Contests in Question
 Under the program, candidates receive public money in proportion to the money they raise privately if they agree to restrictions on their campaign fund raising and spending. Fifteen of the 18 candidates in the hotly contested races, including all of the current leaders, participated in the program.
In addition to the races in the Second District, the Eighth District and the 44th District, the contests that remained in question yesterday included the 14th District in the Bronx, in which former State Senator Israel Ruiz Jr. was leading Sandra Ramos-Alamo by 78 votes, and the 25th District in Queens, where John D. Sabini outpolled Helen Sears by 166 votes.
Also undecided were the 30th District in Queens, in which Pamela L. Fisher led Frank Sansiveri Jr. by 72 votes; the 40th District in Brooklyn, where Carl Andrews was ahead of Una Clarke by 49 votes, and the 48th District in Brooklyn, where Anthony David Weiner was leading Michael J. Garson by 125 votes.
 
Gathering Affidavits
 Based on the observations of their campaign aides, who watched election inspectors record vote totals, many candidates disagreed with the Board of Elections tallies. Several, including Mr. Dear and Mr. Sansiveri, expressed confidence that the Board's recounts would show them ahead.
Other candidates rested their hopes on absentee ballots and the courts. Mr. Smith, who was trailing in the 31st District by 15 votes, said he had already gathered 20 affidavits from voters alleging problems with missing voter-identification cards, early poll closings and broken voting machines.
"We're going to push for another election," he said. "Fifteen is just too close."
Ms. Bernstein, the Board of Elections spokeswoman, did not discount the possibility of tabulation errors. But she said there had been "nothing untoward" about the way the polls were operated. "We feel it's one of the best elections we've had," she said.
Assemblyman Sheldon Silver, who waged an unsuccessful court battle after losing a Council race to Ms. Friedlander almost 20 years ago, warned that the legal test is difficult to pass.
Under precedents now widely accepted by the courts, Mr. Silver said, elections are invalidated only when candidates demonstrate that there are three voting irregularities for every vote that separates the top two contenders. "It's very difficult in a multicandidate race," he said.

HEADLINE: WILDER ANNOUNCES BID FOR PRESIDENT

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RICHMOND, Sept. 13

 BODY:
Saying he could no longer "stand on the sidelines while the country I love stumbles further backwards," Gov. L. Douglas Wilder entered the 1992 Presidential race today.
Mr. Wilder, who less than two years ago became the nation's first black elected governor, declared that President Bush should be defeated because he was leading the country into retreat through divisive racial and economic policies. 
 The 60-year-old Virginia Governor, the grandson of slaves, promised to spend less and to concentrate much of what he does spend on the needy. That centrist stand sets him apart from many leading Democrats, notably the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
 
A Political Vision
 In distancing himself from the liberal policies offered by Mr. Jackson, Governor Wilder painted a political vision that seemed aimed not only at black voters but also moderate whites, a coalition that some Democrats have said could be a winner for the party if only a candidate would come along who could forge it.
Mr. Jackson has made two bids for the Democratic nomination, falling short both times. In both instances he showed great strength among black voters, who make up about a fifth of the party's active membership, and attracted considerable support from white liberals within the party. But he was spurned by many of the party's moderates, leaving the party with a significant split.
Some leading Democrats think Mr. Jackson will not run again. Others hope he will not, fearing his unabashed liberalism is an ideological drag on the party in an era when conservatism is ascendant.
Besides Mr. Wilder, former Senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts has also formally declared an intention to seek the Democratic Party's Presidential nomination. Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa is expected to declare on Sunday, and Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, Representative Dave McCurdy of Oklahoma and former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California have said they are giving serious consideration to entering the race.
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, considered by many to be a potential candidate, has repeatedly denied he plans to run.
 
The Jackson Factor
 Whether Mr. Wilder's entrance into the race today will impel Mr. Jackson to try a third run himself is not clear. Mr. Jackson, who lives in Washington, has been notably reticent on the issue in recent months, amid some speculation that he might be reassessing his position in and approach to American politics.
Should Mr. Jackson stay out of the 1992 race, Mr. Wilder would be in an excellent position to win the black support he will need if he is to have any realistic chance of making a good run for the nomination.
Some political experts have suggested that Mr. Wilder's best hope in 1992, and indeed his real intention, is to win the Vice-Presidential spot on the Democratic ticket.
In announcing his candidacy today, Mr. Wilder cast himself not only as a centrist, the key to his winning the Virginia governorship, but also as an "outsider" and "the longest of long shots." He vowed to fight the current Washington establishment and put the nation's economic books in order. But he also promised to find the money and the will to help the poor and the downtrodden, especially those who are black.
"We must cut tens of billions in Federal spending that we cannot afford if we are to ever begin spending the money in those areas which we can no longer continue to neglect," Mr. Wilder said.
Many political experts, and not a few Democrats, have said the kind of voter coalition sought by Mr. Wilder, especially if led by someone perceived as an outsider, could be a winner for the party. But in recent years every candidate who has tried to forge that combination has been frustrated by the party's basic liberal bent, and there is no good evidence that Mr. Wilder will not be frustrated, too.
In winning the governor's race in 1989, Mr. Wilder also ran as a centrist seeking the votes of blacks and moderate whites in a state that is heavily conservative. In good part, he was successful because he presented to the voters a record of a legislator who was a fiscal conservative and also in touch with the needs of the poor.
 
Tempered Views
 During his early years as a state legislator, Mr. Wilder was considerably more liberal than he is today. Had he not tempered that liberalism, it is doubtful he ever would have been elected Governor of the state that was once the centerpiece of the Confederacy.
Mr. Wilder said he not only wanted to be the next Democrat to attempt to forge a winning coalition, but in fact saw it as his duty to make the try, following in the footsteps of eight other Virginians who have occupied the White House.
"As someone who has fought for positive change and the American dream for all these years, I cannot stand on the sidelines while the country I love stumbles further backwards," the Governor declared in announcing his candidacy at 12:30 P.M. from the front of the State Capitol, a building that once served as the Capitol of the Confederacy.
 
'Serve the Country'
 "This is the moment to rise with the courage of conviction and serve the country, the citizens of these United States, with the honor and the fortitude our forefathers granted us," Mr. Wilder continued. "I have decided to run for President of the United States in 1992."
Mr. Wilder's aides and supporters contend he can bridge the ideological split that has helped deny Democrats the Presidency in recent elections.
"He's the one who can do this, the man with the right plan," said Paul Goldman, chairman of the Virginia Democratic Party and one of Mr. Wilder's closest political advisers.
A former New York lawyer and investment banker, Mr. Goldman, despite his sharp accent and equally sharp tongue, has acquired a deep understanding and feel for Virginia and its politics since he moved to the state 15 years ago. He ran Mr. Wilder's successful gubernatorial campaign, and he is expected to help oversee the Governor's bid for national office.
Asked today what political moves the Governor would make next and what states he would concentrate on, Mr. Goldman replied, "In time, in time, all things in good time."
Some political experts suggested that Mr. Wilder's best tactical campaign strategy would be to concentrate on making a good showing in the New Hampshire primary, the first in the nation, and then shift emphasis to the South, pointing to big votes in primaries where black voters will have the most impact.
"He's got to stay alive in New Hampshire, do well in Dixie, and then pray," said Larry Sabato, a political science professor at the University of Virginia who has written several books about state and national politics.
 
Recognition Problem
 Most polls show Mr. Wilder is little known among voters outside Virginia and has been hurt somewhat by several verbal gaffes and an acrimonious feud with his biggest rival in Virginia politics, Senator Charles S. Robb. In Virginia itself, polls indicate many state residents feel he should not seek the Presidency, having served less than two years of his four-year term as Governor.
In fact, one of the Governor's strongest critics on the latter point has been his former press secretary, Laura Dillard. She left his staff a few week ago -- it is not clear whether she resigned or was fired -- charging that Mr. Wilder was spending too much time on the national scene and neglecting Virginia and its many problems, especially the heavy impact of the recession.
In his announcement speech today, given under a hot September sun before a crowd of a thousand or so supporters and curious office workers on luncheon break, Mr. Wilder expanded on themes that are expected to be the backbone of his campaign for the nomination:
"Until we succeed in getting our fiscal house in order, the standard of living for the American people cannot, and will not, grow as fast as it should, and, in some instances, will both stagnate and even fall backwards. And, as our leaders in Washington continue to let this happen, the ugly residue of man's inhumanity to man starts to creep to the surface, as one group is pitted against another for their share of a pie."

HEADLINE: When an Author's Words Are Sold by the Pound

BYLINE: By Michael Norman; Michael Norman, a former reporter for The New York Times, is an associate professor of journalism at New York University.

 BODY:
Like most writers, I have always championed thrift. Writers live by thrift, after all, cutting losses and conserving profits to survive the inevitable bouts of indigence and bankruptcy that mark a life of letters. And we practice thrift in our work, as well; good writing is always the product of language that has been pared down, sentences that are lean, taut, economical. Not long ago, however, I experienced an extraordinary tergiversation. Now I'm an ally of excess, a proponent of redundancy. It all began the day I received a short letter from my publisher.
"Dear Mr. Norman," the letter began. "Your book, 'These Good Men,' has been scheduled for remaindering." 
 After 20 months in print, there are, it seems, some 12,000 copies of the clothbound edition of my first work still sitting in a warehouse in Westminster, Md., and the time has come, as it does for far too many books these days, for "These Good Men" to surrender its place on the publisher's shelf and take a path that will, for some copies, likely lead to the steel jaws of a shredding machine.
The work, in another form, will probably stay in print for some time. A paperback edition of the book, which is about the surviving Marines I served with in the Vietnam War and what happened to them in the years since they returned home, was published in May. The publisher of that edition, Pocket Books, says it intends to keep the book on its back list for several years. But there is something sui generis about the first edition of one's first book, something that makes an author lose all sense of reason, perspective, economy.
I want those 12,000 cloth copies to stay right where they are: in a warm, dry warehouse waiting for readers to call for them, even if those calls never come. The thought of just one copy crunched to pulp makes me blister.
I remember the book when it was nothing more than a bright flicker on the psyche, pure ambition. I was a newspaperman chafing against deadlines and style sheets when an editor at Crown Publishers called me to lunch and said something over coffee that set me on a search for the old Marine Corps comrades I had not seen since 1968, our year at war.
That lunch took place on a cold, wet winter day in 1983. "These Good Men" was published on a cold, wet winter day in 1990. Seven years from provocation to print, almost nine years from a sweet dream to the pulp machine.
I set to work in 1984 under the musty eaves of my attic on an old metal Olympia portable with a threadbare ribbon. My desk was a hollow-core door that straddled two small blue filing cabinets. Eventually, I traveled halfway around the world, then back and forth across the country several times, doing research. It cost my advance -- and then some. I wrote at night and on my days off. By 1986, I had less than a hundred miserable and disjointed pages. Then came the next best thing to the muse -- a grant. The Florence and John Schumann Foundation awarded me enough money to quit the paper and write the book full time. I was sure I'd be done in a year. It took three.
One morning in March 1989, I typed the last page of endnotes and acknowledgments, tucked the manuscript neatly into a gray box and set the box on a coffee table by a couch. Then I sat down and wept.
My sorrow was atavistic, which is to say that something primitive and, at that moment, inexpressible had seized me and set me sobbing, something no doubt passed down from the first writer ever published and best expressed by the screenwriter Syd Field, quoting Jean Renoir: "True art is in the doing of it." The selling of it is something else and has nothing to do with language or literature.
The selling of it involves profit ratios and print runs and promotion and advertising budgets and cover designs and jacket copy and begging for blurbs. The selling of it begins the day the manuscript in the gray box is carried into New York and handed to a person called an editor, someone nowadays likely more conversant with Moody's and Standard & Poor's than with Strunk and White. The selling of it continues with 10-city tours -- or hollow promises of such -- and long telephone interviews at odd hours to catch air time in places such as Pierre, S.D. Along the way nothing goes as expected. Editors quit, agents are fired. Sales rise, then fall. Returns begin. At a marketing meeting at the end of spring the publisher's salesmen are more keen on a book about barbecues than memoirs about men and war. In time the selling of it ends, usually with a short letter: "Dear Mr. Norman: Your book, 'These Good Men,' has been scheduled for . . ."
Very soon now, a remainder company will buy my book from Crown, not by subject but by the pound. "These Good Men" will be sold anonymously, part of a huge lot of many titles bid on by weight. It may in turn end up in a bookstore, a supermarket or a garden shop. Perhaps a reader will find it on a street vendor's table in Manhattan or under a huge tent in Alabama, where Southern discounters sell books so inexpensively that, according to Elizabeth Bogner of the American Booksellers Association, "people buy them regardless of what the titles are and even when the books aren't in English; it's the white-elephant mentality."
I remember the moment I first held "These Good Men." It was the fall of 1989 and I was on assignment from The New York Times Magazine in Pasadena, Calif. The magazine had put me on a tight per diem and I was staying in a shabby motel. The desk clerk called my room to say an overnight package had arrived. I sat down in the main lobby next to a plate of stale doughnuts and a pot of viscous morning coffee and opened the envelope and . . . there . . . was one of the first copies off the press. Everything was wrong with that book -- the subtitle was incorrect, the running header was missing its ruler line, the opening page had a major typo -- but it was my first copy and I could not stop myself from stroking it.
Now, it is quite possible that some copies -- those that even the white elephants won't buy -- will be mangled to pulp.
Then again, fate can have a poetry all its own. Perhaps the pulp will go to make a piece of cheap furniture -- a desk, say, on which a talented hand might set a piece of paper, pick up a pencil and write the words, "Chapter One."

HEADLINE: Strangers at the Gate

BYLINE: By Judith Miller; Judith Miller is a staff writer for The New York Times Magazine.

 BODY:
JON MOISE, A ROMANIAN GYPSY, SAT ON A DARK AND deserted platform in the railway station at Gorlitz, a town on the German-Polish border, screaming at the German policemen in a language they could not understand, the wound from his suicide attempt still oozing.
He and 15 members of his extended family, including 3 children, had sneaked across the border earlier that day. They were demanding political asylum, the only words of German they knew. 
 Hans Ermlich, the policeman in charge, doubted they were true political refugees. Gypsies, he said, usually just wanted to roam, to beg in richer places and possibly to find work. But this family seemed determined to stay, as the slash marks across Moise's stomach suggested.
Ermlich and the other officers debated what to do with this bedraggled group, huddled in the dank, steamy night, refusing to budge.
"What can we do?" Ermlich asked. "We can't beat them up, or force them into vans and ship them across the border. Moving these people is no job for a German policeman."
Scenes like this are being re-enacted at border stations and refugee camps throughout Western Europe, as thousands of political refugees and immigrants arrive each day from Eastern Europe, Africa and the Middle East trying to escape poverty, civil unrest and repression to find work or safe haven in Europe.
Europeans increasingly feel they are under cultural and economic siege, unnerved by the estimated ten to twelve million immigrants already living among them and the prospective onslaught of millions more. And that doesn't even include the millions of illegal immigrants.
The hysteria reached a peak after the abortive Soviet coup and, subsequently, the threatened collapse of the Soviet empire. That raised the specter of thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of terrified Soviet citizens fleeing their country. But however fearsome that prospect, Africa and the Middle East are the more likely source of immigrants, and by far the more politically wrenching.
Migrant Muslims now constitute about two-thirds of Europe's immigrants. And their presence, along with their different religious, political and cultural traditions, is raising issues of national identity that Europe had skirted in the cold-war era. Are European societies destined to follow the United States and become multiracial and multi-ethnic? Are Europeans willing to accept such a transformation? Do they have the means and power to prevent it, even if they want to? And lurking in every discussion of immigration -- particularly with the alarming recent success of reactionary politicians -- is the never-quite-banished ghost of Europe's fascist past.
Only a year ago, western Europe was basking in the collapse of Communism and the prospect of a united and prosperous era for a politically and economically united European Community. The future, Europeans boasted, lay not in deficit-plagued, drug-ridden, ethnically and racially divided America. It belonged to Europe, whose social cohesion, booming economies and strong governments and political institutions gave the "Old World" the competitive edge.
Today, however, the Europhoria has evaporated.
Europe's initial ambivalence about confronting Saddam Hussein in Kuwait and, more recently, its inability to head off civil strife in Yugoslavia have forced Europeans to acknowledge American military and diplomatic supremacy. Now, after years of disdaining American racism, Europeans are beginning to wonder whether the United States may also be better at integrating cultures and peoples. And in nations where equality of opportunity is not always a bedrock principle, they are beginning to wonder whether their social and political institutions can cope with the migration.
Europeans insist that their nations are not "immigration" countries, as is the United States, which by well-ingrained tradition views immigrants as a source of cultural richness and economic rejuvenation. Their countries are far more ethnically homogenous than the United States, far smaller, more crowded and easier targets of entry.
Europeans also note that the United States now accepts proportionally fewer legal immigrants than do many Western European states. "Despite our rhetoric, Europe has become the real immigration continent," says Francois Heisbourg, director of the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies. "Europe today employs more legally resident foreigners than the United States or even the Arab oil-producing states."
Yet European states are not "immigration" societies in at least one key sense: among Western Europeans, only the French believe in assimilation. In Germany, for example, few Turks -- even those who are third-generation German residents -- are citizens, even second-class ones. The communities coexist, but separately and profoundly unequally. In France and Italy, many Muslim immigrants do not even want to be assimilated, a fact that infuriates many.
Europeans also argue that, because of political asylum, they face a far more explosive form of immigration than does the United States. While the number of legal immigrants has fallen from 1.2 million in 1973 to an average of between 700,000 and 900,000 a year now, the number of economic migrants entering under the guise of political asylum has grown, from 14,000 a year in 1973 to 500,000 in 1990, and the number is still rising.
The problem for Europe is that international law, crafted to handle trickles of cold-war refugees from the Communist bloc, requires each case of political asylum to be reviewed individually -- a long and expensive procedure. While not wishing to violate international law, some states are moving unilaterally to handle political asylum seekers as economic migrants.
Europeans, however, only reluctantly acknowledge a discomforting paradox: immigrants may not be wanted, but they are needed. Many perform jobs Europeans no longer desire. And Western Europe's population is dwindling and rapidly aging. A new study concludes that France will need 315,000 new immigrants a year to maintain its current work force.
Thus, no matter what Europeans do, the immigration tide may roll on. "As long as there are such gross resource imbalances in the world, and so many incredibly poor people living near us in Europe's relative paradise, foreigners will keep coming," says Richard Hilmer, a German pollster in Berlin. "It's like gaps in air pressure."
Gianni de Michelis, the Socialist Foreign Minister of Italy and a supporter of Europe-wide immigration quotas, argues that the issue has placed Europe at a crossroads. "Either we can try to become 'fortress Europe,' turning in on ourselves" he says. "Or we can accept the fact that Europe will continue to have immigrants, that we need many of these immigrants, and that we are destined, like the United States, to become multicultural societies."
In fact, many Europeans have already passed the crossroads. They seem determined to resist change.
Switzerland and Austria, both neutral countries, have finally found a use for their armies, using soldiers to help seal their borders. In what used to be East Germany, gangs of neo-Nazi skinheads roam back streets and subway stations, terrorizing immigrants and, in at least two instances, killing those who fight back.
Last spring in Brussels, police battled gangs of young Moroccans who complained of police harassment, joblessness and hopeless lives in immigrant ghettos. In Italy this summer, thousands of desperate Albanian "boat people" were returned to their hapless, still repressive country.
In some of the richest European states, right-wing parties have expanded and prospered by exploiting the immigration issue. In France, riots by young North Africans have helped Jean-Marie Le Pen, the head of the xenophobic and anti-Semitic National Front, capture about 15 percent of the vote in recent opinion polls, and up to 30 percent in southern France, where immigrants are more numerous. In Austria, Jorg Haider, the charismatic leader of the extreme right Freedom Party, has scored approval ratings as high as 20 percent.
Few politicians and analysts fear a resurgence of fascism. But they do worry that immigration could push governments to adopt authoritarian measures. "Fascism as a political movement died with World War II," says Michel Winnock, a French political scientist. With its distinct program of military expansionism and corporate statism, he says, fascism is unlikely to re-emerge in Europe. "But in the long run, a powerful resurgence of national populism could produce widespread demands for authoritarian governments."
Immigration has already shifted political discourse sharply to the right. Quotas are defended by virtually all political parties, as they scramble for political cover and try to deny extreme rightist forces a potent issue. In the process, however, the talk is getting ugly.
In Austria, Haider labels the immigrants "social parasites." In Italy, newspaper headlines scream about the "vu compras," or "wanna buys," a reference to the African street vendors whose stalls line Roman bridges and squares. But nowhere is the talk as ugly as in France.
In the historic home of the doctrine of human rights, "parlez vrai" (speaking the truth) and "parlez cru" (crude talk) about "les immigres" is much in vogue. Socialist President Francois Mitterrand has spoken of what he called -- and lately tried to retract -- a "threshold of tolerance" in France, whose population is now 56 million. That includes nearly four million immigrants, 2.3 million of them Africans, of whom 800,000 are Algerians.
In June, Jacques Chirac, the Mayor of Paris and leader of the conservative Rally for the Republic, decried the "overdose" of immigrants. It was obvious, he said, why the poor French worker "goes crazy" with the "noise and smell" of his Arab and African neighbors.
Not to be outdone, the Socialist Prime Minister, Edith Cresson, advocated "special flights" to expel illegal immigrants. While she was being denounced by the left (and praised by Le Pen), a poll revealed that more than three-quarters of the country supported her plan to expel illegal immigrants.
Rather, the hostility is curiously selective. Few in France worry about an onslaught from the East -- Poles, after all, are European and Catholic. And for the most part, non-Arab African immigrants are neither feared nor despised.
The hostility is directed mostly at Muslims. The word "immigre" is virtually synonymous with Islam, now France's second largest religion, and reflects a cultural and ethnic racism deeply rooted in French history.
Parts of France were once conquered by Muslims, and in modern history the loss of Algeria after a bloody and debilitating war was a humiliation that has left deep scars. Many young Muslims in France, moreover, violate an article of faith by casting doubt on the superiority of French civilization.
Political differences abound. Many Muslims, for example, reject the traditional Western separation of church and state -- a particularly sensitive issue in secular but Catholic France. Thus, the insistence of a few Muslim girls on wearing head scarves to school triggered a bitter national debate over religious freedom.
"For far too long, France pretended there was no problem," says Pierre Lellouche, an adviser to Chirac and the author of a forthcoming book on immigration. "But now there are neighborhoods, entire suburbs, and even cities like Marseilles where you can't tell you're in France."
Paris, with a population of 2.1 million, has traditionally been anxious about its suburbs, now inhabited by 10.6 million people. Alarm has increased as the "red" suburbs, once seen as teeming with Communists and poorer French workers, have evolved into the "black" enclaves, a haven for recent immigrants and the breeding ground of an underclass that was once thought to be a uniquely American phenomenon. In one of these expanding ghettos recently, a telling slogan was splashed on the side of a tenement: "Long live the Intifada of the Suburbs."
Consider Francs-Moisins, a district of 8,000 people, the majority of them foreign, in the suburb of Saint-Denis, only 10 minutes from Paris. Among its monotonous blocks of low-income housing, police and young "beurs," as French-born Arabs are known, have clashed repeatedly.
"There isn't a single cafe in this complex," says Samir Sahraoui, a 25-year-old activist with France-Plus, a human rights group. "There is no youth club, no sports facility except a makeshift soccer field, absolutely nothing to do at night. Buses comes infrequently. So the guys just hang out. And the Government wonders why there is violence here."
Unemployment, which stands at 9.2 percent nationally, averages as much as 40 percent among beurs in places like Francs-Moisins, Sahraoui says. Rejected by society as "un-French," yet unwilling to leave the country they consider their own, many have turned to fundamentalist Islam, which, in turn, urges them to reject integration, thus completing a circle of alienation, despair and violence.
"We know we must end the isolation of the suburbs, not just for foreigners, but for all those who live there," says Jean-Louis Bianco, the Minister of Social Affairs and Integration in France. And in the long run, he says, he's optimistic: "French Islam can be a beacon, a progressive force for Muslims. We will integrate these young people, for they were born here and are, after all, very French."
There are grounds for optimism, he insists. The elite colleges and institutions have recently graduated their first beur students. French culture is replete with Arab and African stars.
While Bianco believes France will overcome the challenge of immigration, Lellouche and others are not so sure. "Those who say that France would have no immigration problem if we had fewer dogs and more children are simply ignoring what is happening here," he says. "Our former immigrants were Europeans; these are not. Arab girls who insist on wearing chuddars in our schools are not French and don't want to be.
"History, proximity and poverty insure that France and Europe are destined to be overwhelmed by people from the failed societies of the south," Lellouche says. "Europe's past was white and Judeo-Christian. The future is not. I doubt that our very old institutions and structures will be able to stand the pressure."
Austria's version of Le Pen is Jorg Haider, leader of the Freedom Party. Some Austrians argue that Haider's personal political fortunes may now be in decline. He was dismissed this summer as provincial governor in Carinthia, his home province, after he praised the labor policies of Nazi Germany -- a gaffe too glaring even for the country that elected Kurt Waldheim as president while knowing of his Nazi past.
There is little doubt, however, that fears of unchecked immigration have helped boost the Freedom Party's standing. In national elections last October, support leaped to 16 percent from 9.7 percent in 1986, and the party picked up 30 deputies in Parliament, almost double the seats it won four years earlier.
"Immigration is 0.5 percent of our program," protests Heide Schmidt, a Freedom Party parliamentarian. But Viennese still talk about the party's powerful campaign poster decrying the country's growing ethnic diversity and increasing crime rate. "Vienna must not become Chicago," the poster warned.
Karl Krammer, the spokesman for Chancellor Franz Vranitzky, admits that the Freedom Party's success has influenced the Government's immigration policy. "Our political system is under strain, especially among people at the margins," he says. "If we had not responded to public pressure, we would have given Haider a powerful tool. We did not give it to him."
Austria, a country of nearly 7.5 million people, faces immigration from both the south and the east. And despite the collapse of the Soviet bloc, growing numbers of these immigrants are applying for political asylum.
In response to these pressures, Vienna last year excluded Romanians from its special camps for asylum applicants. This summer, the Government extended the ban to Bulgarians. The loss of state support makes it difficult for asylum seekers to stay in Austria while their cases are reviewed. This, critics say, is the implicit goal, and a violation of international law.
The 1951 Geneva Convention defines a political refugee as a person with a "well-founded fear of being persecuted" in his country of origin. Under the convention, the refugee must be given shelter while his application is considered. The law forbids exclusion by nationality.
Manfred Matzka, the Austrian Interior Ministry's senior official for migration and asylum, defends the new policies as lawful and appropriate. "We changed our policy after seeing that following the collapse of Communism, almost no asylum applications from these nationalities were being approved," he said. "Most of those coming now are not political refugees, but economic migrants." Austria, he maintains, is still reviewing each application.
Austrians, Matzka says, are neither racist nor xenophobic. But they are "overwhelmed."
According to Government statistics, 308,000 of Austria's 482,000 aliens are legal "guest workers," invited into the country decades ago when jobs were plentiful. Another 100,000 joined families here; 80,000 are political-asylum seekers, the fastest growing category.
Matzka insists that Austria, one of Europe's wealthiest countries, can no longer afford to accept asylum seekers. Between 1987 and 1990, their numbers doubled, to 22,800, and reached 25,000 in the first six months of 1991. About 12,000 self-proclaimed refugees are staying in Government facilities.
Austria seems close to panic over the brutal civil strife in the Yugoslav republic of Croatia. It was the prospect of thousands of refugees spilling out of Yugoslavia, Matzka asserts, that spurred the Austrian Government to clear out the Government camps and refugee housing.
"I now have 10,000 beds in case of an emergency," Matzka says proudly. "If something happens, we're prepared." Indeed, as the fighting intensified in Croatia, there were reports of thousands fleeing the violence.
The Government has "kept order," Matzka says, echoing a self-congratulatory theme now common in Vienna. "There are no riots here as there are in France, no pogroms and murders of foreigners as there are in Italy, no skinhead or neo-Nazi attacks as there are in Germany. We've maintained law and stability, and that is very important to Austrians."
 Germany has no Jorg Haider, no charismatic right-wing rising star. In fact, the Republicans, the country's extreme right-wing party, lost heavily in the last federal elections despite trying to make an issue of immigration. But Germany does have Mike Schmidt, a 16-year-old who lives in Eisenhuttenstadt on the German-Polish border.
Mike says he has not always hated foreigners. He used to be politically neutral, but that was before the Berlin wall came down, the two Germanys became one, part of his steel factory closed and the asylum seekers arrived from Romania and points south and east. Mike is a slender young man with close-cropped hair, clad in blue jeans and T-shirt, with a tiny gold earring glistening in his left earlobe. "Now," he says, "most people here want the foreigners gone."
As he has watched foreigners living in the camp, buying food and amusing themselves in town -- all at taxpayer expense -- Mike's rage has grown. Only the day before, he says, gypsies from the camp attacked him and trashed the motorcycle of his friend Karsten. "After we've skinned alive the guys who did this, should we roll the skin up or down?" Karsten asks Mike.
Richard Hilmer, the pollster, says that violent youth subcultures have always emerged in Germany during times of social upheaval. "Their numbers are not large, but the level of their aggression is truly shocking."
While rightist violence has been confined largely to the east, immigration is a national problem for Germany.
"We're an ostensible nonimmigration country with proportionally the world's largest immigration," says Barbara John, a member of the Government's Special Commission on Integration. "We also have the world's most outdated definition of nationality."
Under German law, any person of German ancestry, including 2.3 million ethnic Germans in the Soviet Union, is considered German and has the right to come home. In 1990, nearly 400,000 did so. Although most do not speak German or know much about German culture, they are automatically entitled to citizenship.
But guest workers are not. "We have some five million foreigners here, more than three million of whom are Turkish guest workers and their descendants -- some of them third-generation German residents -- but still foreign," John says. "Each year, about 20,000 of them are nationalized, but 79,000 babies are born. So you have a permanent and growing group of excluded people."
Political-asylum seekers make up the fastest growing category of German immigrants, as they do throughout Europe. Almost 200,000 people applied for asylum last year, more than half the total of the rest of the European Community combined.
John argues that Germany needs to change its asylum practices, its immigration laws and its attitudes. She wants Germany to restrict the entry of ethnic Germans and to change its outmoded, some would argue racist, definition of nationality.
"Because of our past," says Roland Bachmeier, the Ministry of Interior's spokesman, "we have the world's most liberal definition of asylum. About 70 percent of those whose cases are rejected are permitted to stay on what we call 'toleration' permits. But this must end if we are to preserve our liberal asylum guarantees and defend the rights of legitimate political fugitives."
John agrees. "Germany is a crowded country," she says. "It's Montana with 80 million people. Although we are very, very rich, we have problems, such as a 100,000-unit housing shortfall in Berlin. Where are we going to put all these people? We're already spending four billion marks a year just maintaining asylum seekers."
Meanwhile, a crackdown on illegal immigrants has begun. In August, Germany announced it was sending extra guards to secure borders with Poland and Czechoslovakia. Bonn called upon other European states to help devise a "defensive" strategy on immigration. The 200 camps in Germany for asylum seekers, or as officials prefer to call them, "communal living arrangements," are already overflowing.
A failure to act would invite a nasty political reaction, Hilmer insists. "The Republicans got only 2 percent of the vote last year," he says. "But the more volatile group of what we call indifferent voters are about 24 percent. These swing voters, part of the breakdown throughout Europe of strong party affiliation, could be key if the economy stumbles. If things go badly, whom do you think they'll blame?"
Between the second half of the 19th century and the early 1950's, twelve million Italians immigrated to the United States and South America in search of work and a better life. The stream gradually dwindled to nothing about 10 years ago.
Yet, a tradition of emigration, born of economic necessity, made Italy one of Europe's least restrictive nations regarding freedom of movement -- until recently.
The complacency ended abruptly last March, when boats carrying more than 20,000 Albanians -- including 2,000 orphans -- dropped anchor off Italy's coast. "It was a social earthquake," says Margherita Boniver, whose newly created ministry has the unenviable task of coordinating Italy's tangle of immigration policies.
By the time a second wave of 10,000 Albanian boat people arrived a few weeks later, the Government had made up its mind.
"We sent them all back, and we will continue doing so," Boniver says. "If we do not, all of Albania will be in Italy. I've been there. It's a horrible country. Many people would walk on water to escape it."
Even before the Albanian crisis, however, Italy had started coming to grips with its new status as an immigration country. In 1990, it passed a sweeping immigration law that brought its policies closer to those of the other European Community members. Yet, Italy now has an estimated 400,000 illegal workers, one of Europe's highest rates, and keeping immigrants out may prove next to impossible.
"Italy has more than 5,000 miles of coast," says Elena Doni, a migration expert at the Giovanni Agnelli Foundation. "Each beach is a frontier. All of Italy's policemen can't police it."
What worries her most, Doni says, is the growing intolerance for the roughly 900,000 foreigners in what was until recently a rather tolerant country. "We've already had a few murders of foreigners here. But we don't have skinheads or Le Pen -- yet."
With immigration seemingly spinning out of control, many Western Europeans are promoting America's quota system as a partial solution. In most countries, the American (and French) goal of assimilation holds little appeal. Most Europeans doubt that the newcomers, particularly the Muslims, can be assimilated. And many don't want them to be.
To a certain extent, the fear of foreigners has been magnified by a lack of reliable information. In France, for example, the Ministry of Interior's estimate of legal foreign workers disagrees by 20 percent with Bianco's. "We should start with better information and less inflammatory language," Heisbourg recommends.
Nevertheless, the pervasive fear that host societies will be profoundly changed by massive immigration is not entirely unfounded. "Even if we adopt and enforce quotas, take only those we need, these people, too, will probably change our societies," says de Michelis. "We will become, as Western Europe was a very long time ago, more multi-ethnic and multicultural. That is an enormously difficult psychological transition for Western Europeans."
While Europe has overcome the cold war, he argues, it now risks creating new divisions and conflicts, such as a white, wealthy and Christian "fortress Europe" pitted against a largely poor, Islamic world. "That could lead to more terrorism and another 40 years of small, hot wars," de Michelis warns.
At the technical level, however, coordination of immigration policies is improving. Now, asylum seekers can file in every E.C. country, one application at a time. By 1992, however, they will be allowed to file in only one E.C. state. And member states will soon require visas for entry from 110 countries and impose common penalties for transporting illegal aliens between member states. The Schengen agreement, signed in June 1990 by several E.C. states, establishes uniform practices for controlling frontiers and permits police to engage in limited "hot pursuit" across borders.
Most experts now agree that international rules on political asylum are inadequate. Yet there is little consensus on an alternative strategy.
Perhaps the best way to discourage huge waves of immigration is to promote development in the East and the South through vast increases in aid and investment. Yet foreign aid is politically unpopular, and the global competition for private capital is likely to intensify in the 90's.
Harlem Desir, the head of SOS Racisme, a French civil rights group with ties to the Socialist Party, blames politicians, particularly Socialists and other leftists, for the growing xenophobia. Political cowardice, he says, has prevented the traditional defenders of tolerance and human rights from challenging right-wing extremists. "The collapse of Communism in the East has triggered a crisis of identity among Social Democrats in the West," he says. "The left has become a timid center. And our democracy is being perverted by demagoguery."
Dominique Moisi, of the Institute for International Relations in France, generally agrees. "This should have been a time of enormous optimism for us in Europe," he says. "And yet in France, there is a sense of 'fin de regime,' and in Europe, a sense of 'fin de siecle.' Europeans now feel threatened by so many things," he continues. "The Americanization of our culture, the drift of the left, a loss of identity, the rise of an ugly populist response to things foreign."
But Europeans, he adds, have very strong societies, durable traditions and cultures. They also have a strong sense of what it means to live in a social democracy, in countries where good infrastructure, fine schools and decent health systems are available to all citizens, even foreigners. Even shoddy immigrant neighborhoods are still relatively safe, clean and calm, compared with American ghettos.
In time, Moisi says, Europeans will adjust to the inevitable change in their societies. If they have enlightened leaders, Europeans will lose their fears of "pollution" by outsiders; if the foreigners are given basic rights, as they are in France, the foreigners will become more like Europeans, and Europeans less afraid of them and of multiculturalism.
"Given our traditions and values," Moisi says, "I suppose I'm optimistic that in the long run we shall overcome this new challenge. In the short run, however, I think we're in for a very rocky time."

 BODY:
THE ZODIAC HAS fallen on hard times. For the ancients it was a sacred book inscribed in the heavens, a key to predicting the future of king and state. And when astrologers talked, people listened. In the 12th century, with the planets headed into conjunction in the windy sign of Libra, astrologers sounded the alarm. Throughout Europe, panicked citizens began digging caves in preparation for violent windstorms. Five hundred years later, when an English astronomer named William Whiston predicted the end of the world, thousands of Londoners fled the city.
Today the starry vault has lost its luster. The era of mass communications has reduced an elegant system of correspondences and symbols to a celestial Lotto game, a galactic mood ring. The priests who interpreted the mysteries of the heavens have given way to suburban sages who speak -- on obscure television channels, in shaky syntax -- exclusively of sex and money. 
 But in this tawdry universe, a star shines: Patric Walker, the class of the field among popular astrologers working today. Over a period of 30 years, he has attracted a fanatical following, first in Britain, where his "Celeste" column appears each month in the tony Harpers & Queen magazine, and more recently in the United States, where Town & Country began carrying a slightly modified version of his column in 1974. The result was as predictable as the vernal equinox: librarians began to notice that their copies of Town & Country had the last page ripped out; countless man-hours were lost as office workers passed around photocopies of Walker's monthly prognostications.
Today, Walker is a small industry, shrewdly trading on his upmarket luster to create a mass-market bonanza. In the United States, his diversified portfolio includes the slick, upscale European Travel & Life -- to which he was lured three and a half years ago -- the tabloid New York Post and three 900 telephone numbers.
Walker devotees prize his urbane, literate touch, his emotional tact and sensitivity, rare qualities in a field dominated by hacks, frauds and vulgarians. He is Henry James in a profession of Danielle Steels, the only astrologer who could possibly use a phrase like "the sadness of closure," or nonchalantly drop in a snippet of Shakespeare.
Even those with no particular interest in astrology -- and he attracts many -- discern a special something in Walker, something more easily felt than analyzed. He strikes a judicious balance between the specialized jargon of planetary movements -- ascendants, opposition, aspects and the like -- and the warmer, more intimate language of the advice column.
The message is not always upbeat. Readers often find that the month ahead looks like 40 miles of bad road, and that even good fortune brings danger with it. On the other hand, Walker is keen on the idea that progress comes through struggle and pain, that there is no such thing as an astrological free lunch. As he puts it to Capricorns this month in European Travel & Life, "remember that freedom means choosing your burdens."
"He's like a wise, slightly cynical friend," says Vicki Woods, editor of Harpers & Queen, "the kind you go to for real advice, not upbeat, positive blah. There's a certain world-weariness to it -- you feel he's been around."
Walker deals out the good news-bad news with an even hand and a deft pen. "On the face of it," he tells Aries (immediately sounding a warning note), "you seem to be going great guns and making enormous strides in your career or field of endeavor. Unfortunately, though, with Mars, your ruler currently passing through your opposite sign of Libra, you tend to imagine that partners or close associates are overly sensitive, narrow-minded and nit-picking, but the truth of the matter is" -- here the plot thickens -- "that they are able to detect certain warning signals."
The recommendation: listen to reason to avoid a letdown or loss of face around the 17th, when Uranus and Neptune at the mid-heaven point of the Aries solar chart are eclipsed by the Moon. And a final bit of advice: "Remember that sense shines with a double luster when it is set in humility."
Readers of the column say they find it uncannily accurate, which may simply mean that Walker, unlike his less-talented colleagues, hedges his bets with some subtlety, and knows how to craft a tantalizingly ambiguous phrase. There's no question that he has pushed the form well past the fortune-cookie level. For Walker, the planets tell a human story. His horoscopes tend to have a narrative line, a beginning, middle and an end. And the central, fascinating figure in every one of them is you.
THE MAN WHO SEES directly into hearts of millions of readers is a mild, silver-haired Yorkshireman from Whitby, a port town of perhaps 12,000 on the North Sea. Some know it as the home base of Captain Cook. Others recall it as the town that Dracula entered in the guise of a wolf after his long trip from Transylvania. Patric Walker remembers it as dark, a result of wartime blackouts. "It was quiet and peaceful," he says. "I read a lot."
Walker is probably the only astrologer Whitby has produced; it's almost certain that he is the only Whitby-ite born in Hackensack, N.J. -- 60 years ago, on Sept. 25, which makes him a Libra. Unfortunately, the hospital did not record the future astrologer's time of birth, which means that it is impossible to cast a thorough chart for him. Walker doesn't mind. "I know where the sun is, I know where the moon is, I know my attributes and I know my failings," he says. "That's enough for me."
Walker was the third of four children, his father an Englishman who emigrated in the 20's to seek his fortune in America. He didn't find it. Discouraged, Walker pere returned home and found work with the postal service; in 1938 his wife died of cancer.
His son, meanwhile, showed no occult tendencies. He attended a local public (i.e. private) school and, after graduating, joined the Royal Air Force, which trained him as an accountant and sent him off to Pakistan. After military service, Walker entered a period of rootlessness and struggle. He spent a number of unhappy years in London as an accountant, eventually succumbing to the devastating whammy of Saturn, a planetary bully that, every 29 1/2 years, re-establishes itself in the sign of one's birth, with devastating results. Walker doesn't go into specifics, saying only, "It wasn't drugs or anything like that."
One day, at a London party in 1960, he met an elderly American woman named Helene Hoskins, who asked him what his sign was. He bristled. "I'm not a sign. I'm Patric Walker." Hoskins coolly looked him over, and predicted he'd be back to see her. She was right. Walker sought her out and for the next six years served as her astrological apprentice.
Walker dismisses the work involved with a wave of the hand. "You remember as a child how it seemed to take forever to learn to tell time -- it just wouldn't click? And then one day you could tell the time? It's the same with astrology. Then the fun starts -- interpreting what it means."
After mastering his subject, Walker struck out on his own as the horoscope writer for a trendy new women's magazine called Nova. In 1974, with Hoskins reaching her 80's, Walker took over her "Celeste" column in Harpers & Queen, which he continued to write anonymously until this May, when it began appearing with his own byline attached.
Today, in addition to Harpers & Queen, Walker's columns appear in a slew of British newspapers, including the classy Evening Standard and The Mail on Sunday, to which he also contributes supplements four times a year that boost the paper's circulation of 2.5 million by a quarter of a million copies. In the United States, Walker reaches an audience of nearly 20 million through his monthly columns in European Travel & Life and New Woman, a weekly column in TV Guide and a daily column syndicated in 13 newspapers, including The New York Post. Although low-tech by inclination, Walker recently set foot in the brave new world of the 900 number. Callers hear a brief introduction by Walker himself; the horoscopes themselves are delivered by Jennifer Croxton, an assistant, in a husky, cosmically soothing voice.
Even with this kind of market penetration, Walker lags well behind such rivals as Sydney Omarr and Joyce Jillson, who appear in more than 100 papers each, and the pseudonymous Francis Drake in 300. Bernice Bede Osol, from her home outside Cleveland, writes for some 350 newspapers. Walker could be described as playing catch-up, but he doesn't seem to be aware that there's a playing field out there. "I know very little about American astrologers," he says over lunch at the Algonquin Hotel in New York. Then he asks, genuinely curious, "Who are they?"
ALTHOUGH ASTROLOGY is ancient -- the basic principles were laid down in Babylon 4,000 years ago and whipped into modern shape by the Greeks -- the popular horoscope has a surprisingly short pedigree. The first horoscope in a major newspaper appeared in 1930, when the editor of The Sunday Express in London, was looking for a fresh angle on the birth of Princess Margaret, sister of the present queen. A call went out to an astrologer named R. H. Naylor, who cast a horoscope for the princess (correctly predicting her marital difficulties) and, as an afterthought, added a few planetary tips for readers with birthdays coming up the next week. Reader response was overwhelming, and Naylor was hired to write a weekly column. Others followed in Britain, and almost immediately, the fad crossed the Atlantic. In 1936, The New York Post devised the now-universal format of running horoscopes under the 12 sun signs.
The early horoscopes read more like Nostradamus than Dear Abby. Astrologers worried about political events, about war, famine and pestilence. "Mundane" astrology, as it was called, showed amazing persistence. During World War II, when the English got wind of an astrologer who was supplying the Nazi high command with planetary intelligence, they hired their own man, the Hungarian-born Louis de Wohl. His mission: to duplicate whatever it was his Nazi counterparts were doing. In true Battle of Britain spirit, he fought alone against appalling odds: British intelligence believed that the Germans had a half-dozen astrologers hard at work.
With peace came prosperity. Horoscope writers found a mass audience by turning to more personal matters: money, career, romance and family. About 90 percent of America's 1,600 or so daily newspapers carry horoscopes. In the United States alone, there are 40 magazines devoted to the subject. And now the computer has entered the picture. Several companies in the United States turn out software that allows astrologers to cast their horoscopes in a matter of minutes.
Walker remains unimpressed by the new technology. He looks genuinely appalled at the suggestion that he might like to take advantage of the newfangled hardware. "Whatever for?" he asks. "All it can do is spit out whatever is put into it. It can't really interpret. So what's the point?"
He reaches into a briefcase and pulls out "Raphael's Astronomical Ephemeris." It's the astrological version of a railroad timetable: a slim paperback filled with tables in minute type that tell what planet is where in the solar system at any moment. "This is all I need," Walker says. "I doubt whether a computer can do it any quicker than I can. Doesn't this sum up so much of what's happening in the world? To save as much time as we can, to add granules to water and make coffee, or whatever. And then what do we do with our time?" He sighs. "But maybe that's why I live in Greece."
ELEVEN YEARS AGO, Walker happened across Lindos, a village of 800 inhabitants on the island of Rhodes. He decided to stay. He lives in a small house overlooking the Acropolis of Rhodes, and he enjoys a pristine night sky, the same sky that the ancient Greeks sliced up into the zodiac 2,500 years ago.
As a schoolboy, Walker learned Greek and Latin. He returned to the classics with new intensity as an astrologer, eager to explore the mythology and religious practices of the classical world. Although a Roman Catholic, he moves in a quasi-mythic world, with the gods and goddesses of ancient Greece hovering just overhead, or lurking around the next corner. In the well-oiled cosmology that he tends, pagan astrology meshes perfectly, if inexplicably, with Christian doctrine. The stars rule us, "but God rules them," as Burton put it in "The Anatomy of Melancholy." Even then, they "do incline, but not compel."
To measure the inclinations, Walker rises at 5:30 A.M., a habit left over from his days as an altar boy in Whitby, and works through to the early afternoon, drawing up charts on simple preprinted forms, then writing up his horoscopes in longhand. The procedure is simple. A pie chart with 12 equal slices represents the 12 "sun" signs -- so called because they refer to the position of the sun in the zodiac on the date of one's birth. With his trusty "Raphael's" in hand, Walker determines the changing relationships of the planets to each sign and interprets what influences will be at work that day, or in the week or month ahead.
His particular talent, he says, lies in taking into consideration the outer planets -- "the planets of change" -- rather than the more stationary Venus and Mars for the relevant period. What results is greater subtlety and, for believers, greater accuracy. Once the charts have been drafted, a secretary types them up, and faxes them off to Walker's London office, near Fleet Street, whence they find their way to the wider world -- as far as Kuala Lumpur and Dubai.
Walker becomes nervous at any talk of his cult status. The word sets him off. "It really is nice, and I am grateful that people read what I write," he says. "But my life isn't about creating a following. I really object to the power of astrologers, which is why I won't do individual horoscopes. I don't want anyone to become hooked or dependent on me."
Or on the planets. "It all comes down to the ancient injunction 'know thyself,' " he says. "And that's an open-ended statement. You then have to come to terms with what you know, and with yourself. The sun, the moon, the planets are all in motion, and hopefully we are on the move too -- spiritually and emotionally."
Suddenly, Walker is struck by a fugitive thought and puts down his fork. "You know, my being an astrologer from Whitby, living on a Greek island -- it really is odd, isn't it?"

HEADLINE: DANCE VIEW;
The Simple Secret of Teaching Dance

BYLINE: By Jennifer Dunning

 BODY:
What makes a good dance teacher? Good teaching must be founded, of course, on a solid technical base. But that is not enough, as the superb young performers of the Katherine Dunham Student Workshop in East St. Louis, Ill., suggested in an informal program early last month.
Here were children who traveled through space with an appetite for movement that in no way blurred the lines between the ballet, modern dance, tap and traditional-style African and Caribbean dance they were performing. Their teachers, Lee Nolting and Darryl Braddix, had created dances of radiant simplicity. But most of all there was none of the stilted, carefully correct negotiation of space that one sometimes sees in young and not-so-young dancers in an era when supreme value is placed on virtuosic technique. 
 Discipline and a respect for technique and style shone through the students' self-assured abandon. Yet they had gone beyond the classroom, becoming performers alive in their every moment on the stage.
How did they learn to dance like that? The answer may lie, at least partially, in Miss Dunham's humanist perspective. "It's a wonderful thing when people know why they dance," the 82-year-old choreographer said recently. "You don't just dance by being out in front in a piece."
She and her assistant, Jeanelle Stovall, continue to struggle against daunting economic problems to keep the Dunham school going. It has offered steady training in dance and music since the late 1960's, when Miss Dunham founded the school to help reclaim the children of the impoverished city of East St. Louis as productive citizens of the future. Technical skills were always important. But as important was what Miss Dunham calls "socialization." "People have to learn how to live, who they are, what they are," she said.
It would be difficult, and perhaps impractical, to offer dance students lessons in cultural history and language as Miss Dunham, an anthropologist as well as a choreographer and performer, encouraged her staff to do in the early years. Dancers who performed with Miss Dunham's internationally known company in the 1940's talk of those days as a continuing education. They learned about other languages and cultures as well as the steps and gestures of her zesty, demanding style of traditional Caribbean and American black dance.
There is another aspect of the Dunham method, one that Ruthanna Boris, an admirer of the training, describes as "catalytic guidance." "The teacher disappears into the class," Ms. Boris, a ballerina and choreographer who now teaches and practices dance therapy, says of the Dunham method and of good teaching in general. "The child invents dance as he or she goes."
Looking back on my own classes, endured and quickly abandoned as a child, then eagerly resumed as a dance-going adult, I remember most vividly the teachers who gave the necessary building blocks of dance a wider context, making them not just inevitable classroom exercises but intellectual and emotional challenges.
There was the teacher who abandoned the usual practice of dividing students into groups to learn combinations of steps by rote. Instead, she set one group beside another, turned both away from the mirror, staggered their entrances into the center of the studio. Suddenly, the steps had to be danced around other bodies and through another group, rather than facing front in neat and isolated ranks.
The deadening power of the classroom mirror, that tyrannical definer of a student's body, work and worth, was diminished. The classroom became a vital, breathing space not unlike a stage. The combinations became dances with exhilarating lives of their own.
"I wish that the schools attached to the regional professional and civic companies could -- or would -- start all their pupils out in class with Dunham teachers," Ms. Boris wrote me in a recent letter. "Their aspiring 'ballerinas' would come to the years of balletic complexities with a strong feeling of personal power, a deep familiarity with the act of dancing, and a sense of joy in movement." Such a broad-based early dance background would strength the younger dancer through "the vigor of an unbiased approach."
A competitive striving for greater and greater technical virtuosity has robbed the ballet stage of some of its vitality in recent years. And, given the increasing blurring of distinctions between ballet and modern dance, it has affected modern dance as well. Blame is often placed on George Balanchine. Like every ballet master, Balanchine had his visions of the ideal dancer, which in the popular imagination was a long-bodied, pin-headed female who danced fast and efficiently, without much emotional involvement, accepting any challenge of technique.
Yet one teacher singled out by Balanchine and his assistants in their research on ballet teaching standards in America during the late 1950's, for a survey sponsored by the Ford Foundation, was "a delightful fat lady who has a wonderful way with children." As reported by the dance writer Elizabeth Kendall in a 1983 report on the foundation's contributions to American dance, the observers noted that the teacher offered not only ballet but "pantomime and a certain amount of acting and ballroom" and "is probably more fruitful and less harmful than the 'serious' ballet teachers who are often misinformed and pretentious."
A practical-minded visionary, Miss Dunham might not entirely approve of Balanchine's find. The chief lessons of Dunham teaching are profoundly serious. And they are as applicable to the easy appropriator of other cultural traditions for "feel-good" or politicized dance as they are to the rigid manipulator at the barre. The dancer, Miss Dunham tells us, lives in a larger world. To be an artist is to be a communicator.

HEADLINE: FILM;
Sean Penn, Human Tempest, Settles Into the Auteur's Life

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER

 BODY:
Sean Penn exhales cigarette smoke and coughs. "I have no argument with anybody who doesn't agree with punching out anybody," he says. "But then don't punch out the man who punches you."
Mr. Penn, widely known as both a human tempest and an actor of sizable gifts, is in New York to publicize a new movie he has written and directed, "The Indian Runner," which opens on Friday, but he's responding, of course, to the most common and longstanding inquiries about him. How does he explain his reputation as Hollywood's most hostile star, its biggest spoiled brat, its loosest cannon? How does he justify the behavior -- the nasty intolerance of fans who approach him in public, the vile and occasionally violent outbursts against paparazzi -- that has led him to be skewered mercilessly in the press? 
 "If that's the case, O.K.," Mr. Penn continues. "Don't engage in violence for your rights. If a fascist dictator takes over, then passive resistance is the only course. But if violence has a place, then you can't say, 'He's punching out a photographer.' I got into fights with people who violated my liberties."
As an argument, it is a little facile but perhaps understandable, especially for a man who was once married to the most famous woman in the world and whose private life was thus exposed to the cruel tenacity of the tabloids.
Still, there is that one line about the fascist dictator -- a reference to Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait -- a blithe, implicit escalation of one man's trouble to the level of international crisis. It isn't self-aggrandizing, exactly; it seems a bit overheated, or maybe just naive.
Indeed, a talk with Mr. Penn over the course of a long, boozy dinner is a little like a perfervid, late-night discourse in a dorm room. Self-confident, frank and adamantly unapologetic, he is 31 years old but looks younger, striking, particularly in profile. His voice has the nasal quality one associates with the stoned. Listening to him, one hears an earnest and even intelligent quest to derive meaning out of gut instinct. To his credit, he doesn't expect to be understood on the basis of a single, formally arranged encounter. He calls his public tantrums "the most inane moments of my life" and bitterly resents their being made to stand for the whole man. But one aches to rope him in. Inevitably he follows his logic into recklessness.
"When people say, 'Well, this is the game,' " he says, referring to the relentless fox-and-hounds he played with photographers during his hectic, three-and-a-half-year marriage to Madonna, "I say, 'O.K., I own a magazine. I'm going to hire somebody who's going to follow you everywhere you go. He's going to follow you home. He's going to be over there at that table when you're here, at a restaurant, with your wife. And then there's the added thing of flashes in the eyes, the goading, the provoking. And this goes on for a month. And you go to the courts, there's nothing you can do. Would you ultimately kill him?' I would."
Mr. Penn is skirting the limelight these days -- no problem, he says, without Madonna -- if not the press. He has given a number of interviews on behalf of "The Indian Runner," his first produced screenplay and effort at directing. The film, about brothers painfully at odds (the title refers to its central metaphor), stars David Morse and Viggo Mortensen. Mr. Penn isn't in the film himself, and one of the surprises to have emerged from his recent public statements is the confession that acting turns him so unhappily in on himself that he isn't likely to return to it.
If Mr. Penn steers clear of the screen, many filmgoers will feel that as a loss. His performances in a dozen or so movies over the last decade -- among them Jeff Spicoli, the stoned-out surfer-teen in "Fast Times at Ridgemont High"; the paranoid cocaine smuggler Daulton Lee in "The Falcon and the Snowman"; Brad Whitewood, the alienated son of a rural gangster in "At Close Range," and Meserve, an Army sergeant in Vietnam who directs his men to a brutal rape and murder in "Casualties of War" -- have shown an estimable range and drawn nearly uniform critical praise.
If his work has moved in any direction, it is toward a sense of menace. "Watchful control and a sense of lake-filled silence behind a thin, rustling curtain of words are the hallmarks of Penn's acting style," the critic James Wolcott wrote in 1986. Three years later, Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times, "As the possibly psychotic Meserve, Sean Penn is perfectly cast." The fierce, almost preternatural intensity that many critics have noted in Mr. Penn's work of late is certainly synchronous with the actor's own angry persona.
"I can't break down how much of my experience with the twilight zone that is celebrity has to do with my feelings about acting," he says. "Mostly I think it's the process itself, which I have equated in my head with a set of works. You got your spoon, you got your surgical tie-off, you got your Bunsen burner, and you get down to business. That's what I looked at acting as, a set of works, not a craft. I was more of an addict than a positive practitioner."
"The Indian Runner" could easily be seen as self-examining, though not autobiographical. It's clearly a movie made by someone who is interested in the mayhem that can plague a man. "I live on the idea that we've got to have compassion for the mass murderer because he is us and we are him," Mr. Penn says, and the notion resonates in the film, if not as explicitly as all that.
A period piece set in Nebraska in the late 60's, based on the lyrics of the Bruce Springsteen song "Highway Patrolman," the story concerns the relationship of the Roberts brothers after the loss of the family farm. Joe (Mr. Morse) has become a locally admired cop; his younger brother, Frank (Mr. Mortensen), always the troublemaker, has gone off to Vietnam. As the film opens, on the day of Frank's return, Joe has to kill a man in the line of duty. Told largely from Joe's conscience-stricken point of view, the film nonetheless centers on Frank's struggle with incorrigibility, his vain attempt to live according to his brother's wishes for him.
"I could see where someone would be coming from if they said I was Frank," Mr. Penn says. "But I think it would be an easy cliche. I don't feel like I have a closer relationship with any one character more than another."
About his shift to writing and directing Mr. Penn is more specific. His perspective on his experience as a movie maker, if not as a celebrity, is clear. He sees the job as empowering in a way that acting was not.
"If somebody says, 'Well, you were good, but the movie wasn't,' then there's no gratification, not to me," Mr. Penn says. Directing, he adds, feeds his sense of responsibility for the whole, and almost as an illustration, he admits that his script was overwritten, which is surprising because the film's dialogue is generally spare. "It's a lot about the actors," he says. "A lot of times, when we were rehearsing, I could put lines through stuff, because I could see what I wanted without it.
"Casting the actors, casting the crew -- that's making a movie right there," he continues. "If you got a weak link, it's your problem because you hired him."
As far as the actors, at least, his choices could not be described as safe. There are no marquee names, except for Charles Bronson, who is notably cast against type as Joe and Frank's father, a defeated old man.
Mr. Penn says he offered Mr. Bronson the role strictly because of what he knew about the hardships of the actor's private life -- Mr. Bronson's longtime support of his late wife, Jill Ireland, in her battle with cancer. On the face of it, that's rather creative thinking, and one can't help speculate that for an explosive character like Mr. Penn, the task of directing -- with the pragmatism required to reproduce a vision on a fixed budget ($9 million in this case) -- is a helpful harness. As he talks about it, his smarts show.
Asked about one unusual shot, for instance, when an unmoored camera follows a bottle of Scotch as Joe and his wife push it back and forth across the kitchen table, Mr. Penn says: "As a director, one thing you can be for your actors is an audience, and to be a real attentive one. Then if you go off the actor and onto a bottle, or whatever it is, you've got to give the bottle equal time. Now it's your image. And why are you drawn to it? Maybe you feel like the audience needs a drink. The character just killed a man, you know."
During the filming, which took place entirely on location in Nebraska, Mr. Penn says his aim was to come to work each morning with a "bottom line" sense of what he wanted to achieve in the day's shooting. "But what happens is, you get there and it's been a year since I wrote the scene, and six months that I've been thinking about what color the walls of the set should be painted, where the light comes in the window. The actors have been thinking about that scene. And if you've cast it right, they have good ideas. All of a sudden you say, 'Oh, I had the camera here, and it should be over there, slowly moving.' If something wonderful's going on, I want to see it. That's storytelling."
In its rural setting, its depiction of people for whom palpable hardship is a daily companion, the film is about a world that is clearly at a distance from Mr. Penn's own upbringing, first in the San Fernando Valley suburbs of Los Angeles, later in Malibu. He is from a Hollywood family -- his father, Leo Penn, has been a director for television and movies; his mother is the actress Eileen Ryan.
"Twenty years ago, Malibu was an incredibly rural community," he says. "You had show-business people, but on our street we had auto mechanics, every economic level. So in a way there's nothing in my movie that couldn't have happened there." He pauses and laughs, unable to sustain the comparison. "Except that you had the outlet of the beach, so if you felt like one of the characters, you'd go down there, look at the ocean and you feel better." Anyway, he goes on, "Alienation isn't married to the home."
It seems rather more likely that his attraction to the world in "The Indian Runner" was born after he moved out of his parents' house. He studied acting for two years in Los Angeles, and then at 19, he just picked up and drove to New York. Almost immediately he landed a role in a play called "Heartland," which led to his being cast in the film "Taps" in 1981.
"I had money in my pocket for the first time, so I went back to California," he says. "But I never stayed put in L.A. for long. Between movies, I've probably driven back and forth across America 15 or 20 times. I used to be just a vagabond, just driving. Stay in little motels. Go see places that you heard about in your favorite books, your favorite songs. Take pictures. And, I guess, look for women."
He traces his public troubles to 1984, when he decided not to do publicity interviews for "Racing With the Moon," a coming-of-age film set during World War II. "I liked the movie; it was a sweet movie," Mr. Penn says. "But I was working on 'Falcon and the Snowman,' and I just didn't have anything to say." Studio executives groused, however, and the press picked up on it. "I wasn't even a famous actor at the time, but it became this thing. 'Ah -- now we've got a label for him. He's the guy who doesn't support his movies.' And then I got married to her."
Mr. Penn is a new father; his daughter, Dylan Frances Penn, is 5 months old. Her mother is the actress Robin Wright, who was Mr. Penn's co-star in the 1990 film "State of Grace." The two are not married. Mr. Penn spent much of the summer with mother and daughter in Ireland, where Ms. Wright was filming "Playboys" with Albert Finney. Since he just returned, it seems reasonable that the family finds its way into many crevices of the conversation. A number of times, it becomes his reference point in trying to explain himself.
"People are born wanting to love," he says. "I got this little girl. I was in a hotel lobby, and I had her in my arms, and there was another baby crying and she saw it. She looks at this other baby crying, and all of a sudden her lower lip starts to tremble and she just starts crying, because she was seeing somebody else in some kind of pain she recognized. That's what we're meant to be, I think."
It is the kind of speech that makes it natural to ask Mr. Penn if he thinks he's mellowed. "Not so," he says, and then he proves it.
"Once you get out there in the world, you see how politically and culturally repressed people are, particularly in this country," he begins. "They're angry. And there's nothing, I think, that can make a person angrier than anger.
"What should be done with a guy like Jeff Dahmer? What should be done with Charles Manson? O.K., I'm a father now. My girlfriend and I are driving down the road; let's say a car wipes us off the face of the earth. The child goes into foster care, this beautiful perfect child, and the foster father rapes her every day. She goes to another foster home. Foster mother beats her up and whores her. And at 17 years old, she gets a semiautomatic weapon and opens up on a schoolyard and kills a bunch of kids. Are you going to give her the death penalty? Hey, at what point after you're born do they give you the test for sensitivity?
"In our culture, antisocial behavior is not judged on a relative scale. Antisocial behavior is antisocial behavior -- that's a problem person. Never do we say, 'We have a problem environment for a person who is different than I am.' But that's what compassion's for."
The speech is made conversationally. It isn't the volume but the righteous indignation that's been turned up -- Where's the compassion? -- and it's easy to see why Mr. Penn so often gets himself in trouble. Eventually he reveals his personal villains, along with his demons: George Bush is "a murderer for killing hundreds of thousands of people in Panama and Iraq"; the Pope is a "monster" for "condemning the use of condoms when there's a sexual plague killing people"; the photographers who once hounded him are "bad people, people who still live with their mothers; they're overweight and don't know who they are and have no sense of decency at all. Now, I got compassion for them, but compassionately speaking, I say, 'Die.' "

HEADLINE: Jump-Starting Sales for New Housing

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON

 BODY:
ARTHUR COLLINS thought he had the market figured in the summer of 1988 when he started building three-story condominiums in Greenwich, Conn., with flats on the first level and duplexes above.
But the market slump that stunted home sales in the region held some surprises. The flats sold to the empty-nesters they were aimed at, but the stairs in the duplexes frightened off the elderly, while their $600,000 prices put them beyond the means of young families. 
 So Mr. Collins, senior partner in Collins Construction Corporation of Greenwich, did what many developers are reluctantly doing these days: He reconfigured his project. He made the duplexes into one- and two-bedroom flats, installed elevators, cut prices to about $300,000 and started selling.
"It's not an easy thing to have to do, but I wasn't selling anything and so I had to go back to my plans," Mr. Collins said. "By the end of the day this will be a $100 million project, and with that much money at stake I don't have the luxury I might have on a smaller project of just sitting back and waiting. There is too much money out there; it was just eating us alive, and we couldn't afford to wait."
All builders of multiphase developments fine-tune their offerings to some extent. They adjust the mix of housing from phase to phase, tinker with their pricing to capture the biggest profit without losing sales, and play around with building configurations within their property boundaries to keep ahead of public tastes and of the competition.
What is new among many of today's developers is the complete break with earlier phases -- building flats instead of duplexes, as Mr. Collins did, or shifting from town houses to detached housing in an effort to jump-start sales in a stagnant housing market.
Such mid-project changes are apparently governed by two universal rules these days: Move away from the expensive to the more affordable, and from attached to detached housing. In the soft real-estate market that followed the boom of the mid-80's, big expensive houses have lost the greatest share of market value overall, real-estate brokers and builders say. This segment depended heavily on move-up buyers and empty-nesters transferring their equity from existing homes to new ones. Now, unable to sell their current high-priced homes, these people are staying away from high-priced new developments.
Another factor is that the condominium town-house market, already heavily overbuilt, is not as attractive to young families with children, who want small, detached homes with private yards.
These are the buyers who dominate today's market. They are the couples, as Patrick O'Keefe, head of the New Jersey Builders Association, put it, who doubled up with the in-laws during the recent cycle of overheated prices, saving their money for a down payment, and who are now ready to buy a modestly priced one-family house.
BUT moving down in price is hard for builders to do, and the difficulties explain why downsizing a development is a last-ditch maneuver, taken only when financial pressures preclude simply letting an unfinished project wait until the market improves.
Changing a project design means having to work the new plans through all the layers of government that stand between builders and their goals, the zoning and planning board, the board of architectural review, the town council.
And the economics of downsizing are tricky. This is because the price of land already bought or contracted for is fixed, and land bought at the rate of $60,000 a unit, a typical price during the boom, is hard to fit under a downsized home aimed at the $160,000 market.
"Some land is just so expensive that you can't just go out and build 125 town houses on land that was priced for expensive single-family homes," said Jay Shackford, a spokesman for the National Association of Home Builders, in Washington. "If the lot costs $100,000, the price of the unit has to be considerably more than that to make it work. Land costs now account for as much as 35 percent of the sale price of a home, and lenders are wary of lending to projects where the land costs more than that."
Richard Mohring Sr. got around the problem of overpriced land by buying a bankrupt project called Longtree Pond, in Eastport, L.I., from the foreclosing bank. While the previous developer was building $375,000 houses on lots he had bought for $100,000 each, Mr. Mohring and his son, Richard Jr., are building $160,000 houses on foreclosure-devalued lots for which they paid the bank $60,000 each.
Although the Mohrings have finessed the financial ramifications of downsizing a project, they have run smack into the psychological problems of putting affordable housing next to the expensive houses built in an earlier phase. His firm, Mohring Enterprises of Sea Cliff, L.I., is being sued by some of the owners of the eight original, $375,000 houses at Longtree Pond for bringing down housing values in the development.
"They think I'm bringing down the market," Mr. Mohring complained. "What people won't accept is that the buyers set the price that they are willing to pay. The competition is fierce, and people will say, 'Well, you want $150,000 and down the road they're selling for $147,000,' you have to say, 'O.K., you got it for one forty-seven.' Either you do that, or you just go deeper in debt with the bank."
If the first buyers in downsized developments complain, there are some obvious opportunities for those who buy after the changes are made.
PRICES in downsized developments are tens of thousands of dollars less per home than in the project's early incarnation. The houses are likely to be smaller and so have lower taxes, and they are likely to be a type of house that builders believe is the product line of the 1990's, the small detached one-family home on a small lot.
So George Davon, the builder of a 123-unit mix of town houses and detached single-family homes in New Milford, Conn., called Sullivan Farm, is planning to shift next spring entirely to detached houses costing $185,000 to $265,000.
"There is far less competition in the modestly priced free-standing homes than in town houses," Mr. Davon said, "so that is what we will be focusing on."
For Mr. Collins, whose project is called Old Greenwich Gables, the shift in marketing strategy since the boom of the mid-80's has been to capture some of the house-hungry young families who are in the market to buy.
Originally, Old Greenwich Gables consisted of three-story structures with a first-floor, one-bedroom flat and a three-bedroom duplex above. The project is being built atop a raised 50- by-400-foot concrete slab left over from the old Electrolux vacuum cleaner plant at the site, a structure that provides for a vast grade-level parking and storage area for owners.
The flats sold well between $250,000 and $300,000, Mr. Collins said, but the duplexes, intended to be the stars of the project, went nowhere at $500,000 to $600,000.
"Two things happened after we changed to flats," Mr. Collins noted. "The pricing went down because the square footage declined, and where we were having difficulty attracting older people to the duplexes, we have them all on one floor in the flats."
Now, each cluster of 12 units is served by an elevator from the garage level to the top flats, thus overcoming the concern among older buyers about having to climb stairs.
For a 900-square-foot condominium with one bedroom or one bedroom and a den, the prices are $200,000 to $300,000. Fifteen units in the new configuration have been built since the spring, and half have already been sold.
But it was not easy. Although Mr. Collins was able to cover his land costs at Old Greenwich Gables, it took him almost a year to get the changes approved by the Greenwich authorites. What made it possible at all, he said, was his keeping the redesigned development within the limits of about 300 bedrooms and 300,000 square feet of space set in the original approval.
INCREASING density by adding more units to help cover the cost of expensive land, Mr. Collins and other developers said, would be all but impossible, because sentiment against growth -- and more traffic, more children to educate, more municipal services to provide -- is so strong that local regulators, having already approved one level of growth, are unlikely to look kindly on approving an even higher one.
New Jersey's Municipal Land Use Law has even institutionalized a bias against letting builders return to the planning table for more density at an already approved project. It requires five votes out of the seven on local planning boards to increase the density of an already approved project.
It was not a step Mr. Collins took lightly, therefore, and one he avoided altogether at other developments, where he has simply stopped construction.
"Greenwich is a special place, and if you have the right product, it will sell," he said. "At other projects where I could have redesigned, I just stopped building. It would be silly to do anything with them. The market just had no depth or strength at all, and I didn't see any future for them for several years."
In some cases, regulatory concern makes changing a project design impossible. New York, New Jersey and Connecticut have been expanding the buffer zones around wetlands in recent years, for example, while allowing construction to continue at projects approved under earlier, less-stringent rules.
Several developers said in interviews that they would lose their grandfathered wetlands permits if they sought to modify their projects.
"It's easier just to wait," said William Becker, head of the Becker Organization of Teaneck, N.J., a prominent development consultant.
MR. BECKER advises his clients to avoid the need for making planning and design U-turns in mid-project by anticipating shifts in the market, and building enough flexibility into planning phases to meet them. To provide this flexibility, he plots out new developments with the care of a supermarket designer putting the milk on the back wall and the candy at the check-out counter.
"Say you got a 300-unit community," he said. "The first thing you learn in today's market is that you can't open a multi-phase community with only one product. You have to give people a choice, say, single-family and garden condos, and you hold your town houses for later, to create new interest."
Mr. Becker tells his clients to open a new project with the worst location first.
"You always have the power line going through the first phase," he said, "because you know you're not going to sell those units for as much as the ones up by the lake or near the front entrance."
So by putting the first units at the worst location, the builder captures the appreciated value of the remaining space that comes with having opened a new development.
Along with having to change a line of housing that is selling too slowly, Mr. Becker said, builders sometimes have to redesign a project that is too popular with buyers.
"There's such a thing as selling too fast," he said. "It means that the people you are attracting have more income than they are using, and they see your development as too good a value to pass up."
In those happy cases, developers should upscale, Mr. Becker said, advising builders to put in more options, perhaps an extra bedroom, and raise prices -- and profits -- accordingly.

HEADLINE: MR. SOFTWARE

 BODY:
The personal computer industry will innovate faster and produce more wealth for society if Microsoft chairman Bill Gates sets the pace and his competitors respond to his moves rather than try to deprive Microsoft of its leading position through lawsuits or other means.
Apple Computers, for example, sued Microsoft because Microsoft's Windows provides cheap software emulations of Apple's high-priced Macintosh line. Apple would like to continue making money by selling old technology at high prices in small volumes. I.B.M. has traditionally followed the same strategy. 
 A century ago, the telephone industry was faced with a similar choice: Should it sell telephones cheaply in very large volumes and maximize the total wealth created for the country? Or should it keep margins high and sell relatively few telephones? The Bell System followed the second option for 20 years, and the development of the telphone system in the United States was held back for half a generation.
Microsoft's competitors today are trying to shift the microcomputer industry onto the same high-margin, low-volume, slower-diffusion track. We will all be poorer -- except for Apple and I.B.M. shareholders -- if they succeed.

HEADLINE: Westchester Wetlands At Stake in Debate

BYLINE: States News Service

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
DEVELOPERS and environmentalists in Westchester County are carefully watching a battle in Washington about which environmentally sensitive areas should be protected as wetlands and which should be opened to construction.
The Bush Administration has initiated a proposal to limit what is defined as a wetland -- typically marshes, bogs and swamps that serve as homes for plants and animals and filters for pollution. 
 Congress also wants to loosen some wetlands conservation rules, which in the last two years have been expanded by the United States Environmental Protection Agency to include forests and fallow fields that are dry most of the year. Lawmakers are under fire from industries, home builders and farmers who complain that current laws often don't make sense.
 
How Fallow Land Functions
 Freshwater wetlands are threaded throughout Westchester, and most of the county's undeveloped land serves important wetlands functions, said Laura Tessier, program administrator for the Soil and Water Conservation District in Westchester. Her office reviews environmental-impact statements given to the county by developers who want to build on land designated as wetlands.
What is going on in Washington "is the most outrageous thing to happen in wetlands protection in 20 years," Ms. Tessier said.
But Robert Szabo, executive director of the National Wetlands Coalition, agreed that the process may be painful but stressed that wetlands regulations were adopted in 1989 without public notification.
Mr. Szabo, who represents a group of large industries lobbying for change in the wetlands definition, said the environmentalists now must accept the public pressure to scale back regulations.
"That's America," Mr. Szabo said. "We have to have this debate."
 
Counting the Wet Days
 The Administration hasproposed extending the number of days the soil must be wet each year to qualify as wetlands under E.P.A. rules.
The ground would need to be covered with water for 15 consecutive days or saturated to the surface for at least three weeks to meet the proposed guidelines. The current law requires saturation for only seven consecutive days a year. The new guidelines are under public review and are about six months away from approval, according to the E.P.A.
Environmentalists estimate that the E.P.A.'s new definition by itself would trim the current stock of wetlands to 66 million acres nationwide, from 100 million acres.
In Westchester, no one knows how many acres would lose the designation; the county land that meets the current Federal definition has not been identified. The New York Department of Environmental Conservation has mapped nearly 6,500 acres of freshwater wetlands in Westchester, but Ms. Tessier said that is only a fraction of what exists in the county.
 
Four Bills in Congress
 Congress is considering its own alterations to wetlands regulations. Four bills to regulate wetlands are pending, but the one gaining widest acceptance is the proposed comprehensive wetlands conservation and management act.
The bill, proposed jointly by two Louisiana Democrats, Representative Jimmy Hayes and Senator John B.Breaux, has attracted 168 signatures of support from House members and 24 in the Senate. Hearings are scheduled for next month.
The legislation would categorize wetlands so that only the most valuable marshes and bogs would be left untouched. The bill would also prevent classifying land as too valuable to disturb unless the owner has been compensated by the Federal Government for losing the use of it. At present, no compensation is offered.
Westchester lawmakers are divided on the issue.
Representative Nita M. Lowey, Democrat of Harrison, said she sees the need to streamline the wetlands regulation process and to exclude land that is not environmentally sensitive from the rules.
 
But With a Caveat
 But she said she was worried that loosening the regulations would mean destruction of valuable habitat. And the compensation requirement in the wetlands bill proposed by Mr. Hayes and Mr. Breaux "would be a tremendous cost," she said.
"I don't think protecting wetlands and encouraging economic growth are incompatible," Mrs. Lowey said. "I think everyone realizes there's going to have to be compromise."
Representative Benjamin Gilman, Republican of Middletown, is supporting the proposed wetlands reform bill, said Todd Burger, grants and projects director for Mr. Gilman.
Mr. Gilman heard dozens of complaints from farmers and developers who could not use their land or were stopped in the middle of projects by Federal officials because the soil stayed wet longer than a week, Mr. Burger said. Yet they had been told by the state and local officials that the land was not wetlands.
The Congressman thought the regulations "should be much more uniform," he said.
Representative Hamilton Fish Jr., Republican of Millbrook, has not made up his mind on the issue, his staff members said.
 
The Differing Reactions
 The proposals have generally been criticized by environmental groups and praised by many landowners and developers.
Congress "is making it impossible to protect all but an insignificant portion of what we need to protect," Ms. Tessier said.
More than wildlife and vegetation are at stake, she said. Wetlands help filter out the pesticides that flow off lawns, the gasoline running off streets and other suburban and industrial pollutants common in Westchester, she said.
But turning down a business that wants to move to Westchester just to protect a field or small patch of woods hurts the economy, said Harold Vogt, president of the Westchester County Chamber of Commerce.
"The environment is the excuse for nongrowth advocates," he said.
 
An Issue With Post Office
 Wetlands, for example, are the issue now blocking plans by the United States Postal Service to build a regional mail-sorting plant next to the Westchester County Airport in Harrison. The Postal Service was taken to court by residents who objected to developing the land there because it is adjacent to a reservoir watershed.
To salvage the $10 million it has already spent on planning, the Postal Service is preparing a lengthy environmental-impact statement to support its contention that the new plant will not contribute to water pollution, said Raymond Murphy, field division general manager for the service. An environmental-impact study is also planned for a second possible site.
But meanwhile, plans to spend $90 million to build the mail-sorting plant are on hold indefinitely, Mr. Murphy said. "This is not any different than any business coming to Westchester" would experience, he added. "Everybody goes through this."
Three Levels of Protection
Although there is no firm figure on the total acreage in Westchester, the county's wetlands are protected by more than just the Federal and state programs. About 70 percent of Westchester's towns and villages protect wetlands, and even New York City extends its control into watershed lands in the county.
The state and local programs generally are not as stringent, however, as the Federal one, many officials agreed. And loosening Federal restrictions will put state and local laws at risk, some environmentalists suggested.

CIVIL WAR SECRETS
A secret Civil War military installation comparable to Alamagordo of World War II fame, now buried under more than a century's worth of debris, is the subject of a talk by Dr. Joel Grossman, Saturday at 8 P.M. The lecture is sponsored by the Putnam County Historical Society in Cold Spring. 
 Dr. Grossman, the head of Grossman Associates of Manhattan, historical archeologists, and his colleagues spent the last three years excavating and recording computer images of the R. P. Parrott gun-testing site of the West Point Foundry in Cold Spring. There, in a 700-by-1,500-foot building constructed in 1818, scientists from the United States and Europe lived during the 1860's while they developed the high-powered, long-distance rifled cannon, which is largely credited with winning the war for the Union.
Dr. Grossman said the current project is "part of a major effort by the Federal Environmental Protection Agency to identify, define and document significant archeological resources that might be eligible for the National Register of Historic Places." The excavation is taking place before the E.P.A. proceeds with Superfund cleanup efforts. The Cold Spring site, which is already on the National Register of Historic Places, is contaminated with cadmium and other heavy metals dumped there by the foundry.
The foundry is no longer there, and the testing site, which is in a valley, was built on in the early 1900's. The industrial buildings that were constructed there were later destroyed by fire. Changes in the water table near the area placed part of the Parrott site underwater, and excavators had to work under pneumatic domes. The ground had to be thawed during the winter months with 600,000 BTU heaters, and so-called rubber ducky suits had to be worn for protection from hazardous substances.
Almost none of the artifacts will be brought to the surface. "It is not the Government's purpose to dig things up, possibly destroying them in the process," said Dr. Grossman, "but to provide enough definition to reproduce them if necessary and to create a public record through advanced camera and computer technology." Remote sensing machines that "see" below the surface and underground maps pinpointed the site for the purpose of taking magnetic pictures.
The lecture will be given at the Foundry School Museum of the society at 63 Chestnut Street. Admission is free. Call 265-4010 for more information.
 
TALL TALES
 If your summer fish stories are not getting the reception they deserve, try them out at Trout Unlimited's September meeting this week. There will be no invited speaker. Instead, members and guests will have the evening free to regale each other with tales of fabulous lures, flies tied just right and fish eligible for the record books. There will also be fly-tying demonstrations, a fly-tying clinic and a discussion of fly patterns that work and those that fail.
The meeting is scheduled Tuesday at 7:30 P.M. in the Fox Lane Middle School, on Route 172 in Mount Kisco. There is no admission charge. For more information about the meeting or about Trout Unlimited, a national, nonprofit ecological organization, call 666-5727.
 
'ART OF MOVEMENT'
 George Rickey is a leading practitioner of sculpture that moves. Thirty of his stainless steel constructions go on display at the Katonah Museum of Art today through Nov. 3. Some were created recently; others have been lent from private and public collections worldwide.
"George Rickey: The Art of Movement," as the show is called, includes models for other larger sculptures, an indoor installation and outdoor works displayed in a tree-lined grove. Their parts do not collide, vibrate or bounce. They can be activated by a touch of the finger or by a breeze, but they can also withstand hurricane-force winds. A video presentation shows the artist at work in his studio, and a visit to his workshop will be conducted by Jill Snyder, the show's curator, on Oct. 5.
The museum, on Route 22 in Katonah, is open free of charge Tuesdays through Fridays, Sundays from 1 to 5 P.M. and Saturdays from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. For more information about the exhibition or the day trip to Mr. Rickey's studio, call 232-9555.
 
PLANTS AND HEALING
 Dr. James A. Duke is an economic botanist with the United States Department of Agriculture in Beltsville, Md. He has a recipe for Oncophobic Onion Soup, which he will share with the audience at a symposium called "Plants for Health and Healing: Their Role in Modern Medicine," to be held Saturday from 8:30 A.M. to 4:30 P.M. at the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx. Disease-fighting elements in foods that may prevent osteoporosis and heart attacks and reduce the incidence of breast cancer are the focus of his talk, titled "Food Farmacy."
Dr. Douglas C. Daly, of the Botanical Garden's Institute of Economic Botany, will talk about the search for new medicinal plants and his experiences in Central and South America with local curanderos, or herbal healers. Dr. Russell M. Jaffe, director of the Princeton Biocenter in Skillman, N.J., and Dr. Michael Weiner, an herbalist from Santa Monica, Calif., and author of 15 books on the subject, will discuss heightened interest in the medicinal properties of plants and the future of herbal medicine.
The symposium fee is $90, including handouts, a box lunch and parking. Call (212) 220-8720 for more information or reservations.
 
IN-FLIGHT MOVES
 Flying demonstrations by eagles, hawks and falcons and a spectacular aerial display by an Andean condor are the highlights of a benefit for the Hudson Valley Raptor Center in Rhinebeck. The event will begin at noon Saturday at Winley, an estate on Route 99 in Millbrook, and continue until 5 P.M.
Experts from the center and area naturalists and biologists will lecture and answer questions about birds of prey, many of which are on the endangered species list. The center is licensed to care for injured raptors by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the state's Department of Environmental Conservation.
There will be book signings by Dean Amadon, ornithologist from the American Museum of Natural History, and by other authors of books about raptors. There will also be an exhibition of birds of prey in art. Prints by Roger Bateman, Roger Tory Peterson and other nationally known wildlife artists will be raffled off or put up for bid in a silent auction.
Admission will be by donation of $25 and $12.50 for students and the elderly. Each adult may bring one child free of charge. Call 876-2106 for directions or more information.
 
A MARIONETTE CIRCUS
 The Bennington Marionettes touring company will take its life-size characters to the Yorktown Performing Arts Theater Saturday at 1 P.M. in a performance of "The Sorcerer's Circus."
The original story by Cedrick Flower, who directs the troupe, concerns the troubles of an aged, once famous sorcerer who has lost much of his ability to make magic. Having turned himself into a tree, he is unable to change back again, until a little boy and his dog, lost in the forest, come upon him, help him regain his powers and restore him to human form. As a reward for their assistance, he conjures up an old-fashioned circus that performes exclusively for the boy and his dog.
There is music by Dmitri Kabelevsky and Paul Dukas, and the show is performed by 15 hand-crafted, elaborately costumed marionettes. Tickets are $7 and can be reserved by calling 961-6665 or 962-0601. The theater is at 1974 Commerce Street in Yorktown Heights.

Is the Life Back in Tokyo's Market?

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
After a stock market decline of more than 45 percent over a year and three-quarters and in the face of an economic slowdown that is now worrying business leaders, some analysts are seeing some real opportunity -- and some life -- in the Tokyo stock market.
Although many people have had their investments in Japanese stocks run aground, there are arguments for re-entering these treacherous waters. 
 One is that the signs of an economic slowdown seem to be so clear that the Bank of Japan will have to move to cut short-term interest rates. The reduction on Friday of the discount rate to 5 percent by the Federal Reserve in the United States should make it a little easier for the Bank of Japan to make a move.
And the fall in the stock market in the last 21 months has made many stocks in Japan -- which have long seemed very expensive -- look fairly priced or even undervalued.
Counsellors International Equity Fund, which is managed by Warburg, Pincus Counsellors Inc. in New York, is beginning to increase its holdings in the Japanese market. In just the last two weeks, the portion of the fund's portfolio that is invested in Japanese stocks has risen to 28 percent from 24 percent. The manager of the $67 million fund, Richard H. King, said the percentage would grow. "I am pretty confident that if one buys a Hitachi or a Sumitomo Realty today, a year from now one will have made decent money," he said.
Akira Suzuki, chief strategist in Tokyo for Morgan Stanley & Company, said: "This is the best opportunity in the market in many years. Lower interest rates and bad economic numbers create a high stock market."
But both analysts also sound notes of caution. Mr. King said there was still a chance for a 10 percent sell-off in the Tokyo market. And Mr. Suzuki is concerned about the fragile condition of the economy and the financial system, and this is why he insists that the Bank of Japan must act quickly to cut interest rates. But the bank could wait too long.
Short-term rates, Mr. Suzuki said, need to be cut aggressively or the the stock market will not rally, the economy will continue to slide and land prices will not rise. Without higher stock prices and higher land prices, he argued, borrowers will not have the funds they need to pay off bank loans, and banks will not have the money they need to continue their lending.
Michael Metz, chief market strategist at Oppenheimer & Company, is not optimistic. He has been telling his clients that the Tokyo market, where the Nikkei index of 225 leading stocks closed at 23,134.43 on Friday, might fall through 20,000, and "a target of 18,500 is reasonable."
He said the danger of such a decline would persist for the next four to six weeks. "We are building to a significant bottom or a cascading down," he said. "If it does not happen in the next six weeks, it does not happen."
Mr. Metz's worries include what Mr. Suzuki said Tokyo traders have called "the four trillion yen anxiety." This is the rough total of immediate selling pressure that some analysts feel could fall on the stock market.
Among the sources of the selling pressure are the huge margin accounts that have limited holding periods, which might force investors to sell their stocks. In addition, there are fears that investment trusts will be redeemed because of the fall in the market and that other special funds that have lost favor will be closed.
And some companies need to raise money in the stock market to pay off bonds issued in combination with warrants on company stock. Because the stock market has tumbled, the buyers of the bonds will not convert the warrants to stock. Therefore, companies have to come up with the cash to pay off the bonds.
Mr. Metz also argued that recent scandals have undermined confidence in the market and that the four giant brokerage houses in Japan are no longer "in a position to manipulate the market as they once were." And the outlook for corporate profits, as the economy slows, is worsening.
But on Friday there were some signs of life in the Tokyo market and an indication that some of the anxieties may be diminishing. One worry was that closing out September futures contracts on Friday would lead to massive selling. But it did not happen. Instead the Nikkei 225 rose 604.23 points, or 2.68 percent, on a volume of 1.2 billion shares, far above the recent turnover of around 300 million shares.
Mr. King and Mr. Suzuki contend the selling pressure will not be as great as some people fear. People will not sell aggressively from funds because they are not eager to sustain losses. And companies can meet some of their bond payments by borrowing from insurance companies and cutting capital spending, which is already declining.
But the optimism still depends, almost solely, on interest-rate cuts. Earlier this year, analysts were also hoping for a reduction in rates to spur the market higher. Yet when the Bank of Japan did reduce the official discount rate on July 1, the stock market did not rally. In fact, it is now 4 percent below its close on July 1.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
If Banks Don't Lend, Credit Is Not Easy

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
Blame it on Friday the 13th. Stock traders got almost everything they claimed to want: a discount rate cut, good inflation numbers and soaring bond prices. But instead of going on a buying spree, they sold, and the Dow Jones industrial average lost 22 points on Friday.
Two possible explanations come to mind. One is the old Wall Street cliche: buy on the rumor, sell on the news. The reduction in the discount rate to 5 percent was widely anticipated, and a number of traders seem to have bought stocks planning to sell them when others rushed to buy on the news. That rush did not materialize, so they sold anyway. And within a few minutes, the bond rally also began to fade. 
 The other explanation is based less on trading strategies and more on an examination of why the Fed is, once again, easing credit. It is not to make life easier for bond traders, a group whose popularity in Washington is not at a high. The Fed, to put it bluntly, is trying to jump start the economy.
Unfortunately, the Fed's batteries appear to be no stronger than its surveillance of Treasury bond auctions. The big moves in the economy -- down last fall and up this spring -- can be traced to sentiment about the Persian Gulf war. The three previous discount rate cuts seem to have had minimal impact.
Those who doubt the Fed's power must contend with history. This is the sixth time since World War II that the Fed has made four consecutive cuts in the discount rate. On average, the Dow has risen 29 percent in the following year, notes Richard Eakle, a technical analyst who runs Eakle Associates.
In 1981 and 1982, the Fed cut the discount rate -- the rate at which it will lend to banks -- nine times, lowering it from 14 percent to 8.5 percent. Seven of those cuts came before the recession ended, but it did end, and the ensuing recovery was a strong one that lasted almost eight years.
With that record, the burden of proof is on those who argue that the Fed's efforts to start a recovery this year will fail. Their argument basically is that this downturn reflects the turning of the credit cycle. The boom left the country with too many office buildings and too few good loans. It will take years to work off the office supply; it may take a generation for the bankers to be so generous again to those who really need the money.
If the pessimists are right, then the fact that the banks cut their prime rates on Friday may mean that they now will not lend money at 8 percent instead of not lending at 8.5 percent.
Lower interest rates help those who are creditworthy and want to borrow money. These days, that is a very small group. Lower rates hurt those who live on interest income -- a lot of consumers among them -- and do nothing for those who are not allowed to borrow. Wall Street has assumed lower rates would be enough to provide a powerful boost for the economy and for corporate profits. Now that faith in the Fed's powers may be starting to fade.

Treasury's Troubled Auctions

 BODY:
The United States Treasury's auction process is fundamentally flawed, says Merton H. Miller, a finance professor at the University of Chicago and a winner of last year's Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science.
His chief objection is its "discriminatory price" auction system, in which Salomon Brothers became ensnared. In that system, bidders willing to take a lower interest rate get their bids filled first, at that rate. Runner-up bids are filled at their rate, on a prorated basis if necessary. A single purchaser is limited to 35 percent of an issue. 
 A better approach, he argues, would be a "Dutch auction," in which all the securities are sold at one price -- the best bid at which the whole issue can be sold. Last week, Professor Miller outlined other lessons he sees in the Salomon Brothers scandal.
Question: When you look at the Treasury market as an economist, what strikes you?
Mr. Miller: First, that the auction arrangements are so peculiar. The Treasury is still doing these discriminatory-price auctions, with all their flaws, flying in the face of the theories that say they are not gaining anything by doing it this way. Secondly, what kind of auction is it where you have to ration how much people get? Anytime an economist sees rationing, he knows something is wrong.
Q. But market participants defend the current system, don't they?
A. People are just comfortable with it. Until the Salomon thing, their attitude has been, if it ain't broke, why fix it? But it is  broken. It is an affront to good economics.
Q. You referred to rationing -- the 35 percent limit. How would you deal with that?
A. When anyone overbids, the Treasury should call their bluff by saying, 'You bid for an extra billion? O.K., it's yours.'
Q. You mean, just keep issuing debt until all the bids are filled?
A. Yes -- but you don't have to actually do it. You just have to threaten to do it! Then you don't have to worry about phony bids.
Q. Treasury officials hinted last week that they are considering a switch to a Dutch auction. What effect would that have?
 A. People will shave their bids down. They'll bid differently in a Dutch auction. In this discriminatory-price auction they use, there is a premium in knowing what other people are going to bid. If you bid too high, you might win and get more than you want, and if you bid too low, you won't get what you want. All of that is eliminated if you use the Dutch auction. You just bid what you think it's worth. You wouldn't need all this discussion beforehand about other people's bids.
Q. So those pre-auction discussions among bidders are, in your view, just an outgrowth of the way the auction is conducted?
A. Exactly! Because of the way the auction is done, you're under tremendous pressure to bid right. If you bid wrong, it can be very costly. With the Dutch auction, you're not so vulnerable to being "gamed" by other people's bids.
m
Q. Can economists say which of these auction methods is best?
A. There is a remarkable theory by William S. Vickrey, who was for many years on the economics faculty at Columbia University, that showed that the revenue to the seller, on average, is the same under all auction methods. So if the revenues are the same regardless of method, you can start to worry about the second-order aspects of these auctions. The Dutch auction simplifies the bidding, it's less costly and it's less prone to manipulative schemes. So, in that sense, it's better.
Q. But some primary dealers responded to the Treasury's trial balloon last week by saying that nobody will bid for these bonds at a Dutch auction. Are they wrong?
A. People who say that just don't understand the logic of markets. If you're selling a product that people want, they'll buy it. And if they don't want it, not all the manipulation in your power can make them buy it.
Q. But doesn't the Treasury need a mechanism to protect it in case people do not want to buy as much debt as it has to sell?
A. That's the argument they always use -- that change would destroy the market. We heard the same thing on Wall Street when people proposed ending the fixed commission system. Economists said it would not destroy the market, and people said, "How can you be so sure?" And we said, a market is a market. The laws of supply and demand work, regardless of the specific context you are given. The only reason I can be sure that the bond market won't disappear is that, in other markets, when you do things like this, the market doesn't disappear.
Q. The political and regulatory machinery is grinding ahead, with promises of tighter supervision and tougher rules. What do you think of the steps so far?
A. Not much. It's like saying, "Take two aspirin and call me in the morning." The Treasury is still captured by this view that we can't tamper with the world's most important market. All that tells me is that they don't really trust markets. And why should they? They're all bureaucrats.
Q. What's the worst thing that could be done, in your view?
A. No matter how bad you imagine something, Congress can make it worse. What I fear is more paper sent to Washington, more examiners coming from Washington, more expense both ways, and the actual economics of the situation won't change one bit. But that's considered progress in Washington.

Mr. Walsh Takes the Field for Tenneco

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES

DATELINE: DALLAS

 BODY:
Three decades after Michael H. Walsh dislocated both shoulders while charging into opposing linemen as a running back on the football team at Stanford University, he still likes to meet challenges head-on.
Tenneco Inc. rushed Mr. Walsh's planned appointment as president ahead by three weeks so that he could deliver a harsh message last week directly to Wall Street analysts. Hurt by its faltering J. I. Case farm and construction machinery unit, Tenneco would pare its yearly dividend in half, sell assets valued at $1.05 billion and slash capital spending and operating costs by a combined $500 million, Mr. Walsh said. 
 The news came 10 days after Mr. Walsh arrived at the Houston-based Tenneco from the Union Pacific Railroad, where he had been chairman and chief executive for five years. He will replace James L. Ketelsen, 60, as Tenneco's chief executive in January and as chairman next May. The president's position had been vacant.
Mr. Walsh, a Yale Law School graduate and a former United States Attorney in Southern California, learned about global business while running the worldwide manufacturing operations of Cummins Engine before moving to Union Pacific.
Now 49 years old, he posted 23 consecutive quarters of rising earnings at Union Pacific, thinning layers of management and emphasizing sales and service. He gave no signal last week as to which of Tenneco's six operating divisions would take the brunt of his initial cost cutting. The company has 92,000 employees in 33 countries.
The likely candidate is Case, a global maker of tractors, backhoes and other heavy equipment, with 25,000 employees. Case contributed 32 percent of Tenneco's $6.8 billion in sales in the first half of the year. But a $270 million loss at the division during that period ate up the company's profits, producing an overall loss of $13 million, and probably accelerated the early retirement that Mr. Ketelsen, Tenneco's leader since 1978, had planned. Case could wind up losing more than $1 billion this year, analysts said.
Another problem is Tenneco's shipyard in Newport News, Va., the world's largest. That division builds and restores aircraft carriers and submarines. It is expected to post steady earnings into 1994, but orders could fade if Washington further cuts Pentagon spending.
Tenneco's other operations in auto parts, packaging, chemicals and natural-gas pipelines had slumping earnings in the first half, but are expected to rebound with the economy. Yet heavy debt payments take a big bite from earnings, so Mr. Walsh must decide whether to keep the conglomerate intact, or auction one or more divisions to pare the debt.
"It really goes back to defining what is Tenneco," said Eli S. Lustgarten, an analyst at Paine Webber Inc.

Sympathy, But Not Credence, as Clark Clifford Explains 

It was a curious defense for a lawyer of such immense stature as Clark Clifford. Mr. Clifford, who has advised every Democratic President since Harry Truman and is a former Secretary of Defense, told the House Banking Committee last week that he had been duped by the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. Mr. Clifford was chairman of First American Bankshares, one of the banks secretly -- and illegally -- owned by B.C.C.I., but he said he did not know that. The Committee was skeptical. B.C.C.I. was a client of Mr. Clifford's law firm for more than a decade. It lent him millions of dollars to buy First American's stock. And there was a memorandum from Mr. Clifford to B.C.C.I.'s chairman warning that First American's link to B.C.C.I. could come to light. "My heart wants to believe you," said Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat who is a member of the commitee (page 11). "But my head says 'No.' "
 
An Ill Wind for American Air
 
As part of his lesson on airline economics, Robert L. Crandall, chairman of American Airlines, told analysts the carrier would cut its aggressive expansion plans. American had planned to spend $21 billion over the next five years with $14.9 billion earmarked for new planes. The airline will still spend, just not as much. The problem, said Mr. Crandall, is that 25 percent of the nation's airline capacity is operated by bankrupt or nearly-bankrupt carriers. The weakened carriers cut fares and offer discounts just to fill seats, pressuring the strong carriers to do the same. Profits tumble. American lost $185.3 million in the first half on revenues of $5.96 billion. Analysts generally agreed with Mr. Crandall's strategy. "Prudent," was the word used by Julius Maldutis of Salomon Brothers Inc.
 
Armani for the Masses?
 
Giorgio Armani is best known for the stylish, soft-shouldered suits and draping dresses he designs in his studio in Milan. Men's suits go for $2,000 and up and the dresses can cost even more. But now Mr. Armani is making a bid to clothe the proletariat. Last week he announced plans to open a chain of about 200 shops. The stores will be called A/X: Armani Exchange. They will stock casual clothes with each item costing $100 or less. The question Seventh Avenue wants answered is this: Will the new lines bring down the value of pricier Armani designs? "People are not going to give up dressing expensively," Mr. Armani said.
 
A Mainframe With a Difference
 
When it comes to its mainframe businsess, the International Business Machines Corporation gets a lot of scrutiny. Those big beasts account for half of I.B.M.'s profits. Last week, when I.B.M. announced its new System/390 series, they were touted as different from anything I.B.M. had offered in the past. They are faster. But they are also more open than other I.B.M. mainframes. And, after years of complaints from its customers, Big Blue decided to listen. It designed the machines to run Unix programs.
 
The Salomon Victims
 
Bond trading is what mathematicians call a zero-sum game. For every winner there has to be a loser. That logic also applies to the scandal surrounding Salomon Brothers Inc., whose every illegal gain inflicted a loss on someone else. Last week, while naming no names, the Big Board said two firms lost millions due to Salomon's manipulation of the market. It did not name the firms. It also said several traders lost their jobs. Once it is determined how much Sal-
omon won illegally, it is believed the Government will ask it to forfeit that money.
 
Paul Mozer, who was head of the government trading desk at Salomon Brothers Inc., is catching most of the heat from the scandal. But Mr. Mozer also made a lot of money. According to Salomon, Mr. Mozer's compensation topped $10 million over the last three years.
 
Out of Focus at Tenneco
 
Lately, Tenneco Inc., which had $14.5 billion in sales last year, has been losing a lot of money. Its biggest problem is its J. I. Case farm and construction equipment unit. It had losses in 5 of the last 10 years. This year its tractors and earth movers could push $1 billion into Tenneco's loss column. To offset those losses Tenneco announced last week that it would sell $1.05 billion in assets. A chemical plant in La Porte, Tex., is on the block, along with a lubrication company owned by Case, three short-line railroads, a gold mining operation and some timberland. That leaves Tenneco -- one of the few companies that never seemed to care about "synergy" -- with shipbuilding, auto parts, gas pipelines and -- yes -- J. I. Case. The sales, the company said, will help it focus its businesses. That may take a while.
 
Merck Workers Have to Wait
 
Merck & Company's stock has been a high flier for years. Now the company is letting its employees in on the action. Each of Merck's 37,000 employees is getting a one-time option to buy 100 shares of its common stock at $127.25 a share -- about $3 below current prices. Employees can sell their options or keep them. If the stock goes up, employees can exercise the options, buy the stock and simultaneously sell it at a profit. But there is a catch: the options cannot be exercised until Sept. 6, 1996.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
Off the Gravy Train for Castro
 
For more than 30 years, the Soviet Union has bankrolled Cuba. Last week in Moscow, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d that that will soon stop. Mr. Gorbachev said Soviet aid to Cuba -- roughly $2 billion a year -- will be replaced by economic relations on a strictly free-trade basis. The curtailment is likely to cripple Cuba's economy. Mr. Gorbachev also said the Soviet Union will pull out its 11,000 military personnel from Cuba. Left unsaid were the concessions to the Soviet Union that the United States would make in return for cutting Cuba loose.
 
It's Bush Vs. Israel's Lobby
 
Last week President Bush got tough with Israel. With a breakthrough in the peace process close at hand, he said, a contentious debate on Capitol Hill about Israel's request for $10 billion in loan guarantees to help it settle its Soviet immigrants "would raise a host of controversial issues." Those issues, "could well destroy our ability to bring one or more parties to the peace table," Mr. Bush said. But Israel's supporters argued that Israel's request is humanitarian and separate from the peace talks. The contentious debate Mr. Bush feared has already begun as Israel's friends began to walk Congress' halls.
 
Target: Computer Cunning
 
The world may be a more peaceful place now that the Cold War is over, but the Administration still frets about the spread of high-tech weaponry. So the Pentagon has proposed a strict new set of controls on exports of computing equipment. Some products the Pentagon wants to keep at home. It wants others to be equipped with attachments that monitor their use. The computer industry has vowed to lobby against the proposals.
 
 
 
THE ECONOMY

 
When the Low Price Is Right
 
Producer prices have barely budged this year. Most industries have kept their prices flat or let them creep down to lure customers back to the stores and showrooms. Only Detroit has been brazen enough to raise prices in the face of few buyers. According to the Labor Department's Producer Price Index, prices in August rose by a slim 0.2 percent.
 
The Fed's Twin Enemies
 
The Federal Reserve, not the bravest of institutions, would rather not fight two enemies at once. So last week, when news of inflation's busted jaw finally reached the Fed, it figured it could take on the recession. The Fed lowered the discount rate half a percentage point, from 5.5 percent to 5 percent. The discount rate, the amount commercial banks are charged for short-term loans, is the Fed's big lever. By cutting it the Fed is making it easier for banks and their customers to borrow. That prods growth. Morgan Guaranty was quick to follow the Fed. It dropped its prime rate from 8.5 percent to 8. Soon, growth may feel confident enough to show its face.
 
The Antiquated Auctions
 
Bids in the $117 billion market for Treasury bonds are still written on paper and placed in wooden boxes by runners minutes before the auction begins. Last week, the Treasury Department decided 200 years of quaint tradition would have to end. It announced new procedures designed to make it harder to subvert the rules. The measures include using computers for the bidding and demanding written verification from customers of large winning bids to guarantee their authenticity (Salomon Brothers Inc. admitted placing bids in the names of customers. These new measures may be followed by others. But will new procedures stop people from abusing a market as plump with profits as this one?
 
Consumers Shy Away From Debt
 
To economists, debts are claims against future earnings. From that perspective, running up debt means consumers have confidence in the future. They think they will be employed and earning enough to pay back all their loans. But last week the Federal Reserve Board said consumer credit fell by 1.4 percent in July -- the seventh decline in the last eight months. Such a significant decline signals continued wariness about the future.
 
Subduing Inflation
 
Inflation may not be completely tamed, but at least it has lost its churlishness. Last month, according to the Labor Department, the Consumer Price Index rose by 0.2 percent, the same as in June and July. That puts the annual inflation rate at 2.7 percent -- less than the rate in Germany and Japan.

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds;
Getting In on the Latin Boom

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
Forget Eastern Europe. The sizzling area for foreign investment in 1991 is Latin America.
The prices of some funds have more than doubled since the beginning of the year. Through Sept. 6, the Brazil Fund was up 150 percent, for example, and the Chile Fund rose 105 percent, according to Thomas J. Herzfeld, who specializes in closed-end fund investment and analysis. That compares with a gain of 32.8 percent in the Herzfeld single-country fund average, an index of 20 funds. Closed-end funds issue a fixed number of shares that trade on stock exchanges. 
 One new closed-end fund -- the Argentina Fund -- is in the works, and some large fund groups are said to be exploring mutual funds specializing in the region. Last month, in fact, GT Capital Management in San Francisco started the GT Latin America Fund and Merrill Lynch announced its Latin America Fund. Both invest in Latin American stocks and debt.
Analysts say investors' improving perception of Latin America's risk is one reason for the region's recent success. Investors are also encouraged by the trends toward privatization, fiscal discipline and democracy. Then there are the opening of Latin equity markets to foreign investment and Mexico's possible participation in a proposed North American Free Trade Agreement.
Nevertheless, most of the good news is probably reflected already in the prices of the Latin America country funds, which have risen an average of 106.7 percent this year. The biggest winner is the Latin America Investment Fund, whose shares rose 150.6 percent through Sept. 6.
What is more, most of the attractive discounts that the country funds sported at the beginning of the year have narrowed or disappeared. Because prices of closed-end funds are set by supply and demand, the funds can trade at more or less than the value of the securities in their portfolios -- the net asset value of each share.
While prices for closed-end-fund shares are listed daily in the tables of the New York Stock Exchange, the net asset value is published once a week, usually on Wednesday or Saturday, depending on the type of fund. These tables allow the investor to determine if a fund is trading at a premium or discount to its net asset value.
Among Latin funds, the Latin America Investment Fund's 23 percent discount and the Mexico Fund's 20 percent discount in January have both disappeared.
Where does this leave investors who are interested in the region? First, they should understand that country funds are the most volatile sector of the closed-end fund industry.
Indeed, this year's rally follows a miserable year for country funds in 1990, when the Herzfeld average dropped 32.7 percent -- roughly five times more than the decline of the average stock fund, which lost 6.3 percent. The bottom line: country funds are for speculative investors and people who want to fill the high-risk part of their portfolios.
Despite the recent surge of Latin American funds, some advisers say there is still a place for long-term investors. "The prospects are still positive for the region," said Michael T. Porter, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. He expects a number of national economies to "produce growth rates in the 5 to 6 percent range."
Mr. Herzfeld said "Latin America looks like a great opportunity." But he added, "Investors should remember that the region has a history of boom-bust cycles and surprises -- mostly unpleasant ones."
Right now, Mr. Porter recommends the Chile Fund, which was trading earlier this week at a discount of 15 percent, and the Emerging Mexico Fund, with a discount of roughly 8 percent. He also likes the Mexico Equity and Income Fund, which divides its portfolio between stocks and bonds. The fixed-income component makes the fund less risky than a pure stock play, he says.
W. Douglas Dent, who edits the Capiello Closed-End Fund Digest in Santa Barbara, Calif., likes the Latin America Investment Fund because its diversification among various countries reduces investment risk. But he recommended buying only when the fund's premium is below 5 percent.
Mr. Herzfeld advises buying Latin American closed-end funds when they have discounts of 10 percent to 15 percent.
What about the Latin America mutual funds? Experts say closed-end funds are a more efficient way to invest in illiquid markets like Latin America because managers of closed-end funds do not have to worry that investors may redeem their shares. For its part, GT says it will initially keep 46 percent of assets in Mexico, the most liquid of the markets it invests in.
The two new mutual funds are not cheap. GT's version has a 4.75 percent sales charge. Merrill Lynch investors choose either a 4 percent upfront sales charge with an ongoing fee of a quarter of 1 percent, or a 1 percent fee plus a contingent deferred sales charge of 4 percent on shares sold within a year of purchase, declining one percentage point a year until it disappears. To discourage short-term trading, Merrill also levies a 2 percent fee on shares sold within 12 months.

HEADLINE: The Executive Computer;
An Economical Time for Improving Your Memory

BYLINE: By Peter H. Lewis

 BODY:
New software operating systems like Microsoft Windows 3.0 and Apple System 7.0 demand large amounts of system memory, especially if the machine will be running complex business applications. Luckily, memory prices are at their lowest point in, well, memory. I recently added eight megabytes of random access memory to my elderly Macintosh, and the price worked out to be $39 a megabyte. In the days of the Great Memory Drought of 1988, a megabyte cost 10 times as much.
Memory prices soared that year because semiconductor companies were closing their 256-kilobit chip production facilities and retooling to produce the more efficient 1-megabit chips. Because almost every company shifted at the same time, supplies of 256Kb chips dried up before 1Mb chips reached the market in quantity. 
 Now, the chip industry is again in the process of shifting technologies, this time from 1-megabit chips to more efficient 4-megabit chips. "It could create a bit of a stir," said Mike Frost, president of Technology Works Inc. of Austin, Tex., one of the largest suppliers of add-on memory products for Macintosh, PC and PS/2 computers. "But there's too much supply out there to create the same thing that happened in 1988."
Mr. Frost said he recalled when the market price for a single 1-megabit chip reached $42 in 1988. In the bits-and-bytes world of computer memory, it takes eight or sometimes nine 1-megabit chips to produce 1 megabyte of system memory -- eight bits per byte, and sometimes one more to control the others -- so the cost per megabyte of memory was roughly $378. In contrast, he said, the market price for a 1-megabit chip today is $3.75, or $33.75 per megabyte.
Kipp A. Bedard, vice president of Micron Technology Inc., which is based in Boise, Idaho, and is the only American company to make and sell memory chips, agreed there might be an increase in chip prices because "supply will migrate away from the old-generation chips, making the older 1-megabyte chips more expensive to get."
Although Japanese companies dominate the advanced memory chip business, it appears that South Korean companies, including Samsung, Gold Star and Hyundai, are the driving force in commodity memory chips. "We haven't seen the aggressive shift from one generation to the next that we saw in 1988," Mr. Bedard said. "It's more of a gradual, graceful shift, allowing manufacturers like Micron to better meet customer needs."
Aiding the smoother transition is the fact that 4-megabit chips are the same size and have the same pin configuration as the 1-megabit chips they ultimately will replace.
Many computer companies are designing their models to be able to use memory packaged in modular units called single in-line memory modules, which makes it much easier to add memory to a system. Early computers required the user to plug in memory a chip at a time, which was daunting to casual computer users. Now, memory chips are arrayed on a slim circuit board about the size of a flattened cigarette. The modules typically come in 256-kilobyte, 1-megabyte or 4-megabyte "sticks," and a few companies are offering bulkier 16-megabyte modules as well, using banks of 4-megabit chips.
Some chip makers, including Micron, Hitachi and the International Business Machines Corporation, are already producing 16-megabit chips in limited quantities (all I.B.M.'s production is used internally). When the 16-megabit chips arrive en masse in late 1992 or early 1993, some personal computers could be expanded to hundreds of megabytes of random access memory. A decade ago, the first I.B.M. PC's came with 64 kilobytes of memory (it takes 1,024 kilobytes to make 1 megabyte).
Who needs all those megabytes of RAM? In general, the most memory hungry users are those who work with computer-aided design, electronic publishing, scientific modeling or other graphically intensive tasks. And the introduction of graphical user interfaces, like Windows, System 7 and OS/2, add to the memory burden by permitting users to hold several different applications in memory at once.
Adding to the demand is the feature inflation of new business applications, which are swelling with every new release and consuming memory voraciously. Keeping several memory-hungry applications in readiness at the same time, along with the memory overhead required by the operating system itself, requires lots of RAM.
Several computer makers now consider 4 megabytes of RAM a minimum configuration. Experience suggests that 5 is better, and 8 is better still.
It is a relatively simple procedure to open the computer case, find the memory slots and snap the modules into place. Because chips are extremely susceptible to damage from static electricity, though, it is important to be careful handling them. Some computer stores carry inexpensive wrist straps that connect to a grounding source, like the metal plate around the PC's power supply.
The most common ways to get more memory are to buy it from a dealer or through a direct-sales outlet, like Technology Works (800 897-9739). Starting this week, Technology Works will be selling memory modules in CompUSA discount stores.
The modules "have been available in a number of the, shall we say, nerdier computer stores, like Fryes Electronics in California, but in terms of widespread availability of memory, this is new," said Dean A. McCarron, vice president of technology for In-stat Inc., a semiconductor industry market research company in Scottsdale, Ariz.
Several major personal computer makers, including I.B.M., already make computers that can be upgraded by replacing the central microprocessor. The Compaq Computer Corporation of Houston is expected to introduce such a system this week.
Business customers can also expect to see new forms for computer memory in coming months, especially for palmtop and notebook portable systems. Several companies are planning to use a new generation of memory cards called IC DRAM's (for integrated circuit dynamic random access memory), which are about the size of a credit card but thicker.
From 1 to 8 megabytes of memory chips are encased in the IC DRAM card, which can be inserted into a slot on the outside of the computer, just as one would insert a floppy diskette; in other words, the user does not have to open the case to add memory. Prices for 1-megabyte IC DRAM's are expected to be higher than for internal modules; the 8-megabyte IC DRAM's and modules are expected to be comparably priced.
In the end, more memory is the key to making computers easier to use. "The more friendly the new operating systems and applications are, the more they do behind scenes," said Mr. Bedard of Micron Technology.

HEADLINE: Managing;
Rewarding Employees for 'Wellness'

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
At Mesa Limited Partnership, T. Boone Pickens' Dallas oil company, employees who take no sick days, file no medical claims, clock in at a decent weight, blood pressure and cholesterol level and exercise at least 13 times a month can make up to $354 extra a year. "Boone understands money as a motivator, and he'd rather motivate people to be healthy than sick," said John A. Durkin, Mesa's fitness manager.
Atco Properties and Management Inc. pays $500 to employees who climb 16 flights to their Manhattan real estate offices every day for a year. (Atco takes their word for it.) Overweight workers get $10 for every pound they lose ($100 a pound for senior staff), and smokers who quit get $500. "I may up the ante to a Caribbean vacation to get our last two smokers to stop," said H. Dale Hemmerdinger, Atco's president. 
 For some time now companies have been paying for weight-loss programs, stress management seminars and other so-called wellness programs for their employees. Yet the corporate landscape remains dotted with overweight, stressed-out smokers with cholesterol-choked arteries. The reason: "Without incentives for life-style changes, employees gain the weight back or start smoking again," said Jesse Bernstein, president of Employee Assistance Associates Inc., a consulting firm in Ann Arbor, Mich.
Slowly, employers are catching on to that fact. A recent study by the Philaldephia consulting firm Hay/Huggins shows that a small but growing number of companies are "making it financially worthwhile for employees to stay well," said Michael Carter, a Hay/Huggins senior vice president.
Many companies, including the Bank of Delaware and U-Haul International Inc., shave the cost of insurance or deductibles for employees who exercise, quit smoking and the like. Others, including Johnson & Johnson and Baker Hughes Inc., will provide a better benefits package for employees who demonstrate healthy habits. Still others, including the Adolph Coors Company and the Control Data Corporation, pay $10,000 more in death benefits if an employee killed in a car accident was wearing a seat belt.
Such programs are new, so no one has calculated their cost or quantified their impact. But incentives rarely amount to more than a few hundred dollars per employee, and that sum can be easily recouped if absenteeism and medical claims are reduced.
Companies vary widely in what they will reward. Some reward the process -- say, exercising. Others hold out for results, like weight loss. Still others only give bonuses to employees who have reached, for example, an ideal weight or cholesterol count.
Johnson & Johnson and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Michigan are in the process camp. Johnson & Johnson's employees can rack up "Live for Life" dollars, play money that is exchangeable for such items as socks or sweatshirts, for exercising a set amount. The New Brunswick, N.J., company once offered five Live for Life dollars, worth about 50 cents in real terms, to employees who had their blood pressure checked.
Employees in Blue Cross's walking club get a water bottle after they have clocked 35 miles; 100 miles gets a towel, 500 miles a fanny pack, and so on, until the grand prize of a jacket, for 1,000 miles. Every additional 100 miles yields a bar for the jacket.
"Walking is easy, it's safe, so why not give them a little incentive to get into the habit?" asked Dorothy I. Kellerman, who coordinates the employee wellness programs.
The answer, say proponents of pay-for-results, is that habits can be broken and are almost impossible to monitor.
To qualify for a wellness bonus at the Sara Lee Corporation's Superior Coffee and Foods unit in Bensenville, Ill., employees take annual blood tests for anemia, thyroid function and the like. People judged to be in excellent health get $200 to spend for wellness-related items like joining a health club.
"This provides early detection of medical problems, and lets employees choose their own route to health," said Vincent P. Pellettiere, director of human resources.
Companies are usually flexible in defining that "route." Coors employees who suffer from stress qualify for a lowered co-payment by taking a vacation. "Wellness is a broad concept, so we allow a lot of latitude," said Lynn Gilfillan, community wellness representative for the Golden, Colo. brewery.
Similarly, Johnson & Johnson's employees get more benefits if, say, they wear seat belts, or promise to talk to their children about drugs and alcohol. The company accepts an employee's word for both.
"To lie about health, they have to think about health, and that may prod them to do something about it," said Melvin L. Benjamin, director of work and family.
 
 
 
PAYING THE PRICE FOR BEING BAD
 Most companies prefer to dangle a carrot in front of people who demonstrate healthy habits. A few prefer to shake a stick at those who don't.
The Turner Broadcasting Company refuses to hire smokers. Texas Instruments, Baker Hughes and U-Haul International charge smokers more for medical insurance. U-Haul takes a few extra dollars from employees who are 20 percent heavier than what is medically considered to be ideal weight.
More companies are poised to take the punitive approach. Next year, Control Data will charge smokers more for medical and life insurance. A smoker must be off cigarettes for a year before the surcharge is removed.
"Enough has been written about smoking and health so that no one can really object to this kind of life-style premium," said Michael E. Kotten, director of employee benefits.

HEADLINE: With Government Growing, More Spending Won't End Deficit

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Tom Wicker proposes in "Investing in America" (column, Aug. 18) massive Government spending on infrastructure and the return of more Federal money to states and localities in the name of pump priming. Mr. Wicker seems to have fallen for the misguided claim that the 1980's witnessed some sort of rollback in the size of government. Nothing could be further from the truth. 
 Before he advances his spend, spend, spend philosophy any more, he might want to note that Government spending increased faster under Ronald Reagan than under Jimmy Carter. For all Mr. Reagan's laissez-faire rhetoric, he failed to tame our Government run amok; he simply replaced stupid tax-and-spend policies with stupid borrow-and-spend policies. Our Government now consumes more than one-quarter of everything produced in this country.
Mr. Wicker suggests we ignore the "vastly overrated" budget deficit. This would be criminally impossible. As long as we pile up massive deficits, our economy will never become competitive and we will never control inflation. What is our national debt -- $3 trillion, $4 trillion? Why not $10 trillion? The numbers are surreal. What is very real is the more than $300 billion we must spend each year to service this mountain of red ink.
Nicholas Leman, author of "The Promised Land," hardly a conservative Republican, reckons that an effective antipoverty program for our inner cities would require $50 billion a year. This is one-sixth of what we spend on interest on the debt.
Indeed, this mountain of debt, which raises interest rates and inflation and sucks investment from the productive sectors of the economy, is a primary reason behind the lower growth rate of the 1980's relative to the 1960's. Also in the 1980's we did not get bogged down in an inflationary Vietnam War.
Finally, why does Mr. Wicker assume that uncontrollable spending and overdependence on an ever-expanding Government are permanent features of the American condition? They need not be. We might consider whether or not we wish to remain, as Alexis de Tocqueville warned we might, in a state of "perpetual childhood."

HEADLINE: Why Eastern Europeans Need Trade Relief

 BODY:
To the Editor:
James Bovard makes an excellent case for removing trade barriers against Eastern European imports ("For the U.S., a Repeated Trade Slip," Forum, Aug. 18.) Our government is protecting us from nonexistent threats. 
 When in Hungary recently, I heard often of the disappointment the Hungarians felt about barriers against Eastern European products in the United States and the European Community. "Why," people asked, "did the E.C. and the U.S. encourage us to turn to free-market economies when their own markets are not free and open? What is the point of a market economy when our products are not even given a chance?"
There is no doubt that we need to make our industries competitive and encourage American companies' growth. Preventing competition is not the method, especially in dealing with countries striving to open their economies. Encouraging the growth of other economies will lead to larger, wealthier markets for United States products in the long run. Let's not defeat ourselves and others with short-term measures.

HEADLINE: Beijing's Top Priority: Maintain Communism

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Sept. 14

 BODY:
China's leaders have pledged in a series of confidential documents that the Soviet upheavals will neither diminish China's commitment to Communism nor weaken its resolve to open the door wider to the outside world.
At least three classified documents are circulating at various levels in the Chinese Communist Party, outlining the leaders' response to the Soviet events, according to Chinese with access to high-level information. Two of the documents are based on advice from the paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, that China must act prudently and avoid taking a belligerent stance against the collapse of Communism elsewhere. 
 One of the three items has been previously reported. It is Central Committee Document No. 4, which concludes that the Soviet Union has restored capitalism and that its mistake was that it chose the wrong successor to earlier hard-liners.
The second document, which is stamped "top secret" and has begun circulating to department heads in the central Government and party apparatus, is a revised version of a speech given in July by the Communist Party leader, Jiang Zemin. Mr. Jiang emphasizes that Communism has faced difficulties before and that it will overcome them, and that China will continue its open-door and reform policies.
To avoid the fate of the Soviet Union, Mr. Jiang says, China must adhere to three principles: Communist Party leadership of China, party control over the military and security forces, and disavowal of privatization in the economy.
"The private sector can be only a supplement to the state and collective sectors, and it can never predominate," Mr. Jiang states.
He also takes a dig at the United States, noting that American relief for the devastating flood in central China amounted to only $25,000, while the people of Hong Kong donated some $50 million. Mr. Jiang suggests that the United States knew through satellite information that the flood was a terrible catastrophe and hoped that it would lead to turmoil that would threaten the regime.
Instead, Mr. Jiang says, the Government has handled the relief effort extremely smoothly and has demonstrated the superiority of socialism. Under capitalism, many people would have starved to death or been left uncared for, he says.
While large sums have been raised within China, these have not all been voluntary. Some Chinese are grumbling that they are being told to give four or five new pieces of clothing to their work units to be forwarded to flood victims.
Mr. Jiang's speech also emphasizes that China's foreign policy will be flexible, encouraging warm relations with former Communist countries. The same point is made in the third of the documents now circulating, an analysis by Foreign Minister Qian Qichen.
 
Not Shocked by Soviet Shift
 Mr. Qian's analysis, which is now being distributed to ministers and vice ministers in the central Government, asserts that the central leadership expected since February that the Soviet Union would go capitalist and so was not surprised by developments. It suggests that China's foreign policy will not be greatly affected by Soviet events.
But among Mr. Deng's recent comments now circulating among officials is this: "One cold war has ended; two others have begun." There is no explanation of what the two new ones are, but presumably one is the ideological struggle between China and the West.
While officials are being told that China's open-door policy will open even wider, many are skeptical. The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences is trying to curtail travel by its scholars to the United States, saying there have been too many such trips recently, and some sensitive work units have called meetings in the last two weeks to warn employees to avoid all contacts with foreign journalists.
One Chinese who attended such a meeting said they were told that they would be punished if they were found to be in touch with foreign correspondents.

HEADLINE: THE SOVIET TRANSITION;
BAKER, IN BALTICS, PROMISES U.S. HELP

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: VILNIUS, Lithuania, Sept. 14

 BODY:
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d made a whistle-stop tour of all three newly free Baltic republics today, promising them help in joining international organizations to solidify their break from the Soviet Union and limited American economic aid.
The Baltic leaders made it clear to Mr. Baker that despite the new independence, 100,000 Soviet soldiers remained on their soil with no firm agreement on withdrawal, American officials said.
 
Leaders Still Wary
 Mr. Baker told republic leaders that Washington was prepared to give them $14 million this fiscal year in the form of assistance programs divided among the three republics. The Baltic leaders were clearly hoping to get more, but the chief issue on their agenda was security issues. 
 American officials said the Baltic leaders urged Mr. Baker to do all he could to help speed their integration into the United Nations, which is already in the process of making them full members, as well as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The Baltic leaders are still very wary that the triumph of change-minded forces in Moscow over the coup's hard-liners could be reversed, and with it their own independence.
Mr. Baker said Washington was already working to speed Baltic membership in the United Nations and had already helped push the nations into the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe last week. He promised to work on other organizations as well.
Mr. Baker's visit was the first by an American Secretary of State to Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, three nations that were occupied and annexed by the Soviet Union as a consequence of a secret pact between Hitler and Stalin on the eve of World War II. The three began separate independence drives after President Mikhail S. Gorbachev came to power in the Soviet Union, and finally attained freedom this month by a resolution of the council temporarily governing the Soviet Union in the wake of the coup.
 
No Housing for Troops
 Soviet officials have told both Baltic and American officials that they recognize that Soviet troops will have to leave the Baltic nations. But they add that they are simultaneously withdrawing from Poland and Germany and that the nation lacks the housing right now to accommodate all returning military men. Moscow has told the Baltic leaders and Mr. Baker that they would like to have all troops out by January 1994, but the Baltic leaders want them out sooner.
Asked if he could not do more to get the soldiers to leave sooner, all Mr. Baker would say was: "Everyone agrees that the sooner that would be accomplished the better it would be."
Mr. Baker spent Friday night in St. Petersburg, formerly Leningrad, holding talks with its Mayor, Anatoly A. Sobchak. Then, starting this morning, he hopped from one Baltic republic to the next in a trip that was longer on symbolism than substance. Mr. Baker posed for photos with leaders in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, presenting to each the republic's flag that flew in the State Department lobby during their 51 years of Soviet occupation.
Mr. Baker's brief remarks outside the Estonian Parliament in Tallinn were typical of those he repeated at each stop, changing the name of the republic or the president.
"Let me say how very pleased I am to be here in a free and independent Estonia," Mr. Baker said. "We have congratulated all of the officials of this government for the realization after all of these years of a goal we in the United States have shared that is the restitution of your full independence and we have also made clear that without the bravery and courage of the Estonian people this would never have happened."
Although the United States never formally recognized that the Baltic states were part of the Soviet Union, Baltic nationalists complained during their drives for independence that the American desire to support Mr. Gorbachev had prevented the republics from getting the kind of firm public support from Washington that they would have liked.
The Baker visit had the feel of a political campaign swing -- including a 15-minute departure delay in St. Petersburg while Mr. Baker held up his motorcade to wait for the sole American network camera crew accompanying him.
But the trip was lacking one key element: crowds. Latvians, Lithuanians and Estonians paid virtually no attention as Mr. Baker's motorcade sped in and out of their capitals, save for a few hundred Lithuanians who turned out at the Parliament building in Vilnius.
The biggest spontaneous reception Mr. Baker received was a smattering of applause from a crowd gathered for a funeral at the Russian Orthodox Church, just across from the Estonian Parliament in Tallinn.
 
U.S. Followed Mongolia
 The seeming lack of interest by average Balts in their high-level American visitor can be understood, in part because the United States -- although it never formally recognized the republics' annexation by Moscow -- dragged its feet in formally recognizing their independence, being the 37th country to do so, after Mongolia.
When Prime Minister Edgar Savisaar of Estonia was asked by reporters whether he could honestly say that he was pleased by the speed with which Washington recognized the Baltics, he said diplomatically, "We were pleased with the wisdom and the balance with which the United States recognized Baltic independence."
The Baltic people also seemed to be responding to the lack of pressure on Mr. Gorbachev for their independence until after it was a virtual certainty.
"You know," said Ille Grun, a Tallinn reporter, "in the last few weeks so many important people came here. Now we say: When the Queen comes, it will be news."
Mr. Baker began his tour in Tallinn, where he drove to the Estonian Parliament, passing barricades of huge granite boulders built to protect the building from Soviet troops during the coup. He had to negotiate similar barricades at government buildings in Riga, the Latvian capital, and Vilnius.
For the Americans, one important matter of substance at each stop involved assurances that each Baltic country would be prepared to endorse provisions of the Conventional Arms Reduction Treaty and Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty that might apply to them. Both treaties were signed by the United States and Soviet Union in the last year and both might have to be changed to account for the fact that the Soviet military garrison and weapons systems will eventually leave the Baltics.
For the Baltic nations, the biggest item on their agenda besides security is American aid. As the Estonian President, Arnold Ruutel, said with Mr. Baker at his side: "I understand Mr. Secretary that the United States is going to support us and help us in this period we are now facing."
The $14 million in assistance Mr. Baker revealed for this fiscal year would include $2 million in medical supplies, a management training institute and bank training center, livestock feed, scholarships, seminars on legal reform, English language training courses, parliamentary training, assistance to political parties and public administration and rule-of-law programs, as well as advice on developing small business.

HEADLINE: Despite Growth, Mormons Find New Hurdles

BYLINE: By PETER STEINFELS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SALT LAKE CITY

 BODY:
A century ago the Mormon Church was widely viewed as a morally and politically dangerous sect. Today it is widely seen as a conservative repository of old-fashioned values, an American success story.
One of the nation's fastest-growing major churches, it dispatches nearly 50,000 missionaries a year, many of them 19- and 20-year-olds, to spread its message in the United States and abroad. There are now more Mormons than members of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) or the Episcopal Church, two pillars of the religious establishment. And no other major American religious group is so generously supported by its followers: By church law Mormons give up to 10 percent of their income to the church. 
 But thanks to its very success, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints confronts a whole new array of problems, some immediate and practical, some touching on the very nature of the faith. Just as it approaches the safe harbor of national acceptance, it is being transformed again, this time into an international religion.
 
More Non-Americans
 By the year 2000, at the church's present rate of growth, only a minority of Mormons will be American. In 1960, the church had 1.7 million members, all but 200,000 in the United States. By 1990, its ranks had swollen to 7.7 million members, but with 3.4 million of them overseas, mostly in Latin America.
The church "is caught in a real bind" by its rapid international growth, said Michael Quinn, a Mormon historian. "Typically the boast and pride of Mormon leadership has been that throughout the world the church is the same, not only in doctrine but even in the building of temples and chapels," he said.
And even with tithing, the mandatory contribution from members, there is not money to recreate the Mormon life and institutions of Salt Lake City in India and Africa, he said.
And the church is not always welcome overseas. In Chile, where 2 percent of the population is Mormon (as against 1.4 percent in the United States), 60 bombs were detonated last year in attacks on Mormon chapels by political groups who view Mormons as agents of American imperialism. In Peru, guerrillas assassinated three Mormon missionaries from that country. A church that was once reviled in the United States is now the recipient of "Yanqui go home" messages, even when local members are not Yankees.
At the same time, the church has barely shed its history of tension with American society.
The church had barely been founded by Joseph Smith in 1830 when persecution drove Mormons from New York to the Midwest, where Smith was lynched by an anti-Mormon mob in 1844, and then to Utah under the leadership of Brigham Young. Until the church renounced its approval of polygamy in 1890, the practice caused decades of cold war, and occasionally armed clashes, with the Federal Government.
But behind the battle lines the church was instilling a code of sober living (no tobacco, alcohol, drugs or gambling), hard work, self-reliance, family stability and organizational efficiency. The church has produced a corps of individuals fluent in foreign languages, familiar with other cultures and trained in salesmanship.
The missionary effort has only one parallel among major Christian groups, that of the Jehovah's Witnesses. Mormonism's emphasis on family solidarity, expressed in the strict morality it preaches for this world and the continuation of the family unit in the afterlife, plays a crucial role in drawing people to the faith.
 
Discouraging Debate
 But the suspicions linger. Tightly governed by a small band of male elders whose decisions are usually made behind closed doors, the church discourages open debate or criticism. Three weeks ago, for example, the highest church officials issued a formal rebuke of an August conference in Salt Lake City at which scholars examined problems of premarital sex, drug abuse and child abuse among Mormons and explored the changing meaning of church rituals.
The conference was sponsored by the monthly Sunstone, one of several independent journals where the swelling ranks of Mormon professionals and intellectuals try to explore their church's history, theology and policies. Church authorities have met these efforts with recurring threats to suspend the religious privileges of critics or bar them from church employment.
This anxiety about maintaining its image enabled a trafficker in forgeries to sell church officials documents purporting to be from Joseph Smith's era that might have reflected badly on Mormonism's origins. In 1985, the scheme was exposed when the trafficker, Mark W. Hofmann, planted three bombs, killing two people and seriously injuring himself.
Inevitably, the church's political influence and economic power in Utah and surrounding states stirs rumors and criticism among Mormons as well as non-Mormons. The church's opposition to the Equal Rights Amendment in the late 1970's stirred a feminist opposition within its ranks, and liberals began to view the church as part of the religious right supporting the Reagan Administration on social issues.
 
No 'Mischief' Found
 Last month, after The Arizona Republic published a series of articles on the church's wealth, Richard Robertson, who oversaw the Phoenix paper's yearlong investigation, said the church's doctrines, its history of polygamy and what Mr. Robertson called a secretive "circle-the-wagons mentality" fostered in the church by past persecution had produced "curiosity and a lot of suspicion and rumors about what Mormons own, control and believe."
Mr. Robertson said the investigators had begun with an expectation of finding "mischief" and misuse of funds and were "surprised not to find anything." According to the series, the church collects $4.3 billion a year in tithes from its members and brings in another $400 million in revenue from more than 100 church-owned enterprises and extensive land-holdings.
Dr. Jan Shipps, a professor of religious studies at Indiana University and a foremost non-Mormon scholar of the church's modern transformation, has noted that although Joseph Smith founded the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as a "restored" form of Christianity, Mormonism quickly modeled itself on ancient Israel, with patriarchal leadership, a temple and an exodus to a promised land where a people distinguished by special dietary and ritual practices would be gathered.
But with the growth of a permanent Mormon "diaspora" throughout the United States and now of congregations in over 100 nations, Mormonism may have to recapitulate the kind of adjustments Christianity made during the early centuries when it spread from Jewish converts to Gentiles and from the Roman empire to the invading tribes and the rest of Europe.
In 1978, Spencer W. Kimball, then the church's President, announced a revelation revoking the church's longstanding ban on extending the priesthood, an office Mormonism grants to all worthy males over 12, to blacks. The change was crucial both for Mormonism's acceptance in America and obviously for its expansion in Africa and in Latin American nations like Brazil with racially mixed populations.
 
More Inclusive Leadership
 The church has only begun to incorporate non-American representatives into its top leadership. Since 1985 Ezra Taft Benson has been church's President, a lifetime office. Mr. Benson, Secretary of Agriculture under President Eisenhower, is now 92, and church leadership is largely in the hands of his First and Second Counselors, Gordon B. Hinckley and Thomas S. Monson.
All three are Americans. So are all members of the Council of the Twelve Apostles, the next highest level of church authority. Only at the next level, the First and Second Quorums of the Seventy, are there members born outside the United States: 21 out of 73. This level, which supervises the church's geographic subdivisions, seems to serve more as a pool of candidates for higher office than to play a major part in setting policies.
Expansion has also forced the church to systematize and adapt its doctrine and organization. "For a long time, 'simplify and reduce by half' has been a catchword" in church agencies preparing teaching materials, said Elbert Peck, the editor of Sunstone.
 
Curbing Talk of Doctrine
 Discussions of speculative doctrines about the afterlife and the nature of God or humankind have been curtailed, he said, partly to make the religion easier to communicate, partly just to reduce the costs of translating and publishing. Some Mormons describe the new approach as "cut and dried," but Mr. Peck noted that the simplified adult Sunday school manual encouraged discussion of local concerns.
To strengthen oversight and reduce disparities in resources, money that was once collected and distributed locally is now channeled through the church's central office.
One seemingly simple change had an impact that Dr. Shipps said "is impossible to overstate." Meetings and activities that once consumed almost every evening have been condensed into a block of time on Sunday. Partly a response to modern time pressures, the change was also "a crucial response to the diaspora," Dr. Shipps said. "Converts in Latin America might live long distances away from one another. They can't drive, or worse walk, to meetings four or five nights a week."
For some Mormons, often from families in the church for generations, these changes represent a loss in the religion's strong sense of community.
"We're becoming a Sunday church," said Peggy Fletcher Stack, a founder of Sunstone.
Overseas growth accelerates pressures already at work as Mormonism adjusts to its growing numbers outside of highly Mormon areas in Utah, Idaho or nearby states.
"I don't think most church members realize how much the international growth is driving what is happening right here in the United States," Mr. Peck said.
The concentration of activities on Sunday reduces "the chance for communal conversation," he said. "You basically come to church and you're talked to and then you live your lives as individuals according to the ordinances and duties the church teaches."
Other occasions for collective activity by church members have been similarly reduced, he said, noting that the extensive church welfare system that used to maintain farms and canneries to provide work and income for church members now finds it more efficient to distribute funds directly.
Martha Nibley Beck, who teaches sociology at Mormon-run Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, said that the shift to a world church would enourage a return to Mormonism's most basic religious elements. Purely American "cultural trapping will get peeled away," she said. Other Mormons believe the change will spur Mormon sensitivity to problems of hunger, poverty and global justice.
 
'Changed Me in Every Aspect'
 "This has changed me in every aspect of my life," said Richard Stone, a 21-year-old who grew up Mormon in Scarsdale, N.Y., and who recently returned from 22 months of missionary work in Chile. Working in outlying districts of Santiago and encountering stark poverty and other human problems had left him with a deep appreciation of the Chilean people and a desire "to do good."
Now a sophomore at Brigham Young University, Mr. Stone said that his missionary experience had made him consider work in the foreign service or as a translator.
The church would meet the financial or cultural strains of growth, said Dr. Russell M. Nelson, a distinguished cardiovascular surgeon whose membership on the Council of the Twelve gives him a voice in the church's major decisions.
Many adjustments will be necessary but basic doctrines will remain unchanged, he said. "This is a healthy exercise for us. It make us examine our own performance and assess our priorities," he said.

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
In Spotlight, Jackson Nears Decision

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 14

 BODY:
This is the season of decision for Democratic Presidential hopefuls, and few decisions will be more closely watched, or have more impact on the race for the party's nomination, than whether the Rev. Jesse Jackson chooses to run for the third time.
It is now widely believed among Democrats, including some of Mr. Jackson's allies, that he will not seek the nomination next year. Some who follow Mr. Jackson closely, but spoke on condition that they not be identified, say they believe he has made up his mind and is wrestling with the pain of making it official -- particularly to his supporters. 
 In an interview this week, Mr. Jackson dismissed such talk as "just speculation." But he has taken to noting, "Running has always been an option, not an obsession." And he talks willingly about the forces that could keep him from another race for the nomination, including family and personal considerations. This is a very different psychology from the fire, the certainty and the edge that were so strong in Mr. Jackson when he began his Presidential candidacies in 1983 and 1987.
Still, Mr. Jackson is a master at keeping his options open, controlling his timing and building suspense -- perhaps more than any other politician on the scene today. And with a fervent base of supporters always eager to take up the chant of "run, Jesse, run," there are probably some twists and turns ahead before his fellow Democrats finally discover just what Mr. Jackson intends to do.
 
Meeting in Washington
 The endgame could begin Sunday night, when Mr. Jackson meets with supporters and former delegates here in Washington, to discuss "the most effective way to render our public service during the next political season."
Mr. Jackson's plans have major implications for his fellow Democratic hopefuls, including the latest entrant, Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia, who announced his candidacy in Richmond on Friday. First and foremost, some party strategists say, if Mr. Jackson chooses not to run, it would suddenly escalate the competition for the support of black voters, a critical part of his base.
Black voters accounted for 21 percent of the Democratic Presidential primary vote in 1988, and 24 percent of that vote in the several Southern primaries held on the March 8 "Super Tuesday," according to the New York Times/CBS News surveys. In 1988, the white candidates for the Democratic nomination largely ceded the black vote to Mr. Jackson; his roots, recognition and loyalties among black voters run very deep.
If Mr. Jackson chooses not to run in 1992, "you'd have the most significant bloc in the Democratic primary system up for competition, in play among the existing and probable candidates," said Thomas Donilon, a Democratic strategist. This would be a big plus for Mr. Wilder, the nation's first black elected governor, who has run well among blacks in Virginia but is moving into national politics for the first time. Several party strategists said they expected him to get vigorous competition from the white candidates for this black support.
Much of Mr. Jackson's support among white liberals, some strategists suggested, could fall to Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa. Michael McCurry, former spokesman for the Democratic National Committee, described Mr. Harkin as "probably the closest to an ideological heir to Jackson."
There has long been division among Mr. Jackson's supporters over whether he should seek the Democratic nomination in 1992. Mr. Jackson was roundly criticized last year when he decided not to run for mayor of Washington; his critics asserted that it showed his unwillingness to test himself in elective office.
Instead, Mr. Jackson was elected to the job of what he calls "statehood senator," a lobbyist for statehood for the District of Columbia. But this did little to silence the criticism that Mr. Jackson was more interested in causes and campaigns than governance. Running a third consecutive time, some Democrats suggest, could only feed the image of Mr. Jackson as a perennial cause candidate.
 
'Personal and Family'
 Mr. Jackson, protective of his political accomplishments, said in the interview: "My reasons for not announcing so far have been personal and family. There is no political reason not to run."
Interviewed the day before Mr. Wilder's expected entry into the race, Mr. Jackson bristled at the notion that his decision, his career path, was somehow linked to that of the Virginia Governor. "It is a race-based comparison that is not based upon our base of support, it's not based upon our views, it's not based upon our ratings in the polls, it's not at all a scientific analysis -- it's a racial analysis," he said.
He showed some appetite for the emerging debate, taking aim, with his customary skill, at the buzzwords of his potential opponents. "We do not need fiscal conservatism," he said. "We need fiscal prudence and economic growth."
Regardless of his decision, Mr. Jackson will not leave the public stage. Besides his constant rounds of travel, speeches and organizing, Mr. Jackson has an offer to host a talk show on CNN.
But he is only entering the decision-making season, he noted. And one Democrat close to Mr. Jackson said: "I personally wouldn't be surprised to see things look a lot less decided over the next two weeks. There are a lot of people who are trying to talk him into taking another look."
This Democrat added, "I don't believe he'll run, and I believe he's not going to ever really get close to running, but the path between here and not running can travel a lot of different routes."
And Steve Cobble, Mr. Jackson's delegate coordinator in 1988, said: "If I had to bet today, I'd probably bet he wouldn't run. But one should keep in mind that Jackson is always the first to respond to new events. He's always the most flexible and the most spontaneous about these things."

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Politicians Take Up The Domestic Issues; Polls Suggest Why

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
BY tacit bipartisan agreement, this is supposed to be the season for politicians to work on domestic issues, everything from abortion to civil rights to education to transportation. Despite the increasingly sharp dispute over housing loan guarantees to Israel, which caught Congress by surprise, leaders of both parties have a compelling reason to concentrate, for now, on the problems of Americans and not those of other countries. In fact, they share the very same reason: President Bush's successes, real and perceived, in foreign policy.
For the Democrats, whether in Congress or launching Presidential campaigns, those successes are a good reason to change the subject. They retain an image of a caring party, one that can best be relied on to improve schools and health care, and look after ordinary people generally. It's not as much to go on as they had until recent years, when polls still identified them as the party of prosperity, too, but it's what they have. 
 So when George J. Mitchell, the Senate majority leader, gathers reporters together as he did Thursday to tell them that the time has come to reduce defense spending and concentrate on domestic priorities, his rhetoric focuses on issues where the public's instinctive trust is with his party:
"We have an education system that isn't teaching, a health care system that isn't taking care of people, an infrastructure that isn't permitting efficient transportation, an unemployment system that doesn't provide insurance to unemployed people."
The Republicans' reason for wanting to change the subject, at least a little, is more intriguing. After Mr. Bush held a campaign strategy session several weeks ago, participants said that the biggest single message they got came from Robert M. Teeter, the President's polltaker, who reported that the public was tiring of Mr. Bush's concentration on foreign policy and wanted him to pay more attention to domestic issues.
There were seeds of the problem even earlier. In a New York Times/CBS News Poll in March, when Mr. Bush had a startling 88 percent approval rating, only 31 percent of the respondents said they thought he was spending enough time on the economy.
Such findings help explain this month's White House travel schedule, with its made-for-television trips to a school to emphasize this year's education program, a drug treatment center to recall the drug policy announced in 1989, and the Grand Canyon to hail last year's Clean Air Bill.
 
Polls and Strategies
 And polls explain some legislative strategy. As Senator Phil Gramm, who heads the Republican Senate Campaign Committee, left the White House last week, he earnestly told the cameras, "The President feels very strongly that we need to adopt the mandatory sentencing provisions of the crime bill."
If promised anonymity, conservatives readily concede there is more symbol than substance in their crime bill and liberals admit that slowing handgun sales will have a minuscule effect on crime. But polls make it clear the public is worrying about crime and likes the death penalties that are scattered through the bill. One skeptic who voted for the bill, Senator John C. Danforth, Republican of Missouri, said it sends the message, " 'Hey, we're going to do this about crime.' It's a great 30-second commercial."
Of course, polls don't control every element of the political agenda. Take Mr. Bush's threat to veto an appropriations bill that would stop the Administration from withholding Federal funds from family planning clinics that discuss abortion with pregnant patients. That came up when the Supreme Court upheld the regulation as constitutional. But the public opposes that policy by a whopping 71 to 23 percent margin, according to this month's New York Times/CBS News Poll. If Mr. Bush sticks to his veto threat, the reason won't be to increase his political appeal, but will reflect his belief that such discussions lead to more abortions, and his political reliance on the zeal of abortion foes who pushed for the rule in the first place.
And if, as the Democrats insist, the Administration has carved its civil rights position in response to surveys that show Republicans can win votes by opposing quotas, the Times/ CBS News Poll suggests that their position is hardly a sure thing. The Administration currently says it opposes the civil rights bill because the measure should allow employers to impose higher educational standards than a job actually requires, even if such standards might discriminate against minorities. The Administration argues that such a provision is necessary in order to encourage youths to complete their education. By a 2-to-1 margin, participants in the poll disagreed.
But as Mr. Danforth's comment on the crime bill indicated, polls and other devices for taking the public pulse may identify problems, but they do not spell out solutions.
 
Fear of Taxes
 They can, however, help rule out solutions. When the House votes this week on a bill to extend unemployment benefits for people out of work for more than half a year, it will get a chance to vote for letting Mr. Bush decide to pay for the extra benefits with higher payroll taxes on employers. Representative Tom Downey, Democrat of New York, acknowledged his colleagues' fear of voting for any semblance of a new tax, estimating its prospects this way: "I believe the Yankees have a better chance of winning the World Series."
There is lots of overlap of subjects that the two parties will focus on this fall. The Republicans have an education proposal; so do the Democrats. Everybody has, or soon will have, his or her crime bill. On health insurance, neither party seems ready to push forward with an overall, national solution. The issue is complicated, expensive, and there is no remotely affordable solution that won't step on some important interests' toes. But it is a serious issue, and the public knows it. So each party offers modest proposals designed to solve some part of the problem.
But there is a big difference between talking about issues and putting them into law. Mr. Bush and Congressional Republicans often seem most comfortable complaining that the Democratic majorities on the Hill do not pass their proposals quickly and with few changes. Mr. Bush last week delighted in blaming "Congressional bickering" for inaction. But divided government gives both parties an excuse. On Thursday, Senator Lloyd Bentsen, a Texas Democrat, said that comprehensive health care reform was impossible without leadership from the White House, which was not forthcoming because there was "very little potential for parades."

Chart: "Policies vs. polls"
 
Education requirements
"The Bush administration says that employers should be allowed to impose educational requirements greater than the job really requires - like a high school diploma for a janitor - in order to encourage young people to finish high school. Critics say this would discriminate against older workers who didn't finish high school. Do you think employers should, or should not, be allowed to impose educational requirements that do not relate to the duties of the job?"
 
Information on abortion
"The Bush administration has ordered that family planning clinics which get Federal money must not tell pregnant women about the availability of abortion because it says that would encourage abortion. Critics say that interferes with medical ethics and that clinincs should have the right to provide this information. Do you think clinics should, or should not, be allowed to tell pregnant women about the availiability of abortion?"

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
The Barriers To Western Aid Are Disappearing

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
PRESIDENT Mikhail S. Gorbachev was Crazy Eddie last week, offering Cuba, the Kurile islands, even Afghanistan, all at prices that were INSANE.
But there was a method to the madness, and a logic that could soon force the United States to consider not only more economic aid to the Soviets than it has been willing to think about up to now, but bigger nuclear arms cuts than looked possible or desirable only six weeks ago. 
 What Mr. Gorbachev and his new regent, President Boris N. Yeltsin of the Russian Republic, were up to seemed at first like mere mendicancy. Eleven thousand Soviet troops would come out of Cuba, Mr. Gorbachev said; Japan might yet get its "northern territories" -- the four northern isles in the Kurile chain -- according to Mr. Yeltsin, and Moscow would cut off weapons deliveries to the Marxist Government of Afghanistan by the beginning of next year, according to Foreign Minister Boris D. Pankin. All of this was clearly being said in the hope that the United States and Japan would then change their minds and agree to send money -- and lots of it.
Apart from agreement by the United States to stop its aid to the Afghan rebels by the same time, and vague hopes that the United States would cut back its naval presence at and around its Cuban base at Guantanamo Bay, there was no quid pro quo. The angry Cubans denounced the Soviet pullout plans as an invitation for American aggression, but the only thing the Soviets seemed interested in was making Washington more willing to grant economic aid.
Just for the coming winter, Mr. Gorbachev said in a letter to the European Community and the Group of Seven industrial democracies, the Soviet Union will need $6 billion to $7.3 billion worth of emergency food aid -- 5.5 million metric tons of grain, 900,000 metric tons of meat and sugar, and so on, down to cigarettes.
 
Billions from Japan?
 Beyond that, Mr. Yeltsin's Russian government would like to get $8 bilion to $15 billion worth of economic aid from Japan, aid he apparently hopes Tokyo will be more inclined to provide if it gets the Kuriles back, though the request got a cool response last week.
How much the new leaders think the United States can or will provide with the Cuban irritant out of the way, they have not yet spelled out. But apparently they must hope it's plenty, because they are giving up positions that Soviet governments fiercely held onto for decades. Cuba, for instance, has been an expensive drain on Soviet finances, but Moscow stayed on to challenge the Monroe Doctrine and to show that the Soviet Union was a superpower, too. But it is one no longer.
Whether this fire sale will save the Soviet Union from collapse or bankruptcy is hard to tell at this point. But it is clear that the rapid changes in Soviet foreign policy since the failure of last month's coup against Mr. Gorbachev have already created a powerful dynamic that could quickly increase pressure on the United States to consider other changes of its own.
At the London economic summit in July, President Bush, strongly supported by Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, put off Mr. Gorbachev until he placed the country on the path to a market economy. Now, with the Russian leadership forging ahead and dragging the Kremlin along, Mr. Gorbachev will soon be in a position to say: "O.K., I've done what you asked. Now fulfill your side of the bargain."
At his last meeting with Mr. Gorbachev in Moscow, six weeks ago, Mr. Bush signed what American officials thought would be the last major strategic arms reduction agreement for some time. But as the Soviet Union continues to come apart, concern is growing in the United States and, even more, in Europe about how to make sure that the Soviet nuclear arsenal stays under tight control. Since the fewer Soviet nuclear warheads there are, the easier it will be to assure that they do not fall into the wrong (or too many) hands, some European allies are already stepping up pressure on Washington to agree to a new round of arms talks.
This logic was evident in remarks by Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the German Foreign Minister, who said that he had lobbied Mr. Baker so hard here to start negotiations to reduce American and Soviet short-range nuclear missiles and artillery warheads that the Secretary of State proposed starting such talks when he saw Gen. Vladimir N. Lobov, Chief of the Soviet General Staff, on Friday.
That proposal was taken up right away. But the same logic applies to long-range nuclear weapons, whose elimination has been a goal of Mr. Gorbachev for years. Even France, which has resisted calls to negotiate cutbacks in its nuclear force, has suddenly developed concern about the controls over nuclear arsenals in Europe, and President Francois Mitterrand called last week for a conference of the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and France to discuss the problem. The French and the British had talked about joining the next medium-range nuclear arms talks, expecting them in the distant future. But the future is suddenly now, and Mr. Gorbachev's dream may come closer to reality.

HEADLINE: IDEAS & TRENDS;
In Financial Scandals, Is Blind Greed Meeting Sightless Watchdogs?

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
ON the surface, the recent financial scandals have little in common. But the more that comes to light about such seemingly disparate cases as cheating by Salomon Brothers in the Treasury market, corruption at the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, the nationwide savings and loan debacle and the shaky condition of many of the nation's largest banks and insurance companies, the more an underlying thread becomes apparent:
As national and international finance has become increasingly complicated, the Government's regulatory apparatus, mostly designed about 60 years ago, has proved unable to cope. "Fragmented, underfunded and perhaps not particularly talented regulators find it difficult to outsmart centralized, wealthy and extremely talented crooks," said Robert B. Reich, an economist at Harvard. 
 Donald F. Kettl, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin who has been studying how the Government and business interact, agreed with that analysis. "A phenomenon sweeping across the society is the lack of Government expertise in dealing with the private sector it is charged with regulating," he said in an interview.
Mr. Reich and Mr. Kettl are liberals. They place much of the blame on the Reagan and Bush Administrations' deep cuts in the staffing and financing of the regulatory agencies, and they would like to see the Government's hand strengthened.
Conservative scholars agree that the scandals grew at least in part out of a failure of Government regulation. But they argue that the solution is not tougher regulation but for the Government to withdraw altogether and let the invisible hand of the marketplace work unfettered.
Existing financial regulation, in the view of Jerry L. Jordan, a member of President Ronald Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers, is based largely on the principle of "permission and denial." Those who want to move in the financial world, said Mr. Jordan, now chief economist at First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles, must concentrate on making friends in high places or finding loopholes in the system, and sometimes they cross the line and act improperly.
If, Mr. Jordan argued, the Government did nothing but publish what everyone in the markets was doing, a philosophy he called "information and disclosure," the resulting competition would prevent scandals like those now in the headlines.
Joseph A. Grundfest, a former member of the Securities and Exchange Commission and now a professor at Stanford Law School, cast the problem somewhat differently. "Regulation," he said, "is not something like butter that can be measured in pounds. The question is smart regulation or dumb regulation, good regulation or bad regulation."
Political scientists and economists cautioned against finding too many similarities in the scandals. After all, what Salomon did -- submitting phony bids to acquire more than its legal share of Treasury securities in several auctions this year -- was an isolated case as far as is known. The massive failure of savings and loan institutions, on the other hand, was a systemic disaster that developed over many years and is costing taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars.
Money laundering and other corruption at the Bank of Credit and Commerce International occurred largely overseas. Although the international bank is accused of illegally controlling a majority of the stock in Washington's largest bank holding company, First American Bankshares, the criminals and most if not all of the victims in B.C.C.I.'s scams were foreigners. By contrast, the failure of the Bank of New England early this year and the weakness of other large banks and insurance companies in the United States could portend danger throughout the American economy.
But however large the differences, a theme running through the scandals was the sense of financial high rollers that they could make big money by taking advantage of the Government's role in the financial world.
John G. Heimann, who was the New York State Superintendent of Banks and the Federal Comptroller of the Currency and is now an executive at Merrill, Lynch, described the connection this way: "When the Government is involved in the marketplace, there's an assumption that the rules are being followed. Somebody who breaks the rules has an advantage."
Thus, B.C.C.I. got itself chartered in Luxembourg and the Cayman Islands so it could avoid many of the regulations that its international competitors in America, Europe and Japan were subjected to. Salomon used its Government-sanctioned position as one of only 39 firms allowed to bid on Treasury notes to corner the market. And greedy savings and loan operators had the money to take wild risks because their depositors had been attracted in part by the protection of Government insurance.
That raises another similarity. Traders at Salomon Brothers and the shady savings and loan operators thought they could make big profits with little risk, a philosophy that defies common sense but typifies the free-lunch attitude that more and more has characterized finance and in some cases politics in recent years.
The regulators eventually wised up, but at least in the case of the savings and loan industry and B.C.C.I., not until heavy damage had been wreaked.
"Regulators," said L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, "are always behind the curve, always correcting for last year's folly while people are finding new ways to beat the system."
More than the other financial regulatory agencies, the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has jurisdiction over the stock market, has managed to stay ahead of the curve. Exactly why is not clear, but it seems to have much to do with what Mr. Grundfest, the former commissioner, called "a certain culture, an unmistakable esprit de corps and competence that the other agencies cannot match."
Warren E. Buffett, the new chairman named to clean up Salomon Brothers, told Congress early this month that the main reason why "the United States has the best equity markets in the world" was that the S.E.C. was such a "tough cop."
"I think," Mr. Buffett continued, "that there's a feeling they can attract young people out of school who could probably earn a lot more money elsewhere and that there's a certain Marine Corps mentality about getting the job done."
But as good as it is, the S.E.C. could not prevent the insider trading and other crimes that were so prevalent on Wall Street in the 1980's.
"You can't keep fraud out of the system," said Mr. Heimann, the former comptroller. "The key to good regulation is how quickly you catch it."

HEADLINE: Remedy for Racism of Past Has New Kind of Shackles

BYLINE: By ISABEL WILKERSON

 BODY:
Without the strong arm of affirmative action, Renee Baldwin would not be a police officer in Cleveland, Carlyle Miller of Manhattan would have trained at a segregated medical school instead of an Ivy League college and Jay Walker, a Chicago lawyer, might not have suffered the pangs of uncertainty over why an East Coast law firm had hired him.
They are among the thousands of blacks who are the ambivalent children of affirmative action, the first generation to walk over the threshold of newly opened doors and integrate the nation's offices and classrooms. 
 Now in their mid-20's to mid-40's, they hold down jobs that their grandparents, as brilliant or educated as they might have been, could not have dreamed of. And whether they have benefited from the programs or succeeded without them, their lives have been buffeted by a climate that, once accepting of affirmative action, has turned grudging and hostile toward not only the programs, but them, too.
 
Too High a Price?
 In recent weeks, the nomination to the Supreme Court of perhaps the most prominent son and critic of affirmative action, Judge Clarence Thomas, has put the issue at center stage. And voices of others in his generation are likely to loom even larger in the coming months as debate begins in Congress over the civil rights bill and as the 1992 Presidential campaign begins.
For the most part, these are the reluctant defenders of affirmative action. Many see affirmative action -- programs and policies intended to correct the effects of past discrimination in employment or education -- as an imperfect solution to racism, one that only gives them the chance they and their ancestors deserved all along. Others say the price is too high and resent the presumptions of inferiority that the programs sometimes evoke.
But even those who have felt stigmatized by affirmative action offer painful arguments in favor of it: They see it as vital, but wish they could be assured of a fair shake without it.
 
Who's in the Way?
 In the Memphis Fire Department, for example, blatant racism that once prohibited black firefighters from sleeping in station beds reserved for whites also prevented the department's few blacks from moving beyond the very lowest rungs. Ulysses Jones says he would not have made lieutenant had a 1980 consent decree, settling a lawsuit brought by blacks against the city and the firefighters' union, not forced the department to award 20 percent of its promotions to minorities.
"They have made affirmative action a dirty word," said Lieutenant Jones, 40 years old. "For us it's a word that means fairness. You kept us down for 300 years and now you have to pay. I look at it as insurance and assurance."
But insurance has its price. Lieutenant Jones recalls bitter confrontations with white colleagues who were resentful when they weren't ignoring him.
"They wouldn't view you as a co-worker, but as an infringement that was keeping their relatives from getting jobs," Lieutenant Jones said. "They would say, 'This could have been my cousin's job,' or "The reason my son is not here is because of you.' They don't look at the 45 white people who came on with you. They still look at our jobs as being their positions."
When the words "affirmative action" first appeared 30 years ago in an executive order by the Kennedy Administration requiring Federal contractors to make their work forces represent the population, the words were a phrase in a well-meaning effort to remedy virulent discrimination.
By the time the idea wound its way to the nation's schools and businesses, Maisha Bennett was a high school senior in Cleveland, a straight-A student, valedictorian and on the top of the mailing lists of the best colleges in the country in 1966. "I should have been the kind of person that anybody would have wanted in their college," she said. "But the letters almost read, 'Dear Black Student.' "
 
Lessons on First Day
 She went to Mount Holyoke College. The courtship began anew four years later for graduate school. Harvard, Yale, Stanford, among others, wanted her desperately. They wooed her with offers of full scholarships and personal telephone calls from the department chairmen. She chose the University of Chicago, which awarded her full tuition, room and board and a stipend as a doctoral student in psychology.
But the first day of school offered a lesson in the great paradox of affirmative action: admittance does not guarantee acceptance. As she and a black law student were standing outside a classroom reading a bulletin board, sirens began blaring and the police pulled up, guns drawn. A secretary had called the police to report that black people were in the building.
The suspicions extended to the classrooms, but she rose above them, got her degree and is now a psychologist in Chicago. She only wishes that people like her father, a man she said was born to be a professor but was consigned to being a bricklayer because of his race and times, had had the chance.
"I'm glad I was on the side of the clock I was on," Dr. Bennett, 42, said. "I knew these hundreds of letters were because of Martin Luther King and Malcolm X and the marching. I knew it wasn't just me. I wasn't any smarter than the valedictorian of 1963 or than my father."
 
Sunlight and Shadows
 Blacks on the trailing edge of the generation report very different experiences. In some ways, they say, they are in the worst of all possible worlds, benefiting from neither the bounty bestowed on their older brothers and sisters nor the air of good will and generosity that characterized the early days of affirmative action.
Indeed, as college tuition rises, sources of financial aid dry up and politics and economics seem to make the country less benevolent in general, they find themselves left with little in the way of affirmative action benefits but more and more white resentment.
Jay Walker, a 33-year-old assistant corporation counsel in Chicago, laments that affirmative action has come to taint the hiring process, whether it is being used or not, and casts a long shadow over the legitimate achievements of blacks.
For 18 months, he worked at a law firm in the Northeast as one of three black lawyers of a total of 200. He was never told he was an affirmative action hire, but he said he always felt like one.
"You always want to believe you were hired because you were the best," he said. "You work seven days a week, you wear Brooks Brothers suits, you play golf. But everything around you is telling you were brought in for one reason: because you were a quota."
He said he felt he was under constant scrutiny from his colleagues and always had to justify his being there. He volunteered for the toughest assignments and took to "carrying my resume in my breast pocket," so to speak, but felt dismissed as a nothing more than a quota.
"No matter how hard I worked or how brilliant I was, it wasn't getting me anywhere," Mr. Walker said. "It's a hell of a stigma to overcome. There are only 24 hours in a day."
When he left the firm, another black took his place. "It's a revolving door," Mr. Walker said.
It is because of problems like these that Stephen Carter, a professor of law at Yale University, argues for a rethinking of affirmative action in his new book, "Reflections of an Affirmative Action Baby," published by Basic Books this year, in which he recounts his own experiences being second-guessed and stigmatized under affirmative action.
"There should be a time when we demand to be judged by the same standards as everybody," Professor Carter said. "I don't have an ideal place to draw the line. But there should be a point where everyone understands, this far and no further. Once you've gotten into the web, people can say everything you do is tainted."
 
Memories of Jim Crow
 Supporters argue that it is not affirmative action but centuries-old prejudice that stigmatizes blacks. "White racism existed before anyone ever heard the word 'affirmative action,' " said Mary Frances Berry, a professor of history at the University of Pennsylvania, who is a member of the United States Commission on Civil Rights. "We have always been stigmatized. It would be better if we could all move up without affirmative action. It would also have been better if we hadn't had Jim Crow and segregation. But we did."
Despite their defense of affirmative action, many are haunted by the failures of past efforts, some pathetically naive in retrospect, as dramatized in the 1960's when a few elite East Coast schools took to recruiting black gang members, who then proceeded to rob other students once they got there. They worry that poor choices in affirmative action candidates seem to condemn not only the policy, but anyone who happens to benefit from it.
Indeed, many are among the most ardent of critics of lax standards because they say that affirmative action failures reflect most poorly on them. Many chafe at the word "qualified," which they say is used as a billy club by whites who question their credentials.
 
The 'One-Way Ticket'
 "They don't realize that affirmative action is a one-way ticket," said Dr. Carlyle Miller, a 42-year-old New York gastroenterologist who won scholarships to Columbia University and to Cornell Medical School in the late 1960's and early 1970's. "You're going through the same curriculum as everybody else. But all along the way everyone is questioning you."
Others express a frustration that affirmative action means a ceiling as well as a floor. "They hire a set number and don't hire any more," Mr. Walker said.
Professor Carter of Yale said he detected a restlessness for alternatives. "Students now seem much more resentful than they did before," he Carter said. "The more you find black people resenting the suggestion of affirmative action, the closer you are to the end of it."
Renee Baldwin, a Cleveland police officer who joined the force in 1977 after a consent decree mandated the hiring of minorities, is among those feeling the weight of public opinion against affirmative action. She does not expect it to last much longer. "It's dead, it's a dinosaur," Ms. Baldwin said. "It died with the Reagan Administration. I'm a relic now."
Affirmative action was not around when Arthur Fletcher, the chairman of the United States Commission on Civil Rights, graduated from Washburn University in Topeka, Kan., in 1950. Job recruiters would not even talk to him and the few other blacks in his class. So he drove an ice truck, mowed lawns and worked as a garbage collector to feed his children for four years until he could find work as teacher.
Although discrimination may be subtler now, he says there is still some unfinished business, and it requires affirmative action. "What we have been doing for the past 20 years is sawing the tree at the ground level," Mr. Fletcher said. "The roots are still very much alive."

HEADLINE: Screws Missing on Tail Wing of Plane in Crash Fatal to 14

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Sept. 14

 BODY:
The night before a Continental Express Commuter plane crashed here on Wednesday, killing all 14 people aboard, workers at the airline's Houston hangar failed to screw on a part of the tail that is now missing from the wreckage, Federal investigators said Friday night.
The investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board said they confirmed their finding by examining the wreckage and by looking at maintenance records that showed mechanics unscrewed part of the plane's tail wing, replaced some of the wing, but failed to refit 43 screws that hold the part in place. 
 The part in question is a flexible section of the tail wing that prevents ice from building up. It forms the leading edge of the tail wing.
 
Torn Free in Flight
 Investigators said it appeared that the piece might have torn free in flight, which would have caused the plane to pitch down, possibly stressing other parts of the aircraft beyond the limits at which it could fly safely.
James Kolstad, the chairman of the safety board, said that as part of a routine maintenance operation the screws were removed from the top of the wing's left side and the top and bottom of the right side. The right side of the assembly was replaced, but the left side was not changed.
"The plane went back into service without the screws on top of the left hand side," he said.
 
Engines Operated Normally
 Mr. Kolstad also said information from the plane's recording devices suggested that the plane come apart piece by piece in just a few seconds, while its engines operated normally. The pilots apparently had no indication of trouble until that moment, he said.
The safety board's investigators boarded a chartered helicopter on Friday afternoon and searched from the air without success for the crucial missing part of the plane.
The bulk of the tail wing was found about 200 yards from where the fuselage and main wings landed in a charred heap. By examining this part of the tail wing, investigators concluded that the missing piece had not been properly screwed on.
A separate team of investigators examined the plane's maintenance records at Continental's hangar in Houston. This team will also interview people who worked on the plane, a Brazilian-made Embraer 120 Brasilia, an official said.
 
No Firm Conclusions
 No firm conclusions have been reached at this stage, the investigators emphasized. But the fact that they are looking into maintenance problems poses troubling prospects for Continental Airlines, the bankrupt parent company of Continental Express.
F.A.A. officials said today that they had increased their surveillance of safety and maintenance programs at Continental and its commuter line after the parent company filed for bankruptcy last year.
"There were no corners being cut," said Roger Myers, an agency spokesman. "We were very happy they were doing things corectly."
A senior F.A.A. safety offical said that because of the accident there would certainly be further reviews of the commuter line's maintenance.
Art Kent, a Continental spokesman, said Friday night that further investigation was needed to determine exactly what happened to the plane. "We want to find out what happened more than anyone," he said. "We want to stress that safety is our No. 1 priority."
Mr. Kolstad said a tape recording of noises from the cockpit showed no conversation by the pilots about the accident. But other noises were recorded, he said.
"All of a sudden there was a loud noise, followed a few seconds later by an even louder noise. That was followed by a series of warning horns and messages," he said, referring to the alarms in the plane's cockpit. "Then there was a loud whooshing noise, followed by the end of the tape."
 
Sharp Downward Pitch
 A separate device that tracks the airplane's motions showed that its nose suddenly pitched sharply downward as the plane dropped suddenly. During this time the plane's engines were operating normally, he said.
Mr. Kolstad refused to speculate about what had happened in these crucial seconds.
It seems possible that the plane's rear tail wing, the horizontal stabilizer, was the first part to break, perhaps when its leading edge tore away.
That rupture, making the first noise heard on the tapes, could have caused the plane to drop suddenly, putting immense stress on its forward wings.
The left wing appears to have folded completely under the plane, which might have been the second loud noise heard on the tape.
That damage, in turn, could have broken fuel lines and started the fire aboard the plane before it crashed. So far, investigators have devoted most of their attention to the tail. But they have not yet been able to fully examine the left wing, because it is still lying on the ground underneath the right wing. It appears that the plane belly-flopped in a corn field with the left wing tucked underneath the right one.
David Messing, a spokesman for Continental, said the company's EMB-120's are maintained at several locations, with the main work done at the Houston Intercontinental Airport, where Continental Express has a separate hangar for maintaining its fleet of 101 planes, including 34 Brasilias.
There are 85 employees, including mechanics, inspectors and supervisors, at the hangar, which can accommodate two Brasilias at a time and can handle all routine and nonroutine work on the planes, he said.
Employment at the hangar has been stable, with no recent layoffs during the economic downturn, he said.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
How Subic Bay Became A Rallying Cry for Philippine Nationalism

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON

DATELINE: MANILA

 BODY:
EVEN among Filipinos who want the United States military to stay, it is commonly said that this is a nation that has never been allowed to progress beyond adolescence, beyond an immature need to hide behind someone or something else for protection.
When Filipinos go abroad to live -- to Europe, to the Middle East, to the United States -- they thrive, their communities as industrious and self-reliant as any. But at home, on the 7,100 volcano-born islands that make up the Philippines, many Filipinos admit that too often they seek out godfathers rather than take responsibility for their own actions. 
 Led by several fierce, hard-headed nationalists, who say with a touch of pride that they are willing to buck popular opinion, the Philippine Senate seems poised to try to end the country's dependence on what is being portrayed as the biggest godfather of them all, the American military and the thousands of jobs and billions of dollars it represents here.
In a move that many of the 23 senators acknowledge is as impractical as it is terrifying, the Senate is prepared to vote to reject a new 10-year American lease for the mammoth Subic Bay Naval Station on the central island of Luzon, and, it is hoped, force the Philippines into a political maturity denied it since a Portuguese navigator in the service of Spain, Ferdinand Magellan, "discovered" the islands in 1521. In the 470 years since, the Philippines have been under the control or at least the influence of a foreign power: the Spanish for more than three centuries, then the Americans, then the Japanese, and then the Americans again.
The Senate's impending vote is, in many ways, the opening of the second act of the "people power" revolution launched by the brave widow in her trademark yellow dress, Corazon C. Aquino, now the nation's president. With Mrs. Aquino at the head of the crowd, the Philippine revolutionaries forced out the ailing dictator, her predecessor, President Ferdinand E. Marcos in 1986. Now many of the same Filipinos are trying to oust -- with what they insist is much less ill will -- the superpower that many believe propped up the Marcos dynasty.
But Mrs. Aquino is not part of this revolution. Hoping to preserve the jobs of thousands of Filipinos working at Subic and the base's larger contribution to the struggling economy, she is the chief sponsor of the base treaty now facing almost certain defeat in the Senate.
Of the 12 senators who have already declared their opposition to the base agreement, one or two seem to be inspired by little more than a policy of opposing everything that Mrs. Aquino supports. Others do not object to the Americans remaining at Subic so much as they do to the amount of rent being paid by the United States -- $203 million a year, less than a quarter of what Mrs. Aquino had originally sought -- and want the pact renegotiated. Still others, perhaps most of the senators, seem motivated by a desire to end, once and for all, the spirit of colonialism and foreign influence they say has long plagued their nation.
 
'A Primal Scream'
 Alexander Magno, a political analyst at the University of the Philippines, describes the impending vote as a turning point for a country that, with so many advantages, has never truly prospered. "To reject this base treaty is not by any means a practical move," he said. "But the emotional release, the assertion of power and independence will be great. It will be therapeutic, a national primal scream that may mature us."
The Senate vote will almost certainly not put an end to the debate. There is every indication that Mrs. Aquino and her supporters in the Senate will try to delay an American departure, either through a national referendum or by modifying the treaty.
But for the first time since the Japanese invaded the Philippines in World War II -- and before that, since the United States acquisition of the Philippines in 1899 as the victor in the Spanish-American War -- the United States is talking seriously about departing from its former colony. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said last week that the United States military will "pack up and move" from Subic unless the Philippine Senate quickly approves the unmodified treaty. "I mean, that's it," he said with a bluntness that many Filipinos found offensive, and that may not fully reflect the value some American military officials still see in Subic.
While the strategic worth of the base has doubtless decreased with the end of the cold war, the cost of replicating Subic's functions at other military installations has been estimated in the billions of dollars.
To some extent, the Senate's move to try to shut down the base is an answer to a question Filipinos have been asking themselves for generations: How much worse can things get? By some measurements, the Philippines is the poorest major non-Communist nation in Southeast Asia and the South Pacific, with a per capita income of $730, a little less than Papua New Guinea's, about half that of Thailand. The nation is suffering from a 15 percent unemployment rate, the highest in years.
The ailing economy has been further jolted by a series of natural disasters, most recently and most significantly the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in June. The volcano left cities and villages in Luzon smothered beneath a thick crust of volcanic ash and led the United States to abandon Clark Air Base.
A shutdown of Subic would put tens of thousands of jobs in jeopardy and remove from the economy hundreds of millions of dollars in direct and indirect American payments. But in a nation of 59 million people with a $40 billion-a-year economy, the loss of Subic, though painful, could probably be managed. "I think people tend to exaggerate the problem of American withdrawal," said Blas Ople, a Manila newspaper columnist who is often described as the eminence gris of Philippine politics and who was for a time Ferdinand Marcos's labor secretary.
While Mr. Ople actively supports the extension of the American lease on Subic, he, like many other supporters of the base, does not panic at the thought of the treaty's rejection. The withdrawal of the American troops from the Philippines "would not be the end of the world," he says. "The nation would of course survive."

HEADLINE: $10 Billion Showdown;
The U.S. and Israel Collide At a Crucial Time in the Mideast

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN

DATELINE: JERUSALEM

 BODY:
IT is something of a gamble, but Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir seems to have calculated that he can go home with all the marbles:
He would get $10 billion in special loan guarantees from the United States to help resettle Soviet immigrants. He would continue to receive some $3 billion a year in regular aid from Washington. He would go to Middle East peace talks planned for next month with no intention of giving up occupied territory and with the power to dictate which Palestinians would be allowed to sit at the conference table. Most important, he would do all this without having to slow the expansion of Jewish settlement in the West Bank and Gaza Strip that he regards as his country's manifest destiny. 
 With his Likud Party getting set for parliamentary elections in 1992, it would be the political equivalent of hitting a grand-slam home run -- "proof that right-wing policies not only do not harm Israel's vital interests, but pay off," said Akiva Eldar, a political columnist for the independent newspaper Haaretz.
Mr. Shamir may yet win his gamble. But the odds against him lengthened last week when a lectern-thumping George Bush declared that the requested loan guarantees for the Soviet Jews stood in the path of Middle East harmony. If Congress approved them now, the President warned, the fragile peace process that he is trying to keep in motion could fall apart. This volatile region stands "on the brink of an historic breakthrough," he said, and there is no alternative but for Congress to delay debate on the assistance package for 120 days. If it does not -- and indeed it may not, for the formidable pro-Israel lobby is energetically working to have Congress enact the loan guarantees -- he would use his veto to block the aid.
 
A Low Point
 At no point did Mr. Bush use the word settlements. But Israel's pursuit of an ever larger Jewish presence in the occupied lands despite clear American opposition is what this dispute is really about, and it has now brought United States-Israel relations to a level of mutual annoyance and sullenness not seen in some time. It is a particularly delicate time for things to be going sour, because other matters hang in the balance as well -- including hopes for obtaining the release of Western hostages in Lebanon, an intricate effort in which Israel figured pivotally last week.
Mr. Bush's unhappiness with Israeli activity in the occupied territories is hardly new, but his irritation has grown, as the settlements have, since a year ago, when Israel got an earlier batch of loan guarantees worth $400 million. Israeli leaders insist that the money they plan to borrow from commercial banks, with the United States acting as guarantor, is purely for immigrant aid -- for roads, schools, houses and job training; not a dime, they say, will go to settlement-building on lands captured from neighboring Arab states in the 1967 Middle East war.
But critics, and they include many Israelis, consider that a disingenuous assertion. Money, they say, is fungible, an accountant's term that means one dollar looks like every other. Any American-backed loans for projects intended to help immigrants free up Israeli Government funds that can be spent elsewhere for hospitals, for roads, for garbage collection -- and for settlements. In the end, there is no way to tell whether a single dollar, or 10 billion dollars, will wind up in Tel Aviv or the West Bank. As a result, according to this argument, there is virtually no weapon available to Mr. Bush other than a suspension of the requested loan guarantees to get Mr. Shamir to bend to his will.
Even in Israel, many people have had it with settlements. Opposition leaders say that Mr. Shamir has brought the crisis on himself with his intransigence, and economists caution that the Government's construction plans not only stand in the way of hoped-for peace but also impose a serious drain on the economy. Zionist goals, they argue, are best served by making Israel proper a stronger place, and not by spreading thin resources across the Judean hills.
Moreover, some of them ask if it is worth waging a potentially nasty fight with the Bush Administration. Even if Mr. Shamir presses ahead in Congress for the loan guarantees (which he said on Friday he would) and even if he prevails (as some of his aides think he can), Israel will have to contend, probably for another five years, with a White House familiar with the old maxim that you don't get mad, you get even.
Clearly, the Prime Minister, by refusing to make a choice between settlements and American aid, is willing to take that risk.
He is committed both politically and ideologically to the notion that Jews must populate all of the biblical land of Israel that they control, including the West Bank, and he reaffirmed that point last weekend on the eve of the Jewish New Year. Like most Israelis, he is also devoutly committed to the Zionist imperative to bring the world's Jews here. So to him, any money intended for the hundreds of thousands of Soviet Jews is humanitarian aid that should have nothing to do with "political" matters like peace conferences and settlements. If push comes to shove, Foreign Minister David Levy said last week, Israelis would be prepared to live without American aid and get by "on bread and salt," a diet that presumably few of the Soviet newcomers had in mind when they left home.
 
Why Wait?
 There are also practical considerations for Israel's Government. Mr. Bush has given no signal that he will support the $10 billion package even after his 120-day cooling-off period. So why wait, officials here ask, especially when the money is needed right away and has already been counted in the 1992 budget plan?
On an even more fundamental level, Israeli leaders say Mr. Bush has handed the Arabs a gift that will encourage them to escalate their demands. Aside from the Palestinians, who are still mulling whether to bother to attend, the key Arab states agreed to peace talks without making an issue of loan guarantees. Now Mr. Bush is doing it on his own, and the Israelis say they cannot figure out why, even though they know the Arabs are dismayed at the prospect of perhaps as many as a million Soviet Jews arriving and inevitably trickling into the occupied territories. While Mr. Shamir insists that he still supports the peace process, provided that he has veto power over the Palestinian delegation, some of his advisers question the Administration's fairness as an arbiter. The fact is, many here suspect that George Bush, the Texas oilman, is inherently pro-Arab and anti-Israel.
Yet, despite the widening gap, no one rules out the possibility of compromise, and the prospects for that should become plainer tomorrow when Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d makes his seventh journey here since the end of the Persian Gulf war. The two countries remain allies, after all. Still, a senior official here said, there is no getting around the obvious: The skirmishes of recent days "cast a very troubling shadow over this whole process."

 BODY:

Pre-emptive Cocktails
 Albany's legislative leaders and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo engaged in hand-to-hand political combat this spring over the state budget, an exercise that pushed budget adoption two months past its legal deadline and left everyone involved embittered and exhausted. 
 So why were they all mingling over cocktails and canapes together at the Governor's mansion one day last week? So they don't have to go through similar brinkmanship next spring, they hope.
The Governor has convened several bipartisan task forces to discuss big budget issues like Medicaid cost containment and criminal-justice reform, even though it is more than six months before the 1992-93 state budget is to be adopted. Four of the six task forces met for the first time last Wednesday, followed at the end of the day by the conviviality session at the Governor's house.
"Maybe nothing will come of it," the Governor said later to reporters with a small shrug. "But at least we're making a sincere effort."
Legislative leaders seemed amenable to the new approach, though none said that any agreements were reached in the first round. Among them there was something less than optimism that peace would break out at the height of budget time next spring.
"It's like chicken soup," said Saul Weprin, a Queens Democrat and the chairman of the Assembly's Ways and Means Committee. "It certainly won't hurt."
Despite the bonhomie reported by many participants, it wasn't long before there was a bit of bipartisan sniping. Republicans, who control the State Senate, complained that several of their Medicaid cost-cutting ideas produced only glazed eyes among their Democratic counterparts. One idea was to institute a photo-identification system for program recipients in order to cut down on fraud. "We were the only ones who really brought anything to the table," said John Daly, a Republican State Senator from the Niagara Falls area. "The Democrats kept saying that we had to talk about long-term solutions, but there are plenty of things you could do right now."
 
The Price of Incumbency
 Despite the recession, the price of a lot of things keeps going up. Take the price of holding on to a legislative seat in Trenton.
A new study of primary campaign spending by the New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission, a state agency, has found that incumbent lawmakers, who spent just over $1 million on their primary campaigns in 1987, spent $1.6 million this year, an increase running above the rate of inflation.
All told, incumbents spent twice what challengers did in the primaries last year, and the disparity appears to be growing. The last time that both the Senate and the General Assembly were up for election, in 1987, incumbents spent 51 percent of the total amount expended; last year it was 70 percent. And while total primary spending by incumbents shot up 63 percent in that period, the spending by challengers actually dropped 23 percent. A report by the agency on general-election spending is scheduled to be issued later.
The top spender in a Senate primary was Thomas H. Paterniti, Democrat of Edison, who spent $198,000, although he wound up losing to a challenger who spent $130,000. Dick Kamin, Republican of Mount Olive, spent the most among Assembly members, $112,000, in a victorious effort.
Even bigger numbers are expected in November, with several candidates having already received $300,000 in donations two months beforehand.
 
Battle on the Thames
 The Thames River in eastern Connecticut, which forms part of the border between the 18th and 20th State Senate districts, has become a skirmish line in the fight over the state's new income tax.
Democrats would like to change the river's political course to repay a debt. District 18 is home to Senator Steven Spellman, a Democrat who provided one of the swing votes needed to pass an income tax and a budget last month after weeks of deadlock with Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. Democratic Party leaders, who mostly backed the Governor's budget overhaul plan, want to reward Mr. Spellman and help his re-election chances next year by changing the district lines. They would move the predominantly Democratic city of New London -- on the west bank of the Thames -- into Mr. Spellman's east bank district.
Republican leaders would like to make the same change, but to settle a score. District 20, on the west bank, is home to Senator Lawrence J. Bettencourt, a Republican who also voted for the income tax, to the deep consternation of his party, which stood mostly united against it. Mr. Bettencourt is vitally concerned about keeping New London in his district because he believes residents there will gain from state programs paid for by the income tax, and thank him for his tax vote in the 1992 elections.
In return for losing New London, Mr. Bettencourt's district could pick up several heavily Republican suburban towns that might not be as favorably disposed toward the income tax. Republican leaders said even before the tax vote that they would do all in their power to see that renegades like Mr. Bettencourt were punished, and their agenda in negotiating the redistricting plan has been driven by the notion that 1992 will mark the voters' revenge on all who strayed from the state's no-income-tax tradition.

 BODY:
University of Connecticut administrators are proposing $356 in new annual fee increases for room and board. The increase, coupled with previously approved increases, would raise students' costs by $673 to attend the university in the 1992-93 year. The administrators said on Friday that they had no choice but to raise fees again to keep pace with inflation and to renovate some dormitories.

HEADLINE: New York on $450 a Night (Sodas and Fruit Free)

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
At the most expensive hotel in New York City, suitcases are taken to the room by an "associate." Room service is delivered and lint is removed by a personal "maitre d'etage" wearing white tie and tails. Soft drinks, fresh fruit and local phone calls are free.
These are the courtesies that managers cite to explain why the St. Regis Hotel reopened in the middle of a recession and expects guests to pay from $350 to $450 a night when other luxury hotels nearby offer rooms for nearly $100 less. 
 Peter W. Tischmann, the managing director and vice president of ITT Sheraton, which owns the hotel, said there was no contest between the St. Regis and say, the Penninsula ($250 to $385) directly across the street on Fifth Avenue. "If you had a choice between the East Side and the West Side," Mr. Tischmann, a native of Hanover, Germany, asked primly, "what would you choose?"
The St. Regis, the ornate Art Nouveau hotel on 55th Street and Fifth Avenue that was built by John Jacob Astor in 1904, closed in June 1988 for an $100 million renovation. It opened its heavy bronze doors last week to reveal acres of sparkling crystal chandeliers, polished marble, glinting 22-karat gold-leaf moldings and a heavy dose of Old World grandeur. With it comes more than a touch of New World snobbery.
 
Leather Books, Not for Reading
 "Our rates are our rates," Mr. Tischmann said, explaining that the St. Regis would never offer corporate discounts. "Our type of customer is not going to change his life style just because of a recession."
The lobby has been scaled down into a series of smaller intimate public rooms, some oak paneled, some filled with gilded Louis XV furniture, all suggesting the drawing rooms of a French aristocrat -- before the deluge. Guests who use the equipment in the exercise room do so beneath ornate molding and in front of a watercolor mural of an 18th century chateau. Locked bookcases that line a vast second-floor library are filled with $3 million worth of leather-bound editions of Dickens, Emerson, and "The Secret Memoirs of the Royal Family of France."
The books are not for reading, however. "They are really more of our decor, now," said Patricia Jefferies, director of public relations.
The number of rooms has been decreased to 362 from 557 to provide larger baths and rooms. The occupancy rate last week hovered around 27 percent, but Mr. Tischmann said that those prosaic figures were misleading. "I would rather have the right customer than a full house," he said.
 
If You Have to Ask. . . .
 The very first guest to sign in on Tuesday (guests are preregistered and upon arrival, sign a guest book) was an Asian ambassador, who, when informed that he was the first, was feted with a bottle of champagne. The president of Venezuela is another expected guest, as well as "many other foreign dignitaries," Mr. Tischmann confided.
There is a presidential suite ($3,000 a night) and three designer suites ($1,750), but the hotel's bread and caviar is the traveling business executive. All rooms include Bijan toiletries and telephones so high-tech that they can be used to turn on the lights and television. Deluxe suites ($750) come with personal fax machines.
The St. Regis, however, does not plan to welcome conventioneers. "No conventions," Mr. Tischmann said emphatically. "We will do a board meeting if I.T.T. or I.B.M. wants a board meeting, but that is as far as we go."
Mr. Tischmann spoke dismissively of the recession that has wounded even some of New York's finest hotels. "There is always room at the top regardless of what happens." He allowed that middle-level hotels were struggling to undercut one another in the lagging economy. St. Regis customers, he said, might visit New York less or stay fewer days, but they would not stay at a lesser hotel.
 
The Wisdom of an English Butler
 To train the maitres d'etage who are assigned to each floor, the hotel hired the English butler Ivor Spencer, who runs a school for butlers in London, to teach for an intensive two weeks. Mr. Spencer instructed employees in the fine points of hotel etiquette, from extracting a noisy drunk from a public area ("Mr. So-and-So, you have a telephone call.") to the golden rule of never saying to an accompanied female guest, "Mrs. So-and-So, how nice to have you with us again."
"Part of it is natural instinct," said Grant Friedman, the 24-year-old maitre d'etage on the eighth floor, who underwent simulated etiquette crises as part of his training. "They teach us to really read the guest."
All employees are paid union wages and, from the assistant managers to the bellboys, are referred to as associates. This is part of Mr. Tischmann's "philosophy of empowerment." To instill responsibility and independence, he said, "associates must feel ownership of the overall product." He was not, however, referring to any sort of employee profit-sharing plan. "I mean psychological, mental and physical ownership," he said, "not financial."
Fine service, he said, extends even to New Yorkers visiting the Astor tea court or the King Cole Bar, home of a famous Maxfield Parrish mural and birthplace of the Bloody Mary. There were, however, a few opening week snags. When a visitor entering the Lespinasse restaurant for breakfast Friday requested cigarettes, a friendly hostess apologetically explained that the hotel did not yet provide them. When the visitor suggested that she send a bellboy out to buy some, she replied with a radiant smile, "I'm afraid I wouldn't know how to go about it."
Most customers seemed content. Mr. and Mrs. William Pershinsky of Allentown, Pa., arrived on Friday to celebrate their 40th anniversary and said they were delighted by the grandiose face lift given to the hotel they had frequented for 25 years. "Its just beautiful," Mrs. Pershinsky said with a sigh. Mr. Pershinsky looked almost relieved to learn that his favorite hotel was now the most expensive in the city. "I thought New York rates must have really gone up since last month," he said.

Students Protest Dinner's Demise At the Commons

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN

 BODY:
Several hundred Yale University students, employees and union representatives gathered near the university president's office on Beinecke Plaza in a rally last week to protest the elimination of dinner in the huge white-columned Commons dining hall. Eliminate dinner, they say, and you irrevocably damage the quality of student life.
The closing of the Commons dining hall, which was announced in the summer, is part of universitywide budget cuts of 5 to 10 percent ordered by President Benno C. Schmidt Jr. last November. Other cuts include seven junior varsity and two varsity sports teams, as well as reductions in student jobs and library services. 
 Mr. Schmidt said the budget crunch stemmed from more than the weak New England economy. "Our problem is not that we have fewer dollars but that we have to divert funding into capital investment," he said in an interview last week. Noting that most Yale buildings were built between 1929 and World War II, Mr. Schmidt said they all required extensive renovations, which are straining the university's operating budget.
Gordon Lafer, a spokesman for the Graduate Employees and Students Organization, which sponsored the rally on Wednesday, said "The budget crisis is alleged and not proven." Mr. Lafer, a graduate student in political science from Wayne, N.J., said, "All the information made public shows only one thing, that Yale is doing very well financially."
 
Dining in Individual Colleges
 Yale students say that since the university lacks a student center, dinner provides an opportunity to relax and socialize. And the dining Commons, they say, have been central to freshman dining traditions since residential colleges were established.
Yale undergraduates are divided among 12 residential colleges, each with its own living area, enclosed courtyard and dining halls. While freshmen are affiliated with a residential college, most live together on the Old Campus quadrangle and, until now, ate dinner together in the dining Commons, an arrangement intended to encourage them to get to know others outside their particular colleges.
With the closing of the dining Commons for dinner, freshmen are to eat dinner in their individual colleges. The dining hall is still open for breakfast and lunch.
"The unity of the class of 1995 has been drop-kicked to save a million dollars," said Matthew Warren, a junior from Cambridge, Mass., majoring in history. Mr. Warren spent $700 in the summer to mail 1,500 letters to students to inform them of the loss of the dining Commons. "To a significant extent my freshman year -- what I did, who I talked to -- was shaped by dinner in Commons. That was where friendships were cemented."
But Mr. Schmidt said, "The colleges are much more conducive to students really getting to know each other" because their environments are more intimate than the vast Commons. He recalled that in his freshman year at Yale, 1959, he felt "very much separated" because freshmen did not join in their individual colleges' social life.
 
A 'Haven' for Some
 Many upperclassmen say they use the dining Commons as a meeting place for large groups, like sports teams. And Justin Kim, a senior studying art from Manchester, Conn., said that for some individuals, the dining Commons provided a "haven."
"There are certain students who don't thrive in the residential college atmosphere" because their numbers are small, Mr. Kim said. "This would include students of color, students of different sexual orientations and a variety of other groups."
More than 2,200 students, almost half the undergraduate population, have signed a Yale College Council petition demanding the reinstatement of dinner in the dining Commons, said the council president, Kyu Rhee, a senior from Potomac, Md., majoring in molecular biophysics and biochemistry.
Summer letter-writing campaigns generated another 600 letters of protest, officials in the president's office said, while a hunger strike staged by Odell Huff, a senior studying economics and political science, generated considerable media attention. Mr. Huff, who is from Hemet, Calif., ended his strike last week, saying that alumni and parents "can exert more pressure than my hunger strike will."
Students said they were particularly upset that they had not been consulted regarding the budget cuts. "We live here, we work here, we study here and we know what we need," said Kathleen Newman, a second-year graduate student in American studies from Seattle who spoke at the rally.
Promising to review the changes as the semester progresses, Mr. Schmidt said, "I want to judge this on the basis of experience and not on the basis of what I think is a predictable but perhaps misleading reluctance for change."

HEADLINE: For the Soviets, Not Mere Charity

 BODY:
One way or another, the West will meet Mikhail Gorbachev's desperate plea for food to get his country through the winter. But even then, Soviet citizens will be left with a crumbling economy; they need something beyond charity.
The Soviets are poised, finally, to make the leap to a market system. The West is the only place they can turn for help; and it would be monumentally in the self-interest of the Western powers to give it. 
 Before the August coup, when Soviet hard-liners and reformers were maneuvering for power, there was a compelling case for Western engagement. Experts devised a "Grand Bargain" of targeted aid tied to reforms, intended to tilt the political scale in favor of the reformers. That rationale has dissolved. The reformers won. Yet the case for Western aid remains compelling, as Secretary of State James Baker acknowledged last week.
Economic reform will be traumatic; no country has pulled off a transition from centralized control to markets. The Soviet people, already beset by grim shortages and inflation, might well crack under the strain. As the Russian President, Boris Yeltsin, has warned, they might revert to authoritarian controls, with frightening consequences for world peace and security. By easing the strain of reform, by taking an edge off the fear, the West could help propel the Soviets irreversibly toward markets.
The essential ingredients of economic reform are unchanged. To create markets, the Soviets will have to free prices -- which have already doubled this year. They will also have to plug gaping deficits so they can stop printing money. That will require eliminating subsidies to inefficient businesses, which would throw tens of millions out of work. Then, amid the turmoil, factories, stores and other property will have to be stripped away from government ministries and put into private hands. These are frightening steps, which Mikhail Gorbachev has repeatedly evaded.
The immediate need is for money to import consumer goods during the initial stages of price decontrol and to set up currency stabilization funds. These funds would be used to maintain the exchange value of the ruble, thereby reassuring traders and investors. The reform package would include no blank checks; instead, aid would be directed at specific, irreversible market reforms. And the U.S. share need not exceed a modest $3 billion a year for five years.
For economic reform to work, the republics will have to cooperate. Each will have to forswear the use of internal trade barriers, maintain strict control over currency, protect legal contracts and assume partial responsibility for the union's debt and military costs. If cooperation among 15 republics proves impossible, the West could work with just Russia, the Ukraine and, say, the Baltics. That would cover more than 80 percent of the economy.
Western engagement would incur decided risks. The political revolution is only in its first stage; the old guard still controls key ministries and nearly all the factories. Unless the Western assistance is carefully targeted, it could solidify the power of these bureaucrats.
Yet the best way to release the bureaucrats' stranglehold over the economy is competition. As Western engagement hastens price reform, budget discipline and privatization, the old order will be smashed beyond repair. And that would be in the interest of prosperity, peace and freedom far beyond the boundaries of the old Soviet empire.

North American Model

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The breakup of the Soviet Union into as many as 15 independent republics will neither ameliorate their deep economic problems nor fail to exacerbate even deeper internal conflicts. The need for some kind of stable, federal structure is obvious. 
 For more than a century in Canada, and for two centuries in the United States, there have been viable models for such a structure. Neither model, Canadians and Americans will quickly affirm, is perfect, but despite periodic crises and chronic complaints, their federal systems have fused stability with freedom and prosperity in vast, diverse territories. The 1780's in the United States, and the 1860's in British North America, though far distant in time, had some of the same desperate features as the Soviet crisis. Those concerned with the crisis, and with the predictable results of its runaway secessionism, could do worse than look closely at these Canadian and American federal models.

Mirror-Image Fallacy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Anthony Lewis in "E Pluribus Unum?" (column, Sept. 6) reflects the mirror-image thinking about the Soviet Union that has continually contributed to flawed United States policy toward the Soviet Union. The United States cannot and will not serve as a model for a new Soviet Union. Our states were settled by individuals who left their native land. The populations of the former Soviet republics are living on their historic lands with separate and distinct languages, cultures, histories and religions. 
 There is no doubt that the newly independent nations of the former union will maintain economic ties to one another through bilateral and multilateral treaties. A confederation is also a possibility, but on the model of the European Community -- an association of independent nations, rather than the United States.
If the United States is to play a role in the peaceful transition, we must understand that the Soviet Union was never a nation as we know it. It was an empire and now, like most empires, it has disintegrated into true nations.

Sun City Is Stood Up By Guest Of Honor

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: VENICE, Calif., Sept. 14

 BODY:
In this, the land of the endless summer, summer never came. Where bathing suits and deep tans were once the order of the day, pale skin and long sleeves made a comeback.
This summer, now in its final days, may have been a disappointment for sun worshipers, but for the merchants whose shops and stands line the Venice boardwalk it has been a disaster. Under cloudy skies more typical of San Francisco than Los Angeles, the customary mass exodus to the beach that keeps lifeguards busy, police officers on edge and businesses alive never materialized. 
 "Only thing we worry about is weather," said Yong No, owner of the Mr. No Poster Shop. Gazing in dismay as a handful of people strolled on the boardwalk under a ceiling of clouds that stretched over the ocean, Mr. No said "we're not so good" when the weather is bad. This year, he added, business has been off by about 30 percent.
Mr. No and his neighbors knew the recession would keep away many of the tourists who descend every summer on this Los Angeles neighborhood. But nature dealt them another, and unexpected, blow.
Heat waves are a regular feature of Los Angeles summers, sending temperatures soaring above 100 degrees and baking airborne chemicals into a toxic brown haze. The scorching weather and smog can usually be counted on to drive people by the hundreds of thousands to the sea in search of relief.
But this year the sun barely put in an appearance. Fog enveloped the coast for much of the summer, a pair of rare July storms pelted the parched city with rain, and the temperature in downtown Los Angeles topped 90 degrees only once.
Los Angeles County's lifeguard corps reported that beach attendance in June and July lagged more than 30 percent behind last year's figures, and was about average in August. With fewer people braving the unseasonably chilly water, lifeguards rescued only 3,191 people over the three-month period, as against 5,310 last year and 5,770 in 1989.
Boardwalk merchants, who rely on a summer financial boom to carry them through the winter, said the gray skies were responsible for the decline in business, which they said averaged more than 20 percent compared to last year.
"Usually, I get like 50, 60 people a day," said a psychic who identified herself only as Crystal, a former New Yorker who offers palm, tarot card and crystal-ball readings at her boardwalk apartment. "This year it's more like 20."
At the Sidewalk Cafe, where long lines were a given in years past, an outdoor table with a view of the beach and the Santa Monica Mountains often could be had without a wait this summer.
"We didn't get the early beach crowd that comes in for breakfast, or the usual crowd that comes in after the beach," said Patrick J. Good, manager of the restaurant. "All we got was the tourists, and there weren't many of them. If they do have something to eat, they don't spend as much."
Speaking over the reggae music that blared from the stereo in his All One People clothing shop, Richard A. Nutting acknowledged that this summer his business was the slowest he had seen in the 10 years he had been on the boardwalk.
"The weather affected us a lot," he said. "June and July were just the worst." Even when the weather improved somewhat in August, he added, "for most people it never picked up."
Not everyone was disappointed by the cool weather and thin crowds.
"The incidents of violence were considerably reduced," said Lieut. Jerry C. Szymanski, commander of the Los Angeles police unit that patrols the boardwalk and beach. "We had a remarkably quiet summer."
Labor Day weekend usually produces the last major beach crowd of the summer, but the dreary season ended much as it had begun, with overcast skies. Most boardwalk merchants conceded that as Labor Day passed so did their last chance at a bonanza that might have partially redeemed a dismal year. But a few held out hope.
"California summers are long and winters not so cold," Mr. No said, suggesting that business could get better. Gesturing at the racks in his shop, he added: "We sell clothes. And people need clothes year round, right?"

CORRECTION-DATE: September 22, 1991, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
A "Venice Journal" from California last Sunday, about the cloudy weather that afflicted Los Angeles's beaches this summer, misattributed a quotation. It was Richard A. Nutting of the All One People clothing shop, not Yong No of the Mr. No Poster Shop, who said: "We sell clothes. And people need clothes year round, right?"

HEADLINE: Landmarks of the Loop

BYLINE: By SUZANNE WINCKLER; SUZANNE WINCKLER is the author of the Great Lakes and the Plains States volumes of "The Smithsonian Guides to Historic America" (Stewart Tabori & Chang).

 BODY:
I WAS walking up Michigan Avenue in the shoppers' nirvana that Chicagoans call the Magnificent Mile. Even though it was Sunday, the sidewalk was elbow-to-elbow people, so I didn't have to strain to hear the father say to his son, "There was a big fire, and the city burned down."
"Hot dog!" I thought to myself. Here was at least anecdotal confirmation of some of my cherished thoughts about Chicago. 
 First observation: many of the events that define the city -- and in some cases the nation -- are so compelling that even as the incidents recede in time they retain an indelible, cinematic richness. The Great Fire of 1871 is still a topic of conversation on the streets of Chicago. After all, what could be more dramatic, to child and grownup alike, than a conflagration that turned a boomtown into a heap of ashes?
The Great Fire burned out of control for three days, set ablaze 2,000 acres of Chicago, killed 300 people, left 90,000 homeless and created what is probably the most famous open space in America. A collection of stellar architects -- the list includes William Le Baron Jenney, Daniel Burnham, John Wellborn Root, Louis Sullivan, Dankmar Adler, William Holabird, Martin Roche and Frank Lloyd Wright -- were working in Chicago (or soon to be; Wright was only 4 years old at the time of the fire).
Upon this charred ground they assembled a host of remarkably timeless structures. Numerous grand examples of the works of these architects still stand in the Loop. (This zone in downtown Chicago is generally defined as west of Lake Michigan, east of the south branch of the Chicago River, south of the main branch of the Chicago River, and north of West Congress Parkway.)
These turn-of-the-century buildings are not only beautiful to behold; they also bear witness to the evolutionary history of the skyscraper, the one building form that above all others has come to signify American cities today. I can't imagine taking a trip to Chicago without going to the Loop to pay my respects to these landmarks.
If you are unable to take the Chicago Architecture Foundation's two-hour walking tour of the Loop, wander on your own with a guidebook (Ira J. Bach and Susan Wolfson's "Chicago on Foot" and Richard Saul Wurman's "Chicago Access" are both good). It is difficult, if not impossible, to recommend a must-see roster of landmarks, but such a list would include:
* The Monadnock Building (53 West Jackson Boulevard). The north half, completed in 1891, was designed by Burnham and Root; the south half, 1893, by Holabird and Roche. The newer half of the building uses steel-frame construction; this engineering innovation speeded the construction of buildings and kept costs down; it also allowed engineers to take buildings ever higher. By contrast, in the Burnham and Root portion, the walls are load-bearing, the antediluvian method of construction that was more painstaking, more expensive and that also restricted the height of buildings. The higher the building, the thicker the bases of the walls must be, and the less rentable floor space there will be. Hence, developers trying to recoup their investments started losing interest in structures with load-bearing walls. Burnham and Root's portion on the Monadnock is the tallest of its type. Note the massively thick bases and the odd-sized handmade brick; Burnham and Root not surprisingly experienced cost overruns. Stand at a corner and with your eye follow the edge of the building up to the sky. The graceful, bird-wing curve of the ascending wall is one of the most tranquil spectacles in urban America.
* The Marquette Building (140 South Dearborn Street). Chicago buildings, old and new, are famous for their lobbies, and the one in this classic 1894 Holabird and Roche structure is no exception. The mosaic murals and bas-relief busts commemorate Father Jacques Marquette who, with Louis Jolliet and the help of an Indian entourage, was the first European to set eyes on the Mississippi River in 1673. The space is a symphony of Tiffany glass, mother of pearl and marble. As you enter the revolving doors, note the time-polished panther-head door handles and the tomahawks on the kickplates. The sculptor of the panther heads was Edward Kemeys, who is better known for the lions that stand at the entrance to the Art Institute of Chicago, at Michigan Avenue and Adams Street.
* The Rookery (209 South LaSalle Street). This 1888 Burnham & Root office is one of Chicago's most venerable buildings and a model of the most-difficult-to-pull-off 19th-century rock-pile style, called Romanesque. The Rookery is an elephant en pointe, a pile of rock so ineffably graceful it almost soars. In 1905 Frank Lloyd Wright remodeled the lobby, and his now-famous design is currently being restored.
The handiwork of these post-inferno architects remains a kind of provocation for today's pre-eminent designers, which explains why Chicago continues to be the place where architects and engineers are drawn to display their design prowess. Their work is not all vainglory. It has become almost a design imperative in Chicago that the new achievers pay homage to their antecedents.
Examples: John Burgee and Philip Johnson's brand-new 190 South LaSalle Street, so grand it verges on grandiloquent, pays its respects to the much shorter but still mighty Rookery Building, which stands across the street, as well as to the long-razed 1892 Masonic Temple of John Wellborn Root. The NBC Tower (200 East Illinois Street), a Skidmore, Owings & Merrill building completed in 1989, is embellished with very modern renditions of the Gothic flying buttresses that adorn the nearby Tribune Tower (435 North Michigan Avenue), which dates to 1925. Besides the fact that architectural critics and historians love to bask in historical references of this sort, the allusions are real.
Returning to the father and son, observation No. 2: the history of Chicago is not only vivid; it is so crystalline that one of the city's pivotal moments can be explained in a sentence of monosyllables. "There was a big fire, and the city burned down." You can hardly be more concise.
Of the American cities I have visited, Chicago has always been the easiest to read. I don't mean to imply that its history is simple -- it is not -- but rather that the city reveals its narrative with an amazing degree of ease and grace.
This is partly because Chicago has preserved a wealth of landmarks; partly because, as mentioned, many of its new structures are variations on time-honored architectural themes, and partly because Chicago's original reasons for being -- as a center of trade and transportation -- are still the main engines that drive the city.
When, for instance, you walk from Grant Park, Daniel Burnham's magnificent public space skirting Lake Michigan, along the north side of the Art Institute of Chicago, you cross over the huge Illinois Central Railroad yard. Here commerce and trade and art and culture stand shoulder to shoulder. William Cronon's masterful new book, "Nature's Metropolis: Chicago and the Great West," is about the labyrinthine bond between a city and its outlying countryside. Even with so complicated a topic, Chicago obliges the tourist and the historian with ample proof of the country-city bond.
There is another reason for what you might call Chicago's historical candor. Chicagoans themselves have made their city remarkably accessible to outlanders. On any given day, a visitor can choose from a dozen or so walking, bus or boat tours of the city sponsored by the Chicago Architecture Foundation; (312) 782-1776; after February, (312) 922-8687.
Perhaps my interests in history lean toward the maudlin, but high on my list of first inducements to visit Chicago turned on the tragic fates of two men, the frontiersman William Wells (one of the neglected figures in American history) and the great architect Louis Sullivan.
As a child in the Ohio Valley, William Wells was kidnapped and raised by the Miami Indians. He was fully -- and happily, it seems -- integrated in the world of the Miami, but as an adult decided to rejoin his white kin, in large part, historians believe, because he saw the writing on the wall: that the American Indians' cultures were doomed. He became a scout, interpreter and Indian agent, while maintaining his friendship with the Miami and other tribes.
During the early days of the War of 1812, Wells was summoned to the small frontier outpost of Chicago to try to negotiate with the pro-British Indians for the safe passage of the occupants of Fort Dearborn. He failed. Then, apparently knowing full well he would fail at his next enterprise as well, he dressed in Indian regalia, got on his horse and led the flight of men, women and children from Fort Dearborn on Aug. 15, 1812. He and half the party were massacred several miles south of the fort by Potawatomi Indians.
As much as I wanted to see 19th- and 20th-century masterworks of architecture, I also wanted to visit the town where William Wells died. Nothing remains of Fort Dearborn, but there are historical plaques marking the site where East Wacker Drive meets North Michigan Avenue at the Chicago River in the heart of downtown Chicago. The intersection bustles with pedestrians, cars, taxis and buses. And the landscape is gilded with some of Chicago's most famous architectural specimens: the wedding-cake Wrigley Building (constructed in 1921); the cathedral-like Tribune Tower (1925); the bizarre honeycombed residential towers of Bertrand Goldberg's Marina City (1967), and the cool, calm I.B.M. Building (1971), last work of Chicago's most famous modernist, Mies van der Rohe.
As for Louis Sullivan, the architect was his own nemesis; he drank too much, was prone to tantrums (a colleague once described one of Sullivan's outbursts as an "arrogant fit of absurd petulance") and vexed by a cast of personal demons. Sullivan was born in Boston in 1856; he practiced architecture most of his adult life in Chicago, where he cut a flamboyant swath; he died in 1924 in a Chicago hotel penniless and almost friendless.
Of all the post-inferno architects, Sullivan has always been my favorite. He designed sublime buildings and, with a host of equally talented designers he drew around himself, ornamented these buildings in imaginatively beautiful ways. It is a puzzle how a mortal whose existence was so dark and woebegone could make such exhilarating places. When I am in Chicago, I make the rounds of as many of the Sullivan shrines as I can. They include:
* The Auditorium Building (South Michigan Avenue at Congress Parkway), a Sullivan and Dankmar Adler project completed in 1890, which includes the gorgeous, cavernous Auditorium Theater, one of the most famous performance spaces in Chicago.
* The Trading Room and Entry Arch of Adler and Sullivan's 1893-94 Chicago Stock Exchange Building. Both fragments of the now-demolished structure can be seen at the Art Institute of Chicago.
* Holy Trinity Orthodox Cathedral (Leavitt Street and Haddon Avenue), an intimate stucco church Sullivan designed in 1903 for a Russian Orthodox congregation. The church is well outside of the Loop, and a visit requires access to a car or taxi.
* Carson Pirie Scott (1 South State Street), on Chicago's once-great mercantile boulevard. (Although Carson Pirie Scott is still a department store, upscale Chicago shoppers have been enticed northward to the Magnificent Mile on Michigan Avenue north of the Chicago River.) Carson Pirie Scott, which dates to 1899, is a serene, sophisticated structure to which Sullivan affixed over the entryway a sensational encrustation of cast iron ornamentation.
There comes a time, however, usually an hour or two into hiking on hard pavement, when this pilgrim gets footsore and hungry, when even the handiwork of Louis Sullivan fails to uplift.
The Loop is short on public places to sit down. These are the three I recommend: the steps of the Art Institute of Chicago, where there are many kinds of people to watch and usually some impromptu entertainment; the breakwater of the Chicago Yacht Club, on the east edge of Grant Park, where the fittings of all the moored sailboats jingle like an orchestra of windchimes, and the benches around Marc Chagall's "Four Seasons" mural in the plaza of First National Bank of Chicago, at the corner of West Monroe and South Dearborn Streets.
The Loop and vicinity provide such an impressive selection of restaurants, ranging from the dear to the economical, that you could easily spend all your time and money on the culinary trail. On the western fringe of the Loop, Lou Mitchell's (565 West Jackson Boulevard) is a great Chicago institution for breakfast and lunch. In a nation where a good cup of coffee is increasingly difficult to find, Lou Mitchell's is a historic landmark on the basis of its coffee alone.

HEADLINE: Coming to the Rescue of Vintage Pianos

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

DATELINE: GOLDENS BRIDGE

 BODY:
A 1907 Steinway A piano dominates the living room of the Gordon house here. Russell H. Gordon is a piano craftsman and technician and a member of the second generation of his family to ply his trade from a small workshop in the family homestead built by his parents and grandparents 50 years ago.
"This particular Steinway pretty well illustrates the unique aspects of my business," Mr. Gordon said the other day. "It was a shell when I bought it. The pads were completely worn out; it needed everything. But over a period of three to four months I completely rebuilt it." 
 Among other things, he installed a type of key and hammer action that only recently became available. "Now I have a magnificent instrument for about half the price that I'd have had to pay for a comparable piano new," he said. "An added bonus is that the 1907 piano has a much finer case than is available in pianos today."
 
Comparing the Costs
 Although completely rebuilding an old piano takes several months and costs $12,000 to $15,000, a comparable new Steinway costs about $38,000, Mr. Gordon said.
Mr. Gordon, who is 41, recalls that although he helped his father in the shop when he was in high school and college, in those days he had no intention of following in his father's footsteps.
"My dad is Paul Gordon," Mr. Gordon said. "He was a recording engineer for Columbia Records and a fine pianist as well. He started the shop in the early 1950's, mainly because he was interested in sound. He quickly won a reputation for his ability to restore tone to vintage pianos."
 
Rethinking Biochemistry
 But Russell Gordon became a biochemist who worked with the United States Geological Society for several years before he came back to Goldens Bridge and apprenticed with his father.
"I chose to become a craftsman instead of a biochemist because this kind of life better suits my temperament," he said. "I'll never get rich, but I find the work extremely satisfying."
By having a small shop, he added, "I have enough time to pay attention to the details that each piano needs, to restore tone and touch to it for another lifetime of use."
 
Tuning and Restoring
 For private owners, Mr. Gordon has restored an 1820 Clementi piano, an 1899 Mason & Hamlin reed organ and many Steinways, including one owned by the DeWitt Wallaces, founders of Reader's Digest. He also works on the pianos in the Caramoor Music Room in Katonah.
"Most of my business comes from word-of-mouth recommendations," he said. "About half of my income is derived from tuning pianos, the other half from restoring them."
It was the combination of a scientific background and piano craftsmanship that two years ago led him to David C. Stanwood, a piano technician in Vineyard Haven, Mass., who four years ago developed a type of key and hammer action for the grand piano called the Stanwood Action.
"David Stanwood has made a revolutionary advance in piano technology," Mr. Gordon said. "For a pianist, who is dependent on piano action, the Stanwood Action is tremendous because it makes the touch 100 percent uniform and adjustable, which means actions can be customized for individual players and even for different musical styles."
 
Compensating for Wear and Tear
 What is remarkable, he said, is that the uniformity of action can be maintained over time because it compensates for the effects of wear and tear and seasonal changes. "Pianists say that with the Stanwood Action they have exceptional artistic control and responsiveness, especially during soft passages," he said.
Mr. Gordon, who is president of the New York City chapter of the Craftsman Piano Technicians Guild, a professional organization that confers accreditation on its members, is one of the few technicians licensed to use the Stanwood Action method of adjusting keyboard weights and hammer friction.
"I've installed four actions in Westchester, and they have received strong endorsements from everyone who has played on the pianos, including concert pianists and piano technicians," he said, adding that performance pianos modified with the Stanwood Action include a Steinway D at the Manhattan School of Music, a Steinway C at the Old Whaling Church Performing Arts Center of Martha's Vineyard in Edgartown and a Bechstein D at the Fogg Museum at Harvard College. About 35 Stanwood Actions are in private use.
 
'Connected to the Piano'
 After playing on Mr. Gordon's Steinway A with the Stanwood Action, Mary Ann Scialdo, a concert pianist who teaches music at the Todd School in Briarcliff Manor, said, "It's extraordinary. The action is so even that you actually feel connected to the piano. My technical facility was so enhanced that I had the freedom to be a colorist. If it were a car, it would be a Ferrari, not a Ford."
Emphasizing that pianists are very dependent on piano technicians, Ms. Scialdo said, "Russell Gordon just doesn't tune a piano. He's a talented artist dedicated to the art of sound."
Two years ago when she had an important performance on a Sunday, she said, "I was given a dog of a piano. I was so distraught, I called Russell, who came to the hall immediately and adjusted it. He stayed with me during the entire concert, making other adjustments as were needed. What a miserable piano that was!"
Even two pianos of the same age built by the same manufacturer will sound different, Mr. Gordon said. "A good piano technician can evaluate the tone and action and spot some of the flaws in its manufacture," he said. "In the 50's, for example, plastic parts were used, which now may have to be replaced in those pianos."
 
A Recession-Proof Business
 Mr. Gordon advises tuning home pianos twice a year. He charges $80 to $90 for a basic tuning, depending on how far he has to travel. The recession has had a minimal effect on his business, he said.
"I work in a very specialized area," he said. "Few clients have cut back on tunings. Actually, I've been pretty busy. My dad, who lives in Florida most of the year, was here this summer, and I was able to keep him busy working for me."
The cost of installing a Stanwood Action, he said, can be anywhere from $2,500 to $5,500, including parts. "If existing parts can be modified, it will be less," he said, "but if new modified parts have to be installed, it will be more."
As for the electronic-keyboard craze, Mr. Gordon said it has had no effect on his business. "No matter how it's programmed, the sound is still coming through speakers," he said. "No electric keyboard is a substitute for a piano."

Gordon returned to his family's roots to become a piano craftsman and technician, operating from the Goldens Bridge shop where his father restored vintage pianos before him.

SMART SCHOOLS, SMART KIDS
Why Do Some Schools Work?
By Edward B. Fiske with Sally Reed
and R. Craig Sautter.
303 pp. New York: Simon & Schuster. $21.95.  
 Public education in America needs to change. In "Smart Schools, Smart Kids," Edward B. Fiske, the former education correspondent of The New York Times, argues that the prevailing model for education, a model that dates back at least to the beginning of this century, is the factory. In his view, American schools are, in effect, factories for turning out perfect little minds; they are centrally managed, efficient and regulated, and the teachers are supposed to rely on repetitive pedagogical techniques, rigid scheduling and standardized texts and tests. But just as corporations are abandoning rigid and centralized workplaces in favor of decentralized ones that encourage cooperation and allow for flexible schedules and new standards of quality control, so American schools must find a new example to follow. Mr. Fiske, who is now a visiting scholar at the school of education at Stanford University, proposes that schools should now model themselves on "smart" machines.
"Smart" machines are computers that can receive new information and alter their own inner workings accordingly. "The functioning of a modern democracy requires citizens with similar skills" to those of a smart machine, Mr. Fiske writes. And since the economy now demands workers who are "smart" in this sense, Mr. Fiske believes that we need "smart" schools that will turn out such "smart" citizens. In fact, he thinks the transformation of public schools is already taking place. In cities, in suburbs and in rural towns, teachers, administrators, parents and politicians are rethinking and reshaping their schools. The trouble is that most of the reformers are working in relative isolation, only dimly aware of similar efforts in other places.
The strength of "Smart Schools, Smart Kids" lies in its detailed descriptions of the many types of educational reforms across the United States, from Miami to Louisville, Ky., from the Shenandoah Valley to Cambridge, Mass., from Hannibal, Mo. to Silverdale, Wash. Mr. Fiske tells of schools that are managed from the inside rather than by a board of education, schools that stress cooperative learning rather than competition among students, schools that use flexible schedules rather than following the regimented 8-to-3 clock, schools that assess a child's development without traditional tests and schools that use new computers as easily as they once used pencils and paper.
Mr. Fiske, for instance, visits an 11th grade American history class in a school on the outskirts of Louisville taught by Jim Streible, a former coach. Rather than lecturing his students, he splits up the class into clusters. "One group of students," writes Mr. Fiske, "is having an animated discussion about a short play they are writing about life in the 1920's and 1930's. Across the room another cluster of students is putting the final touches on a video documentary on the life of D. W. Griffith. . . . A third group . . . is over near the lockers trying on period costumes to wear when they will dance the Charleston . . . while a fourth group is finishing up a gigantic Hooverville house constructed from cardboard." Mr. Fiske writes that "Jim Streible is raising students, if not from the dead, then at least from deadly apathy."
Some of the changes Mr. Fiske documents are surprising, others obvious. Teachers now use copy machines and telephones in their classrooms, and they are learning, like the new wave of enlightened industrial managers, to become leaders rather than authorities. Students now help shape their educations, and often decide to take more or less than the traditional 12 years to complete their schooling. Multiple choice tests that were used to measure how much material students had covered and how many hours they had sat at their desks are now giving way to "authentic tests" that allow students to demonstrate what they can actually do with their knowledge and skills. And parents, no longer relegated to the sidelines, are now invited to make informed choices about their children's schooling. If these changes sound less than radical, remember that the norm in American public education is about as up-to-date as a Model T Ford.
What is missing in this book is a discussion of how teachers are being prepared for their new roles, how the various teachers' colleges and schools of education are redesigning the teaching profession. Mr. Fiske says there are no such institutions cultivating the new generation of "smart" teachers. Indeed, he argues that teacher education is "the black hole in the movement to create smart schools." But if he had defined his subject more broadly, to include not only the schooling that teachers must go through before they begin to teach but also the variety of ways that they continue to learn while they are working, he might have found enough material to fill another book. Perhaps a book titled "Smart Teachers" will follow.
Still, "Smart Schools, Smart Kids" describes many schools that work -- schools that will help make responsible citizens and good thinkers. And that is a small but significant contribution to the transformation of a basic American institution.

HEADLINE: CONNECTICUT Q&A: ALLAN A. CRYSTAL;
State's Tax Chief Welcomes a New Era

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
ON Feb. 1 Allan A. Crystal was appointed Commissioner of the State Department of Revenue Services. With the implementation of a state income tax on Sept. 1, and withholding scheduled to start on Oct. 1, no other state agency has seen so much change in the way it does business this year.
The 4.5 percent income tax, the first to become effective in state history, has several tax credits and exemptions designed to make it progressive. But critics contend that these provisions will make the tax unwieldy and confusing. Mr. Crystal will also oversee a lowering of the sales tax, to 6 percent from 8, a broadening of the items and services subject to the sales tax and numerous other changes in the tax structure. 
 A certified public accountant and lawyer, Mr. Crystal retired as a vice president for corporate taxes at Pitney Bowes in Stamford, and has held executive positions with C.I.T. Financial Corporation and the accounting firm of Lavanthol & Horvath in Manhattan. Mr. Crystal, who is 62 years old, lives in Westport. He is active in several business and civic organizations, including the Internal Revenue Service Volunteer Income Tax Assistance program.
He answered questions about the implementation of the income tax recently during an interview at his office overlooking Farmington Avenue in Hartford. Here are excerpts from the conversation.
Q. When you agreed to come on as tax commissioner, were you aware you would be embroiled in what will likely be the most controversial issue of Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.'s first term?
A. It certainly appeared the state had a serious fiscal problem, and one of the possible ways of solving it was an income tax. And it did intrigue me, being involved in such an implementation.
Q. Will the Oct. 1 deadline leave you enough time to get regulations printed and distributed to employers?
A. It depends on what you mean by regulations. The Oct. 1 target date relates to changes in the sales and use taxes and excise taxes. Those are principally announcements that we can get out in time for people to put into effect for Oct. 1. The other issue relates to the income tax itself, and withholding, which commences with payrolls paid on or after Oct. 1. We are gearing ourselves to get every bit of information that we conceivably can by the third week of September. It takes a little time to prepare the tables. Unfortunately, we didn't have all the time we thought we'd need.
Q. Your predecessor began a study of how to implement the income tax. Is that going to help in the process?
A. Jim Meehan had set up a committee to take a look at implementation issues, and I continued that committee, so we built on what he initiated. I think the committee did a lot of good work before I got here and still more good work once I got here.
Q. Will you be monitoring Federal tax returns to make sure people are reporting all the income to the state that they are reporting to the Internal Revenue Service?
A. To a great extent we have been using Federal Internal Revenue data interchange for the purpose of verifying capital gains, interest and dividends taxes that we've had so far. We'll use the same process to check adjusted gross income and make sure they are reporting the same numbers to the state and Federal governments.
Q. Do you have any cooperative agreements with neighboring states to facilitate collection from people who live in one state and work in another?
A. Well, there is not that kind of coordination with New York, Massachusetts and Rhode Island. First of all, people who live in Connecticut and work in New York will be having their tax withheld and may have an estimated tax requirement, and the same thing will now be required of people who work in Connecticut but live in New York.
Each state taxes are based on where you earn the wages. Then in the state where they file a return, they can usually get a credit for the tax that was withheld from the other state. Both states are doing somewhat the same thing. The formulas are a bit different, but the results are the same.
Q. Do you anticipate any confusion over state adjusted gross income and Federal adjusted gross income?
A. There should not be much confusion, because there are only modest changes, and the people who have the changes will probably be using outside assistance -- certified public accountants and lawyers -- who should understand the rules.
Q. Will you be setting up any special telephone lines to answer taxpayer questions?
A. Absolutely. We are setting up, and it is operating today, a hot line. The number is (800) 3-TAXINFO. As a matter of fact, we're adding special hours. Some of our taxpayer service people will be working late Thursday nights and four hours on Saturdays.
Q. Will there be special training for tax preparers?
A. We will be participating in organizational activities, that is to say the Connecticut Society of Certified Public Accountants, the Bar Association, the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, all of those organizations who bring in their members for tax information sessions, we will be appearing before them in one way or another. We have a speakers bureau that we're in the process of training, whose people will be able to go out and review the tax changes in detail. The biggest problem, we feel, is getting the information out to taxpayers who we feel want to comply but need information.
Q. Will you be using the same April 15 filing deadline used by the Federal Government?
A. Ultimately, yes. The filing date for the final annual return will be April 15. In that same way, we have matched a lot of our key dates with the Federal dates. For example, the withholding remittance by employers will be made at the same time as they remit tax payments to the Federal Government.
Q. Connecticut has been accused of having a patchwork of taxes. This doesn't lift any taxes, so isn't it just a new patch?
A. That is, indeed, one way of looking at it. But come back and look at it from the beginning. The patchwork existed because there was no personal income tax. What you should ask is, should there be a revision of some of the patches? That is something that, conceivably, the new Tax Review Board would be looking at.
Q. Is there any indication how much it will cost to implement tax reform?
A. Legislatures make changes all the time. Every time they change the sales tax, there is a cost associated with it. We have, provided to us by the legislature, $8 million for the implementation. That number, maybe, should be a touch higher, but if we have to live within that, we'll live within it. Certainly the $8 million is less than comparable numbers from other states. The income tax is expected to collect just over $1 billion this year.
Q. What do you think will be the most confusing thing for taxpayers this year?
A. Most people are concerned with how much and how am I going to pay. But most people are not thinking about anything beyond that. They should be realizing that in addition to the income tax there is a reduction in their sales tax cost, from 8 percent to 6 percent. Those people who itemize deductions on their Federal income tax returns get the benefit of a tax credit for the state income tax they pay, so that there is a net increase, the actual cost, that people are not focusing on.
Q. The I.R.S. notices an increase of taxpayer protests, some of them involving violence, in a bad economy. Do you anticipate any of that because Connecticut is imposing an income tax for the first time in what is a poor economy?
A. Well, it is certainly possible people may protest in some way, that it could be expected. Connecticut has some advocates of repeal. But I don't believe it's necessary for us to take any precautions. I think people understand taxes are something people need to pay. They may quarrel over how those taxes are raised, they may even quarrel about whether the expenditures are necessary, but neither one of those are a function of this department, and I would hope most people would realize that and not vent their spleen on the tax department.
Q. Is a new income tax likely to force more of the economy underground?
A. I would be surprised if much of that happens on account of the Connecticut income tax.
The biggest bite of all, of course, is the Federal tax, and if they were going to do it at all, they would have already done it because of the Federal income tax. I really don't anticipate much of that.

CORRECTION-DATE: September 22, 1991, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
The Connecticut Q&A column last Sunday, about the state income tax, rendered a sentence incorrectly in a discussion of confusing aspects of the tax by Allan A. Crystal, the State Commissioner of Revenue Services. The affected sentence should have read, "Those people who itemize deductions on their Federal income tax returns get the benefit of a tax credit for the state income tax they pay, so that there is a net decrease, the actual cost, that people are not focusing on."

HEADLINE: Beauty/Fashion;
The Mirror Cracked

BYLINE: By Marcelle Clements; Marcelle Clements writes frequently on cultural and political topics.

 BODY:
IT USED TO BE THAT BEAUTY WAS IN the eye of the beholder, but these days the beholder doesn't know where to look.
How do you express fragmentation and still have fun? Mix and match. Many people laughed at fans of the post-modern esthetic for quoting from a hodgepodge of traditions, but now it's permissible to combine elements from many classes, subcultures, erotic types, eras. What's beautiful now is the Composite. In their age-old quest to solve the problem of self-presentation, women have marched into this stylistic breach with both gusto and anxiety. What's more, all kinds of women mix and match: style-obsessed women, offhand women, frivolous women and serious women. 
 Nowadays, there's unprecedented interest in style, and newcomers to the arena add their own remarkable juxtapositions. Some of the new combos are unsettling: octogenarians wearing mascara, once-dowdy suburbanites sporting new breasts, Park Avenue ladies in blaster jewelry. Others, rare until very recently, are now common: female attorneys wear sling-back heels, homemakers wear black lace lingerie and librarians wear foundation.
This development and the deep-structure changes that underlie it are so exciting and confusing that a women's discourse has surfaced around it. Much of the discussion centers on the business of beauty. But the business of beauty is tangential. The purpose of "fashion" is not merely to make money for an anonymous "industry." Aside from the pleasure and pain it gives, what matters about beauty is whether and how it reflects and changes consciousness.
In the bombardment of new female images, it has become impossible to hold on to a unified esthetic. This is in part because the role of women has changed so much in the last several decades that previously undisturbed geological layers of our psyches are being excavated and require expression.
Some of the images do their work subterraneously. For instance, we all talk and talk about "Thelma and Louise," but perhaps more eloquently the daily newspaper shows us photographs of business women, scientists, astronauts and cops. We want to know what they're doing and what they're wearing. And why not? Like myths and dreams, fashion provides texts that are enactments of our realizations about ourselves.
Every change in the culture, certainly in the female culture, is much documented and photographed. Thanks to the plentiful visual record, we are constantly looking at one another. Female firefighters and fashion models and executives and heads of state are looking at one another, and they get their ideas of how they want to present themselves from one another. What's more, we have available to us elements of male archetypes, other ethnic groups and classes and a wonderful grab bag of serendipitous abstractions. Why shouldn't we use them if we feel like it? There's no stopping us now. If there's no stopping us now, there's no resting point for the eye. All is flux.
WOMEN ARE TRYING TO GET THEIR INSIDES TO match their outsides. No wonder they're having trouble.
Women are in the process of a tremendous and very complicated adaptation to an incomprehensible culture. Women are pretty complicated to begin with, and present all sorts of inside-outside enigmas that have yet to be solved, psychologically or physiologically. Certainly, nobody understands women's sexuality. Once unleashed, fashion and beauty, which express sexuality, can eloquently refract its primitive mysteries and modern contradictions. We may not understand it, but we can enjoy it. And the struggle to generate an esthetic system complex enough to encompass and express a woman's innate erotic intricacy can be a worthy (and amusing) task.
To tell the truth is empowering. Even visual expressions of women's passivity, their role as penetrable beings, when acknowledged in a clever or moving way, empowers them. (In our marketplace of images, a nursing mother is as powerful as a warrior.)
CROSS-GENDER referencing, formerly repulsive, frightening, declasse, and illegal (or, at best, decadently elitist), is now universally considered to be cool and sexy.
The September issue of Playboy magazine features a sympathetic piece about a transsexual, "the extraordinary story of a beautiful woman who was born a boy." The text is accompanied by photographs of Tula, who has truly superb breasts and thighs, stripping from a man's business suit to a loosened tie and garter belt. The photographs are endowed with as much erotic power, Playboy style, as photographer and model can muster. Clearly, now that there's been a decade or two of settling in, no institution can resist the tidal wave of change resulting from the tremendous combined impact of the gay and women's liberation movements.
More than ever, cross-gender trespassing entertains and fascinates us, as do all types of disguises, playful deceptions, masquerades. Witness the tremendous impact of Jennie Livingston's funky and compassionate documentary about Manhattan's voguers, "Paris Is Burning," a film in which masquerade is elevated into a passion play.
When we take off the masks, what are we left with? It's anybody's guess. In the midst of all these disturbing questions, it may be true that the sense of self is weakened or even shattered, but the consolation prize is that one's satellite ego fragments get to come out and play.
In her book "Female Perversions," Louise J. Kaplan argues that around the time of the Industrial Revolution, the Western world became preoccupied with sexual normality and gender conformity in order to insure the survival of the bourgeois couple. But that was then and this is now. If established social structures are breaking down, tyrannical gender roles can go, too. And vice versa. "Psychological femininity always includes some degree of identification with the femininity of the father (and the father's mother and father)," she writes, "and some degree of identification with the masculinity of the mother (and the mother's father and mother)." This is turning out to be great for style.
WHAT IT MEANS TO WANT TO BE LOOKED AT, TO BE looked at, to look, have changed, even in the most basic forms.
Take voyeurism. It used to mainly be a secret pleasure. And then, of course, take Madonna, the face that launched a thousand mouths, the living-walking-one-woman theory of beauty fetish. She embodies the shift that has turned the old voyeurism-exhibitionism complicity on its head. Madonna isn't saying, "Here, sweetie, take a peek." She's saying, "Let me stick it in your face." Whether or not this is an attractive strategy has become a topic of conversation from supermarket checkouts to chic book-party territories, accompanied by much acrimony.
Beauty is under attack, from both the right and the left. There is much debate as to whether women are enslaved or liberated by their obsession with appearance. At the center of the brouhaha is Naomi Wolf, the neo-feminist author of "The Beauty Myth." Wolf tries to demonstrate that the fashion, beauty, diet and pornography industries are tools of a patriarchal system used to keep women from reaping the benefits of their social and economic advancements.
"The more legal and material hindrances women have broken through," she writes, "the more strictly and heavily and cruelly images of female beauty have come to weigh upon us. . . . We are in the midst of a violent backlash against feminism that uses images of female beauty as a political weapon against women's advancement."
There's been a lot of published comment on the Wolf book and, in a way, it's great to hear that hubbub of women's voices again. But arguments on both sides tend to be skewed and reductive. If given a chance to respond, I'd bet many women, feminists or otherwise, would say: "My life is complicated and my vision of myself is made up as I go along and it sometimes translates into buying a lipstick or a pair of cowboy boots. Why are you making me feel bad? Give me a break!"
Of course, women are financially exploited by the beauty, fashion and diet industries, but not necessarily more than America is generally by its consumerist ethic, except in exact ratio to the extent that women are more exploited to begin with. All of the institutions in Western society that broker a trade between money and hope are questionable, and they all radically modify the ability of women and men to be powerful and free.
And it's true that these days everything is merchandised: in a magazine, a smile on a pretty young face will almost certainly announce the merits of lip gloss. But cosmetic-surgery addiction or compulsive diets or binge shopping are the symptoms of a personal and societal pathology much more extensive than can be resolved by attacking the marketing of lip gloss.
The huge amount of space occupied by beauty, fashion, models, fashion photography, are only part of a bigger phenomenon in the culture. In a way, making money is only an excuse to "fix" the fleeting, to memorialize it and to try to avoid thinking about death. It's easy and banal to mock vulnerable women for their fear of aging and revile the industries that profit from that fear, but isn't everything that's most lofty and exhilarating in our anxious society (art, religious ritual, philosophy) designed to help us live with or modify the inevitability of decay and death?
And, besides, those of us with no particular ax to grind find the marketing useful. It makes us feel invaded, sure, but so does everything else. Why shouldn't the marketing of beauty reflect the style of our era? At any rate, it hardly deserves so much defensive talk, except perhaps as an unfortunate digression from the main problems, which are women's power, women's earnings and women's control of their own bodies.
IN THE END, ATTACKS ON BEAUTY ARE attacks on women.
In a gigantic flurry of titillating tautologies and stimulating sophistries, the blustering academic Camille Paglia, another player in the new debate, makes no secret of her contempt for feminists (along with liberals and other riff-raff) in her book "Sexual Personae." She proposes that beauty is a defense designed to prevent us from noticing how terrifying women are (a parallel, in her view, to the pitiful humanist displacement which causes us to find nature beautiful, thereby preventing us from noticing how horrible and violent and ugly nature truly is).
"Beauty, an ecstasy of the eye, drugs us and allows us to act. . . ." she writes. "Menstruation and childbirth are an affront to beauty and form. . . . Their ugliness has produced the giant displacement of women's historical status as sex object, whose beauty is endlessly discussed and modified. Woman's beauty is a compromise with her dangerous archetypal allure. It gives the eye the comforting illusion of intellectual control over nature."
The interesting problem of female misogyny aside, the characterization of beauty as a dirty trick is a lamentable and silly desecration of one of humankind's most natural paths to an experience of the sublime.
Beauty transforms consciousness. Paradoxically, even though it is said to be only skin deep, beauty enables us to experience the invisible world that lies just beyond the visible. It is said of love that it is like a seizure. Beauty, similarly, grips the beholder for a moment in a mysterious, small but timeless seizure. For a moment, all other priorities disappear. It's a powerful experience that transcends topical political and esthetic arguments. Try arguing when you're looking into the eyes of someone you love. (Why are the eyes of someone you love beautiful? When we've figured that out, women can stop spending money on mascara, trying to be beautiful, trying to be loved. Meanwhile, why shouldn't they?)
Beauty heightens consciousness, it expands it, it situates you nearer the hub of your animal aliveness and spiritual vitality. It consoles, it disturbs, it excites. It arouses desire, envy, weird energy. It makes you want to do something: kiss, flee, cry, compete, talk, die, live.

HEADLINE: FORUM;
Lift the Trade Embargo on Vietnam

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. SCHWARZ and EUGENE A. MATTHEWS; Thomas J. Schwarz is a partner at Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom. Eugene A. Matthews, president of Ashta International, an investment and consulting firm, lives in Hanoi.

 BODY:
If the 16-year-old ban on trade with Hanoi continues, the United States will lose Vietnam all over again. But this time, the defeat will be economic and the winner will be our economic rival, Japan.
In the next decade, Vietnam has the potential to outpace other nations in economic growth. With a population of 70 million, it offers a larger market for American goods than Romania, Czechoslovakia and Hungary combined. Nearly 60 percent of the population is under the age of 21. 
 Despite what is called the "American" war, Americans and American products in Vietnam are looked upon with friendliness and favor -- even in Hanoi. Teen-agers in Hanoi dance to American rock music in cafes owned by the Government; children in Hanoi wear T-shirts imprinted with "United States of America"; their faces light up when they realize an American is in their midst. The tastes of the nearly 42 million consumers under 21 also include such traditional American brands as Juicy Fruit gum and Kodak film.
Asian merchants and manufacturers recognize Vietnam's potential. Aside from the billions of dollars of oil reserves mapped by American companies before the ban and now being exploited by non-American companies, trade in other areas has boomed. Japan is Vietnam's second-leading trading partner, after the Soviet Union. Trade with Japan reached $853 million in 1990, and with Moscow's economic and political difficulties, Japan can be expected to loom much larger in Vietnam's future. JVC, National and Sanyo television sets and tape recorders are being assembled in Vietnam. Toyota, Mitsubishi and Honda have finalized plans to build factories there.
To encourage foreign investment, Vietnam has adopted one of the most liberal foreign investment codes of any developing country. Foreigners can own and manage 100 percent of their enterprises in Vietnam or they can form joint ventures with private companies or individuals there. Generous tax write-offs are available to foreign investors; the Government has eliminated subsidies to state-run businesses, abolished price controls and is openly discussing a stock market.
American opposition to our trade embargo -- both in the business community and among Vietnam veterans -- is widepread. Many blue chip companies, as well as Wall Street investment houses and law firms, have joined the United States-Vietnam Trade Council. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted 12 to 1 in June to support a measure that would lift the trade embargo. The measure's chief sponsor is a Republican.
The Bush Administration has not established relations with Vietnam for many reasons, including Vietnam's presence in Cambodia. Given progress on the issue of Americans missing in action, however, the Administration's resistance to stronger economic ties can only be explained by a determination to keep punishing Vietnam for having humiliated the United States in the war.
Recently, under pressure to stop changing its demands on Vietnam, the Administration outlined its "road map" for what Vietnam must do to improve relations with the United States. But as a guide for American businesses, it is essentially a dead end. It essentially would allow American companies to do nothing more than sign contracts that would not become binding for an indefinite period -- six months after peace in Cambodia. By then, the agreements could well have been rendered meaningless.
The White House is scheduled to decide this month whether to renew the Vietnamese trade embargo. But even if it were lifted tomorrow, most American companies would be at least a year away from making investments.
For our benefit and Vietnam's, the United States should let its free-market values triumph in Vietnam, as they have around the world, and it should allow United States companies to participate in the next great Asian economic success story.
